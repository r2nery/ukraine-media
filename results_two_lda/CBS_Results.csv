2022-11-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-brutality-donetsk/,"Ukraine warns of Russian ""brutality"" in contested eastern region","Kyiv, Ukraine — Russian forces are stepping up their strikes in a fiercely contested region of eastern Ukraine, worsening the already tough conditions for residents and the defending army following Moscow's illegal annexation and declaration of martial law in Donetsk province, Ukrainian authorities said. The attacks have almost completely destroyed the power plants that serve the city of Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the region's Ukrainian governor, said. Shelling killed one civilians and wounded three, he reported late Saturday. ""The destruction is daily, if not hourly,"" Kyrylenko said in a state television interview. Moscow-backed separatists controlled part of Donetsk for nearly eight years before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Protecting the separatists' self-proclaimed republic there was one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's justifications for the invasion, and his troops have spent months trying to capture the entire province. While Russia's ""greatest brutality"" was focused in the Donetsk region, ""constant fighting"" continued elsewhere along the front line that stretches more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Between Saturday and Sunday, Russia's launched four missiles and 19 airstrikes impacting more than 35 villages in seven regions, from Chernihiv and Kharkiv in the northeast to Kherson and Mykolaiv in the south, according to the president's office. Russia has focused on striking energy infrastructure over the last month, causing power shortages and rolling outages across the country. The capital, Kyiv, was scheduled to have hourly blackouts rotating Sunday in various parts of the city of some 3 million and the surrounding region. Rolling blackouts also were planned in the Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava regions, Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said in a Telegram post. More positive news was the re-connection of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to Ukraine's power grid, local media reported Sunday. Europe's largest nuclear plant needs electricity to maintain vital cooling system, but it had been running on emergency diesel generators since Russian shelling severed its outside connections. In the Donetsk city of Bakhmut, some 15,000 remaining residents were living under daily shelling and without water or power, according to local media. The city has been under attack for months, but the bombardment picked up after Russian forces experienced setbacks during Ukrainian counteroffensives in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. In Kharkiv, officials are working to identify bodies found in mass graves after the Russians withdrew, Dmytro Chubenko, a spokesperson for the regional prosecutor's office, said in an interview with local media. DNA samples have been collected from 450 bodies discovered in a mass grave in the city of Izium, but the samples need to be matched with relatives and so far only 80 people have participated, he said.",17,0.0,0.0,0.0,17
2022-11-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-cafe-blaze-kills-at-least-13-people-injures-5/,"Russia cafe blaze kills at least 13 people, injures 5","MOSCOW — A fire in a cafe in the Russian city of Kostroma killed at least 13 people and injured five others on Saturday, local authorities said. The governor of the Kostroma region, Sergei Sitnikov, said 13 people died in the fire and five more were slightly injured. Russian news agency Interfax cited local emergency officials as saying that the death toll stood at 15. The contradicting numbers couldn't be immediately reconciled. The blaze erupted in the early hours after someone apparently used a flare gun, according to the authorities. The Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that a brawl erupted in the cafe shortly before the fire, but it wasn't immediately clear if it had anything to do with the use of a flare gun. Rescuers were able to evacuate 250 people. The roof of the cafe collapsed during the fire, which engulfed an area of 3,500 square meters (more than 37,000 square feet). Firefighters spent five hours battling the blaze, and a dozen residents of a nearby residential buildings were evacuated as a precaution. A criminal investigation has been launched, and the police have arrested a suspect. Ikhtiyar Mirzoyev, a member of the regional legislature and owner of the cafe, promised assistance to those affected by the fire. Kostroma, a riverside city of 270,000, is located roughly 340 kilometers (210 miles) north of Moscow. It wasn't the first time that pyrotechnics caused a deadly fire at a recreational venue in Russia. In 2009, more than 150 people were killed in a blaze at the Lame Horse nightclub in the city of Perm that erupted after someone set off fireworks.",17,2.0865834372533074,3.480789774125949,-1.3942063368726414,9
2022-11-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/power-blackouts-announced-across-ukraine-amid-russian-shelling/,Power blackouts announced across Ukraine amid Russian shelling,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine's state electricity operator on Saturday announced regular scheduled blackouts in Kyiv and seven other regions of the country in the aftermath of Russia's devastating strikes on energy infrastructure. The move comes as Russian forces continue to pound Ukrainian cities and villages with missiles and drones, inflicting damage on power plants, water supplies and other civilian targets, in a grinding war that is nearing its nine-month mark. Russia has denied that the drones it has used in Ukraine came from Iran, but the Islamic Republic's foreign minister on Saturday for the first time acknowledged supplying Moscow with ""a limited number"" of drones before the invasion. Hossein Amirabdollahian claimed, however, that Tehran didn't know if its drones were used against Ukraine and stated Iran's commitment to stopping the conflict. Ukrenergo, the sole operator of Ukraine's high-voltage transmission lines, said in an online statement Saturday that scheduled blackouts will take place in the capital and the greater Kyiv region, as well as several regions around it — Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Poltava and Kharkiv. The outages for ""certain groups of consumers"" will occur daily ""in accordance with a specific schedule drawn up by operators of distribution networks for each region,"" the statement said. The outages are expected to last for six and more hours each day. Ukraine has been grappling with power outages and disruption of water supplies since Russia started unleashing massive barrages of missile and drone strikes on the country's energy infrastructure last month. Moscow has said those came in response to what it alleged were Ukrainian attacks on Crimea, the region that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Ukraine has denied those allegations. Meanwhile, Russian shelling of Ukrainian regions continued into the early hours of Saturday. About 40 shells were fired overnight at the city of Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said on Telegram. The Russian forces targeted the city and the areas around it from heavy artillery. Two fires broke out, and more than a dozen of residential and utility buildings, as well as a gas pipeline, were damaged, the official said. Elsewhere in the region, the Ukrainian forces shot down a drone and another projectile, according to Reznichenko. In the southern Mykolaiv region, the overnight shelling of rural areas damaged several houses, but didn't cause any casualties, Mykolaiv Gov. Vitali Kim said on Telegram. The Russian forces also fired missiles at the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, which has been illegally annexed by Moscow and large parts of which remain occupied. According to regional Gov. Oleksandr Starukh, the attack took place shortly after midnight and damaged buildings of three businesses, as well as a number of cars. In the eastern Donetsk region, also annexed and partially occupied by Russia, eight cities and villages have been shelled, including Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Porkovsk. According to Ukraine's presidential office, at least three civilians were killed and eight others were wounded over the past 24 hours by Russian shelling of nine Ukrainian regions, where drones, missiles and heavy artillery were used. In the Russian-occupied Kherson region, where a Ukrainian counteroffensive is underway, the Russian military continue to abduct local residents, the presidential office said, with the most recent cases taking place over the past 24 hours.",17,2.328161880168914,7.068048658073736,-4.739886777904822,17
2022-11-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-attacks-2021-fincen-report-billion/,Ransomware crimes netted more than $1 billion last year,"Victims of cybercrime shelled out a record $1.2 billion to have their data returned last year as ransomware attacks have grown in size and intensity, according to newly released federal data. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, reported that banks processed a billion-plus dollars last year in what were likely ransomware payments. That's more than double the amount of money from 2020, the report concluded. The top five highest-paid ransomware incidents all came from attackers who were connected to Russia, FinCEN said. The report ""reminds us that ransomware — including attacks perpetrated by Russian-linked actors — remains a serious threat to our national and economic security,"" Himamauli Das, FinCEN's acting director, said in a statement this week. Ransomware is a type of computer hack where an attacker accesses someone's digital device and locks the owner out of their own files. After the lockout, the hacker contacts the owner and demands a payment before restoring access to the files. If there's no payment, the hacker threatens to keep the owner locked out or delete the files completely. FinCEN, which started in 1990, is an arm of the U.S. Department of Treasury charged with tracking international money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. FinCEN said hackers initially focused ransomware attacks on individuals, but have graduated to targeting large companies and demanding bigger payouts. Hackers in 2019 created a variation of ransomware attacks called double extortion, where they lock owners out of their files and then threaten to publish the data — which is often private or potentially embarrassing — if a payment isn't made. Indeed, 2021 had some of the biggest ransomware attacks on record aimed at large companies and nonprofits. A Russian hacking group attacked the Colonial Pipeline, one of the largest pipelines in the U.S., in May 2021. The company paid $4.3 million to retrieve its data, but federal authorities later recovered at least $2.3 million of the paid ransom. Hackers also attacked Planned Parenthood, Sinclair Broadcasting, Shutterfly and payroll processing company Kronos last year. All told, organizations reported 1,489 ransomware attacks to FinCEN in 2021, a 188% increase from 2020, the agency said. More recently, a ransomware attack last May marked the last straw for Lincoln College, a historically Black college in rural central Illinois that opened in 1865. The school gave hackers a $100,000 ransom, a payout that compounded financial troubles caused by plummeting enrollment in recent years. The 157-year-old institution shuttered in May. Ransomware attacks have become more common with the rise in remote work and e-learning, with schools becoming particularly vulnerable. The Biden administration brought together three dozen nations, the European Union and a slew of private-sector companies for a two-day summit this week looking at how best to combat the attacks. President Biden earlier this year signed a new law that requires owners of factories, banks, nuclear reactors and other critical infrastructure operations to report when their computer systems are hit with ransomware. Reporting is currently optional for ransom victims, making it difficult to calculate the full impact of the crime.",3,4.373706214433765,2.8671807307636166,1.5065254836701487,7
2022-11-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-extends-aid-for-ukraines-wartime-technology-innovation/,microsoft,"LISBON, Portugal — Ukraine is counting on more Western technological support as its war against Russia drags on, with Microsoft pledging Thursday to extend its backing for Kyiv's ""extraordinary"" wartime innovation through the end of next year. Microsoft's financial commitment of more than $400 million enables the Ukraine government and other organizations to continue using the Microsoft cloud and its public data centers across Europe, the company's president, Brad Smith, announced at the annual Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal. Cloud technology offers resilience and security for Ukraine operations, Smith said, after Russia targeted Ukrainian data centers with air strikes when it invaded more than eight months ago. The invasion triggered ""extraordinary innovation"" by the Ukrainian military, Smith said. Ukraine and Russia are fighting ""a new type of war,"" with cyberweapons and other types of digital technology playing a pivotal role, he said. Artificial intelligence deployed by Kyiv, for example, is detecting and thwarting Russian cyberattacks ""in the blink of an eye,"" according to Smith. Microsoft is also working with the U.S. Army on AI and image recognition. Ukraine and Russia are engaged in ""a technology war,"" according to Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation. Fedorov, appearing with Smith at a news conference, pointed to the Delta real-time battle management system developed by Ukraine.

2022-11-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/russia-us-ukraine-biological-weapons-lab-claims-un-security-council-vote/,U.N. Security Council rejects Russia's call to probe debunked U.S.-Ukraine biological weapons claims,"United Nations — The U.N.'s 15-nation Security Council voted down on Wednesday a proposal by Russia to create a commission to investigate Moscow's unsubstantiated claims of a joint U.S.-Ukrainian ""military biological"" program. Russia has leveled allegations since March that programs in Ukraine sponsored by the U.S. Defense Department were in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention, an international law regulating weaponized toxins. Moscow has offered no verifiable proof of such work, and the U.S. Defense Department, the White House and Ukraine have consistently refuted the allegations. The U.N.'s disarmament chief, Izumi Nakamitsu, said in March that while the global body did not have the capacity to investigate, the U.N. was not aware of any biological weapons program in Ukraine. As the Security Council voted Wednesday on the resolution brought by Russia, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Washington and Ukraine had been ""through Russia's allegations in Geneva, point by point, and debunked every single one."" She said Russia's claims were ""based on disinformation, dishonesty, bad faith, and a total lack of respect for this body."" ""The United States does not have a biological weapons program. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States,"" insisted Thomas-Greenfield. During a series of U.N. meetings prompted by the Russian allegations, the U.S. has described the non-military biological labs it has supported in Ukraine since the 1990's, including one called the ""Biological Threat Reduction Program"" that was created to disassemble the former Soviet Union's programs, to ""reduce legacy threats from nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons left in the Soviet Union's successor states."" In May, CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay visited the Ukrainian facility at the heart of Russia's disinformation campaign, the Virology Reference Laboratory in Kyiv, and spoke with the chief researcher and scientists whose work there had been dedicated for years to containing dangerous pathogens. The facility has always been regularly inspected by international agencies, including the World Health Organization. Their work changed abruptly, however, when Russian forces invaded Ukraine on February 24 and the shelling began. ""They bombed a building right nearby,"" Dr. Natalia Vidayko, the lab's top scientist, told Livesay. From that day, the Ukrainian government ordered the lab, and others in the country, to destroy all particularly dangerous biological strains they had in storage, Vidayko said. ""They're completely destroyed,"" she repeated to Livesay, who found minimal security — amounting to one tired old guard dog — when he visited the lab in Kyiv. Despite the clear flaws with Russia's claims, Moscow brought its draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council this week — embedded within a 310-page document of claims and complaints — calling for a ""commission consisting of all members of the Security Council to investigate"" the allegations. Only Russia and China voted in favor of the measure, with the other three veto-wielding permanent members of the Council, the U.S., U.K. and France, voting against it. The 10 elected members of the Council abstained, so the measure was defeated. Analysts, Western diplomats and the Pentagon have suggested that Russia's disinformation about the biological labs is really a ""false flag,"" aimed at creating a pretext to blame Ukraine and the U.S. for a possible biological or chemical attack that Russia's own forces could carry out in Ukraine. President Biden warned in March that Russia would pay a ""severe price"" if it did use biological or chemical weapons in Ukraine. Russia's deputy Ambassador to the U.N., Dmitry Polyansky, said his country would take the issue to a U.N. meeting on the biological weapons convention in Geneva, which takes place between November 28 and December 16, claiming the U.S. and Ukraine had ""placed themselves above the law."" After Wednesday's vote, U.K. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia's claims that Ukraine's Western allies had failed to consider Moscow's evidence were ""completely false."" ""Russia's allegations have no credible basis in fact,"" she said. French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere told diplomats at the Council meeting that Russia ""must stop this irresponsible disinformation campaign,"" dismissing Moscow's ""so-called evidence"" and insisting that it ""deserves no further consideration.""",3,4.226845205970328,5.264183446913981,-1.0373382409436536,5
2022-10-31,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/china-space-station-component-mengtian-third-last/,China launches third and last component of its space station,"Beijing — China on Monday launched the third and final module to complete its permanent space station, realizing a more than decade-long endeavor to maintain a constant crewed presence in orbit. Mengtian was blasted into space at 3:39 p.m. local time (3:39 a.m. EDT) Monday from the coastal Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on the southern tropical island province of Hainan. A large crowd of amateur photographers, space enthusiasts and assorted lookers-on watched the lift-off from an adjoining beach. Many waved Chinese flags and wore T-shirts emblazoned with the characters for China, reflecting the deep national pride invested in the space program and the technological progress it represents. Mengtian, or ""Celestial Dream,"" joins Wentian as the second laboratory module for the station, collectively known as Tiangong, or ""Celestial Palace."" Both are connected to the Tianhe core module where the crew lives and works. Like its predecessors, Mengtian was launched aboard a Long March-5B Y4 carrier rocket - a member of China's most powerful family of launch vehicles from Hainan. Mengtian was due to spend 13 hours in flight before reaching Tiangong, which is populated by a crew of two male and one female astronauts, according to the China Manned Space Agency. Chen Dong, Cai Xuzhe and Liu Yang arrived in early June for a six-month stay, during which they will complete the station's assembly, conduct space walks and carry out additional experiments. Following Mengtian's arrival, an additional un-crewed Tianzhou cargo craft is due to dock with the station next month with another crewed mission scheduled for December, at which time crews may overlap — Tiangong has room to accommodate six astronauts. Mengtian weighs about 20 tons and is 58.7 feet long, with a diameter of 13.8 feet. It will provide space for experiments in zero gravity, an airlock for exposure to the vacuum of space, and a small robotic arm to support extravehicular payloads. The already orbiting 23-ton Wentian laboratory is designed for science and biology experiments and is heavier than any other single-module spacecraft currently in space. Next year, China plans to launch the Xuntian space telescope which, while not a part of Tiangong, will orbit in sequence with the station and can dock occasionally with it for maintenance. In all, the station will have about 3,880 cubic feet of pressurized interior space. China's crewed space program is officially three decades old this year. But it truly got underway in 2003, when China became only the third country after the U.S. and Russia to put a human into space using its own resources. The program is run by the ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, and has proceeded methodically and almost entirely without outside support. The U.S. excluded China from the International Space Station because of its military ties. Prior to launching the Tianhe module, China's Manned Space Program launched a pair of single-module stations that it crewed briefly as test platforms. The permanent Chinese station will weigh about 66 tons - a fraction of the size of the ISS - which launched its first module in 1998 and weighs around 465 tons. With a lifespan of 10-15 years, Tiangong could one day find itself as the only space station still running if the ISS adheres to its 30-year operating plan. China has also chalked up success with un-crewed missions, and its lunar exploration program generated media buzz last year when its Yutu 2 rover sent back pictures of what was described by some as a ""mystery hut"" but was most likely only a rock of some sort. The rover is the first to be placed on the little-explored far side of the moon. China's Chang'e 5 probe returned lunar rocks to Earth for the first time since the 1970s in December 2000 and another Chinese rover is searching for evidence of life on Mars. Officials are also considering a crewed mission to the moon. The program has also drawn controversy. In October 2021, China's Foreign Ministry brushed off a report that China had tested a hypersonic missile two months earlier, saying it had merely tested whether a new spacecraft could be reused. China is also reportedly developing a highly secret space plane. China's space program has proceeded cautiously and largely gone off without a hitch. Complaints, however, have been leveled against China for allowing rocket stages to fall to Earth uncontrolled twice before. NASA accused Beijing last year of ""failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris"" after parts of a Chinese rocket landed in the Indian Ocean. China's increasing space capabilities were featured in the latest Pentagon defense strategy released Thursday. ""In addition to expanding its conventional forces, the PLA is rapidly advancing and integrating its space, counterspace, cyber, electronic, and informational warfare capabilities to support its holistic approach to joint warfare,"" the strategy said. The U.S. and China are at odds on a range of issues, especially the self-governing island of Taiwan that Beijing threatens to annex with force. China responded to a September visit to Taiwan by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi by firing missiles over the island, holding wargames and staging a simulated blockade.",3,5.230038230849133,7.362699488091396,-2.1326612572422627,5
2022-10-31,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/russia-ukraine-war-critical-infrastructure-hit-again-several-cities/,"Russia pounds Ukrainian cities with missiles, knocking out water and power","Kyiv — A massive barrage of Russian strikes on Monday morning hit critical infrastructure in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities. Russian missiles knocked out water and power supplies in the attack, which was apparent retaliation for what Moscow claims was a Ukrainian attack on its Black Sea Fleet over the weekend. Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces carried out ""strikes with long-range high-precision air and sea-based weapons against the military command and energy systems of Ukraine."" ""The goals of the strikes were achieved. All designated targets were hit,"" the ministry said in a statement. Ukraine's air force said it shot down 44 of more than 50 cruise missiles that were launched by Russia, but Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said missiles and drones hit 10 Ukrainian regions and damaged 18 objects, most of which were energy facilities. Hundreds of localities in seven Ukrainian regions were left without power, he said in a Facebook post, adding that ""the consequences could have been much worse"" if the Ukrainian forces hadn't shot down most of the Russian missiles. Loud explosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital in the early morning as residents prepared to go to work. Many received text messages from the emergency services about the threat of a missile attack, and air raid sirens wailed for three straight hours. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that 80% of consumers in the city of 3 million people were left without water supplies because of the damage to a power facility. Local authorities were working to restore the supplies as soon as possible, Klitschko said, telling Kyiv residents in the meantime to ""stock up on water from the nearest pump rooms and points of sale."" Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, vowed that the attacks on civilian facilities would not weaken Ukraine's resistance. ""We will persevere, and generations of Russians will pay a high price for their disgrace,"" Yermak said. The attacks came two days after Russia accused Ukraine of a drone attack against Russia's Black Sea Fleet off the coast of the annexed Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine has denied the attack, saying Russia mishandled its own weapons, but Moscow still announced that it was halting its participation in a U.N.-brokered deal to allow safe passage of ships carrying grain from Ukraine. It was the second time this month that Russia unleashed a massive barrage of strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure. On October 10, a similar attack rocked the war-torn country following an explosion on the Kerch Bridge, the sole land link between Ukraine's Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula and the Russian mainland. Moscow blamed Kyiv for blast, but Ukraine never publicly accepted responsibility. Monday's attacks occurred just before Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and many top members of his government, including the foreign, defense and interior ministers, arrived in Kyiv in the latest show of support from European leaders for Ukraine. Prime Minister Shmyhal said that in the Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions, emergency power shutdowns were underway. ""Today, just like in previous weeks, it is important that Ukrainians consume energy mindfully and reduce the load on the grid,"" the official said. Kyiv region Governor Oleksii Kuleba said one person was wounded and a number of houses were damaged in the morning attacks. ""The Kremlin is taking revenge for military failures on peaceful people who are left without electricity and heat before the winter,"" Kuleba said. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, two strikes hit critical infrastructure facilities, according to authorities, and the subway ceased operating. Officials also warned about possible power outages in the city of Zaporizhzhia resulting from the strikes there. The city of Zaporizhzhia still held by Ukrainian forces, but about 20 miles away in the city of Enerhodar sits Europe's biggest nuclear power plant. Fighting around the Russian-occupied plant has fueled concern for months over a possible accident, or even a deliberate attack leading to widespread radiological contamination. The Lviv region in western Ukraine was also targeted on Monday, but the missiles were shot down, Lviv Governor Maksym Kozytskyy said.",17,6.268293594467107,4.649464628585586,1.6188289658815211,17

Thomas Blom of Norway's Security Service said the man's name was Mikhail Mikushin, adding authorities were ""not positively sure of his identity, but we are quite certain that he is not Brazilian."" The man was detained Monday in the Arctic city of Tromsoe, where he worked at the Arctic University of Norway. Norwegian media have said he called himself Jose Assis Giammaria. Norwegian authorities said he was 44, born in Russia in 1978. Mikushin is a senior Russian military intelligence officer, according to a researcher at the investigative website Bellingcat. ""Great job, Norway, you've caught yourself a colonel from the GRU (Russia's military intelligence agency),"" Bellingcat researcher Christo Grozev tweeted. Blom told a press conference that the suspect faces a ""temporary"" charge of spying and that preliminary charge could change as the investigation into the case had just begun. If found guilty of violating Norway's espionage laws, the man faces up to three years in jail. At first he was arrested in view of expelling him. ""There is an imminent danger of tampering with evidence,"" Blom said, explaining why the suspect was detained for four weeks. On Friday, his lawyer in Oslo, Marijana Lozic, told Norwegian news agency NTB that the man denies any wrongdoing. ""Our view is that, just gaining access to some of these research environments, which are premise providers for the authorities, for policy formulation, is of significant national importance,"" Blom said of the suspect. The university rector told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that to his knowledge no data has been stolen or information had been taken ""that could damage our research."" However, ""it could undermine the legitimacy of our professional environment,"" said Dag Rune Olsen. The suspect arrived in Norway in 2021, and has researched the northern regions and hybrid threats, Norwegian media said. Norway's Arctic border with Russia is 123 miles long. In Canada, where the man also studied, he identified himself as Jose Assis Giammaria, according to Canadian Press. The news agency said the University of Calgary had reported that the man also attended the Alberta school and graduated in the fall of 2018 with a master of strategic studies. Canadian Press also said a 2015 convocation program from Ottawa's Carleton University shows Giammaria had graduated with a honors bachelor of arts in political science with a concentration in international relations. In addition to the suspected spy, Norway has in recent weeks arrested nine Russian nationals. They are accused of flying drones in its airspace in violation of a ban introduced since the war in Ukraine, or having photographed sensitive sites in restricted areas. Russian fishing trawlers, still allowed to dock in some Norwegian ports despite an EU ban, and research vessels have also drawn suspicion in Norway. Norway, which has overtaken Russia as Europe's biggest supplier of natural gas since the war in Ukraine, has beefed up security at strategic sites. That step was taken after mysterious drones were observed near some oil and gas installations following the suspected sabotage of Nord Stream's two Baltic Sea pipelines.

The annual exercise has been described by U.S. officials as ""routine"" around this time of year but nevertheless will take place against heightened Russian rhetoric about using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The Russian ""Grom,"" or Thunder nuclear exercise, typically involves large-scale maneuvers of strategic nuclear forces, including live missile launches, a senior military official said earlier this month. Officials have expected the annual exercise for several weeks but only recently received notification from Russia. According to AFP, state television showed Russian President Vladimir Putin overseeing the drills from a control room. ""Russia is complying with its arms control obligations and its transparency commitments to make those notifications,"" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters Tuesday, after confirming the U.S. has been notified of the annual exercise. The Russian exercise coincides with the long-planned NATO nuclear exercise ""Steadfast Noon."" This year's NATO exercise, hosted by Belgium, takes place from Oct. 17 to Oct. 30 and involves 14 countries. U.S. B-52 long-range bombers will participate, flying from Minot Air Base in North Dakota. The exercise also includes fourth and fifth generation fighter jets, but no live weapons will be used. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters earlier this month that the NATO exercise is meant to ensure NATO's nuclear deterrence capabilities ""remain safe, secure and effective."" Stoltenberg said NATO will ""monitor"" the Russian exercise and ""will remain vigilant not least in light of the veiled nuclear threats and the dangerous nuclear rhetoric we have seen from the Russian side.""

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made the claims in a series of calls with U.S., British, French and Turkish defense officials. ""We reject reports of Minister Shoigu's transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,"" said U.S. National Security Coucil spokesperson Adrienne Watson. A ""dirty bomb"" uses conventional explosives to spew radiological materials into the air and contaminate the surrounding area. The size of the area contaminated would depend on the size of the explosion.Russian authorities repeatedly have made allegations that Ukraine could detonate a dirty bomb in a false flag attack and blame it on Moscow. Ukrainian authorities, in turn, have accused the Kremlin of hatching such a plan. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace strongly rejected Shoigu's claim and warned Moscow against using it as a pretext for escalation. The British Ministry of Defense noted that Shoigu, in a call with Wallace, ""alleged that Ukraine was planning actions facilitated by Western countries, including the U.K., to escalate the conflict in Ukraine."" ""The Defense Secretary refuted these claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation,"" the ministry said. In a televised address Sunday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that Moscow itself was setting the stage for deploying a radioactive device on Ukrainian soil. ""If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means only one thing: that Russia has already prepared all of it,"" Zelenskyy said. The mention of the dirty bomb threat in Shoigu's calls seemed to indicate the threat of such an attack has risen to an unprecedented level. The French Ministry of the Armed Forces said Shoigu told his counterpart, Sebastien Lecornu, that the situation in Ukraine was rapidly worsening and ""trending towards uncontrollable escalation."" ""It appears that there is a shared feeling that the tensions have approached the level that could raise the real threat for all,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, the Kremlin-connected head of the Council for Foreign and Defense policies, a Moscow-based group of top foreign affairs experts. The rising tensions come as Russian authorities reported building defensive positions in occupied areas of Ukraine and border regions of Russia, reflecting fears that Ukrainian forces may attack along new sections of the 620-mile front line of the war, which enters its ninth month on Monday. In recent weeks, Ukraine has focused its counteroffensive mostly on the Kherson region. Their relentless artillery strikes cut the main crossings across the Dnieper River, which bisects the southern region, leaving Russian troops on the west bank short of supplies and vulnerable to encirclement. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-installed regional administration in Kherson, said Sunday in a radio interview that Russian defensive lines ""have been reinforced and the situation has remained stable"" since local officials strongly encouraged all residents of the region's capital and nearby areas Saturday to evacuate by ferry to the river's east bank. The region is one of four that Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month and put under Russian martial law on Thursday. Kherson city has been in Russian hands since the early days of the war, but Ukraine's forces have made advances toward reclaiming it. About 20,000 Kherson residents have moved to places on the east bank of the Dnieper River, the Kremlin-backed regional administration reported. The Ukrainian military said Sunday that Russia's military also withdrew its officers from areas on the west bank, leaving newly mobilized, inexperienced forces. The Ukrainian claim could not be independently verified. As Ukraine presses south after liberating the Kharkiv region in the north last month, authorities in the western Russian provinces bordering northeastern Ukraine appeared jittery. The governor of Russia's Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said Sunday that two defensive lines have been built and a third one would be finished by Nov. 5. Defensive lines were also established in the Belgorod region, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. More defensive positions were being built in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, said Yevgeny Prigozhin, a millionaire Russian businessman who owns the Wagner Group, a mercenary military company that has played a prominent role in the war. Prigozhin said his company was constructing a ""Wagner line"" in the Luhansk region, another of the Ukrainian provinces Putin illegally annexed last month. Prigozhin posted images last week showing a section of newly built defenses and trench systems southeast of the town of Kreminna. The British Defense Ministry said Sunday ""the project suggests Russia is making a significant effort to prepare defenses in depth behind the current front line, likely to deter any rapid Ukrainian counteroffensives."" Russia's forces captured Luhansk several months ago. Pro-Moscow separatists declared independent republics in the region and neighboring Donetsk eight years ago, and Putin made controlling all of both provinces a goal at the war's outset. The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington, said Sunday that Russia's latest strategy of targeting power plants appeared aimed at diminishing Ukrainians' will to fight and forcing the government in Kyiv to devote more resources to protecting civilians and energy infrastructure. It said the effort was unlikely to damage Ukrainian morale but would have significant economic impacts. President Zelenskyy said Sunday that utilities workers were well on their way to restoring electricity supplies cut off by large-scale Russian missile strikes Saturday, but acknowledged that it would take longer to provide heating. Nine regions across Ukraine, from Odesa in the southwest to Kharkiv in the northeast, saw more attacks targeting energy and other critical infrastructure over the past day, the Ukrainian army's general staff said. It reported a total of 25 Russian airstrikes and more than 100 missile and artillery strikes around Ukraine. In response, Zelenskyy appealed to mayors and other local leaders to ensure that Ukrainians heed official calls to conserve energy. ""Now is definitely not the time for bright storefronts and signs,"" he said.",14,4.135371165500644,5.223560476222855,-1.0881893107222105,17

In a Telegram post, the regional pro-Kremlin administration called on civilians to use boat crossings over the Dnieper River to move deeper into Russian-held territory, citing a tense situation on the front and the threat of shelling and alleged ""terror attacks"" by Kyiv. Kherson has been in Russian hands since the early days of the invasion in February. The city is the capital of a region of the same name, one of four Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month. The region's Kremlin-backed authorities previously announced plans to evacuate all Russian-appointed officials and as many as 60,000 civilians across the river, in what local leader Volodymyr Saldo said would be an ""organized, gradual displacement."" Ukrainian officials have urged local residents to resist attempts to relocate them, with one local official alleging that Moscow wanted to take civilians hostage and use them as human shields. Putin signed a decree Wednesday imposing martial law on Kherson and three other regions in southern and eastern Ukraine he declared as Russian territory in defiance of international law. Elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up on Saturday to power outages and periodic bursts of gunfire, as Ukrainian air defense tried to shoot down drones and incoming missiles.

Ukrainian officials confirmed at least half a dozen regions were targeted, including the capital city, Kyiv. The air force said it downed 18 out of 33 cruise missiles launched from air and sea. ""Several rockets"" targeting the capital were shot down on Saturday morning, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging service. Similar reports were made by the governors of six western and central provinces, as well as the southern Odesa region on the Black Sea. The attack is part of Russia's latest strategy. Over the past two weeks, Moscow has increased its attacks on key civilian infrastructure across Ukraine, as the country braces for a cold winter. About 40% of the country's electric power system has been severely damaged, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier in the week that 30% of Ukraine's power stations have been destroyed since Oct. 10. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up to power outages. The western city of Khmelnytskyi, which straddles the Bug river and was home to some 275,000 people before the war, was left with no electricity Saturday, shortly after local media reported several loud explosions. The city council urged local residents to store water, ""in case it's also gone within an hour,"" in a social media post on Saturday. The mayor of Lutsk, a city of 215,000 in Ukraine's far west, made a similar appeal on Telegram on Saturday. Power in Lutsk had been partially knocked out after Russian missiles slammed into local energy facilities, he said. The central city of Uman, a key pilgrimage center for Hasidic Jews which counted some 100,000 residents before the war, was also plunged into darkness after a rocket hit a nearby power station, regional authorities said on Telegram. In the capital and four surrounding regions, including Cherkasy, rolling blackouts came into effect on Saturday morning in response to the reduced power supplies. The state energy company Ukrenergo continued to urge all Ukrainians to conserve energy.

2022-10-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukrainian-forces-bombard-russian-held-kherson-region/,Ukrainian forces bombard Russian positions in Kherson region,"Ukrainian forces bombarded Russian positions in the occupied and illegally annexed southern Kherson region, targeting resupply routes across a major river while inching closer Friday to a full assault on one of the first urban areas Russia captured after invading the country. Russian-installed officials were reported desperately trying to turn the city of Kherson, a prime objective for both sides because of its key industries and major river and sea port, into a fortress while attempting to evacuate tens of thousands of residents. The Kremlin poured as many as 2,000 draftees into the Kherson region — one of four provinces Moscow illegally annexed and put under Russian martial law — to replenish losses and strengthen front-line units, according to the Ukrainian army's general staff. The Dnieper River figures prominently in the regional battle because it serves critical functions — crossings for supplies, troops and civilians; drinking water for southern Ukraine and the annexed Crimean Peninsula; and power generation from a hydroelectric station. Much of the area, including the power station and a canal feeding water to Crimea, is under Russian control. Kremlin-installed Kherson officials said Ukrainian shelling of a Dnieper River ferry crossing killed two journalists working for a local TV station they set up under occupation. At least two other people were reported killed and 13 wounded. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine's southern operational command, confirmed the Ukrainian military struck the Antonivskyi Bridge but only during an overnight curfew Russian-installed officials put in place to avoid civilian casualties. ""We do not attack civilians and settlements,"" Humeniuk told Ukrainian television. Earlier Ukrainian strikes had made the Antonivskyi Bridge inoperable, prompting Russian authorities to set up ferry crossings and pontoon bridges to relocate civilians and transport supplies to Russian troops in Kherson, which sits on the Dnieper's western bank. Russian-installed officials are trying to evacuate up to 60,000 people from Kherson for their safety and to allow the military to build fortifications. Ukraine's military reported Friday that bank employees, medical workers and teachers were relocating as the city's infrastructure wound down. ""The situation is really difficult,"" the deputy head of Kherson's Kremlin-installed regional administration, Kirill Stremousov, said in a video he posted on Telegram. ""Today we are preparing the city of Kherson as a fortress for defense and are ready to defend to the last. Our task is to save people, build defenses and protect the city."" Kherson city, with a prewar population of about 284,000, was one of the first urban areas Russia captured when it invaded Ukraine, and it remains the largest city it holds. Another flashpoint on the Dnieper River is the Kakhovka dam, which creates a large reservoir, and associated hydroelectric power station, about 70 kms (44 miles) from Kherson city. Each side accuses the other of targeting the facilities. Russian-installed officials claim Ukrainian forces have been attacking the facilities in part to cut the water supply to Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy contends the Russians plan to blow up the dam and power station to unleash 4.8 billion gallons of water and flood Kherson and dozens of other areas where hundreds of thousands of people live. He told the European Council on Thursday that Russia would then blame Ukraine. None of the claims could be independently verified. Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed Ukraine's Kherson, Luhansk, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions last month even though his forces don't control all the territory. Putin declared martial law in the regions as of Thursday to assert Russian authority in the face of military setbacks and strong international criticism. In the Donetsk region, two people were killed in Russian shelling of the city of Bakhmut, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, the province's Ukrainian governor. Russian troops have been unable to advance toward the city for more than a month. In the capital of the eastern Ukraine's recently reclaimed Kharkiv region, nine people were wounded in two Russian attacks, according to Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. In the city of Zaporizhzhia, a Russian S-300 missile strike Friday wounded three people and damaged a residential building, a school and infrastructure, Ukrainian authorities said. ""Each strike won't scare anyone. It will make us stronger,"" said Dniprovskyi District acting administrative chief Volodymyr Hrianysty. In an apparent effort to keep hostilities from spinning out of control, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin reached out to Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Friday for their first phone call since May 13. Defense officials have said that for some time, the Russians had not responded to U.S. efforts to set up calls. Russia's deployment of aircraft and troops to air bases in Belarus raised the specter of another front on Ukraine's northern border, although Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Friday: ""We're not going anywhere today ... If you do not want to fight with us, then we will not, there will be no war."" The Ukrainian army's general staff has reported a heightened chance that Belarus could attack to cut supply routes of Western weapons and equipment. The build-up could also aim to divert Ukraine's resources and weaken its counteroffensive in the south. While prospects for peace appear slim, the Kremlin insisted Friday that Putin has been open to negotiations ""from the very beginning"" and ""nothing has changed."" Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Putin ""tried to initiate talks with both NATO and the United States even before the special military operation"" — the Russian term for its war in Ukraine. Peskov was responding to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said earlier Friday that the Russian leader appeared to be ""much softer and more open to negotiations.""",14,1.2084307259481712,3.812061791442741,-2.60363106549457,17

The light infantry unit, nicknamed the ""Screaming Eagles,"" is trained to deploy on any battlefield in the world within hours, ready to fight. CBS News joined the division's Deputy Commander, Brigadier General John Lubas, and Colonel Edwin Matthaidess, Commander of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, on a Black Hawk helicopter for the hour-long ride to the very edge of NATO territory — only around three miles from Romania's border with Ukraine. From the moment Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, his forces have advanced northward from the Crimean Peninsula, a Ukrainian region that Moscow illegally seized control of in 2014. For more than seven months, Russian troops have tried to push along the Black Sea coast into the Kherson region, aiming to capture the key Ukrainian port cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa. Their goal is to cut off all Ukrainian access to the sea, leaving the country and its military forces landlocked. That threat, so close to NATO territory in Romania, is why one of America's most elite air assault divisions has been sent in, with some heavy equipment. ""We're ready to defend every inch of NATO soil,"" Lubas told CBS News. ""We bring a unique capability, from our air assault capability… We're a light infantry force, but again, we bring that mobility with us, for our aircraft and air assaults."" Skirting northward along Romania's Black Sea coast, the Black Hawk eventually touched down at a forward operating site where U.S. and Romanian troops were pounding targets during a joint ground and air assault exercise. The tank rounds and artillery fire were real. The drill was meant to recreate the battles Ukraine's forces are fighting every day against Russian troops, just across the border. The war games so close to that border are a clear message to Russia and to America's NATO allies, that the U.S. Army is here. ""The real meaning for me, to have the American troops here, is like if you were to have allies in Normandy before any enemy was there,"" Romanian Major General Lulian Berdila told CBS News, referring to the landmark World War II battle on France's north coast. The American forces have been establishing a garrison at the Romanian military's air base. In all, about 4,700 soldiers from the 101st Airborne's home base in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, have been deployed to reinforce NATO's eastern flank. Matthaidess told CBS News that he and his troops were the closest American forces to the fighting in Ukraine. From their vantage point, they've been ""closely watching"" the Russian forces, ""building objectives to practice against"" and conducting drills that ""replicate exactly what's going on"" in the war. ""It keeps us on our toes,"" he said. The ""Screaming Eagles"" commanders told CBS News repeatedly that they are always ""ready to fight tonight,"" and while they're there to defend NATO territory, if the fighting escalates or there's any attack on NATO, they're fully prepared to cross the border into Ukraine.",14,5.2462212455493695,5.242521763707166,0.003699481842203589,8

Moscow insists it is only targeting power installations, and it has indeed hammered Ukraine's energy and water supplies, including a power plant in Kyiv that was hit Tuesday. With power cuts already spreading as Ukraine's harsh winter approaches — and with civilians being killed daily by the ongoing barrage of ""suicide drones"" that Russia is launching along with its missiles — Kyiv's mayor and Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy have labeled Russia a ""terrorist state."" A swarm of the Iranian-made, explosives-packed drones slammed into buildings in Kyiv on Monday killing four people, including Viktoria Zamchenko, who was reportedly six months pregnant with her first child. Ukraine claims Russia has ordered nearly 2,500 suicide drones from Iran, reportedly at a cost of around $20,000 each, a fraction of the price of a guided missile. Iran has denied that it is providing Russia with weapons for the war, but the Reuters news agency reported Tuesday, citing unnamed Iranian sources, that Tehran had actually agreed to provide Russia with even more weapons in a new deal arranged during an early-October visit by Iranian security officials to Moscow. The deal, which CBS News could not independently verify, apparently saw Iran promise not only drones, but surface-to-surface missiles. Ukraine's foreign minister said Tuesday that he was submitting a proposal to Zelenskyy to sever the country's diplomatic ties with Tehran completely over its provision of drones to Russia. Last week, a top British intelligence official said the Russian military's ""supplies and munitions are running out."" ""The world must stop this terror,"" Zelenskyy said Monday night, renewing his months-long plea for Western nations to provide Ukraine with more, and more advanced, air defense systems. Many of Ukraine's cities, including Kyiv, had been relatively calm for months. But since General Sergei Surovikin, or ""General Armageddon"" as he's also known, took over as commander of Putin's struggling war effort, Moscow has increasingly relied on the small, relatively cheap suicide drones, and they could have a significant impact on the course of the war. Russia's goal, according to Ukrainian officials, appears to be to destroy enough infrastructure and civilian lives that support for the war wanes inside Ukraine, and among its international partners. While there's been no indication that the Russian tactic is working to that end, Ukrainian officials have started warning people to brace for a difficult winter. ""The situation is critical now across the country,"" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of President Zelenksyy's office said on television. ""The whole country needs to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages."" Zelenskyy said in a tweet that ""30% of Ukraine's power stations"" had been destroyed over the last week alone, leading to ""massive blackouts across the country."" The power cuts were already hitting parts of the capital, the Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv, and Dnipro in the south. ""The terrorist state will not change anything for itself with such actions,"" Zelenksyy said in another message posted to the Telegram messaging app. ""It will only confirm its destructive and murderous essence, for which it will certainly be held to account."" In the meantime, Ukrainian civilians continue to pay the price. ""They [Russians] probably get pleasure from this,"" the owner of a flower shop in the southern city of Mykolaiv told the Reuters news agency after a Russian missile slammed into a nearby apartment building, killing one person and damaging his store. ""They get pleasure from us feeling bad. I think they want us to bomb and shell [their] city buildings. But we won't do that, to be different from them.""",17,4.09134143702468,1.534724094616485,2.5566173424081953,16

The assaults reportedly killed at least eight people and came after a week of massive, coordinated Russian air strikes across the country. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in Ukraine, but as CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reported, one of the neighborhoods hit in Kyiv on Monday is packed with apartment buildings, schools and restaurants. Apartment blocks and a non-residential building were set alight in the capital's central Shevchenko district, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska tweeted photos of the damage in the capital and said three people were killed when a drone hit the apartment building, including a pregnant woman. ""Civilians, children, pregnant women — the ones RF [Russian Federation] is actually fighting with,"" said Zelenska, vowing that ""Ukrainians will never forget who murdered our relatives."" Emergency services later said a total of four people were killed in the strike on the building in the capital, and four others in drone strikes on the Sumy region. News photographers caught images of some of the drones as they flew into Kyiv, with triangle-shaped wings and a pointed warhead clearly visible against the blue sky. Drones came in several waves and buzzed overhead with angry hums from their engines. Videos posted to social media, including one seemingly taken by the body-camera worn by a member of Ukraine's national police force, showed security forces taking aim at the small aircraft from the ground with rifles. Russian strikes over the past week have hit apartment buildings and other civilian infrastructure, but also targeted infrastructure, including power facilities. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said the strikes on Monday hit critical energy infrastructure in three regions, knocking out electricity to hundreds of towns and villages. ""Russian terrorists once again attacked the energy infrastructure of Ukraine in three regions,"" Shmygal said, noting five strikes in Kyiv, in addition to attacks in the Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions. ""Hundreds of settlements were cut off as a result of the attack,"" he said. Explosions were heard from the same central Kyiv district where a missile strike a week ago tore a hole in a children's playground. Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, wrote in a post on the Telegram social media site that Russian forces struck Kyiv with Iranian Shahed drones. Russia has repeatedly been using the self-detonating drones in recent weeks to target urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations. ""The Russians think it will help them, but it shows their desperation,"" he said, according to AFP. ""All night and all morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday. ""Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine. The enemy can attack our cities but it won't be able to break us."" Strikes in central Kyiv became a rarity in the last several months after Russian forces failed to capture the capital in the beginning of the war. Last week's early morning strikes were the first explosions heard in Kyiv's city center in several months and put Kyiv as well as the rest of the country back on edge as the war nears the nine month mark. Monday's blasts seemed to continue what many fear could become more common occurrences in urban centers. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week's strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Putin blames Ukraine for masterminding the blast, which suspended traffic over the bridge and curtailed Moscow's ability to use the bridge to supply Russian troops in the occupied regions of southern Ukraine. The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Zelenskyy said in his evening address Sunday that there was heavy fighting around the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region. The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the bulk of the industrial east known as the Donbas, and were two of four regions annexed by Russia in September in defiance of international law.

""Another large-scale exchange of prisoners of war was carried out today... we freed 108 women from captivity. It was the first all-female exchange,"" Andriy Yermak, chief of staff for the Ukraine president's office, said on social media. In his daily address late on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ""96 (of the swapped prisoners) are servicewomen, including 37 evacuees from Azovstal, and 12 are civilians."" Zelenskyy thanked ""all involved for this success... the more Russian prisoners we have, the sooner we will be able to free our heroes."" The head of the breakaway region of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Denis Pushilin, confirmed the exchange, saying that out of 110 people agreed in the swap, two people had decided to remain in Russia. The Russian defense ministry said 72 people returned from Ukraine were crew of civilian ships held by Ukraine since February. It said all those returned would be flown to Moscow and provided with medical and psychological assistance. Yermak said on the Ukraine side that some of the people exchanged were mothers and daughters who had been held together. Thirty-seven, he said, had surrendered at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol. Images released by Yermak showed dozens of women — some wearing coats and military fatigues — disembarking from white buses. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov in southeastern Ukraine, withstood weeks of relentless Russian bombardment, with resistance concentrated in a dense network of underground tunnels at its Azovstal steel plant.",17,3.55989812378056,2.310397545045169,1.249500578735391,17
2022-10-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/russia-plane-crash-su-34-yeysk-higher-death-toll/,Death toll jumps to 15 in crash of Russian warplane in residential area that ignited massive blaze,"A Russian warplane crashed Monday into a residential area in a Russian city on the Sea of Azov after suffering engine failure, leaving at least 15 people dead, three of whom jumped from upper floors of a nine-story apartment building to escape a massive blaze. A Su-34 bomber came down in the port city of Yeysk after one of its engines caught fire during takeoff for a training mission, the Russian Defense Ministry said. It said both crew members bailed out safely, but the plane crashed into a residential area, causing a fire as tons of fuel exploded on impact. After hours of combing through the charred debris, authorities said 14 people, including three children, were found dead. Another 19 were hospitalized with injuries, and one of them died of severe burns at a local hospital, bringing the death toll to 15 on Tuesday, said Anna Minkova, a vice governor of the region. Officials on Monday had put the death toll at four. Minkova said three of the four victims died when they jumped from the upper floors of the building in a desperate attempt to escape the flames, according to the RIA-Novosti news agency. Over 500 residents were evacuated and provided with temporary accommodations. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin was informed about the crash and dispatched the ministers of health and emergencies along with the local governor to the site. Yeysk, a city of 90,000, is home to a big Russian air base. Several hours after the crash, regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said that emergency services managed to contain the fire, making the evacuation of residents in adjacent buildings unnecessary. Surveillance cam videos posted on Russian messaging app channels showed a plane exploding in a giant fireball. Other videos showed an apartment building engulfed by flames and loud bangs from the apparent detonation of the warplane's weapons. Oksana, a local resident who declined to give her last name, told Agence France-Presse the area was cordoned off. ""There could be an explosion. Everything is burning inside. There is smoke,"" she told AFP. She said she was stuck in traffic when she heard the news. ""I'm in shock, obviously. My child was alone at home. We already used to go to sleep with fear every day — Mariupol is just across from us,"" she said. The Su-34 is a supersonic twin-engine bomber equipped with sophisticated sensors and weapons that has been a key strike component of the Russian air force. The aircraft has seen wide use during the war in Syria and the fighting in Ukraine. Monday's accident marked the 10th reported non-combat crash of a Russian warplane since Moscow sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Military experts have noted that as the number of Russian military flights increased sharply during the fighting, so did the crashes.",17,4.00442891664156,3.0192206720559853,0.9852082445855745,23

(CNN) -- Two gunmen opened fire on Russian military recruits at a training ground in Russia's Belgorod region, killing at least 11 people and wounding another 15, Russia's state news agency TASS reports. The attack took place Saturday during a training session at the Western Military District, according to TASS, which cited the Russian Defense Ministry. The gunmen were said to be from former Soviet states. Russian officials have branded the attack an act of terrorism. ""As a result of a terrorist attack at a military training ground in the Belgorod region, 11 people were killed, 15 were injured and are receiving medical assistance,"" TASS reported. ""The incident occurred during a shooting training session with volunteers preparing for a special operation. The terrorists attacked the personnel of the unit with small-arms fire.""

The Russian Investigative Committee has launched a criminal investigation into the incident, according to a statement published on Sunday. ""The Main Military Investigation Department of the Investigative Committee of Russia initiated a criminal case on the fact of criminal acts in the Belgorod region,"" the statement said. The Belgorod region is in western Russia on the border with Ukraine. The Governor of Belgorod city said later that no civilians had been killed in the attack.

It said that the two men from an unnamed ex-Soviet nation fired on soldiers during target practice and were killed by return fire. The ministry called the incident a terrorist attack. The shooting comes amid a hasty mobilization ordered by President Vladimir Putin to beef up Russian forces in Ukraine — a move that triggered protests and caused hundreds of thousands to flee Russia. Putin said on Friday that over 220,000 reservists already had been called up as part of an effort to recruit 300,000. Even though the Russian leader declared that only people who had recently served in the military will be subject to the call-up, activists and rights groups reported military conscription offices rounding up people without any army experience — some of whom were also unfit for service for medical reasons. Some of the freshly called-up reservists posted videos of them being forced to sleep on the floor or even outside and given rusty weapons before being sent to the front lines.

2022-10-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-missile-iranian-drone-strikes-kyiv-zaporizhzhia-putin/,"With munitions ""running out,"" Russia hurls Iranian drones and anti-aircraft missiles at Ukraine's cities","Russia launched new attacks around Ukraine's capital and other regions overnight, including sending Iranian-made self-detonating drones packed with explosives hurtling into towns around Kyiv. The drone attack set off air raid sirens and sent people running for shelters yet again in the capital, in a fourth day of reprisals by Moscow for a bombing that damaged a bridge providing the only land link between Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. Vladimir Putin's escalating war on Ukraine is now led by a hard-line commander whose reputation for brutality earned him the nickname ""General Armageddon."" For days it has been clear that the strategy is to increase the aerial assault not only on the front lines, where Russia has lost ground in recent weeks, but across Ukraine. It wasn't immediately clear if the self-detonating drones had killed or wounded anyone, but Ukrainian officials said Thursday that 13 people were killed and almost 40 others wounded over the preceding 24 hours of Russian missile strikes all around Ukraine. The southern city of Mykolaiv was struck again early Thursday, with Russian missiles destroying a five-story apartment building. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said an 11-year-old boy was rescued from the debris six hours after the strike, but seven others remained missing. Kim said Russia hit the building with an S-300 missile — a weapon designed, and usually used to bring down enemy aircraft. Russia has seemingly turned to the S-300s more often to carry out indiscriminate attacks on Ukrainian cities, amid intelligence reports that Putin's army is running low on weaponry, and on morale. ""We know, and Russian commanders on the ground know, that their supplies and munitions are running out,"" Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of Britain's cyber intelligence agency GCHQ said in a speech on Tuesday. The city of Zaporizhzhia — in Ukrainian-held territory but not far from the sprawling, Russian-occupied nuclear power plant that has been the focus of rising concern over a possible nuclear accident — was also hit again on Thursday. The city, about 20 miles from the nuclear plant, has been the target of relentless Russian bombardment. Some of the missiles have slammed down in residential areas, and CBS News saw rescuers pulling one victim from beneath the rubble of an apartment building. Over the past two weeks, more than 70 civilians have been killed by Russia's aerial assault in Zaporizhzhia alone, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine's military claims it has managed to shoot down dozens of the missiles and Iranian-made ""Shahed-136"" drones Russia has fired over the past week, but with so many still getting through to wreak havoc on the country's infrastructure and beleaguered civilians, it is desperate for more help. To stop the aerial assault, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy begged this week for the U.S. and other partners to send Ukraine more, and more advanced, missile defense systems. He was assured that help is on the way.",17,4.324960356128775,7.940487826426704,-3.6155274702979288,17
2022-10-12,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/dennis-tito-spacex-starship-moon-space-tourist/,"Dennis Tito, world's first space tourist, plans flight around the moon aboard SpaceX Starship","Dennis Tito, an 82-year-old aerospace engineer-turned-financial analyst who paid Russia $20 million for a trip to the International Space Station in 2001, is working with SpaceX on plans to take his wife on what amounts to a belated honeymoon voyage to the moon. In an interview with ""CBS Mornings,"" Tito said he and his wife of two years want to fly on Elon Musk's futuristic Starship for the sheer adventure of it. They also want to inspire senior citizens who might think their horizons are increasingly limited. And they want to play a part in humanity's initial steps out into the solar system. ""I've been thinking about flying to the moon for the last 20 years, since my space flight,"" Tito said. ""And here we were at SpaceX (recently) and they were interested in talking about a space flight. And I brought it up. And within a few minutes, we both were on board."" In an interview Monday at SpaceX's sprawling Starship development complex near Brownsville, Texas, Tito and his wife Akiko, 57, said they hope to blast off with 10 other yet-to-be-named passengers, booked by SpaceX, within the next five years or so — after the rocket completes a series of test flights. ""We will be able to watch the Earth get smaller, and smaller and smaller, and the moon get larger, and larger and larger,"" Tito said, describing the planned trajectory. ""We will then, upon emerging from the far side of the moon, see the Earth"" from a perspective only the Apollo astronauts have enjoyed to date. ""We will be literally out of this world,"" he said. As it now stands, their voyage presumably would follow two other piloted flights of the Super Heavy/Starship rocket: one to Earth orbit, possibly with billionaire Jared Isaacman, who funded the first private orbital flight aboard a Crew Dragon capsule in 2021; and an around-the-moon flight chartered by Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa. It's not known when those missions might get off the ground or how much they might cost. Likewise, Tito would not discuss how much he'll be paying for two seats aboard the Starship. Whatever the amount, it's obviously worth it to a man who described his space station visit two decades ago as ""100 percent enjoyment,"" adding ""I've been thinking about it every day since."" ""One of the things I hope to do, we both hope to do, is inspire people that as we get older, there are so many things we still can do,"" Tito said. ""And flying in space actually is a lot easier than a lot of other things. I mean, I'm beyond the age of skiing, but space is a lot easier than that."" Said Akiko Tito, a real estate investor and jet pilot: ""Like Dennis said, I think age is just a number. We just want to inspire people and especially me, inspire women, you know, young women (who) want to become a pilot in the future, want to become astronaut. You know, work hard and make it happen."" ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner, then 90, set the age record last year when he flew to the edge of space aboard a sub-orbital New Shepard spacecraft from Blue Origin. The oldest person to reach orbit was the late John Glenn, who was 77 when he flew aboard a space shuttle in 1998. Tito could be nearing 90 himself when he finally gets his Starship flight, but he told ""CBS Mornings"" correspondent Janet Shamlian he's in better shape now than when he launched aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to become the first so-called space tourist. ""I am probably in better physical shape than I was 21 years ago,"" he said, ""because I've taken up weightlifting in a serious way. And I wasn't able then to manage the kind of weight I can manage now. So I think I'm in better shape."" But realizing it could be several years before he blasts off aboard the as-yet-untried Starship, he says they're ""upping our physical fitness activities and health monitoring to really make sure that we're going to be in shape for many years into the future."" The regimen includes weight training along with walking and running on a quarter-mile track outside his house. The couple also has a Pilates studio. ""We're not counting on (launching) next year,"" Tito said. ""So we have to stay in good shape, which is a great motivational thing for us because a lot of people when they reach my age, you know, will sit in a rocking chair and wait for the inevitable."" Akiko Tito said she started working out on a daily basis 20 years ago and now trains for beauty and fitness competitions that focus on ""total physical fitness. And then you have to be elegant as well at the same time."" She said she had no hesitation about joining her husband for a flight to the moon. ""We want to make it happen together, as a couple,"" she said. Born in Tokyo, Akiko Tito holds a degree in economics and moved to New York in 1995 to work on Wall Street while raising a daughter. She and Tito were married in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""So we didn't have a chance really to have a honeymoon,"" Tito said. Then, laughing, he added, ""so maybe this is our honeymoon."" The 394-foot-tall Starship will be the world's most powerful rocket when it finally takes off, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust from the 33 methane-burning Raptor engines powering its ""Super Heavy"" first stage — twice the liftoff thrust of NASA's $4.1 billion Space Launch System moon rocket. SpaceX's upper stage — the Starship — is equipped with six Raptor engines and will be capable of carrying passengers and payloads to the moon and beyond. Both stages are fully reusable and will descend to tail-first landings back on Earth using similar software and techniques perfected using the company's smaller Falcon 9 rockets. The Starship upper stage has been launched seven times on low-altitude test flights, four of which suffered catastrophic failures during the landing sequence. The most recent test flight in May 2021 was fully successful. ""Every time a rocket explodes, you learn something,"" Tito said. ""So the more rocket explosions we see, the better because then we'll get all the bugs out of it."" The Super Heavy first stage has not yet been launched. SpaceX is in the process of testing its engines and other critical systems before a test flight to boost an unpiloted Starship into orbit for the first time, possibly before the end of the year. SpaceX already holds a $2.9 billion NASA contract to develop a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in the agency's Artemis moon program. Under the current plan, astronauts launched aboard NASA's third piloted SLS rocket will dock with a Starship in lunar orbit and descend to touchdown near the moon's south pole in the 2025-26 timeframe. SpaceX is required to carry out an unpiloted test flight, complete with moon landing, before that Artemis 3 mission. Whether SpaceX can perfect the huge rocket and test it to NASA's satisfaction by 2025-26 remains to be seen. SpaceX does not provide details about its schedule and it's not known how the NASA mission will fit in with the company's plans to launch the other two currently planned Starship missions before Tito and his wife get their turn. Isaacman, who funded the first private flight, Inspiration 4, to low-Earth orbit in September 2021, has announced plans for three more private missions with SpaceX, including one that will feature the first spacewalk by a private citizen. Billionaire entrepreneur and art collector Maezawa, founder of ZoZotown, one of Japan's largest retail websites, also has booked a Super Heavy/Starship flight to carry him and several companions on the first privately-funded flight around the moon. Tito's flight presumably will follow Maezawa's, but it's not known whether one or both will precede NASA's lunar landing mission or whether Tito will get his wish within five years as hoped. ""We're prepared to wait as long as it takes to get everything perfected,"" Tito said.",3,6.8947516658401895,6.412583638597291,0.4821680272428983,6

The assault prompted Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to implore G-7 leaders on Tuesday, including President Biden, for more help. Zelenskyy told his fellow leaders that with enough modern, effective air defense systems, Ukraine could render useless the most damaging instruments of Russia's terror — its missiles, rockets and explosives-laden kamikaze drones. President Vladimir Putin has defined the dramatic escalation in Russia's attacks as retaliation for a huge explosion that damaged the 12-mile Kerch Bridge, the only ground link between Ukraine's Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula and mainland Russia. Two days of retaliatory strikes on Monday and Tuesday saw Russia fire dozens of missiles and drones at Ukraine — many of which were intercepted by air defense systems the country already has, but not enough of them. At least 19 people were killed and more than 100 injured as the bombs rained down on cities across Ukraine. A hospital in the capital city of Kyiv said Wednesday that a veteran cancer doctor was among those killed on Monday as she rushed to work after dropping her child off at daycare. The blistering assault on Ukraine's infrastructure and civilians began just two days after Putin — whose most senior generals have come under mounting pressure over Russia's territorial losses — put a new commander in charge of the war in Ukraine. General Sergei Surovikin, lionized by Russia's pro-Kremlin press as ""General Armageddon,"" was previously the commander of Russia's Air Force. He earned his reputation by a stint leading Russia's ruthless bombing campaign in Syria, flattening entire cities and killing thousands of civilians in support of dictator Bashar Assad's regime. Now Surovikin has been tasked with turning the tide for Russia's troops in Ukraine as they face daily crushing defeats on the front lines in the country's south and east. On Wednesday morning, Ukraine's Defense Ministry announced the recapture of five more villages in the southern Kherson Oblast, one of four Ukrainian regions that Putin unilaterally declared Russian territory with an illegal annexation about two weeks ago. CBS News has seen first-hand how Ukrainian tactics and firepower have overwhelmed Russian troops in Kherson. In the towns and villages where Ukrainian forces have ousted the invaders and raised their national flag again over recent weeks, soldiers have dug in deep, and there are armored personnel carriers, tanks, heavy artillery, and rocket launchers everywhere. It's clear their lightning counteroffensive hasn't been about just taking ground back from Russia, but holding onto it. The city of Kherson, the regional capital with a pre-war population of around 300,000, was the first major city to fall to Russia after Putin ordered his invasion on February 24. His forces still hold it, but Ukrainian troops are inching closer every day. If Ukraine's military manages to force the Russian occupiers out of the strategic stronghold in the south, it would be Putin's most humiliating defeat since he launched his war, so it's not something Russia is likely to give up without a fight - or further retaliation.",14,8.187399756392683,5.550656404031038,2.636743352361645,20

Multiple cities were hit again after dozens of missiles and explosives-packed drones rained down across Ukraine on Monday. Many hit packed neighborhoods during the morning rush-hour, as civilians made their way to work in cities including the capital Kyiv, which had largely escaped Russia's artillery for months. Ukrainian officials said at least 19 people were killed in the first round of strikes on Monday, and more than 100 injured. The toll from Tuesday's onslaught wasn't immediately clear. Air raid sirens pierced the quiet of the early morning hours, accompanied by new alerts sent out via cell phones, warning of incoming missiles. Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed Tuesday that it had continued its ""massive attack using high-precision long-range air- and sea-based armament."" Moscow has called the aerial assault retaliation for an apparent Ukrainian attack on the Kerch Bridge over the weekend — the only land link between Ukraine's Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula and mainland Russia. The Ukrainian military said Russia fired more than 75 cruise missiles at the country on Monday, with around 40 intercepted by air defense systems. About two dozen Iranian-made suicide drones were used in the attacks, too. Ukraine's infrastructure — the only target of the strikes, according to Russia — has indeed taken a pounding. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asked businesses to close after 6 p.m. and residents to limit appliance use during peak hours in a bid to conserve electricity. On Tuesday morning, Ukraine was still reeling from the onslaught as the fresh barrage of missiles struck. People emerged onto rubble-strewn streets to survey the damage and count the costs. But contrary to Russia's claims, those costs were being counted not only in damaged infrastructure, but dead civilians. The assault sent residents in Kyiv back into subways and other underground shelters for the first time in many weeks, where they defiantly sang Ukrainian folk songs and their country's national anthem. But while President Vladimir Putin may have proven Russia's ability to reach right across Ukraine, to recklessly rain missiles down on civilian neighborhoods, his soldiers are taking a beating on the battlefield. ""That is why they resort to this terror,"" said Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, adding a call for his own forces to ""make the battlefield even more painful for the enemy."" CBS News visited villages near the raging front lines in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, one of four that Putin recently declared Russian territory in an illegal land grab. Despite his purported annexation, Ukraine's troops have recaptured territory in Kherson and some other regions in a counterattack so rapid that it is being measured daily, by the mile. The villages there were among the first to fall to Russia and they remained under its iron grip for seven months, until they were liberated only about a week ago. Resident Oksana told CBS News she was still in a state of disbelief, but when she saw Ukrainian troops enter her village, all she felt was ""happiness."" ""We were suffering,"" she said, fighting back tears as she described life under Russian occupation. ""It was so hard, and so scary."" At a high school that was used for months as a military headquarters by the occupying Russian soldiers, the building itself tells the story of the brutal battle that brought the village back under Ukrainian control. Huge chunks of concrete are missing from the walls, every window is smashed, the buildings are scorched and the grounds are littered with the burnt-out carcasses of armored personnel carriers bearing the white ""Z"" of the Russian army. CBS News found teacher Sveltana Reznichenko taking stock of the filth and squalor left behind by the retreating Russian forces. It looked more like the remnants of a ragtag militia than a professional army. ""When I came in there and saw this horror, I still had faith that we will rebuild everything,"" she said. Zelenskyy vowed on Monday night that his nation would ""rebuild all the objects that had been damaged in today's Russian terrorist attacks. It's just a matter of time."" By Tuesday morning, there was even more to rebuild, and plenty more fighting still to do.",17,5.3074827259077475,1.5496340116432303,3.757848714264517,23

CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the strikes, which could signal a major escalation in the eight-month-old war, appeared to be entirely punitive — retaliation meant to terrorize Ukrainian civilians in densely-populated urban neighborhoods, close to government buildings, with one even hitting a children's playground. Ukraine's national police later said at least 10 people were killed and about 60 others injured by the missile strikes early Monday morning. Russia's strongman leader Vladimir Putin acknowledged the barrage of missiles, which Russia claimed targeted only energy infrastructure, was retaliation for an apparent Ukrainian attack on a key bridge over the weekend. Putin warned Monday that if Ukraine continued to mount ""terrorist attacks"" on Russia, his regime's response would be ""tough and proportionate to the level of threats."" ""Unfortunately there are dead and wounded. Please do not leave the shelters,"" Zelenskyy told Ukraine's citizens on social media earlier Monday, accusing Russia of wanting to ""wipe us from the face of the Earth."" The explosions in Kyiv and other cities came just a day after Putin blamed Kyiv for a massive explosion on a 12-mile bridge connecting Crimea with Russia. Crimea is a large Ukrainian peninsula that Russia occupied and then unilaterally annexed eight years ago during a previous invasion. The annexation of that territory, like Putin's recent land grab of four Ukrainian regions that he declared Russian soil last week, have been condemned as illegitimate and illegal by Ukraine, the United Nations, the U.S. and other Ukrainian partners. ""Ukraine is under missile attack. There is information about strikes in many cities of our country,"" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office, said on social media. General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said on Twitter that Russia had launched 75 missiles at Ukraine but that ""41 of them were neutralized by our air defence."" Zelenskyy later emerged onto a street in Kyiv to record a selfie video with a message to his people and the world, denouncing Russia for the barrage of missiles which he said had targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, and its civilians. ""They have specifically chosen such a time and such targets to cause as much damage as possible,"" the president said. ""But we Ukrainians, we help each other, believe in ourselves, rebuild everything. Now the shortages of electricity may occur, but not the shortage of our defiance and our confidence in our victory."" In Kyiv, reporters for the French news agency AFP heard at least five explosions in two salvos Monday morning, and a BBC News reporter ducked for cover as a massive explosion struck while he was on the air. Some of the missiles hit the center of the capital. Previous attacks largely targeted Kyiv's outskirts. Videos posted on social media showed black smoke rising above several areas of the city. Russia's last strike on the capital was on June 26. Other major cities hit by explosions Monday included Lviv, in Ukraine's far west, which has been a refuge for many people fleeing the fighting in the east. The foreign minister of Moldova, a small nation that sits along Ukraine's southwest border, said three cruise missiles ""from Russian ships in the Black Sea"" had flown through Moldova's airspace as they headed for Ukraine on Monday morning. Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu added in his Twitter message that he had ""instructed that Russia's ambassador be summoned to provide an explanation."" As the European Union condemned Russia's attack and said the targeting of civilians amounted to ""a war crime,"" Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed the ""massive strike with long-range precision weapons."" It claimed the missiles had targeted ""objects of the military command and control, communications and energy systems of Ukraine"" and that ""all assigned objects were hit."" Witnesses also reported a loud explosion Monday morning in Russia's Belgorod region, meanwhile, which sits right along Ukraine's eastern border. One witness told Reuters there was a loud bang and windows shook. The cause of the blast wasn't clear. The explosions came a day after Putin said Ukraine was behind an explosion on the Kerch bridge, linking Crimea with Russia, that left three people dead. ""The authors, perpetrators and sponsors are the Ukrainian secret services,"" Putin said of Saturday's bridge bombing, which he described as a ""terrorist act."" Putin spoke during a meeting with the head of the investigation committee he has set up to look into the bombing, Russian news agencies reported. The Russian leader was gearing up for a meeting with his Security Council later Monday, the Kremlin told local news agencies. ""Tomorrow the president has a planned meeting with the permanent members of the Security Council,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The blast that hit the bridge sparked celebrations among Ukrainians and others on social media. But Zelenskyy, in his nightly address on Saturday, didn't directly mention the incident, and officials in Kyiv have made no direct claim of responsibility. On Saturday, Russia said some road and rail traffic had resumed over the strategic link, a powerful symbol of the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea. The bridge has served as a vital supply link between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula during its current invasion of south and eastern Ukraine. Some military analysts argue the explosion could have a major impact if Moscow sees the need to shift already hard-pressed troops to Crimea from other regions — or if it prompts a rush by residents to leave. Mick Ryan, a retired Australian senior officer now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said even if Kyiv wasn't behind the blast, it constituted ""a massive influence operation win for Ukraine. ""It is a demonstration to Russians, and the rest of the world, that Russia's military cannot protect any of the provinces it recently annexed,"" he said on Twitter. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, denounced a Russian missile strike on Sunday that killed at least 17 people in Zaporizhzhia, the latest deadly bombardment of the southern Ukrainian city. The attack also wounded 89 people, according to a statement from the president's office. Zelenskyy described the ""merciless strikes on peaceful people"" and residential buildings as ""absolute evil"" perpetrated by ""savages and terrorists."" Regional official Oleksandr Starukh posted pictures of heavily damaged apartment blocks on social media and said a rescue operation had been launched to find victims under the rubble. Russian officials, meanwhile, denounced on Sunday what they said was a surge in Ukrainian fire into its territory that had hit homes, administrative buildings and a monastery. Russia's FBS, which is responsible for border security, said on Sunday: ""Since the start of October, the number of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations on Russia's border territory has considerably increased."" More than 100 artillery attacks, concentrated on the western border regions of Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk, had hit housing and administrative buildings, said the statement. The attacks had killed one person and wounded five others.",17,1.2798605884412428,0.29540548538593747,0.9844551030553054,17
2022-10-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-kyiv-missile-attack-putin-crimea-bridge/,Russia rains missiles down on Ukraine's capital and other cities in retaliation for Crimea bridge blast,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that people were killed and injured in multiple missile strikes across Ukraine, including the first bombardment of the capital, Kyiv, in months. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the strikes, which could signal a major escalation in the eight-month-old war, appeared to be entirely punitive — retaliation meant to terrorize Ukrainian civilians in densely-populated urban neighborhoods, close to government buildings, with one even hitting a children's playground. The lethal barrage smashed into civilian areas, knocking out power and water, shattering buildings and killing at least 14 people. The bombardment came two days after Russia suffered a serious blow with the bombing that damaged its sole bridge to Crimea. Ukraine's Emergency Service said nearly 100 people were wounded in the morning rush hour attacks that Russia launched from the air, sea and land against at least 14 regions, spanning from Lviv in the west to Kharkiv in the east. Many of the attacks occurred far from the war's front lines. Though Russia said missiles targeted military and energy facilities, some struck civilian areas while people were heading to work and school. One hit a playground in downtown Kyiv and another struck a university. The attacks plunged much of the country into a blackout, depriving hundreds of thousands of people of electricity and creating a shortage so severe Ukrainian authorities announced they would have to stop power exports to Europe starting Tuesday. Power outages also often deprive residents of water, given the system's reliance on electricity to run pumps and other equipment. The head of Ukraine's law enforcement said Monday's attacks damaged 70 infrastructure sites, of which 29 are critical. Zelenskyy said that of the 84 cruise missiles and 24 drones Russia fired, Ukrainian forces shot down 56. Andriy Yermak, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the strikes had no ""practical military sense"" and that Russia's goal was to cause a ""humanitarian catastrophe."" Russian President Vladimir Putin said his forces used ""precision weapons"" to target key energy infrastructure and military command facilities in retaliation for Kyiv's ""terrorist"" actions — a reference to Ukraine's attempts to repel Moscow's invasion forces, including an attack Saturday on a key bridge between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula that Putin called a ""terrorist act"" masterminded by Ukrainian special services. Putin vowed a ""tough"" and ""proportionate"" response should Ukraine carry out further attacks that threaten Russia's security. ""No one should have any doubts about it,"" he told Russia's Security Council by video. The explosions in Kyiv and other cities came just a day after Putin blamed Kyiv for the massive explosion on a 12-mile bridge connecting Crimea with Russia. Crimea is a large Ukrainian peninsula that Russia occupied and then unilaterally annexed eight years ago during a previous invasion. The annexation of that territory, like Putin's recent land grab of four Ukrainian regions that he declared Russian soil last week, have been condemned as illegitimate and illegal by Ukraine, the United Nations, the U.S. and other countries. The blast that hit the bridge sparked celebrations among Ukrainians and others on social media — but officials in Kyiv have made no direct claim of responsibility. The Russian president has been under intense domestic pressure to take more aggressive action to stop a largely successful Ukrainian counteroffensive and to react forcefully to Saturday's attack on the Kerch bridge, whose construction he used to cement his 2014 annexation of Crimea. Putin's increasingly frequent descriptions of Ukraine's actions as terrorist could portend even more bold and draconian actions. But in Monday's speech, Putin — whose partial troop mobilization order last month triggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of men of fighting age from Russia — stopped short of an expected escalation from what he calls a ""special military operation"" to a counterterrorism campaign or martial law. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on world leaders to declare Russia a terrorist state because of its attacks on civilians and alleged war crimes. Zelenskyy emerged onto a street in Kyiv on Monday to record a selfie video with a message to his people and the world, denouncing Russia for the barrage of missiles which he said had targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, and its civilians. Zelenskyy's wife, Olena, posted a video showing people sheltering on the stairs of a Kyiv subway station singing a Ukrainian folk song, ""In a Cherry Garden,"" whose final lines are: ""My dear mother, you are old and I'm happy and young. I want to live, to love."" ""They have specifically chosen such a time and such targets to cause as much damage as possible,"" the president said. ""But we Ukrainians, we help each other, believe in ourselves, rebuild everything. Now the shortages of electricity may occur, but not the shortage of our defiance and our confidence in our victory."" The strikes sent residents of Ukraine's two largest cities — Kyiv and Kharkiv — into bomb shelters, including subway stations. While air raid sirens have continued throughout the war in cities across the country, in Kyiv and elsewhere many Ukrainians had begun to ignore their warnings after months of calm. Just as traffic was picking up Monday morning, a commuter minibus was struck near Kyiv National University. Nearby, at least one strike landed in Shevchenko Park, leaving a large hole near a children's playground. Another target was the Klitschko pedestrian bridge — a landmark in central Kyiv with glass panels. Closed-circuit video footage showed a huge explosion under the bridge, with smoke rising, and a man running away after the blast, apparently unhurt. No significant damage to the bridge was immediately apparent. Air raid sirens sounded in every region of Ukraine except Russia-annexed Crimea for four straight hours. Videos posted on social media showed black smoke rising above several areas of the city. Russia's last strike on the capital was on June 26. Associated Press journalists saw multiple bodies at an industrial site on the outskirts of Dnipro. Four people were killed and 19 injured in the city, officials said. Witnesses said one missile landed in front of a bus during the morning rush hour, damaging the vehicle but not killing any passengers. Kharkiv was hit three times, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. The strikes knocked out the electricity and water supply. Energy infrastructure was also hit in Lviv, regional Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi said. Three cruise missiles launched against Ukraine from Russian ships in the Black Sea crossed Moldova's airspace, said the country's foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu. As the European Union condemned Russia's attack and said the targeting of civilians amounted to ""a war crime,"" Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed the ""massive strike with long-range precision weapons."" It claimed the missiles had targeted ""objects of the military command and control, communications and energy systems of Ukraine"" and that ""all assigned objects were hit."" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was ""deeply shocked by today's large-scale missile attacks"" on Ukraine, his spokesman said in a statement, adding that the strike ""constitutes another unacceptable escalation of the war and, as always, civilians are paying the highest price."" Some feared Monday's attacks may just be the first salvo in a renewed Russian offensive. As a precautionary measure, Ukraine switched all schools to online learning until at least the end of this week. In an ominous move, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced Monday that he and Putin have agreed to create a joint ""regional grouping of troops."" He offered no details. Lukashenko repeated his claims that Ukraine is plotting an attack on Belarus, sparking fears he would take preemptive action. His defense minister, Viktor Khrenin, later issued a video warning Ukraine not to provoke Belarus, but added, ""We don't want to fight.""

2022-10-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/airport-websites-hacked-pro-russia-ddos-attack/,U.S. airport websites knocked offline in apparent pro-Russia hacking attack,"An apparently coordinated denial-of-service attack organized by pro-Russia hackers rendered the websites of some major U.S. airports unreachable early Monday, though officials said flights were not affected. The attacks — in which participants flood targets with junk data — were orchestrated by a shadowy group that calls itself Killnet. On the eve of the attacks the group published a target list on its Telegram channel. While highly visible and aimed at maximum psychological impact, DDoS attacks are mostly a noisy nuisance, different from hacking that involves breaking into networks and can do serious damage. ""We noticed this morning that the external website was down, and our IT and security people are in the process of investigating,"" said Andrew Gobeil, a spokesman for Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. ""There has been no impact on operations."" Portions of the public-facing side of the Los Angeles International Airport website were also disrupted, spokeswoman Victoria Spilabotte said. ""No internal airport systems were compromised and there were no operational disruptions."" Spilabotte said the airport notified the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration, and the airport's information-technology team was working to restore all services and investigate the cause. Several other airports that were included on Killnet's target list reported problems with their websites. Orlando International Airport told CBS News that its site was affected but is back online and that airport operations were not impacted. The Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that websites for O'Hare International and Midway airports went offline early Monday but that no airport operations were affected. ""Early Monday, FlyChicago.com and related websites for O'Hare and Midway international airports went offline. No airport operations were affected. City of Chicago IT staff worked diligently to restore the website's functionality shortly after noon CT, and they continue to vigilantly monitor the situation. The City's Information Security Office at the Department of Assets, Information and Services is investigating the cause of the outage,"" the department said in a statement. Last week, the same group of hackers claimed responsibility for denial-of-service attacks on state government websites in several states. John Hultquist, vice president for threat intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, tweeted that denial-of-service attacks like those aimed at the airports and state governments are usually short in duration and ""typically superficial."" ""These are not the serious impacts that have kept us awake,"" he said. Such attacks instead tend to reveal insufficient attention by webmasters to adequate bulletproofing of sites, which now includes DDoS protection service.",3,8.750195945389201,0.40018059157678626,8.350015353812415,7
2022-10-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/cyberattack-ohare-midway-airport-websites-russian-hackers/,Cyberattack temporarily takes down websites for O'Hare and Midway airports,"CHICAGO (CBS) -- A cyberattack on Monday shut down the websites for O'Hare and Midway airports, and several other large airports across the country. An FBI spokesperson confirmed they were aware of the cyberattack that took down flychicago.com for part of the morning on Monday, but would not confirm or deny if they were investigating. The O'Hare and Midway websites were down for at least a few hours Monday morning, but was back up and running early Monday afternoon. The Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that no airport operations were affected. ""City of Chicago IT staff worked diligently to restore the website's functionality shortly after noon CT, and they continue to vigilantly monitor the situation,"" the department said in the statement. ""The City's Information Security Office at the Department of Assets, Information and Services is investigating the cause of the outage."" CNN reports Russian-speaking hackers claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against more than a dozen airport websites, including Los Angeles International Airport. No immediate signs of impact to actual air travel were reported, suggesting the issue may be an inconvenience for people seeking travel information. ""Obviously, we're tracking that, and there's no concern about operations being disrupted,"" Kiersten Todt, Chief of Staff of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said Monday at a security conference in Sea Island, Georgia. The 14 websites include the one for Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. An employee there told CNN there were no operational impacts. The Los Angeles International Airport website was offline earlier but appeared to be restored shortly before 9 a.m. Eastern. A spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment. The hacking group known as Killnet listed multiple US airports as targets. It stepped up activity to target organizations in NATO countries after Russia's February invasion of Ukraine. The loosely organized ""hacktivists"" are politically motivated to support the Kremlin but ties to Moscow are unknown. The group claimed responsibility last week for knocking offline US state governments websites. Killnet is blamed for briefly downing a US Congress website in July and for cyberattacks on organizations in Lithuania after the country blocked shipment of goods to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad in June. The type of cyberattack used by Killnet is known as ""distributed denial of service"" (DDoS), in which hackers flood computer servers with phony web traffic to knock them offline. ""DDoS attacks are favored by actors of varying sophistication because they have visible results, but these incidents are usually superficial and short lived,"" John Hultquist, a vice president at Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told CNN. A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said the agency is monitoring the issue and working with airport partners. With less than a month until Election Day, Prof. Bill Kresse of Governors State University said governments and businesses should be doubling down by protecting against breaches and online phishing scams that allow hackers into vulnerable areas. He said the attacks were a message to allies of Ukraine to ""back off."" ""It could be interpreted that they don't want to do anything major that might cause major repercussions, but this is something which will be noticed,"" Kresse said. ""It was really more signaling than anything else ... The message we should take from this: playtime's over. It's time we really take our precautions seriously.""",3,1.2621953379919857,6.411803780192769,-5.149608442200783,7
2022-10-09,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-airstrike-today-russia-kerch-bridge-bridge-attack-2022-10-09/,Russian strike kills at least 17 in Ukraine following bridge attack,"A Russian barrage pounded apartment buildings and other targets in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least 17 people and wounding dozens, officials said Sunday. The blasts in the city, which remains under Ukrainian control but sits in a region Moscow has claimed as its own, blew out windows in adjacent buildings and left at least one high-rise apartment building partially collapsed. The multiple strikes came after an explosion Saturday caused the partial collapse of a bridge linking the Crimean Peninsula with Russia. The Kerch Bridge attack damaged an important supply route for the Kremlin's faltering war effort in southern Ukraine, an artery that also is a towering symbol of Russia's power in the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called the attack ""a terrorist act"" masterminded by Ukrainian special services. ""There's no doubt it was a terrorist act directed at the destruction of critically important civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said during a meeting with the chairman of Russia's Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin. ""And the authors, perpetrators, and those who ordered it are the special services of Ukraine."" Bastrykin said Ukrainian special services and citizens of Russia and other countries took part in the attack. He said a criminal investigation had been launched into an act of terror. ""We have already established the route of the truck,"" he said, saying it had been to Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, North Ossetia and Krasnodar, a region in southern Russia. In Kyiv, presidential adviser Mikhail Podolyak called Putin's accusation ""too cynical even for Russia."" ""Putin accuses Ukraine of terrorism?"" he said. ""It has not even been 24 hours since Russian planes fired 12 rockets into a residential area of Zaporizhzhia, killing 13 people and injuring more than 50. No, there is only one state terrorist and the whole world knows who he is."" Podolyak referred to missile strikes on the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight that brought down part of a large apartment building. The six missiles were launched from Russian-occupied areas of the Zaporizhzhia region, the Ukrainian air force said. The bombing of the bridge came a day after Putin turned 70, dealing him a humiliating blow that one military analyst called it a punch in the face for Putin on his birthday, CBS News' Charlie D'Agata reports. The rockets that pounded Zaporizhzhia overnight damaged at least 20 private homes and 50 apartment buildings, city council Secretary Anatoliy Kurtev said. At least 40 people were hospitalized, Kurtev said on Telegram. The Ukrainian military confirmed the attack, saying there were dozens of casualties. Residents gathered behind police tape by a building where several floors collapsed from the blast, leaving a smoldering chasm at least 40-feet wide where apartments once stood. Tetyana Lazun'ko, 73, and her husband, Oleksii, took shelter in the hallway of their top floor apartment after hearing sirens, warning of an attack. They were spared the worst of the blast that left them in fear and disbelief. ""There was an explosion. Everything was shaking,"" Lazun'ko said. ""Everything was flying and I was screaming."" Shards of glass, entire window and door frames and other debris covered the exterior floors of the apartment where they'd lived since 1974. Lazun'ko wept inconsolably, wondering why their home in an area with no military infrastructure in sight was targeted. ""Why are they bombing us. Why?"" she said. Oleksii, who sat quietly, leaning on a wooden cane, has suffered three strokes, Lazun'ko said. Breaking his silence, he said slowly, ""This is international terrorism. You can't be saved from it."" In recent weeks, Russia has repeatedly struck Zaporizhzhia, which is the capital of a region of the same name that Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed in violation of international law last week. At least 19 people died in Russian missile strikes on apartment buildings in the city on Thursday. ""Again, Zaporizhzhia. Again, merciless attacks on civilians, targeting residential buildings, in the middle of the night,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote in a Telegram post. ""Absolute meanness. Absolute evil. … From the one who gave this order, to everyone who carried out this order: they will answer. They must. Before the law and the people,"" he added While Russia targeted Zaporizhzhia before Saturday's explosion on the Crimea bridge, the attack was a significant blow to Russia, which annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. No one has claimed responsibility for damaging the bridge. Putin signed a decree late Saturday tightening security for the bridge and for energy infrastructure between Crimea and Russia, and put Russia's federal security service, the FSB, in charge of the effort. Some Russian lawmakers called for Putin to declare a ""counterterrorism operation,"" rather than the term ""special military operation"" that has downplayed the scope of fighting to ordinary Russians. Hours after the explosion, Russia's Defense Ministry announced that the air force chief, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, would now command all Russian troops in Ukraine. Surovikin, who this summer was placed in charge of troops in southern Ukraine, had led Russian forces in Syria and was accused of overseeing a bombardment that destroyed much of Aleppo. The 19-kilometer (12-mile) Kerch Bridge, on a strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, is a symbol of Moscow's claims on Crimea and an essential link to the peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The $3.6 billion bridge, the longest in Europe, is vital to sustaining Russia's military operations in southern Ukraine. Putin himself presided over the bridge's opening in May 2018. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a video address, indirectly acknowledged the bridge attack but did not address its cause. ""Today was not a bad day and mostly sunny on our state's territory,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it was cloudy in Crimea. Although it was also warm."" Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants a future ""without occupiers. Throughout our territory, in particular in Crimea."" Zelenskyy also said Ukrainian forces advanced or held the line in the east and south, but acknowledged ""very, very difficult, very tough fighting"" around the city of Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have claimed recent gains. Train and automobile traffic over the bridge was temporarily suspended. Automobile traffic resumed Saturday afternoon on one of the two links that remained intact, with the flow alternating in each direction, said Crimea's Russia-backed leader, Sergey Aksyonov. The Russian transport ministry said on Telegram Sunday that passenger train traffic between Crimea and the Russian mainland resumed overnight ""according to schedule."" In a separate Telegram post Sunday, the ministry said car ferries also were working between Crimea and the mainland, with the first crossing taking place shortly before 2 a.m. local time (11 p.m. GMT). While Russia seized areas north of Crimea early in its invasion of Ukraine and built a land corridor to it along the Sea of Azov, Ukraine is pressing a counteroffensive to reclaim that territory as well as four regions Putin illegally annexed this month. Russia has ramped up its strikes on the city of Zaporizhzhia since formally absorbing the surrounding region on September 29. The regional governor of Zaporizhzhia reported that the death toll had risen to 32 after Russia's missile strike on a civilian convoy making its way out of the city on September 30. In a Telegram post, Oleksandr Starukh that one more person died in the hospital on Friday. A part of the Zaporizhzhia region currently under Russian control is home to Europe's largest nuclear power station. Fighting has repeatedly imperiled the the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, and Ukrainian authorities shut down its last operating reactor last month to prevent a radiation disaster. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said Saturday that the Zaporizhzhia plant has since lost its last remaining external power source as a result of renewed shelling and is now relying on emergency diesel generators. The Crimean Peninsula is a popular destination for Russian tourists and home to a Russian naval base. A Russian tourist association estimated that 50,000 tourists were in Crimea on Saturday.",17,7.166377800393249,2.4223668545515804,4.744010945841669,17

Lyman was liberated from Russian control last week. According to a post by Kyrylenko on the social platform Telegram, one site contained about 200 individual graves, and authorities believe they are all civilians. The other was a mass grave which may contain the bodies of both Ukrainian military members and civilians. The exact number of bodies in both grave sites is unknown, Kyrylenko said. On Oct. 1, Russia withdrew its troops from Lyman after the city was surrounded by Ukrainian forces, who have been in the midst of a successful counteroffensive to take back Ukrainian territory. A Ukrainian official also said Thursday the bodies of at least 530 people have been discovered in recaptured areas of the Kharkiv region since Sept. 7. Ukraine's First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Yevhen Yenin said Friday the bodies included those 225 women, 257 men and 19 children, while 29 bodies haven't yet been identified. Some 447 of the bodies were found in the mass grave in the city of Izium. Yenin said forensics experts have found indications of ""violent death in a considerable number of bodies,"" including signs of torture. According to Yenin, some bodies ""had a rope around their neck, hands tied behind their back, bullet wounds to their knees, and broken ribs.""

Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv region's State Police Investigative Department, said 22 torture sites were found in recently liberated areas. Early Saturday, meanwhile, a series of explosions rocked the city of Kharkiv, sending towering plumes of illuminated smoke into the sky and triggering a series of secondary explosions. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the early-morning explosions were the result of missile strikes in the center of the city. He said that the blasts sparked fires at one of the city's medical institutions and a nonresidential building.

But you don't have to go that far to see the destruction Russia is capable of. We visited the city of Zaporizhzhia, miles from any front-line combat, not long after it was hit with a barrage of Russian rockets on Thursday. The explosions sent emergency teams scrambling in a desperate search for those who survived the strike. At times, they found only those who had not. We arrived to find firefighters dousing a mountain of twisted metal and debris. War crimes investigators were already looking through the rubble. Residents stood nearby, staring in disbelief. Just a few hours after the rocket attack, it was no longer a rescue mission. The building in the middle of a main street in an upmarket part of Zaporizhzhia, several miles from any front line and at least 25 miles from Russian-held territory, was still smoldering. The city of Zaporizhzhia has remained firmly under Ukrainian control, but it's the regional capital of one of the four areas Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed just a few days ago. Resident Olena got a phone call from her 70-year-old mother at 5 a.m. on Thursday, saying she was trapped beneath the rubble. ""She has broken ribs, a lung contusion and broken leg,"" Olena told CBS News. ""But she is alive."" Despite the ordeal, Olena seemed remarkably composed. Her real emotions, however, were simmering just underneath the calm veneer. ""I'm very angry, very angry,"" she told us. ""We need help,"" she said, begging the wider world to ""stop this."" Lying on the pavement outside were body bags containing three of 11 people known to have been killed by the Russian strike. With the search still going on Friday, it was possible more innocent victims of Putin's senseless war were yet to be found. It was the second major missile attack on civilians in Zaporizhzhia in just a week. Last Friday we saw the aftermath of a strike on a civilian convoy that killed at least 30 people. Ukrainian troops continue to smash through front lines in the south and the east, forcing the Russian invaders to retreat. Battlefield commanders tell us Russian forces are in ""complete disarray."" One of the factors behind the recent success, according to a British intelligence report released on Friday, is the vast number of Russian tanks the Ukrainians have captured. The report estimates that at least 440 have been seized — amounting to roughly half of Ukraine's current tank fleet. Infuriated by the losses, Putin has retaliated by launching long-range weapons into residential areas far from the fighting, spreading terror. What Russia cannot capture, it seeks to destroy. The fear, voiced bluntly on Thursday by President Biden, is that the Russian leader will feel so backed into a corner that he'll resort to even more lethal tactics in that strategy, including his nuclear arsenal.",17,3.0743938252468217,6.328640704668497,-3.2542468794216752,22

2022-10-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/534-civilian-bodies-found-ukraine-territory-recaptured-russian-troops-police/,"534 civilian bodies found so far in Ukrainian territory recaptured from Russian troops, police say","The bodies of 534 civilians have been discovered in Ukrainian territories previously occupied by Russian troops, Serhii Bolvinov, who leads the investigative department of Kharkiv's regional police, told journalists Thursday. Nineteen of those bodies belonged to children and 226 were women, he said. The count includes remains that were found in shallow graves last month at a mass burial site in Izyum, where hundreds of corpses were discovered after Russian troops were forced out of the area by a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Bolvinov said authorities identified 22 sites that Russian troops used as torture chambers when they were occupying the area. ""In almost all the big towns and settlements where the soldiers of the Russian army were based, they arranged these locations for detaining civilians and prisoners of war, where they got tortured,"" Bolvinov said. ""The most common type of torture is connecting wires to shock someone's body, and causing pain by that. Severe beatings with sticks and other items. There is also evidence of the nails being removed and other horrible things, including usage of a gas-mask to stifle breathing."" He said the most recent torture chamber to be discovered by Ukrainian investigators in the region had been continuously manned by about 10 soldiers. It was in the basement of a house in Pisky-Radkivski, a village near where Russian troops positioned their headquarters. Ukrainian detainees, who were captured for — among other things — breaking curfew or being accused of spotting for Ukrainian attacks, were held and tortured in that basement, which was about 8 feet long by 5 feet wide. ""We have witnesses who are giving us information on the fact that they heard people screaming, begging for help, to be let out, and sometimes people asked to go to the toilet from this basement,"" Bolvinov said. ""Sometimes, after these screams, the locals heard gunshots, and the screams stopped after that."" In the basement, investigators found blindfolds, ropes, a dildo, military jackets, written notes of prisoner ""confessions,"" a telephone, a gas mask, and a plastic container full of dentures and teeth. The teeth have been sent to be DNA profiled, to identify who they belong to and determine whether they were taken from a local dentist.

2022-10-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/russia-ukraine-war-putin-elites-critical-and-looking-for-scapegoats/,"Russia's elites are increasingly critical of the war in Ukraine, and they're looking for scapegoats","Cracks are emerging in the solid base of support within Russia's political elite for President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. As Russia's forces suffer setback after setback and a botched and highly unpopular military mobilization effort draws thousands of poorly trained men to serve on the front lines, senior military and political figures have been looking for scapegoats, and the blame game is getting closer than ever to Putin himself. Criticism of Moscow's military strategy and the way decisions are being made and implemented on the ground has brewed for weeks on social media channels popular among pro-war Russian military correspondents. This week, however, it reached a new level. General Andrey Kartapolov, who held a range of senior positions in Russia's Defense Ministry until he became a member of parliament and head of its defense committee a few years ago, has lashed out at the country's current military commanders over losses in the war. ""First of all, you have to stop lying,"" Kartapolov, who previously commanded the Western Military District, which is central to the Ukraine invasion, said on a popular online video show run by a top Kremlin propagandist. ""All border villages of the Belgorod region are practically destroyed,"" Kartapolov lamented, referring to settlements right on the Ukrainian border that have been caught in the crossfire as Russia uses the area as a staging ground for its attacks. ""We hear about this from anyone, from governors and military correspondents. But the reports of the Ministry of Defense do not change,"" the politician said. ""The people know. Our people are not stupid, they see they are not telling them the truth and this can lead to loss of credibility."" Casting blame at Russia's top brass, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu who, at least in the past, has been considered a close friend and confidant of Putin, has become a central theme on Russian television and in public forums. Direct criticism of Putin himself still appears to be off-limits on Russia's closely monitored and tightly controlled airwaves, and pro-Kremlin voices have been working hard to shelter the autocrat from the public discontent. But infighting between various political clans does seem to be disrupting the carved-in-stone hierarchy Putin has relied on to remain in power — and to quickly quash any inkling of dissent — for more than two decades. A week ago, Russian troops were forced out of the Ukrainian city of Lyman. Retaking the railway hub in the Donetsk region deprived Russia of a crucial logistics hub and gave Ukraine's forces a route to attack the Russian occupied Luhansk region. Shortly after Lyman fell to Ukrainian forces, the powerful head of the Russian region of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, unleashed a sneering attack on the Russian military's General Staff, which leads the military campaign, and on Alexander Lapin, who Kadyrov said was responsible for that sector of the front line. ""The shame isn't that Lapin is talentless,"" Kadyrov wrote on his blog on the Telegram messaging app. ""It's that he's being shielded from above by the leadership in the General Staff."" ""If it was up to me, I would demote him down to a private, take away his medals and send him with a rifle to the front in order to cleanse his shame in blood,"" Kadyrov added. The proxy leader installed by Russia in the largely-occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, went even further, issuing rare scathing criticism of Defense Minister Shoigu over Moscow's recent military losses, including in Kherson. ""Many are saying that the Defense Minister — who allowed things to come to this — should simply shoot himself like a [real] officer,"" Stremousov said in a four-minute video posted Thursday to his Telegram channel. Russia's botched military mobilization campaign — which has seen the blind, elderly and others incapable of fighting among those to receive summons to fight — has been another major point of public criticism. Tens of thousands of people, mostly young men, have fled the country to avoid being sent to fight in Ukraine, and hundreds have been arrested at anti-mobilization protests around the country. Those who have reported for duty have faced shortages of protective gear and other basics, including food and uniforms. ""I'm perplexed how a current training site of the Ministry of Defense can be in such a state. A ruined canteen, broken and rusty showers, lack of beds, and those that exist are broken,"" Roman Starovoit, Governor of the Kursk region that borders Ukraine, said Wednesday after a tour of military training grounds there, some of which he described as ""terrible."" Bloomberg has reported, citing sources, that the sudden abundance of public acknowledgement over the Russian military's failures in Ukraine is actually the result of a Kremlin directive. The report suggests the Kremlin told some trusted state media outlets to start acknowledging the failures, fearing an overly-positive message on Russian airwaves would fuel public doubts about its credibility. Putin has also reportedly met with pro-war military correspondents and bloggers who have spent months on the ground, and have been offering more realistic battleground updates. Some of these journalists have reportedly wondered whether the Russian president had been relying solely on the rosy public briefings provided by his Ministry of Defense. ""The idea that Russia will inevitably prevail has started to be overshadowed by doubt over what price Russia is prepared to pay in order to bring Ukraine to heel,"" political analyst and nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment Tatiana Stanovaya said in a recent analysis. ""Matters have progressed so far that they may now have to choose among various losing scenarios. That makes Putin far more vulnerable, for he may just find that he and the elites settle on different scenarios.""",14,4.479995294499056,3.890975772851422,0.5890195216476339,0

Spacecraft commander Nicole Mann, co-pilot Josh Cassada, Japan's Koichi Wakata and cosmonaut Anna Kikina, the first Russian to fly on a Crew Dragon, monitored a series of automated rendezvous rocket firings as the SpaceX capsule moved in, docking at the station's forward port at 5:01 p.m. EDT. A dozen motorized bolts then drove home to firmly lock the two spacecraft together with an airtight structural seal. ""Docking sequence complete,"" radioed SpaceX communicator Jake Vendl from the company's Hawthorne, California, control room. ""Crew Dragon Endurance, and Koichi, Nicole, Josh and Anna, welcome to the International Space Station."" ""Thank you so much!"" Mann replied. ""Crew 5 is happy to have finally arrived at the International Space Station. Endurance is a very proper name for our training, mission and the spacecraft. ... We are looking forward to getting to work."" At 6:49 p.m., Mann and her crewmates floated into the station to hugs and handshakes from Crew 4 commander Kjell Lindgren, Bob Hines, Jessica Watkins and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, along with Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitri Petelin and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio. The Endurance crew is replacing Lindgren, Hines, Watkins and Cristoforetti, who plan to return to Earth on Oct. 13 aboard Crew Dragon Freedom, which carried them to the space station last April. Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio, who arrived at the lab aboard a Russian Soyuz ferry ship on Sept. 21, replaced an earlier Soyuz crew that returned to Earth on Sept. 29. Kikina is the first Russian to fly aboard a U.S. spacecraft in nearly 20 years. She and Rubio were launched under a new agreement between NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, that ensures at least one astronaut or cosmonaut is always aboard the space station even if a Crew Dragon or Soyuz is forced to depart early, taking its crew with it. Without the seat-swap arrangement, a medical emergency or some other major problem could leave an all-Russian or all-NASA crew aboard without the expertise to operate the other nation's systems. ""We signed an agreement with Roscosmos for one flight this year, one flight next year and one flight in '24,"" said Joel Montalbano, manager of the NASA space station program at the Johnson Space Center. ""That's for all SpaceX missions."" NASA and its partner agencies are working to extend station operations to the end of the decade. Assuming Russia eventually signs on for at least part of that planned extension, Montalbano hopes the seat-swap agreement will be updated with additional flights.",3,6.712777707724027,8.181277286984526,-1.4684995792604996,3

CBS News traveled to Lyman on Wednesday to see the scars of the ferocious battle that raged for days as Ukrainian forces clawed back territory. The trail of destruction leading up to Lyman stretches for miles. A local resident told CBS News that most of the damage was done in the days just before the liberation of the city. A bombed-out convoy with vehicles used by Russian soldiers who tried to escape the onslaught was found further down the road. Among the soldiers' scattered belongings were Russian anti-tank mines. Bodies of Russian soldiers laid in the road in the immediate aftermath of the fighting. The city center was in tatters, pummeled by both sides of this conflict. Once a population of more than 20,000, the few remaining residents emerged grateful for the humanitarian aid workers who came, bringing a few loaves of bread. There is no electricity, no running water and no heat for their homes, with winter on the way and no guarantee the Russians won't return to wrestle this city back. Col. Sirhiy Cherevatyi, who took part in the fight, told CBS News that the victory was down to strategy and western-supplied weapons. ""Artillery was very important,"" Cherevatyi said. ""American weapons and of course the HIMARS."" He said recapturing Lyman was not just a military loss for Russia, but a blow to Russian morale.

Nicole Mann becomes first Native American woman in space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — For the first time in history, a Native American woman has launched into space as a member of a NASA mission. Petaluma-born Marine Col. Nicole Mann, a member of the Wailacki of the Round Valley Indian Tribes, made history when her rocket lifted off on their Hurricane Ian delayed mission to the International Space Station. ""Awesome!"" said Mann as they reached orbit. ""That was a smooth ride uphill. You've got three rookies who are pretty happy to be floating in space right now."" Mann is taking up with her on the mission her mother's dream catcher, a small traditional webbed hoop believed to offer protection. ""I am very proud to represent Native Americans and my heritage,"" Mann said before the flight, adding that everyone on her crew has a unique background. ""It's important to celebrate our diversity and also realize how important it is when we collaborate and unite, the incredible accomplishments that we can have."" Retired NASA astronaut John Herrington of the Chickasaw Nation became the first Native American in space in 2002. Joining Mann on the mission were Japan Space Agency's Koichi Wakata, who is making his fifth spaceflight, Navy Capt. Josh Cassada and Russia's lone female cosmonaut, Anna Kikina. They're due to arrive at the space station Thursday, 29 hours after a noon departure from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, and won't be back on Earth until March. They're replacing a U.S.-Italian crew that arrived in April. Kikina is the Russian Space Agency's exchange for NASA's Frank Rubio, who launched to the space station two weeks ago from Kazakhstan aboard a Soyuz rocket. He flew up with two cosmonauts. The space agencies agreed over the summer to swap seats on their flights in order to ensure a continuous U.S. and Russian presence aboard the 260-mile-high outpost. The barter was authorized even as global hostilities mounted over Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February. The next crew exchange is in the spring. Shortly before liftoff, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said that the key reason for the seat exchange is safety — in case an emergency forces one capsule's crew home, there would still be an American and Russian on board. In the meantime, Russia remains committed to the space station through at least 2024, Russia space official Sergei Krikalev assured reporters this week. Russia wants to build its own station in orbit later this decade, ""but we know that it's not going to happen very quick and so probably we will keep flying"" with NASA until then, he said. Beginning with Krikalev in 1994, NASA started flying cosmonauts on its space shuttles, first to Russia's Mir space station and then to the fledgling space station. The 2003 Columbia reentry disaster put an end to it. But U.S. astronauts continued to hitch rides on Russian rockets for tens of millions of dollars per seat. Kakina is only the fifth Russian woman to rocket off the planet. She said she was surprised to be selected for the seat swap after encountering ""many tests and obstacles"" during her decade of training. ""But I did it. I'm lucky maybe. I'm strong,"" she said. As for the war in Ukraine, Mann said all four have put politics and personal beliefs aside, ""and it's really cool how the common mission of the space station just instantly unites us."" Added Cassada: ""We have an opportunity to be an example for society on how to work together and live together and explore together."" Elon Musk's SpaceX has now launched eight crews since 2020: six for NASA and two private groups. Boeing, NASA's other contracted taxi service, plans to make its first astronaut flight early next year, after delays to fix software and other issues that cropped up on test flights.",3,6.675674008173984,0.7465480752852388,5.929125932888745,6

The four crew members - astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada of NASA, astronaut Koichi Wakata of JAXA, or Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and cosmonaut Anna Kikina of Roscosmos - lifted off at noon from Kennedy Space Center. Dubbed Crew-5, the mission is the sixth astronaut flight launched as a joint endeavor between NASA and SpaceX, a privately held aerospace company, to the space station. The space flight marks a historic moment. Mann is not only the first Native American woman ever to travel to space, she's also the mission commander, making her the first woman ever to take on such a role for a SpaceX mission. What's more, Kikina is the first Russian to join a SpaceX mission as part of a ride-sharing deal NASA and Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, inked in July. Her participation in the flight is the latest clear signal that, despite mounting tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the decades-long US-Russia partnership in space will persist - at least for now. The spacecraft is aiming to dock with the space station on Thursday around 5 p.m. Who are the other astronauts on board? Mann and her fellow NASA astronaut Josh Cassada, who grew up in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, both joined NASA in 2013. Cassada has described Mann as one of his ""closest friends on the planet."" As with Mann, this mission is the first trip to space for Cassada and Kikina. For veteran astronaut Wakata, who has previously flown on both NASA's space shuttle and Russia's Soyuz spacecraft, this trip marks his fifth spaceflight mission. ""I still remember when I first flew and saw our beautiful home planet,"" he recalled during an August press conference. ""It was so wonderful, such a beautiful planet, then I felt very lucky to be able to call this planet our home."" What will they do in space? After reaching the ISS, the crew will join the seven astronauts already aboard the ISS - including four NASA astronauts, a European Space Agency astronaut, and two Russian cosmonauts. There will be a handover period, where the current ISS crew will help the newly arrived astronauts settle in before a separate Crew Dragon spacecraft brings the four astronauts who were part of SpaceX's Crew-4 mission back home. Then the Crew-5 astronauts will set to work conducting spacewalks, during which astronauts exit the ISS, to maintain the space station's exterior, as well as performing more than 200 science experiments. ""Experiments will include studies on printing human organs in space, understanding fuel systems operating on the Moon, and better understanding heart disease,"" according to NASA. Crew-5 is slated to return from space in about five months.",3,0.7881056791399208,7.552269940397835,-6.764164261257914,6

Olga Valeyeva — who won the Miss Crimea 2022 beauty pageant — and an unnamed friend sang the popular Ukrainian ""Chervona Kalyna"" song on a balcony. A video of the women singing was posted on Instagram stories, which auto-deletes after 24 hours. Crimean police said Valeyeva was fined 40,000 rubles (about $673), while her friend was given a 10-day prison sentence. ""A video was published on the internet in which two girls performed a song that is the fighting anthem of an extremist organization,"" the Interior Ministry of Crimea, a peninsula that Russia unilaterally annexed in 2014, said Monday on Telegram. It said a court found the women, born in 1987 and 1989, guilty of discrediting the Russian army and publicly demonstrating Nazi symbols. Russia, whose troops are fighting in Ukraine, often alleges that Kyiv's national symbols are extremist and Nazi-like. Crimean police also posted a video of the women apologizing for singing the song, blurring their faces. ""I did not know and did not realize that it had a nationalist character and definitely did not want to spread propaganda by singing it,"" one of the women said in the video. Valeyeva posted on Instagram earlier that she did not wish to ""harm anyone."" ""I didn't know that this song was connected with something and is somehow forbidden,"" she wrote. ""We just sang a Ukrainian song. We thought it was just a little song that we knew for a long time."" ""In Crimea, no one is punished for normal Ukrainian songs,"" Oleg Kriuchkov, an aide to the governor of occupied Crimea, said on Telegram. ""But no one will allow nationalist hymns to be sung here!"" Last month, the Moscow-installed head of the peninsula Sergei Aksyonov warned Crimeans that authorities would react ""harshly"" to such songs after Chervona Kalyna was played at a wedding. ""Singing such nationalist anthems — especially during the special military operation — will be punished,"" Aksyonov said in a video on Telegram in September, using Moscow's terminology to describe its military invasion of Ukraine. ""People who do this are acting like traitors,"" he added. Aksyonov said there was a special FSB security service group working on the matter. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 during a previous invasion, and has used the territory to launch attacks against the country in the current war. In August, explosions and fires ripped through an ammunition depot in Crimea, forcing the evacuation of more than 3,000 people.",17,5.440553883682304,5.570243018659737,-0.12968913497743362,29

Wearing futuristic SpaceX pressure suits, Anna Kikina, Russia's only active-duty female cosmonaut, Crew 5 commander Nicole Mann, Josh Cassada and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12 Eastern. Pushed skyward by 1.7 million pounds of thrust, the Falcon 9 arced away to the northeast trailing a brilliant jet of flame from its nine first stage engines, smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight. Nine minutes later, after dropping off its first stage for recovery on a landing barge, the Falcon 9's upper stage propelled the Crew Dragon — Endurance — out of the atmosphere and into low-Earth orbit, the first step in a 29-hour rendezvous with the space station. ""On behalf of the entire launch and recovery team, it's been an honor and a pleasure to be a part of this mission with you,"" radioed the SpaceX launch director. ""Godspeed, Endurance. Cheers."" ""Awesome!"" Mann replied from orbit. ""Thank you so much to the Falcon team. Whoo! That was a smooth ride up hill! We've got three rookies that are pretty happy to be floating in space right now, and one veteran astronaut who's happy to be back as well."" A few minutes later, Cassada showed off the crew's zero gravity indicator, a small Albert Einstein doll, complete with frizzy white hair. He said the mascot was chosen because of Einstein's insights about gravity, or the absence thereof, which helped pave the way to his theory of general relativity. SpaceX thanked him for the explanation, prompting Cassada to add ""my crewmates are just happy we didn't break out a dry erase board and get into more details."" Mann, a Marine Corps colonel and F/A-18 carrier pilot, is the first Native American woman to be assigned to a spaceflight. Cassada holds a doctorate in high energy physics, is a captain in the Navy and an accomplished pilot in his own right. Wakata, who holds a doctorate in aerospace engineering, is making his fifth spaceflight with a combined 347 days in orbit. The 38-year-old Kikina, like Mann and Cassada, is a space rookie, but like her U.S. crewmates, she's had years of training while waiting for a flight assignment. A last-minute switch from an expected Soyuz flight to the Crew Dragon caught her by surprise. ""My leaders just appoint me and told me, do you want to be part of Crew 5?,"" Kikina told reporters, speaking in broken English. ""Yes! Why not? But I was so surprised."" Her addition to Crew 5 was the result of a new agreement between NASA and the Russian space agency to resume launching U.S. astronauts aboard Soyuz spacecraft and to begin launching cosmonauts aboard American ferry ships. The idea is to ensure at least one American and one Russian are always on board the space station even if a medical emergency or some other issue forced one country's spacecraft to leave early, taking its crew along with it. Wednesday's launch marked the eighth piloted flight of a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, the 178th flight of a Falcon 9 rocket overall and the 44th so far this year. Kikina is the first Russian to fly aboard a U.S. spacecraft since December 2002 when cosmonauts Valery Korzun and Sergei Treschev returned to Earth aboard the space shuttle Endeavour. ""We have trained and prepared for years for this,"" Cassada said Saturday when the crew arrived in Florida for launch. ""I just can't tell you how grateful we are for this opportunity. Now it's time for us to go get to work on space station."" If all goes well, Mann and Cassada will monitor an automated rendezvous and approach to the space station, moving in for docking at the lab's forward port around 4:57 p.m. Thursday. Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew 4 commander Kjell Lindgren, Bob Hines, Jessica Watkins and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, the current station commander. They launched aboard a Crew Dragon last April. Also on board: cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitri Petelin and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, who arrived at the lab complex on September 21 aboard a Soyuz spacecraft. Kikina originally expected to fly aboard a Soyuz. But she was assigned to Crew 5 after NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed on a new seat-swap plan that has its roots in the very design of the space station. The Russians provide the propellant and propulsion needed to keep the 930,000-pound lab in orbit, countering the effects of atmospheric drag with periodic thruster firings. Russian thrusters also move the station out of the way when radar tracking indicates the possibility of a close encounter with space debris. For its part, NASA provides the lion's share of the lab's electrical power from eight huge solar wings, around-the-clock satellite communications and the stabilizing gyroscopes that help maintain the station's orientation. Neither side can operate the station on its own and the withdrawal of either partner would cripple, if not end the lab's useful life, at least in its current form. NASA, the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan want to operate the station through 2030 while transitioning to planned commercial research stations in low-Earth orbit. Russia never committed to an extension beyond 2024 and in the wake of sanctions imposed after the Ukraine invasion, it was unclear whether Russia would stick with the station past the previously agreed on 2024 target date. During a Crew 5 news briefing Monday, veteran cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, now director of human spaceflight with Roscosmos, said he expects a decision next year on extending ISS operations past 2024. ""On the Russian side, we understand that we extend our participation in the station with our government until 2024 and we start to think about designing and building (a) new station,"" he said, speaking in English. ""But we know that it's not going to happen very quick. ""So probably we will keep flying until we will have new infrastructure that allow us to do continuous human presence on low Earth orbit at least. So up to now, we keep flying together, we are going to fly until 2024 ... and we start to discuss extending our participation in ISS program with our government, and hope to have permission to continue next year."" In the meantime, Russia and the U.S. State Department signed off on the seat-swap agreement. ""With flight of Soyuz and flight of Crew 5, we will start what we call integrated crew, or exchange flight, when one crew member from Russian segment will fly on American vehicle and one American will fly on Russian vehicle,"" Krikalev said. ""And this type of exchange will increase the robustness of our program, and we will continue this practice to make our program more reliable."" Unlike earlier flights, which cost NASA up to $90 million per Soyuz seat, no money will change hands for future rides because the plan benefits both sides equally. Rubio and Kikina are the first to launch under the new seat-swap agreement. With a ready smile and an air of competence, Kikina cheerfully responds to questions from U.S. reporters. But she does not discuss Ukraine of U.S.-Russia relations. Asked if the topic ever came up during discussions with her NASA crewmates, she said ""no, never."" ""I am thinking a lot about my own tasks, about participation in the Crew Dragon 5 now,"" she said. ""And then, a lot of thinking about working on the station, because in Russia, I have a lot of training and practice about Russian station program."" Rubio was more forthcoming.

The 38-year-old Kikina, the only active-duty female in Russia's cosmonaut corps, will join Crew 5 commander Nicole Mann, Josh Cassada and Japanese veteran Koichi Wakata for blastoff from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 12 p.m. ET Wednesday. Forecasters predicted good weather locally, although mission managers were keeping close tabs on high winds and waves down range along the spacecraft's northeasterly trajectory over the Atlantic Ocean that could cause problems for booster recovery operations and abort scenarios. Mann, a Marine Corps colonel and F/A-18 carrier pilot, is the first native American woman to be assigned to a spaceflight. Cassada holds a doctorate in high energy physics and is an accomplished Navy pilot in his own right. Wakata, who holds a doctorate in aerospace engineering, is making his fifth spaceflight with a combined 347 days in orbit. ""Looking forward to launch tomorrow. Let's do this!"" Mann tweeted. Kikina, like Mann and Cassada, is a rookie, but like her U.S. crewmates, she's had years of training while waiting for a flight assignment. A last-minute switch from an expected Soyuz flight to the Crew Dragon caught her by surprise. ""My leaders just appoint me and told me, do you want to be part of Crew 5?,"" Kikina told reporters, speaking in broken English. ""Yes! Why not? But I was so surprised."" If all goes well, Mann and Cassada will monitor an automated rendezvous and approach to the space station, moving in for docking at the lab's forward port around 4:57 p.m. Thursday. Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew 4 commander Kjell Lindgren, Bob Hines, Jessica Watkins and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, the current station commander. They launched aboard a Crew Dragon last April and plan to return to Earth on October 13. Also awaiting Mann and her crewmates at the ISS: cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitri Petelin and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, who arrived at the lab complex on September 21 aboard a Soyuz spacecraft. Kikina originally expected to fly aboard a Soyuz. But she was assigned to Crew 5 after NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed on a new seat-swap plan intended to ensure at least one U.S. astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut are on board the station at all times. That way, if a medical emergency or some other issue forced a U.S. or Russian spacecraft to depart early, taking its crew with it, both nations would still have personnel on board to operate their respective systems. ""With flight of Soyuz and flight of Crew 5, we will start what we call integrated crew, or exchange flight, when one crew member from Russian segment will fly on American vehicle and one American will fly on Russian vehicle,"" veteran cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, now a senior Russian space manager, told reporters Monday. ""And this type of exchange will increase the robustness of our program, and we will continue this practice to make our program more reliable.""",3,0.1828812672165765,8.370419026813886,-8.18753775959731,6
2022-10-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-lyman-melitopol-mayor-fears-putin-nuclear-strike/,"As Ukraine retakes ground claimed by Russia, fear grows that Putin will lash out with nuclear weapons","Dnipro, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces recaptured the key city of Lyman over the weekend — a major crossroads in eastern Ukraine. Vladimir Putin's military has responded to its steady loss of ground with more long-range attacks, punishing Ukrainian civilians miles away from the front lines for their own troops' advances. When Ukrainian paratroopers swept into Lyman after a hard-fought battle, hoisting their country's flag over the town for the first time in months, it was one of the most significant victories of the war. Lyman is a major transport hub, and the city was used for months by Russia as a vital staging area to resupply its troops on the front lines. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy defiantly declared to his nation on Sunday night that their national flag would soon fly again over other regions, too. Even as he spoke, Ukrainian soldiers were advancing further into Russian-occupied regions in the south. Unverified social media posts suggested that Ukraine's defenders had pushed Russian forces back about 25 miles in a single day. The rapid-fire territorial takeover is slicing right into a huge swath of ground that Putin claimed as Russia's own on Friday. The unilateral annexation, following staged referendums in occupied territory, has gone unrecognized by virtually the entire world. It has been derided as an illegal land grab by the United Nations, Ukraine, the U.S. and many other countries. With it, Putin declared the four Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, all Russian soil. As Ukraine's forces push their gains in those regions, reclaiming territory, the mayor of one occupied city told CBS News he expects to see a massive escalation in the seven-month war. Ivan Federov, the exiled mayor of Russian-occupied Melitopol, in the Zaporizhzhia region, was kidnapped in the early days of the war but released in a prisoner swap. He said Putin's decision to declare the annexation of the four regions was a ""new level of aggression,"" and he believes the Russian strongman leader may well ""use nuclear weapons now on these territories."" ""I expect it,"" Federov said. ""He is crazy."" Fears of a tactical Russian nuclear strike — using small-scale atomic weapons to target a specific area — have put cities like Dnipro on edge. Russian forces have already stepped-up attacks on civilian targets in such places, west of the ground they hold. CBS News saw the vast crater left when a Russian missile slammed down recently in Dnipro, completely destroying a home in a residential neighbohood. It wasn't clear what the Russians could have been targeting. Neighbors told CBS News that a grandmother, a mother and two small children were killed as they slept. Tearful residents paid tributes, laying flowers and toys to remember the young lives taken in a seemingly random rocket attack, miles from the front line. Other Dnipro residents wandered around in shock and disbelief after the strike — and in fear, of where and when the next rockets might strike, and what they could be carrying.",14,7.234340606045543,0.9627459402255883,6.271594665819955,20
2022-10-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/ukraine-russia-troops-continue-offensive-claim-new-gains/,Ukraine claws back more territory in areas Russia is trying to absorb,"Ukrainian forces scored more gains in their counteroffensive across at least two fronts Monday, advancing in the very areas that Russia is trying to absorb and challenging Moscow's effort to engage fresh troops and its threats to defend incorporated areas by all means. In their latest breakthrough, Ukrainian forces penetrated Moscow's defenses in the strategic southern Kherson region, one of the four areas in Ukraine that Russia is in the process of annexing. Kyiv's troops also consolidated gains in the east and other major battlefields, re-establishing Ukrainian control just as Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to overcome problems with manpower, weapons, troop morale and logistics, along with intensifying domestic and international criticism. Putin faces disarray and anger domestically about his partial troop mobilization and confusion about the establishment of new Russian borders. Ukraine's advances have become so apparent that even Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov, who usually focuses on his military's successes and the enemy's losses, was forced to acknowledge it. ""With numerically superior tank units in the direction of Zolota Balka and Oleksandrivka, the enemy managed to forge deep into our defenses,"" Konashenkov said Monday, referring to two towns in the Kherson region. He coupled that with claims that Russian forces inflicted heavy losses on Ukraine's military. Ukrainian forces have struggled to retake the Kherson region due to its open terrain, in contrast to their successful breakout offensive in the northeast around the country's second-largest city of Kharkiv that began last month. Ukraine has pressed its counteroffensive in the Kherson region since the summer, relentlessly pummeling Russian supply lines and making inroads into Russian-held areas west of the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian military has used U.S.-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to repeatedly hit the main bridge across the Dnieper and a dam that served as a second crossing. It also has struck pontoon bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops. As the front lines shifted, Russia's lower house of parliament rubber-stamped annexation treaties for Ukraine's Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions to join Russia. The upper house will follow suit Tuesday. This follows annexation referendums that the Kremlin orchestrated last week that the U.N. chief and Western nations have said were illegal and fraudulent. Russia's moves to incorporate the Ukrainian regions, as well as Putin's effort to mobilize more troops, have been done so hastily that government officials have struggled to explain and implement them. On Monday, the issue was basic: Exactly what areas of Ukraine is Russia trying to incorporate? Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Donetsk and Luhansk are joining Russia with the same administrative borders that existed before a conflict erupted there in 2014 between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces. But he added that the borders of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are still undecided. ""We will continue to discuss that with residents of those regions,"" Peskov said. A senior Russian lawmaker offered a different view. Pavel Krasheninnikov said Zaporizhzhia will be absorbed within its ""administrative borders,"" meaning Moscow plans to incorporate parts of the region still under Kyiv's control. He said similar logic will apply to Kherson, but that Russia will include two districts of the neighboring Mykolaiv region that are now occupied by Russia. In addition to the Kherson areas that Russia's Defense Ministry cited, other sources showed Ukrainian flags, soldiers deployed or other signs that Kyiv's forces had retaken the villages of Arkhanhelske, Myroliubivka, Khreshchenivka, Mykhalivka and Novovorontsovka. There was no immediate confirmation from Kyiv on the gains. The situation in the regional capital, also called Kherson, was so precarious that Russian authorities are restricting people from leaving, Ukraine's presidential office said. A Russian-installed official in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, acknowledged that the Ukrainian forces ""have broken through a little deeper"" but insisted that ""everything is under control"" and that Russia's ""defense system is working."" Still, Russia claimed some success at pushing back. The Moscow-appointed chief of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said Ukrainian troops tried to advance toward Dudchany along the Dnieper's western bank, seeking to reach a key dam at Nova Kakhovka, but that Russian warplanes destroyed two Ukrainian battalions and halted the offensive. Saldo also said Russian forces fended off Ukraine's attempted inroads into the Kherson region from Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih. Neither Saldo's nor Stremousov's claims could be independently verified. Ukraine reported advances in other areas Russia is annexing. The Ukrainian governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said Kyiv's forces retook the village of Torske, 12 miles from the city of Kreminna. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the area is ""key for controlling the entire Luhansk region, because further beyond (the city) the Russians don't have any more lines of defenses."" ""Retaking this city opens up operational space for Ukrainians to rapidly advance to the very state border with Russia,"" Zhdanov told The Associated Press. He said Russian troops had retreated from the Kharkiv region. Ukraine's army reportedly liberated most of Borova in the Kharkiv region across the Oskil River, 31 miles north of the city of Lyman. Officials posted a video while driving along recaptured streets, waving the Ukrainian flag. ""Finally, you are home. Finally, it's Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"" an onlooker yelled. Elsewhere in the Kharkiv region, a doctor was killed and nurse wounded in a Russian missile attack on a hospital in Kupiansk that caused major damage, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported. Last week, at least 24 civilians were killed in an attack on a convoy trying to flee Kupiansk. Ukraine also has retaken Lyman, a strategic eastern city that the Russians had used as a key logistics and transport hub. Lyman is in the Donetsk region near the border with Luhansk. Ukraine's push to recapture territory has embarrassed the Kremlin and prompted rare domestic criticism of Putin's war. Tens of thousands of Russian men have fled Russia since the Sept. 21 call-up. Many flew to Turkey, one of the few countries maintaining air links with Russia. Others have left in cars, creating long traffic jams at the Russian borders with Georgia, Kazakhstan and Finland. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said Monday that the director general of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant — Europe's largest — had been released from Russian custody. Russian forces had blindfolded and detained Ihor Murashov on Friday for questioning.",14,1.2363249013196194,0.4432020211933443,0.7931228801262751,0

Bombardments have intensified as Moscow illegally annexed a swath of Ukrainian territory in a sharp escalation of the war. Kharkiv region Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said the convoy was struck in the Kupiansy district, calling the attack on people who were trying to flee the area to avoid being shelled ""сruelty that can't be justified."" Russian forces have not acknowledged or commented on the attack, apparently the second in two days to hit a humanitarian convoy. Russian troops have retreated from much of the Kharkiv region after a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive last month but continued to shell the area The attack comes at a pivotal moment in Russian President Vladimir Putin's war. Facing a Ukrainian counteroffensive, Putin this week heightened threats of nuclear force and used his most aggressive, anti-Western rhetoric to date. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his military vowed to keep fighting to liberate the annexed regions and other Russian-occupied areas. Ukrainian officials said Saturday that their forces had surrounded thousands of Russian forces holding the strategic eastern city of Lyman, which is located in one of the four incorporated areas. Zelenskyy formally applied Friday for Ukraine to join NATO, increasing pressure on Western allies to help defend the country. Also Saturday Ukraine's nuclear power provider said that Russian forces blindfolded and detained the head of Europe's largest nuclear plant. It appeared to be an attempt to secure Moscow's hold on the newly annexed territory. Russian forces seized the director-general of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Ihor Murashov, around 4 p.m. Friday, Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom said. That was just hours after Putin signed treaties to absorb Moscow-controlled Ukrainian territory into Russia, including the area around the nuclear plant. Energoatom said Russian troops stopped Murashov's car, blindfolded him and then took him to an undisclosed location. Russia did not immediately acknowledge seizing the plant director. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which has staff at the plant, said it was aware of the reports of Murashov's capture, and had contacted Russian authorities for clarification on what happened. ""His detention by (Russia) jeopardizes the safety of Ukraine and Europe's largest nuclear power plant,"" said Energoatom President Petro Kotin said, demanding the director's immediate release. The power plant repeatedly has been caught in the crossfire of the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian technicians continued running it after Russian troops seized the power station, and its last reactor was shut down in September as a precautionary measure amid ongoing shelling nearby. Amid growing international sanctions and condemnation of Russia, a Ukrainian counteroffensive that has embarrassed the Kremlin appeared on the verge of retaking more ground. A Ukrainian official said Saturday that the Russian-occupied city of Lyman was surrounded, with some 5,000 Russian forces trapped there. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai claimed that all routes to resupply Russian forces in Lyman were blocked. ""The occupiers asked their leadership for the opportunity to leave, which they refused,"" Haidai said in a television interview. ""Now they have three options: to try to break through, to surrender or to die together."" His claims could not immediately be verified. Russia has not confirmed its forces were cut off, and Russian analysts had said Moscow was sending more troops to the area. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said Ukraine likely will retake Lyman in the coming days.",14,0.6643033518013463,5.93181494199774,-5.267511590196394,17

His hands were bound. His head was covered by a plastic bag, and the packing tape holding it in place was secured so tightly it it caused welts on his forehead. Drueke said he and fellow American prisoner Andy Huynh reached their limit in this state during the transit, which occurred in a series of vehicles from eastern Ukraine to an airport in Russia that was surrounded by armed guards. ""For all we went through and all the times we thought we might die, we accepted that we might die, we were ready to die when it came, that ride was the only time that each of us independently prayed for death just to get it over with,"" Drueke told The Associated Press in an interview Friday. ""The mental and emotional torture of those last 24 hours in captivity, that was the worst,"" he said. Drueke, 40, is healing: The swelling is going down on his head and he's trying to regain some of the 30 pounds he figures he lost eating a poor diet. But awful memories remain, and he's unsure what comes next aside from trying to focus attention on fellow prisoners who remain in Russian hands. ""The war has not ended,"" he said, speaking at the home he shares with his mother and other relatives in Tuscaloosa. Drueke and Huynh, a 27-year-old fellow military veteran from Alabama, were among hundreds of Americans who went to Ukraine early on to help in the fight against Russia. On June 9, they were captured during what Drueke described as a reconnaissance mission associated with Ukraine's international legion, composed of foreign volunteers. ""Everyone else managed to make it back to the base safe,"" he said. Russian soldiers took the two men to their camp, and then into Russia for ""intensive interrogation,"" Drueke said. While declining to go into specifics, Drueke said the treatment was brutal. ""Every one of our human rights were violated,"" he said. ""We were tortured."" The men were taken back to Ukraine to a ""black site"" in Donetsk for nearly a month of additional interrogation, he said. They were eventually taken to an isolation cellblock within a former Ukrainian prison. There, Drueke and Huynh were forced to record propaganda statements for a Russian video camera with soldiers in the room. ""On the positive side, there were times they would put us in a closet, bound and blindfolded, ... while they were waiting for whatever reporter to show up, and it gave Andy and I just a few seconds to whisper things back and forth to check in on each other,"" he said. ""It was the first time we had talked in weeks at that point."" Eventually, after weeks of confinement that included multiple threats, it became apparent that something — either a release, a prison transfer or execution — was in the works, said Drueke, who joined the U.S. Army Reserve after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and served two tours in Iraq. ""We knew something was happening because our normal routine was being skewed and they were having us clear all of our personal stuff out of the cell,"" he said. But even then, the mental torture continued, he said. ""One of the guards said a couple of times, 'I'm pretty sure you guys are getting executed,'"" he said. Instead, they were part of a group of 10 men who were released Sept. 21 in a deal brokered by Saudi Arabia. The others who were released with them were from Croatia, Morocco, Sweden and the United Kingdom. No one relaxed until the plane was in the air and an official from Saudi Arabia explained what was happening, he said. Landing in New York after a flight from Saudi Arabia, Drueke said he and Huynh were met by a Homeland Security official from an office that investigates war crimes. Press aides with Homeland Security didn't immediately return an email seeking comment, but the U.N. human rights investigators have said Ukrainian prisoners of war appear to be facing ""systematic"" mistreatment by Russian captors that includes torture.",13,3.1238132463538464,6.588540851778963,-3.4647276054251166,2
2022-10-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/crew-florida-for-launch-to-international-space-station-nasa-russia-japan/,Crew flies to Florida ahead of launch to International Space Station,"Two NASA astronauts, a Japanese space veteran, and Russia's lone female cosmonaut, flew to the Kennedy Space Center Saturday to prepare for launch Wednesday on a flight to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. Their Falcon 9 rocket was rolled to the top of historic pad 39A before dawn Saturday and rotated vertical just after 12 p.m. Eastern. A few minutes later, Crew 5 commander Nicole Mann, Josh Cassada, Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata and cosmonaut Anna Kikina landed on the spaceport runway after a flight from Houston to begin final preparations. ""First of all, my prayers and thoughts go out to all the people in Florida who are affected by the devastating hurricane,"" Wakata said. ""I hope with this launch, we will brighten up the skies over Florida a little bit for everyone."" The astronauts plan to don their pressure suits and strap into the Crew Dragon spacecraft Sunday morning for a dress-rehearsal countdown. Later in the day, SpaceX engineers plan to test fire the Falcon 9's first stage engines to verify their readiness for flight. If all goes well, Mann and her crewmates will strap in for real around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday to brace for launch just after 12 p.m., the moment the Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit. It will take the crew about 29 hours to catch up with the lab complex, moving in for an automated docking at the station's forward port around 5 a.m. Thursday. Standing by to welcome them on board will be Expedition 68 commander Samantha Cristoforetti and her Crew 4 crewmates — Kjell Lindgren, Bob Hines and Jessica Watkins — along with Soyuz MS-22/68S crew members Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitri Petelin and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, who arrived at the station Sept. 21. Wakata is making his fifth space flight, while Mann, Cassada and Kikina, the first Russian cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon, are space rookies. Rubio's addition to the Soyuz crew, and Kikina's addition to Crew 5, were the result of a recent agreement between NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, that's designed to ensure at least one U.S. astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut are aboard the station at all times. Without such an agreement, a medical emergency — or some other problem that might force a Crew Dragon or Soyuz to depart early — could leave the station with an all-Russian or all-NASA-sponsored crew without the expertise to operate the other nation's systems. Kikina said she was thrilled by the opportunity. ""I want to share with you my feelings,"" she said in broken English. ""I really want to say, from my side, and to everybody who made for me that unbelievable, incredible opportunity to be a part of our joint, big something, for all of us. And to be a part of that great, for me, maybe for you also, Crew 5. I really love my crewmates, I really feel comfortable."" Kikina, who joined the Roscosmos Cosmonaut Corps in 2012, said she was stunned when told she was being assigned to Crew 5. ""My leaders just appoint me and told me, do you want to be part of Crew 5? Yes. Why not? But I was so surprised.""",3,5.080978646325805,4.449263100056952,0.6317155462688531,6

""The official was blindfolded, with pressure applied to both his hands and head so he was unable to move while being detained, and then he was questioned in an overbearing way,"" Matsuno said. Japan ""strongly protests these unbelievable acts"", he said, denying the espionage allegations. The diplomat has been released and will leave Russia by Wednesday, he added. Japan summoned the Russian ambassador and ""demanded a formal apology"" for the treatment of the diplomat, which Matsuno said violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Russia said Monday that it had detained a Japanese consulate official based in the eastern city of Vladivostok for soliciting ""restricted"" information, according to Russian news agencies. ""A Japanese diplomat was detained red-handed while receiving, in exchange for financial reward, restricted information about Russia's cooperation with another country in the Asia-Pacific region,"" the FSB, the KGB's successor agency, was cited as saying through its press service, without specifying the third country. The FSB identified the official as Tatsunori Motoki, accusing him of seeking out information on ""the impact of Western sanctions"" on the surrounding Primoriye region, according to news agencies. The FSB distributed a short video it said showed the diplomat acknowledging that he had violated Russian laws, and reportedly said Moscow had lodged a protest with Tokyo through diplomatic channels. Russia considers Japan to be a ""hostile"" country -- a designation it shares with all European Union countries, the United States and its allies, including Britain and Australia. Tokyo had complex relations with Moscow before the invasion of Ukraine in February, and the two sides have yet to sign a post-World War II peace treaty. Attempts to do so have been hampered by a long-running dispute over islands controlled by Russia, which calls them the Kurils. In its latest sanctions, Japan's government on Monday banned the export of materials that may be used for chemical weapons to 21 Russian organizations, including science laboratories. The measure was approved by the Cabinet following a decision by Group of Seven foreign ministers last week.

The shooting comes after scattered arson attacks on enlistment offices and protests in Russian cities against the call-up that have resulted in at least 2,000 arrests. Russia is seeking to bolster its military as its Ukraine offensive has bogged down and sapped its forces. In the attack in the Siberian city of Ust-Ilimsk, 25-year-old local resident Ruslan Zinin walked into the enlistment office saying ""no one will go to fight"" and ""we will all go home now,"" according to local media reports.

A witness quoted by local news site said Zinin was in a room of people called up to fight. Troops from his region were scheduled to head to military bases Tuesday. Concerns are growing that Russia may seek to escalate the conflict - including potentially using nuclear weapons - once it completes what Ukraine and the West see as illegal referendums in parts of Ukraine under its control. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told 60 Minutes the Kremlin has a nuclear ""chain of command"" but it's uncertain whether anyone would tell Russian President Vladimir Putin ""no"" if he decides to launch a nuclear weapon. ""And that is the Achilles heel of autocracies anywhere,"" the secretary of state said. ""…There is usually not anyone who has the capacity or the will to speak truth to power. And part of the reason, I think, Russia has gotten itself into the mess that it's in is because there is no one in the system to effectively tell Putin he's doing the wrong thing."" Blinken said Putin's rhetoric is ""irresponsible"" and added that the U.S. expressed their concerns to Russia about its threats. ""We're focused on making sure that we're all acting responsibly, especially when it comes to this kind of loose rhetoric,"" Blinken told Pelley. ""We have been very clear with the Russians publicly and, as well as, privately to stop the loose talk about nuclear weapons."" The voting, in which residents are asked whether they want their regions to become part of Russia, began last week and ends Tuesday, in conditions that are anything but free or fair. Thousands of residents had already fled the regions amid months of incessant fighting, and images shared by those who remained have showed armed Russian troops going door-to-door to pressure Ukrainians into casting a ballot. ""Every night and day there is inevitable shelling in the Donbas, under the roar of which people are forced to vote for Russian 'peace,'"" Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kirilenko said Monday. Russia is widely expected to declare the results in its favor, a step that could see Moscow annex the territory and give it the pretext to defend it as its own territory under the Russian nuclear umbrella. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that no date has been set for recognizing the regions as part of Russia, but it could be a question of days. On Monday, Putin and Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko held an unannounced meeting in the southern Russian city of Sochi and said they were ready to cooperate with the West - ""if they treat us with respect,"" Putin said. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Monday that Putin had told Turkey's president during their meeting in Uzbekistan last week that Moscow was ready to resume negotiations with Ukraine but had ""new conditions"" for a cease-fire. The minister didn't elaborate on the conditions. The Kremlin last week announced a partial mobilization - its first since World War II - to add at least 300,000 troops to its force in Ukraine. The move, a sharp shift from Putin's previous efforts to portray the war as a limited military operation that wouldn't interfere with most Russians' lives, proved unpopular at home. Thousands of men of fighting age flocked to airports and Russia's land border crossings in an effort to avoid being called up. Protests erupted in various parts of the country, and Russian media reported an increasing number of arson attacks on military enlistment offices, including one that hit the southern city of Uryupinsk on Monday. Meanwhile, the first batches of Russian troops mobilized by Moscow have begun to arrive at military bases, the British military said Monday. In an online intelligence briefing, the British Defense Ministry said tens of thousands had been called up so far. Under normal circumstances, two battalions deploy while a third remains behind to train. But in the Ukraine war, even the third battalion is deploying, weakening that training, the British Defense Ministry said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Facebook post Monday that the Ukrainian military is pushing efforts to take back ""the entire territory of Ukraine,"" and has drawn up plans to counter ""new types of weapons"" used by Russia, without elaborating. An overnight drone strike near the Ukrainian port of Odesa sparked a massive fire and explosion, the military said Monday. It was the latest in a series of drone attacks on the key southern city in recent days, and hit a military installation and detonated ammunition when it struck. Firefighters struggled to contain the blaze, and civilians nearby were evacuated, the Ukrainian military's southern command said. New Russian shelling struck the area around the Zaporozhzhia nuclear power plant, according to Zelenskyy's office. Cities near the station were fired on nine times in recent hours by rocket launchers and heavy artillery. In the town of Izium in eastern Ukraine, which Russian forces left earlier this month after a Ukrainian counteroffensive, Margaryta Tkachenko is still reeling from the battle that destroyed her home and left her family close to starvation. With no gas, electricity, running water or internet, she said, ""I can't predict what will happen next. Winter is the most frightening. We have no wood. How will we heat?""",14,2.936625011861838,1.239387270518172,1.697237741343666,19

But the move has not gone down well. In the hours after Putin made the announcement, thousands of Russians in cities across the country defied the country's blanket ban on unauthorized demonstrations to take to the streets in protest. More than 1,000 were arrested, according to an independent Russian monitoring group. And while the Kremlin denies any exodus is taking place, there has been clear evidence of Russians, mostly men of fighting age, clambering to flee their country to avoid fighting in Putin's war in Ukraine. As CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports, Russian men, reservists between the ages of 18 and 50 from across the country, started receiving summons calling them up to report for military duty within hours of Putin making the announcement on Wednesday. Video has shown young men boarding buses, bidding hasty goodbyes and tearful farewells to their families as they head off to training camps. For their loved ones left behind, there's just the cold grip of fear. Putin's professional soldiers have not fared well recently on the battlefields of northeast Ukraine, where they've lost a huge swath of the territory they occupied quickly after the invasion began on February 24. Russian officials say the country has lost an estimated 6,000 soldiers, but the U.S. military estimates that close to 80,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured during the war. Ukraine has sustained huge casualties, too, with a commander putting the figure at about 9,000 a month ago. But the counteroffensive launched by Ukrainian forces in and around the country's second largest city of Kharkiv just a few weeks ago has sent Russian forces scurrying — and it has lent significant momentum to Ukraine's war effort. Many Russians, who still rely heavily on the country's state-controlled media for their information, won't have a full picture of the circumstances on the ground across the border in Ukraine. But the Kremlin's effort to obscure the truth seemingly failed to stem a rush for the border this week upon news of the call-up of reservists. Flights out of the country have been booked solid for a couple days as Russians try to escape conscription. ""That's why I'm here,"" a Russian passenger who identified himself only as Alex said after stepping off a plane Thursday in Istanbul, Turkey. ""Not many Russian people want to fight and join the army."" Land border exits from Russia into neighboring Georgia, Finland and Serbia have also seen traffic backed up in recent days. In the remote far east of Russia, however, one long line that formed at the end of this week was of new conscripts — men who have either been willing, or simply unable to dodge the war — boarding military planes. Many of the reservists getting summons this week have never fought in a war, let alone one that has already put Russia's hardened fighters on the backfoot. Ukraine's soldiers may be outgunned and outmanned by Russia, but Ukrainian Special Forces Senior Lieutenant Taras Berezovets, who led the counteroffensive in one part of the Kharkiv region, told Patta that his men are more nimble, and they have a vital advantage: technology. Satellite communication devices provided to Ukraine by its Western backers have been used by the country's troops to communicate anywhere, anytime, and without being easily detected. It has given them a modern warfare edge over the invading forces. Berezovets said the technology had ""never been seen before"" on the battlefields of Russia's war on his country, and ""it played one of the key roles in the battle for Kharkiv region."" It was ""one of the reasons why Russians lost, because they are completely outdated,"" he told Patta. But Ukraine's leaders and its troops know the war is still far from over. It could, in fact, be about to escalate. On Friday, the de-facto administrations in four Ukrainian regions still occupied by Russia — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — began holding referendums, asking residents if they want their hometowns to become part of Russia. The voting staged by Russia in the occupied territories is certain to go Moscow's way, and the results will give Putin an excuse to unilaterally annex the regions, just like he did with Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Virtually no nations have recognized that land grab as legitimate under international law in the ensuing eight years, and virtually no nations are likely to recognize the new land grab Russia is orchestrating this week as legitimate, either. Speaking Thursday at the United Nations, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken ridiculed the votes as ""sham referenda."" But once they've taken place, it's expected that Putin will quickly declare the four Ukrainian regions Russian territory, and he could use that as a pretext to claim that Ukraine's forces, as they battle to reclaim occupied ground, are attacking Russia. The Russian president, when he announced his partial military mobilization earlier this week, said he was prepared to resort to more deadly weapons in his arsenal, which includes nuclear weapons that could be used in local or regional tactical strikes. ""Our country also has various means of destruction,"" Putin threatened. ""And when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal. It's not a bluff.""",14,1.3385127170098288,5.623801596837887,-4.285288879828058,20

""There were some significant impacts,"" said Amanda Harrison, a spokeswoman for Wheat Ridge. ""We are working with sophisticated foreign agents from eastern Europe or Russia,"" she told CBS4. The Wheat Ridge hack was discovered on Aug. 29 causing the city to take down its phone and email systems, some payment systems and police records have not been immediately available to the public, according to Harrison. She said the attackers have captured some city data but, ""the investigation into what data they took from our system is still being investigated."" The FBI and state of Colorado have assisted in addressing the hack. While the hackers demanded $5 million in ransom, the city has opted not to pay any ransom, choosing to try to circumvent the attack and restore network systems on their own. Harrison said city staffers and IT consultants have been able to restore most services and citizens likely aren't noticing any change. The city said it does not believe the hackers got into the system through a city employee error, but computer security is being beefed up, said Harrison. The attackers utilized BlackCat ransomware, which is the same ransomware that was deployed in Fremont County in southern Colorado on Aug. 17. Fremont County Emergency Manager Mykel Kroll was blunt in his assessment of what the hackers have done: ""Everything was impacted. I hope we never have to go through this again."" He told CBS4 no ransom has been paid in the data breach but he said personal information for some county employees and members of the public might have been seized by the hackers. The Fremont County Sheriff's Office says some jail inmate data ""has been deemed unrecoverable."" The county website was taken down and Kroll said supply chain issues were slowing the effort to get everything back up and running. Vikki Migoya with the Denver FBI field office said she could not discuss either of the recent cyber attacks.

Ron DeSantis on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at governments in China, Iran, Russia, Cuba and ""others hostile to American interests,"" as he pointed to concerns about issues such as cybersecurity. DeSantis, who is running for re-election in November, said he also will ask lawmakers in 2023 to make changes in state law that would further block business activities in Florida by those governments. ""I think we've stood strong against this type of ideology in a variety of ways, and this just continues us on that course,"" DeSantis said during an event at Miami Dade College's Wolfson Campus that focused heavily on China. The executive order, in part, bars the state and local governments from procuring or using technology services that any federal agency has prohibited based on national-security concerns. The order also directs the state Department of Management Services to take steps to ensure commodities and services used by the state and local governments are not susceptible to exploitation by ""foreign countries of concern."" ""This will prevent the exposure of Floridians' personal information and technology systems in Florida to foreign entities and bad actors,"" DeSantis said.

The mobilization will see military reserves sent to the front lines of Putin's war on neighboring Ukraine — the same front line that recently fell apart in the face of a Ukrainian counteroffensive. After humiliating losses on the battlefields around Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta got a rare look at just how Putin's demoralized troops are performing on the ground. Even the Russians' most heavily fortified base in the occupied northeast region of Kharkiv collapsed in a matter of hours as Ukraine's troops laid siege. Senior Lieutenant Taras Berezovets, of Ukraine's Bohun Special Forces Brigade, led the six-day assault in the area, which he says was a breaking point. ""If the Ukrainian army failed here, I think the whole offensive was endangered,"" he told CBS News. In their line of fire, a Russian base called ""Muskva,"" or Moscow, in the small village of Nova Husarivka. It's where Russian troops had set up their regional headquarters, but looking around the base now, Patta said they appeared to have fled in such a hurry that it resembled a museum of panic. Cards from a game of poker interrupted by the Ukrainian offensive still lay on a table where they were abandoned. Military rations, gas masks, musical instruments — all left in situ. It appears that the commanders were among the first to flee, abandoning their troops at a nearby camp. Patta walked down the long line of a Russian trench dug near the base, where Putin's forces had settled down and held their ground for more than six months. They left it perfectly preserved. A pot of food, a fur coat, religious icons and an ancient typewriter were all abandoned as the soldiers fled. ""Ukrainian forces effectively attacked the Russians,"" Berezovets told Patta. ""Not from the front… they've been outflanked."" ""They were fleeing from here just like rats,"" he boasted. The Russians who held the ground in the area were supposed to be one of their country's elite units, including many paratroopers. The men Putin is now drafting to the front lines are far less inexperienced soldiers, some of whom have never fought in a war. With his partial mobilization of Russia's military, Putin could see 300,000 men summoned to join the fight. Some Russians have already received summons to report for military duty, and any reservists with medical expertise have been told to report immediately. It has proven a deeply unpopular move, sparking nationwide protests that saw more than 1,300 people arrested in the hours immediately after Putin made the announcement, according to independent Russian monitoring group OVD-Info. CBS News has been told that Ukraine captured hundreds of Russian soldiers during the offensive around Kharkiv. They will no doubt be used in prisoner swaps like the most recent one, which secured the release of more than 200 people who had fought for Ukraine, including two American men.",14,7.172982238835054,2.7894982111126874,4.383484027722367,20
2022-09-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/ukraine-war-american-veterans-alex-drueke-andy-huynh-released/,"2 American veterans captured in Ukraine released, their families say","Two U.S. military veterans who disappeared while fighting Russia with Ukrainian forces have been released after about three months in captivity, relatives said Wednesday. Alex Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, went missing in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine near the Russian border June 9. Both had traveled to Ukraine on their own and became friends because both are from Alabama. The families announced their release in a joint statement from Dianna Shaw, an aunt of Drueke. ""They are safely in the custody of the U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia and after medical checks and debriefing they will return to the states,"" the statement said. Shaw said both men have spoken with relatives in the United States and are in ""pretty good shape,"" according to an official with the U.S. embassy. The Saudi embassy released a statement saying it had mediated the release of 10 prisoners from Morocco, the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Croatia. Shaw confirmed that Drueke and Huynh were part of the group. The United Kingdom confirmed that five British nationals had been released, and lawmaker Robert Jenrick said one of them was Aiden Aslin, 28, who had been sentenced to death after he was captured in eastern Ukraine. ""Aiden's return brings to an end months of agonising uncertainty for Aiden's loving family in Newark who suffered every day of Aiden's sham trial but never lost hope. As they are united as a family once more, they can finally be at peace,"" Jenrick tweeted. British Prime Minister Liz Truss heralded the release on social media. ""Hugely welcome news that five British nationals held by Russian-backed proxies in eastern Ukraine are being safely returned, ending months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families,"" she tweeted. In a statement late Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the news. ""The United States is appreciative of Ukraine including all prisoners of war, regardless of nationality, in its negotiations, and we look forward to these U.S. citizens being reunited with their families,"" he wrote. ""We also thank our Saudi partners for helping to spearhead this humanitarian initiative and facilitating the return of ten foreign nationals, including the two U.S. citizens greeted earlier today by our embassy team in Riyadh."" Blinken reiterated the dangers of traveling to Ukraine and joining the war there. ""Americans who travel to Ukraine to participate in the fighting there face significant risks and the United States cannot guarantee their safety,"" he said. ""We encourage U.S. citizens to devote their energies towards the many other opportunities that exist to help the country of Ukraine and its people."" Russian state television had previously said Drueke and Huynh were being held by Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The U.S. does not recognize the sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and has no diplomatic relations with them, which made it necessary for others to lead efforts to get the men released. Drueke joined the Army at age 19 after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and he believed he could help Ukrainian fighters because of his training and experience with weapons, Shaw said previously. Drueke pondered whether to go for a few weeks, she said, and then made up his mind and left in mid-April. Druke's mother received a call from Saudi Arabia on Wednesday morning and an embassy worker handed the phone to the man, Shaw said. ""He got on the phone and said, 'Hi mom, it's your favorite child,'"" she said. Huynh moved to north Alabama two years ago from his native California and lives about 120 miles (193 kilometers) from Drueke. Before leaving for Europe, Huynh told his local newspaper, The Decatur Daily, he couldn't stop thinking about Russia's invasion. ""I know it wasn't my problem, but there was that gut feeling that I felt I had to do something,"" Huynh told the paper. ""Two weeks after the war began, it kept eating me up inside and it just felt wrong. I was losing sleep. ... All I could think about was the situation in Ukraine."" Huynh told his fiancée he wants a meal from McDonald's and a Pepsi-Cola when he returns home, Shaw said. The two men bonded over their home state and were together when their unit came under heavy fire. Relatives spoke with Drueke several times by phone while the two were being held. One member of their squadron told CBS News this summer that they were all nearly killed by a Russian vehicle, when Drueke and Huynh destroyed it with a rocket-propelled grenade, saving their lives. The Kremlin had said it didn't know anything about Americans being held by Russia. But during a TV segment, a host on a Russian state media video could be heard mocking the families as images of the two appeared in the background. Drueke's mother previously told ""CBS Mornings"" that her son ""felt very strongly that Putin needed to be stopped, because he said Putin is not going to be satisfied with just part of Ukraine, or even all of Ukraine.""",13,2.5786155394160235,7.893850001233955,-5.315234461817932,2
2022-09-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/nasa-astronaut-joins-russian-cosmonauts-flight-space-station/,"Despite tensions, NASA astronaut joins Russian cosmonauts for flight to space station","Despite severely strained U.S.-Russian foreign relations, an American astronaut joined two Russian cosmonauts aboard a Soyuz spacecraft in Kazakhstan and rocketed into orbit Wednesday on a two-orbit flight to the International Space Station. With commander Sergey Prokopyev at the controls, flanked on the left by co-pilot Dmitry Petelin and on the right by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, the Soyuz 2.1a rocket roared to life at 9:54 a.m. ET (6:54 p.m. local time) and smoothly climbed away from its firing stand at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. All three crew members appeared relaxed in cockpit video as they monitored their instruments, marking off milestones on the way to orbit. Eight minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff, the Soyuz separated from the booster's third stage, solar panels unfolded and the spacecraft set off after the space station. The launching was timed to enable a fast-track two-orbit rendezvous procedure, allowing Prokopyev and his crewmates to catch up with the orbital outpost a little more than three hours after launch. The rendezvous went off without a hitch, and the Soyuz glided in for a docking at the Rassvet module's Earth-facing port at 1:06 p.m. ET. ""We had a spectacular view of the #Soyuz launch!"" station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti tweeted. ""Sergey, Dmitry and Frank will come knocking on our door in just a couple of hours ... looking forward to welcoming them to their new home!"" Standing by to welcome them aboard were Expedition 67 commander Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov, who launched last March aboard the Soyuz MS-21/67S ferry ship. Also on board the ISS: SpaceX Crew 4 commander Kjell Lindgren and his three crewmates, Robert Hines, Jessica Watkins and Cristoforetti, a European Space Agency astronaut. Rubio will be part of the U.S.-sponsored crew complement, although he will remain a member of the Soyuz MS-22/68S crew. His seat is the first under a new agreement between NASA and the Russian space agency to resume launching astronauts aboard the Soyuz and to begin carrying cosmonauts aboard SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. The goal is to ensure one crew member from each country is always on board the station even if a Soyuz or NASA ferry ship is forced to depart early in an emergency, taking its crew back to Earth along with it. ""From the ISS side, I think it is very important in that it gives us redundancy and the ability to respond to unforeseen circumstances,"" Rubio said in a pre-launch interview with CBS News. ""Essentially, it gives us a backup plan."" The arrival of the new Soyuz crew sets up a carefully choreographed sequence to replace all seven members of the station's current crew. If all goes well, Artemyev, Korsakov and Matveev will return to Earth on Sept. 29, landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan to wrap up a 194-day mission. Four days later, the Crew Dragon Endurance is scheduled for launch from Florida carrying Crew 5 commander Nicole Mann, pilot Josh Cassada, Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata and Russian cosmonaut Anna Kikina. Including a piloted test flight, the launching will mark SpaceX's seventh crewed station mission. After a weeklong handover to help familiarize their replacements with station operations, Lindgren, Hines, Watkins and Cristoforetti will undock and return to Earth on Oct. 10 aboard their own Crew Dragon – Freedom – to close out a 166-day mission that began with launch last April. Kikina is the first cosmonaut to be assigned to a Crew Dragon flight and the first to ride an American spacecraft since December 2002 when the shuttle Endeavour carried one cosmonaut up to the station and brought two others back to Earth. Kikina will live and work in the Russian segment, although she'll remain a member of the SpaceX crew. Russian Soyuz spacecraft carried joint crews to the lab complex between the shuttle's retirement in 2011 and the debut of SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which began carrying astronauts to orbit in 2020. Those seats cost NASA up to $90 million each. For the past two years, NASA managers worked with their Russian counterparts to hammer out an agreement to begin bartered seat swaps, launching one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz going to station and one cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon. No money would changes hands because both sides benefit. Because crews must launch and land on the same vehicle, a medical emergency or some other major problem could force one crew to leave the station and return to Earth earlier than planned. The seat swap agreement ensures that at least one NASA astronaut and one cosmonaut are on board station at all times to operate their respective systems. The Russians provide the propellant and rocket power needed to keep the station in orbit and to dodge space debris while NASA provides most of the lab's electrical power, near-continuous communications and the massive gyroscopes that keep the outpost properly oriented. Crews are not cross-trained to operate each other's systems. Kikina is the first cosmonaut to fly under the recently signed seat swap agreement while Rubio is the first American to ride a Soyuz since astronaut Mark Vande Hei took off on a station flight in April 2021. The agreement took longer than expected because the Russians first wanted to evaluate the safety of the Crew Dragon system and then because of increasingly strained relations in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Rubio took the drawn-out negotiations in stride. ""It is important to realize there's a long standing history of cooperation right back to the Apollo-Soyuz program, to the shuttle-Mir program and now 20-plus years of working together on the ISS,"" he said. ""It just builds camaraderie and trust in a way that's very important to maintain, especially in moments like this when there are tensions and other aspects. So I'm very honored to represent our nation, and I'm proud to be here. I can't emphasize enough how much of a good thing I think this is.""",3,7.178458016997786,7.887784931381142,-0.7093269143833556,3

Vladimir Osechkin, who leads the Gulagu.net NGO that specializes in uncovering abuses in Russian prisons, is a refugee in France and is based in the resort town of Biarritz on its southwest coast. Osechkin, an avowed opponent of President Vladimir Putin, said he was targeted on the evening of September 12 when he was at home with his wife and children and working in the dark. ""I noticed a moving red dot on the railing of one of the terraces and then moving towards me on the wall,"" he told AFP by telephone. ""We turned off the light, lay down on the floor, closed the shutters and called the police."" He added that police and neighbors had heard shots were fired. Osechkin said he had been informed in February of an assassination plot against him and was subsequently put under police protection. He added that 10 days ago, he had also received information that a ""Russian criminal world boss"" had arrived in France on a mission to kill people in the Biarritz area. A source close to the investigation, who asked not to be named, told AFP that a probe had been opened into ""threats"" and not into attempted murder. The source declined to confirm or deny that shots had been fired. Gulagu.net rose to prominence in 2021 after publishing videos showing rapes in Russian prisons, as well as testimonies from victims and, extremely unusually, from the perpetrators, leading to the opening of an investigation by the authorities. Osechkin told the BBC that the protocol followed by the alleged torturers suggests they are well-practiced. ""They are giving signs to each other, acting in silent concert, understanding each other even without words because they are following a well-established system,"" he said. Gulagu.net claims to have more than 1,000 videos showing torture in Russian jails. ""We have gathered overwhelming evidence that proves instances of torture in Russia have been set up literally by the intelligent services, that these instances of torture were systematic,"" Osechkin told Reuters last year. Activists and Western governments accuse Russia of being prepared to eliminate opponents abroad, such as the double agent Sergei Skripal, who survived an attempt to kill him with the nerve agent Novichok in 2018. The Kremlin denies the allegations.

CBS News entered it after it was demined, and as Ukrainian detectives began their grim work. Patta was led through rooms that Ukrainian locals and police say were used as torture chambers. Russian soldiers slept there, ate there, and meted out the terror used to keep civilians and captured Ukrainian fighters under control. The walls of the police station's dark, damp basement were lined with egg cartons, as it had previously been used as an underground shooting range. It was already soundproofed. That meant the screams would be muffled. Scattered all around the basement, Patta saw things left behind by the occupying forces. Many looked innocuous — a coat-hanger, old electrical devices, masks and other household items — but police have taken testimony from victims who say they were all wielded as implements of torture. Unused electric shock devices were also found. Patta met local resident Anatoly Garagatny last week, who broke down sobbing as he described being electrocuted at the police station. Prisoners like Garagatny were kept in cramped jail cells filled with the stench of urine from overflowing buckets. The walls are peppered with rows of little pencil strokes, marking the days prisoners spent locked inside. In some spots, there are more than 50 marks. Police Chief Sergei Bolsenov is leading the investigation into what happened in his town, including at his department's headquarters. ""We collect evidence of fingerprints and DNA from this place,"" he told CBS News, to determine whether the people who were recently held there are even still alive. Russia has dismissed the discovery of mass-burial sites in Izyum as ""lies."" But when he spoke to Patta, Garagatny was already exhausted after cordoning off more than a dozen crime scenes like the one in the police station. ""This is the aftermath of terrorism,"" he told CBS News. ""Russia was trying to strangle the local people, to make them suffer… to make them so scared, they'd forget about freedom."" The effort has failed. Like so many Ukrainians who've suffered under Russian occupation, the people of Izyum have not had their spirit broken. Their fear has turned into defiance.",13,2.2164462360460084,2.965827355122316,-0.7493811190763076,27

The town was just recently liberated by Ukraine, and it was discovered that so many people were killed so quickly that hundreds were buried in shallow mass graves – including at least one entire family. CBS News foreign correspondent Debora Patta visited the site on Friday, where she learned that the makeshift cemetery included those who were killed by shelling. Others buried had been executed, including some, according to Reuters, who were buried still with rope around their necks and their hands tied. Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a video posted to Telegram on Friday that among those buried is ""a whole family"" – a mother and father in their 30s, their parents, and their 5- or 6-year-old daughter. The family's remains are marked with plywood crosses and small yellow and purple flowers planted in the dirt that covers them. ""We have testimony from locals stating they were all killed as a result of an air attack carried out by planes of the Russian Federation's military,"" Lubinets was translated as saying in Ukrainian. Russian troops had control over the town for more than six months until Ukrainian forces were able to take it back earlier this week. Izyum resident Serhii Shtanko told Reuters that he believes his neighbor's entire family, seven people in total, are also buried in the mass grave. Patta reported that the bodies found at the site will be exhumed and identified in the days ahead. Oleh Synehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region, told Reuters that Ukrainian officials had received information about mass deaths while Russian forces still occupied the region, but it wasn't until now that they were able to confirm the casualties. Ukraine's head of national police Ihor Klymenko said early Friday that it's believed many of the bodies have been buried since March. ""Back then, we didn't have reliable information, but now, we have facts,"" he said. ""There are many children, there are bodies with hands tied on their backs. Each of these facts will be investigated and they will get a legal review. Still, all of this can only testify that the world has to acknowledge that this is a genocide of the Ukrainian people."" Oleksandr Ilyenkov, Kharkiv's chief war crimes prosecutor, told Reuters it's believed there are about 500 civilian bodies at the site. These numbers would make it the biggest mass burial found in Europe since what was discovered in the aftermath of the Balkan wars, Reuters said.",13,2.6041908549814736,0.8347284598760747,1.769462395105399,27

Investigators, led by Kharkiv's chief war crimes prosecutor, are determined to uncover them after the area was liberated from Russian control. The smell — death on an industrial scale — is overpowering. The work is overwhelming and exhausting for those on the scene. There are so many graves that CBS News stopped counting after 100. Investigators say they've found over 400 shallow graves, and at least one of those is a mass grave containing the remains of at least 17 Ukrainian fighters. But CBS News mostly saw the bodies of civilians. Hrygory Pryhodko's wife was among those buried here. She was killed when Russia aimed its rockets at his family home. Pryhodko still can't believe his wife is gone. Kharkiv's chief war crimes prosecutor Oleksander Ilyenkov and investigators exhumed 50 bodies on Friday, some bearing signs of torture. Ilyenkov said they found bodies with rope around their necks and hands. Anatoli Garagatniy, who was jailed by Russian soldiers for 110 days for filming the invasion, weeped while he told CBS News he thought he'd end up buried here as well. ""They tortured me using electric shocks,"" he said. ""My nerves are shattered."" Some of those imprisoned with him did not get out alive.

(CNN) -- Even the heavy rainfall couldn't erase the smell of death in the pine forest in Izium on Friday afternoon, as Ukrainian investigators worked their way through a mass burial site found in the eastern Ukrainian city after its recapture from Russian forces. Ukraine's Defense Ministry said at least 440 ""unmarked"" graves were found in the city in recent days. The country's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that some of the bodies found in Izium showed ""signs of torture,"" blaming Russia for what he called ""cruelty and terrorism."" Izium was subject to intense Russian artillery attacks in April. The city, which sits near the border between the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, became an important hub for the invading military during five months of occupation. Ukrainian forces took back control of the city on Saturday, delivering a strategic blow to Russia's military assault in the east. When CNN arrived to the mass burial site on Friday afternoon, officials were transporting body bags, including one that appeared to be holding something very small, into a refrigerated truck. Most graves at the burial site are individual graves, with wooden crosses placed at the head of the dirt mounds. Some with names and numbers handwritten on them. One had a number as high as 398. Another with the name of an 82-year-old man. One official at the site told CNN that investigations would have to determine when these people died. Further down in the forest lies what appeared to be a former military position, with tank positions dug deep into the ground. A policeman at the scene told CNN that the spot is a mass grave where 17 bodies were found. ""Here are civilian bodies and military ones further along,"" Igor Garmash, an investigator at the scene said of the specific part of the site he was examining, pointing to a location nearby. ""Over 20 bodies have been examined and sent for further investigation,"" he told CNN. Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications said on Thursday that some of the graves discovered at Izium were ""fresh,"" and that the corpses buried there were ""mostly civilians."" Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian Parliament's Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a video statement from the site that ""there is a whole family right next to me... This is a young family... The father was born in 1988, the wife was born in 1991, their little daughter was born in 2016."" He said local people told the investigators that the family had died in a Russian airstrike. ""Also we saw here a mass burial of servicemen of the Ukrainian army. The way they were buried -- you will see evidence that their hands were tied, they were killed at close range,"" Lubinets said. An Izium resident living across the street from the mass burial site told CNN the Russians first hit a nearby city graveyard with an airstrike and then moved in. ""They brought their special machines. They dug some trenches for their vehicles. We only heard how they were destroying the forest,"" Nadezhda Kalinichenko told CNN. She said she tried not to go out during the time the city was under the Russian occupation because she was too scared. ""When they left, I don't know if there was fighting or not. We just heard a lot of heavy trucks one night a week ago,"" she said. Zelensky said during his address on Thursday that Russia must be held accountable for deaths there, and in other cities where large numbers of bodies had been found. ""Bucha, Mariupol and now, unfortunately, Izium... Russia leaves death everywhere. And must be responsible for it. The world must hold Russia to real responsibility for this war. We will do everything for this,"" he added. The Governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said that ""the scale of the crimes committed by the invaders in Izium is enormous. This is bloody brutal terror."" Syniehubov said that ""450 bodies of civilians with traces of violent death and torture were buried in a forest belt. It is difficult to imagine something like this in the 21st century, but now it is a tragic reality in Izium."" Syniehubov said that among the bodies exhumed on Friday ""99 percent showed signs of violent death."" ""There are several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person is buried with a rope around his neck. Obviously, these people were tortured and executed. There are also children among the buried,"" he said. Meanwhile, Oleh Kotenko, Ukraine's commissioner for missing persons, said in a Telegram post that search operations for the remains of ""fallen heroes"" were proceeding cautiously throughout the region. ""The biggest problem is that some areas are still mined. Despite this, we continue to work, because we have to return each hero home so that the families can honor the memory of the soldiers who died for Ukraine in a dignified manner as soon as possible,"" Kotenko said. Zelensky visited Izium on Wednesday and told journalists he was ""shocked"" by the number of ""destroyed buildings"" and ""killed people"" left in the wake of the Russian occupation. A United Nations source has told CNN that a team from the UN's human rights monitoring agency -- the OCHR -- would be going to Izium and areas around it as soon as possible. The War Crimes investigation team may follow after that, the source said. Their specific destination remains unclear at this time. Moscow was using Izium as a launching pad for attacks southward into the Donetsk region and Kupyansk, some 48 kilometers (30 miles) to the north of Izium, and as a rail hub to resupply its forces. Zelensky also thanked foreign governments for sending investigators and prosecutors to investigate alleged human rights abuses by occupying forces in Ukraine, adding that all occupied areas would eventually return. Ukrainian forces have been on a sustained military offensive, particularly in the country's northeast and southern regions. Zelensky said on Tuesday that 8,000 square kilometers (3,088 square miles) of territory had now been liberated by Ukrainian forces so far this month, with roughly half the area still undergoing ""stabilization"" measures.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Ukraine's partners ""need to be prepared for the long haul,"" as Ukraine's forces push their gains and Russia shows no sign of halting its assault further to the east and the south. As CBS News foreign correspondent Debora Patta reports, the full horror of that assault becomes clearer by the day, as residents of towns and villages in the recently-liberated Kharkiv region emerge from months in hiding. As Russian forces seized Izyum, they laid waste to the town. Vladimir Putin's military shelled Izyum relentlessly for weeks before they fully wrested control of the town and turned it into a logistics hub. The shelling destroyed hospitals, homes and schools — clearly not military targets. Many people were killed, often buried hastily in shallow mass-burial sites. Patta visited a makeshift cemetery in Izyum on Friday where the bodies of hundreds of civilians were laid to rest in shallow graves during Russia's occupation. Many died in their homes as artillery rained down. Others were executed. The awful task of exhuming and identifying the bodies has begun. It will take days, and each victim exhumed will be a personal trauma for family and friends, and another national tragedy for war crimes prosecutors to investigate. Once they controlled Izyum, the Russian forces also attempted to erase every trace of Ukrainian identity in the town. ""They burned our books, destroyed our schools, removed our TV channels and put on Moscow's propaganda,"" resident Yulia Koziubenko told CBS News. Anyone with connections to Ukraine's military forces was subjected to torture by the Russians, residents told Patta. ""Those who served in the security services were found,"" Koziubenko said. ""Taken away and beaten."" The bodies found in the shallow graves show that in some cases, they met an even worse fate. But for some, even harder to bear than the loss of their culture, their town and their neighbors, has been the knowledge that some of their own betrayed them. Koziubenko said her husband was among them. She has denounced him as a traitor. ""My husband is working with the Russians in Kherson,"" she said, referring to a region further to the south still largely occupied by Russia. ""He no longer exists for me."" There were those who say they had no choice but to take what Russia gave them, including Svetlana Fisher. The Izyum resident told Patta the town's mayor abandoned them, and she had nowhere else to turn for food. ""I couldn't leave. Nobody helped me,"" she protested angrily. ""Now I am a traitor because I had to survive on Russian rations?"" Others stood firm, refusing handouts from the occupiers. Liza Jankina and 50 of her neighbors survived for more than 100 days with hardly any food in a freezing basement. They would often go weeks without a proper meal during Russia's nearly-six-month-long occupation of Izyum. Now she's bitter about anyone in the town who was seen to have supported the Russian troops. But as the full extent of Russian atrocities is revealed in Izyum, that bitterness is quickly turning into hatred for the people who brought death to the town.",14,1.4641217435056508,1.4328003233668287,0.03132142013882211,20

""A mass grave of people was found in Izium in the Kharkiv region. The necessary procedures have already begun there. More information — clear, verifiable information — should be available tomorrow,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly televised address. Associated Press journalists saw the site in a forest outside Izium on Thursday. Amid the trees were hundreds of graves with simple wooden crosses, most of them marked only with numbers. A larger grave bore a marker saying it contained the bodies of 17 Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian investigators were already at work examining the site with metal detectors for any hidden explosives. Oleg Kotenko, an official with the Ukrainian ministry tasked with reintegrating occupied territories, said videos that Russian soldiers posted on social media indicated there were likely more than 17 bodies in the mass grave. ""We haven't counted them yet, but I think there are more than 25 or even 30,"" he said. Izium resident Sergei Gorodko said that among the hundreds buried in individual graves were dozens of adults and children killed in a Russian airstrike on an apartment building. He said he pulled some of them out of the rubble ""with my own hands."" In his address to the nation, Zelenskyy invoked the names of other Ukrainian cities where authorities said retreating Russian troops left behind mass civilian graves and evidence of possible war crimes. ""Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izium. … Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for it. The world must bring Russia to real responsibility for this war,"" he said. Sergei Bolvinov, a senior investigator for Ukrainian police in the eastern Kharkiv region, told British TV broadcaster Sky News that a pit containing more than 440 bodies was discovered near Izium after Kyiv's forces swept in. He described the grave as ""one of the largest burial sites in any one liberated city."" ""We know that some (of the people buried in the pit) were shot, some died from artillery fire, from so called mine-explosion traumas. Some died from airstrikes. Also, we have information that a lot of bodies have not been identified yet"" Bolvinov said. Russia's forces left Izium and other parts of the Kharkiv region last week amid a stunning Ukrainian counteroffensive. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy made a rare trip outside Ukraine's capital to watch the raising of the national flag at Izium's city hall. Ukraine's deputy interior minister, Yevhen Enin, said Thursday night that other evidence found after Kyiv's sweeping advance into the Kharkiv region included multiple ""torture chambers"" where both Ukrainian citizens and foreigners were detained ""in completely inhuman conditions."" ""We have already come across the exhumation of individual bodies, not only with traces of a violent death, but also of torture — cut off ears, etc. This is just the beginning,"" Enin said in an interview with Ukraine's Radio NV. He claimed that among those held at one of the sites were students from an unspecified Asian country who were captured at a Russian checkpoint as they tried to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory. Enin did not specify where the students were held, although he named the small cities of Balakliya and Volchansk as two locations where the alleged torture chambers were found. His account could not be immediately verified independently. ""All these traces of war crimes are now carefully documented by us. And we know from the experience of Bucha that the worst crimes can only be exposed over time,"" Enin said, in a reference to a Kyiv suburb where the bodies of hundreds of civilians were discovered following the Russian army's withdrawal from the area in March. Earlier Thursday, Zelenskyy said that during the five months the Russians occupied the region, they ""only destroyed, only deprived, only took away. They left behind devastated villages; in some of them there is not a single undamaged house. The occupiers turned schools into garbage dumps, and churches — shattered, literally turned into toilets.""",13,1.5789918978577089,2.3617138214486064,-0.7827219235908975,27

""You see what Russia destroyed, you see the scale of this tragedy,"" Zelenskyy told CBS News in Izyum. ""But the main thing is that we are coming back and we are on the way to the end."" Zelenskyy's surprise visit to Izyum would have been unthinkable just last week. Russian forces held the town for more than six months, until it was liberated just three days ago. Even on Wednesday, the visit was bold. The town is just a little more than six miles from the nearest active front line, and occasional shelling can still be heard in the distance. Izyum's liberation was part of a stunning counteroffensive that has seen the Ukrainian army take back nearly all the territory in the Kharkiv region that Russia captured early in the war. Just days ago, Russia was using the Izyum as a strategic hub to resupply its forces elsewhere on the eastern front lines with food, weapons and other supplies. A Ukrainian soldier who was part of the lightning counteroffensive told CBS News that he and his fellow troops found themselves running up to 20 miles every day as they recaptured villages along the way to Izyum. He said they didn't expect to liberate the region so quickly. He thought it would take a month or more. ""We take the first line of Russians,"" the soldier said, and then ""they then don't have a second line, third line, and we can go to the front very fast."" For the residents who endured more than half a year of hell under Russian occupation, it could not have come soon enough. Liza Jankina hid with 50 neighbors for four months in an icy basement. She pointed out the bushes in an overgrown patch of ground just outside the building where they were forced to hastily bury a neighbor, who due to a lack of medical care.

Ukraine's troops have recaptured an estimated 2,000 square miles of territory in recent days. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vows to keep pushing the counterattack until his country reclaims all of its territory, Russia's Vladimir Putin is facing some rare criticism at home. As CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports from Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, from which Russian troops have effectively been forced out, Ukrainian forces are seizing the momentum. The yellow and blue of the national flag now flies proudly again over many liberated towns and villages across the region — only about 30 miles from the Russian border. ""Our troops were so smart,"" said one proud woman, welcoming the liberators. ""The Russian soldiers were shocked, running away so fast. They [Ukraine's forces] planned this really well."" When Putin launched his war on Ukraine nearly seven months ago, his troops quickly seized massive chunks of territory around Kharkiv. But Ukrainian forces have blitzed through Russia's gains in just days, snatching back a huge swath of land. It's been a crushing defeat for the Russian troops, depriving Moscow of its ability to resupply forces on the front lines, as it can no longer use the recently-liberated town of Izyum as a strategic logistics hub. ""They left all their explosives and ammunition here,"" gloated one Ukrainian soldier there. As the Russian front line collapsed in Izyum, the extent of a war waged largely against Ukrainian civilians has become devastatingly clear: Hospitals and schools blown up; people killed in their own backyards. The Kremlin's attempt to spin the humiliating withdrawal in the region as a strategic ""regrouping"" of forces to other front lines has been ridiculed on social media — even in Russia. Away from the battlefield, on the usually-friendly airwaves of Russia's state-run television, months of eager repetition of the Kremlin's talking points has given way recently to some hard questions for Putin about his so-called ""special military operation."" ""It's either full scale war or we get out,"" former parliamentarian Boris Nadeszhdin insisted during a heated panel discussion on state TV late last week. ""You say everything's going according to plan,"" policy expert Viktor Olevich exclaimed in disbelief, addressing the narrative Putin has stuck to dogmatically. ""You really think six months ago we planned on leaving and repelling a counteroffensive?"" Ukrainians want to believe that the tide is turning in a war that, from the onset, seemed weighted heavily in Russia's favor. But Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned that while this counteroffensive was well-planned and has clearly benefitted from an avalanche of Western military aid, it's too early to predict an outcome.",14,1.5887304404204527,0.9052953791156318,0.6834350613048209,20

The Ukrainian military says it's reclaimed an area the size of Rhode Island since the beginning of September alone. As CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports, the Ukrainians' recent battlefield successes around their country's second largest city of Kharkiv have been among their most significant since they crushed the bid by Vladimir Putin's military to seize capital Kyiv near the start of the war. Their counteroffensive, focused largely around Kharkiv, has already taken back about 1,000 square miles of the territory that Ukraine had lost since Putin launched his invasion on February 24. Ukrainian forces have swept through the northeast at breath-taking speed, and as Patta reports, they're being greeted like conquering heroes, with civilians rushing to offer flowers, embraces, and tears of joy. Ukraine's blue and yellow flag once again flies high in liberated towns and villages across the region, as the country's advancing troops push north, just 30 miles from the Russian border. It's a humiliating defeat for Putin's men as they're forced to flee, abandoning key supply hubs like Kupyansk and Izyum as they go. ""The Russians were here,"" said local resident Dmytro Hrushchenko. ""Then they suddenly started shouting wildly and running away, charging off in their tanks."" For those who've lived under Russia's occupation, it has been more than half a year of hell. ""I was very scared all this time,"" said Maria Hryhorora, another resident of a liberated town. ""I can still see an image of a huge puddle of blood in front of my eyes."" As the Russian troops fled, fearing they would be surrounded and captured, they left behind the usual trail of destruction, devastation — and the possibility of new crime scenes for police to investigate as they begin the now horribly familiar task of digging up the bodies of civilians allegedly killed by the invading forces. As Moscow ordered its soldiers to withdraw from around Kharkiv — with the face-saving explanation that it was to reinforce the front line further to the southeast — they fired off a gruesome parting gift: A missile strike hit a thermal power plant that left the area under a partial blackout overnight. Patta says that while Ukrainians have certainly been emboldened by the steady supply of Western military aid, nobody in the country is under the illusion that the war is going to be over quickly, and they say they need more heavy weapons to keep the momentum going.",14,0.8336852582020154,2.302092644653426,-1.4684073864514104,20

The counterattack began in the final days of August and at first focused on the southern region of Kherson, which was swept by Russian forces in the opening days of the invasion. But just as Moscow redirected attention and troops there, Ukraine launched another, highly effective offensive in the northeast, near Kharkiv. Facing the prospect of a large group of its forces becoming surrounded, Moscow pulled back its troops from Kharkiv in a dramatic shift in the state of play that posed the biggest challenge to the Kremlin since it launched the invasion Feb. 24. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, pledged Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that Ukraine's military will liberate all of the country from Russia amid the counteroffensive. ""We always have to keep in mind that Russia still can do a lot of damage. But we don't have any other choice, we will advance,"" Markarova said. ""As we said before, we will not surrender. And we will liberate all Ukraine, because this is what we have to do not only to restore our territorial integrity, but to save all of our people who are under occupation."" Markarova attributed the success of the counteroffensive so far to the ""resolve of the armed forces"" and Ukraine's commanders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who she described as being ""so devoted to victory."" But she also said the military aid from international partners has been crucial. ""The Ukrainian army has taken advantage of the relocation of the bulk of the Russian forces to the south and is trying to direct the course of the war, excelling in maneuver and showing great ingenuity,"" said Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military expert with the Razumkov Centre, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine's quick gains, he added, are ""important both for seizing initiative and raising troops' spirit."" Zelenskyy praised the military in a video address Saturday night, saying it has reclaimed about 2,000 square kilometers (over 770 square miles) of territory so far this month. He also taunted Moscow over its withdrawal, saying the Russian army was ""demonstrating the best it can do — showing its back"" and ""they made a good choice to run."" The Russian military debacle has provoked outrage among Russian military bloggers and patriotic commentators, who chastised the Kremlin for failing to mobilize more forces and take stronger action against Ukraine. Even Ramzan Kadyrov, the Moscow-backed leader of the Russian region of Chechnya, publicly criticized the Russian Defense Ministry for what he called ""mistakes"" that made the Ukrainian blitz possible. Both sides have suffered heavy losses in Europe's largest conflict since World War II. Ukraine's military chief said last month that nearly 9,000 of its soldiers have been killed in action. And while Moscow hasn't reported its own losses since March, Western estimates put the toll as high as 25,000 dead, with the wounded, captured and deserters bringing the overall Russian losses to more than 80,000. Ukraine has sought to mobilize the population to reach an active military of 1 million people, while Russia, in contrast, has continued to rely on a limited contingent of volunteers for fear that a mass mobilization could fuel discontent and upset internal stability. As the war slogs on, a growing flow of Western weapons over the summer is playing a key role in the counteroffensive, helping Ukraine significantly boost its precision strike capability. Since the counteroffensive began, Ukraine said, its forces have reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region. In the Kherson region, troops sought to drive Russian forces from their foothold on the west bank of the Dnieper River, a potential vantage point for a push deeper into Ukraine by Moscow. The Ukrainian General Staff said Russian forces had also left several settlements in the region but did not identify the towns. The city of Kherson, an economic hub at the confluence of the Dnieper and the Black Sea with a prewar population of about 300,000, was the first major population center to fall in the war. Russian forces also have made inroads into the Zaporizhzhia region farther north, where they seized Europe's largest nuclear power plant. The last of its six reactors was shut down Sunday after operating in a risky ""island mode"" for several days to generate electricity for the plant's crucial cooling systems after one of the power lines was restored. Moscow has installed puppet administrations in occupied areas, introduced its currency, handed out Russian passports and prepared for local plebiscites to pave the way for annexation. But the counteroffensive has derailed those plans, with a top Moscow-backed official in Kherson saying the vote there needs to be put off. The counterattack followed methodical strikes on Russian infrastructure and supply lines. Ukrainian forces have used U.S.-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to pound the two bridges on the Dnieper, forcing Russian troops in the Kherson region to rely on pontoon crossings that also have faced daily strikes. Last month, a series of explosions also hit airbases and a munitions depot in Crimea, underlining the vulnerability of the peninsula that was annexed by Russia in 2014 and has been crucial for its southern operations. Ukrainian authorities initially refrained from claiming responsibility, but the country's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyy, acknowledged in recent days that his forces hit them with rockets. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said Kyiv ""has used the tactics of methodically exhausting the Russian army, weakening it and depriving it of a possibility to regularly beef up its forces."" Unlike in the south, where Ukraine's counteroffensive proceeded more slowly on the barren steppes of Kherson that left troops vulnerable to Russian artillery, the Kharkiv region's forests offered natural cover that allowed for lightning-fast surprise attacks from multiple directions. ""Swiftness and surprise have become key components of the Ukrainian army action in the Kharkiv region after Russian forces deployed there had been relocated to the south,"" Zhdanov said. Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the Virginia-based think tank CNA, said the counteroffensive ""has proven a very significant victory for Ukraine."" ""Russian forces appear to have been spread thinly, and military leadership unprepared despite earlier evidence of Ukrainian buildup,"" Kofman wrote. ""I think it's fair to assess that Russia was caught by surprise with little in the way of reserves locally available."" After capturing the town of Balakliia, about 55 kilometers (about 34 miles) southeast of Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces quickly pressed their offensive farther east to Kupiansk, a rail hub vital for sustaining Russian operations in the region. They claimed control of the strategic city Saturday, cutting supply lines to a big group of Russian forces around Izyum to the south. To prevent their complete encirclement, Moscow ordered the hasty retreat, claiming they were relocating to focus on the neighboring Donetsk region. Zhdanov noted that a successful counteroffensive is key to persuading allies to further increase supplies of weapons to Ukraine, something that was discussed Thursday at a NATO meeting in Germany. ""The events in the south and in the Kharkiv region must show to the West that the Ukrainian military knows how to handle the weapons and needs to develop their success,"" Zhdanov said.",14,2.411246699816292,1.6504447121694956,0.7608019876467962,12
2022-09-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/russia-troop-pullback-kharkiv-ukraine-breaks-through-front-line-in-east/,Russia pulls back troops in Kharkiv after Ukraine counteroffensive,"Russia's Defense Ministry announced Saturday that it's pulling back troops from two areas in Ukraine's eastern Kharkiv region where a Ukrainian counteroffensive has made significant advances in the past week. The news came after days of apparent advances by Ukraine south of Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, in what could become the biggest battlefield success for Ukrainian forces since they thwarted a Russian attempt to seize the capital of Kyiv at the start of the nearly seven-month war. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Saturday that troops would be regrouped from the Balakliya and Izyum areas to Ukraine's tern Donetsk region. Izyum was a major base for Russian forces in the Kharkiv region and earlier this week social media videos showed residents of Balakliya joyfully cheering as Ukrainian troops moved in. Konashenkov said the Russian move is being made ""in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas,'"" one of the eastern Ukraine regions that Russia has declared sovereign. The claim of pullback to concentrate on Donetsk is similar to the justification Russia gave for pulling back its forces from the Kyiv region earlier this year when they failed to take the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian officials earlier Saturday claimed major gains in a counteroffensive against Russian forces in the Kharkiv region, saying Ukrainian troops had cut off vital supplies to Izyum. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko also suggested the Ukrainian troops had retaken Kupiansk, a town along the main supply route to Izyum, long a focus on the Russian front line and the site of heavy artillery and other fighting. Nikolenko tweeted a photo showing soldiers in front of what he said was a government building in Kupiansk, 73 kilometers (45 miles) north of Izyum. The Ukrainian Security Service of Ukraine hours later posted a message which it said showed its forces in Kupiansk, further suggesting it had been seized by Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian military didn't immediately confirm entering the town, a railway hub that Russia seized in February. Videos on social media appeared to show Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of Izyum at a roadside checkpoint. A large statue with the city's name could be seen in the footage. Ukrainian forces did not acknowledge holding the city. Earlier Saturday, the British Defense Ministry told reporters it believed the Ukrainians had advanced as much as 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Kharkiv, and described Russian forces around Izyum as ""increasingly isolated."" ""Russian forces were likely taken by surprise. The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns,"" the British military said, adding that the loss of Kupiansk would greatly affect Russian supply lines. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, likewise referenced sweeping Ukrainian gains, estimating that Kyiv has seized around 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) in its eastern breakthrough. The institute said it appeared that ""disorganized Russian forces (were) caught in the rapid Ukrainian advance."" They cited social media images of apparent Russian prisoners seized in the advance around Izyum and surrounding towns. The same report said Ukrainian forces ""may collapse Russian positions around Izyum if they sever Russian ground lines of communication"" north and south of the town. Vladislav Sokolov, head of the Russian-appointed local administration, said on social media that authorities in Izyum have started evacuating residents to Russia. The fighting in eastern Ukraine comes amid an ongoing offensive around Kherson in the south. Analysts suggest Russia may have taken soldiers from the east to reinforce around Kherson, offering the Ukrainians the opportunity to strike a weakened front line. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told the television channel Ukraina that the Russians had no food or fuel for their troops in the area as Kyiv had cut off their supply lines. ""It will be like an avalanche,"" he said, predicting a Russian fallback. ""One line of defense will shake and it will fall."" The Ukrainian military was more circumspect about the reported gains, claiming Saturday to have taken ""more than 1,000 square kilometers"" (386 square miles) from pro-Kremlin forces this week. It said ""in some areas, units of the Defense Forces have penetrated the enemy's defenses to a depth of 50 kilometers,"" matching the British assessment, but did not disclose geographical details. Officials in Kyiv have for weeks been tight-lipped about plans for a counteroffensive to retake territory overrun by Russia early in the war, urging residents to refrain from sharing information on social media. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that Ukrainian troops had reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region since the start of the counteroffensive. ""We are gradually taking control over more settlements, returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for our people,"" Zelenskyy said. He spoke after the Ukrainian governor of Kharkiv reported that the national flag had been raised over Balakliya, a town recaptured by Ukrainian troops on Thursday following six months of Russian occupation. ""Balakliya is Ukraine! Today, together with the military, led by the commander of the Ground Forces Oleksandr Syrskyy, we raised the Ukrainian flag,"" governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. Elsewhere, Ukrainian emergency services reported that a 62-year-old woman was killed in a Russian missile strike in the Kharkiv region when her home was flattened overnight. Syniehubov also accused Moscow of pummeling settlements retaken by Kyiv. He said in a Telegram post that five civilians were hospitalized in the Izyum district, while nine others suffered injuries elsewhere in the region. In the embattled Donbas region south of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian governor said civilians were killed and wounded overnight by Russian shelling near the city of Bakhmut, a key target of the stalled Russian offensive there. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram that two people died and two more suffered injuries in Bakhmut and the neighboring village of Yahidne. Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit Saturday, saying that Europe would not tire of helping Ukraine despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to raise the pressure by withholding energy supplies from European Union nations. Baerbock said Germany will assist Ukraine in finding and removing mines and other unexploded ordnance left by Russian troops in areas where they have been pushed back by Ukrainian forces. Despite the gains made by Ukraine's armed forces, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the head of NATO warned Friday that Ukraine's fight against Russia appears set to drag on for months. Blinken said the war was entering a critical period and urged Ukraine's Western backers to keep up their support through what could be a difficult winter.",14,1.1886892640575528,4.269300126801118,-3.0806108627435655,17

""We are disturbed by reports that aid worker Paul Urey may have been tortured in detention,"" the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in a statement sent to AFP. ""It is essential that we see the results of a full post-mortem as soon as possible,"" the ministry said. It added: ""Our thoughts are with Paul Urey's family at this distressing time."" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Wednesday that Russians had returned the body of Paul Urey, with ""signs of possible unspeakable torture"", which he said would be ""a heinous war crime."" Urey went out as a volunteer to help evacuate Ukrainians soon after Russia's invasion in April. He was captured later that month and died on July 10 while being held by Moscow-backed separatists, who said he had chronic illnesses and a ""depressed psychological state."" The death of the father-of-two with Type 1 diabetes was discussed by the U.N. Security Council and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Then-U.K. foreign minister Liz Truss said in July she was ""shocked"" by reports of Urey's death. She said the Kremlin was ""fully responsible"" since he was ""in custody of a Russian proxy in Ukraine."" Urey's mother, Linda Urey, wrote on Facebook Thursday that her son's body is in Kyiv. She urged supporters ""to help me get him back."" In a separate post accompanied by family photos, she wrote: ""Bring my son home please."" His daughters, aged 17 and 20, are using crowdfunding to pay to repatriate his body. Russia declined any responsibility for Urey's death, saying Britain should have negotiated with the separatists. The separatists claimed that Urey, from Warrington in northwestern England, was a professional soldier acting as a mercenary. Urey was detained at a checkpoint near the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia and held in the Donetsk separatist region in eastern Ukraine. Another British man captured with him, Dylan Healy, is on trial in Donetsk with four other foreigners, accused of being a mercenary and facing a possible death penalty. Pro-Russian separatists have captured several foreign citizens they describe as mercenaries. Among them are Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner who in June were sentenced to death by separatist authorities in the stronghold of Donetsk. Two Americans who are also being held, Alexander Drueke and Andy Huynh, have not yet been charged.",13,6.588239219928276,6.479124632412427,0.10911458751584924,2
2022-09-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-accuses-us-nsa-cyberattack-spying-northwestern-polytechnical-university-military-research/,China accuses U.S. of cyberattacks on university that allegedly does military research,"China on Monday accused Washington of breaking into computers at a university that U.S. officials say does military research, adding to complaints by both governments of rampant online spying against each other. Northwestern Polytechnical University reported computer break-ins in June, the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center announced. It said the center, working with a commercial security provider, Qihoo 360 Technology Co., traced the attacks to the National Security Agency but didn't say how that was done. China and the United States are, along with Russia, regarded as global leaders in cyberwarfare research. China accuses the United States of spying on universities, energy and internet companies and other targets. Washington accuses Beijing of stealing commercial secrets and has announced criminal charges against Chinese military officers. The U.S. actions ""seriously endanger China's national security,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. She also accused Washington of eavesdropping on Chinese mobile phones and stealing text messages. ""China strongly condemns it,"" Mao said. ""The United States should immediately stop using its advantages to steal secrets and attack other countries."" The American Embassy in Beijing didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Security experts say the ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, and the Ministry of State Security also sponsor hackers outside the government. Northwestern Polytechnical University, in the western city of Xi'an, is on a U.S. government ""entity list"" that limits its access to American technology. Washington says the university helps the PLA develop aerial and underwater drones and missile technology. Monday's announcement accused the United States of taking information about the university's network management and other ""core technologies."" It said Chinese analysts found 41 ""network attack"" tools that it said were traced to the NSA. Last year, a Chinese man, Shuren Qin, was sentenced to two years in prison by a federal court in Boston after he pleaded guilty to exporting underwater and marine technology to Northwestern Polytechnical University without required licenses. The NSA, part of the Department of Defense, is responsible for ""signals intelligence,"" or obtaining communications and other data. The Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, set up in 1996 by the police department of the eastern city of Tianjin, describes itself as the Chinese agency responsible for inspection and testing of anti-computer virus products. A report by Qihoo 360 in 2020 said hacking tools used in attacks on Chinese companies and government agencies in 2008-19 were traced to the Central Intelligence Agency by comparing them with code in CIA tools disclosed by the Wikileaks group. The virus center accused the NSA of carrying out other ""malicious network attacks"" in China but gave no details. It said 13 people involved in the attacks had been identified. The hackers targeted a ""zero day,"" or previously unreported, vulnerability in the school's security, the statement said. It said the break-ins were conducted from servers in 17 countries including Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Poland, Ukraine and Colombia. The statement described what it said were NSA software tools with names such as ""Second Date"" and ""Drinking Tea"" but didn't say which might have been used at the university.",3,5.604058039854203,5.826199287961817,-0.22214124810761415,1

A helicopter with a rescue team was on the way to the site of the accident, emergency officials said. Russian media initially reported on Saturday that five climbers died while trying to ascend to the top of the Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka peninsula. The accident occurred about 500 meters below the 4,750-meter (15,884-foot) summit, the reports cited the prosecutor's office of the Kamchatka region as saying. All the climbers were Russians, the reports said. Four people survived the accident and were waiting for the rescuers at different altitudes. One person is thought to have a broken leg, Reuters reported, citing officials. Reuters reported that freezing winds halted an initial rescue attempt on the mountain where temperatures can reach as low as 7 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. Last year, the volcano erupted on its northwestern slope, seeping lava and ejecting volcanic bombs. The Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's far northeast is noted for its array of active and dormant volcanos, hot springs and abundant wildlife. The incident marks the latest in a recent string of climbing accidents involving volcanoes around the world. Last month, three mountaineers died and 12 were injured after they fell while climbing Ecuador's Carihuairazo volcano. In June, a woman died and a climbing companion was injured when they scaled the highly active, off-limits peak of the Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico.

2022-09-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ethiopia-war-tigray-truce-falling-apart-humanitarian-crisis/,Truce in Ethiopia's war with Tigray rebels brought little relief. Now it seems to be falling apart.,"For five months, a fragile peace agreement has allowed desperately needed humanitarian relief to trickle into Ethiopia's embattled Tigray region. But the year-long war that tore apart the northern part of the country in 2021 appears to have returned, once again putting the lives of millions of people at risk. Reports of fighting emerged again near the end of August in the town of Kobo, in southern Tigray. The independence-minded rebels of the Tigray province and the Ethiopian government forces blamed each other for firing the first shots. Regional analysts had warned that the tension was building quickly again in the region, in spite of optimism just weeks earlier that talks to establish a lasting peace agreement were set to get under way. There were even rumors circulating that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had sent senior officials to meet in secret with leaders of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) in the northern region. Since then, the TPLF's forces have again been advancing southward, with reports of fierce clashes and at least two Ethiopian Air Force strikes against the Tigray region's capital, Mekele, in the past week. Residents claim one of those strikes hit a nursery school, killing at least four people, including three children. Prime Minister Abiy has maintained tight control over the country's media, and journalists are largely unable to visit Tigray. Many international journalists have been barred from entering Ethiopia, or thrown out if they were already there. In the void, much of the information that makes it out of the region is propaganda. Videos produced by the TPLF have been emerging online over the last week, showing large numbers of captured government tanks and soldiers. TPLF officials have accused the government of launching an offensive from the north, from neighboring Eritrea, where the government is aligned with Abiy's. There have been unconfirmed reports of Eritrean forces massing at the border. Other reports, meanwhile, suggest TPLF forces have been operating along the border with neighboring Sudan, where they're engaged in fighting over disputed territory in western Tigray. A security expert told CBS News that there's growing concern fighting on this new front could potentially draw Sudan into what is already a complicated regional conflict. A United Nations report last year found that both sides had ""committed atrocities,"" possibly amounting to crimes against humanity. The aim of the humanitarian truce agreed to by the TPLF and the Ethiopian government on March 24 was to get much needed humanitarian supplies into Tigray, which had been cut off at that point by a government blockade for more than a year. It was hoped that the ceasefire would lay the groundwork for a more permanent peace deal. But Tigrayan officials have said that over the last five months, the region has still had no electricity or fuel, only a small amount of food and medical supplies have trickled in, and doctors and nurses in the region have had to work continuously for 16 months without pay. A recent United Nations report said almost everyone in Tigray — some 5 million people or 90% of the region's population — needed food aid. U.S. Special Envoy Mike Hammer visited Tigray on August 2 and called for a ""swift restoration of electricity, telecom, baking and other basic services,"" and he hinted that Abiy had agreed to make it happen. But the TPLF accused Abiy of reneging on the truce deal and failing to lift the blockade, even going so far as to threaten a resumption of the war if the blockade wasn't lifted. Ethiopian officials from Abiy's administration said repeatedly that they were willing to talk ""anywhere, anytime,"" but they would not address the TPLF's demands. At a news conference last week, TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda said he thought the government had ""hoodwinked the international community"" into believing it was working toward a peaceful outcome. The following day, government officials accused the TPLF of launching the operations along the Sudan border. The war with the TPLF in Tigray isn't the only front on which the Abiy government is fighting. In other parts of the country, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) has continued to clash with government soldiers. Last year, the OLA and TPLF formed a military alliance, which at one point fought its way to within just 60 miles of the capital Addis Abba. As the fighting intensifies once again in various parts of the country, and carries with it the threat of exacerbating an already-dire humanitarian situation for some of the poorest people on the planet, Ethiopia's farmers are expected to harvest yet another poor crop in the coming weeks. The first ship carrying a much-needed humanitarian grain shipment from Ukraine docked in the neighboring nation of Djibouti last week. The food is expected to reach Ethiopia in just days, but it won't be nearly enough to feed those in need. The World Food Program says the ongoing blockade of Tigray, combined with the global grain shortage fueled by Russia's war in Ukraine, mean it's reaching far short of the 4.8 million people in need in the northern Ethiopian region. For the many Tigrayans who were already desperate and starving, the renewed violence will likely look like the snuffing out of the last glimmer of hope.",14,5.965833294563491,6.3685414925987756,-0.4027081980352847,4

""Then one man came in with a rifle and threatened to cut off my ear to play with it,"" said the man, identified only as Anatolii V. to protect his identity, about his experience in a so-called filtration camp in Russian-held territory in Ukraine. Anatolii V., who is now in Germany, was among dozens of Ukrainians whose horrifying accounts are laid out in detail in the HRW report on the Russian camps. The report comes amid mounting allegations from U.S. and Ukrainian officials about the filtration camps, where Ukrainians are allegedly forced to undergo invasive security checks and interrogations as they flee Russian-held areas. Russian authorities have forcibly brought some of the Ukrainians into Russia, or simply made them disappear, according to the report. ""During the process, [separatist Donetsk People's Republic] or Russian officials collected civilians' biometric data, including fingerprints and photographs of their face looking forward and in profile; searched their bodies, belongings and phones; and questioned them about their political views and ties to Ukrainian armed forces and government agencies,"" the Human Rights Watch report says. ""While for some the wait lasted only hours, many had to remain near the filtration centers for between three days and up to almost a month, waiting to undergo interrogation."" HRW's report quotes family members as saying ""those who 'failed' the filtration process in the [Donetsk People's Republic], apparently due to their suspected ties to the Ukrainian military or national groups, were detained and some forcibly disappeared."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in July that an estimated 900,000 to 1.6 million Ukrainians, including 260,000 children, had been ""interrogated, detained and forcibly deported"" to Russia, adding that the forced deportations are a war crime. A U.S. intelligence assessment from June said filtration operations had been identified in ""18 possible locations in eastern Ukraine and western Russia,"" with more likely yet to be detected. Last week, a State Department-funded program released a report that documented 21 sites allegedly linked to filtration operations in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region alone, much of which has been controlled by Russian forces or their separatist allies for months. ""This adds to the growing body of credible reporting and evidence on filtration operations that should deeply concern us all,"" the State Department said. Russia has denied the allegations, claiming that it's providing humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians from occupied areas. Anatolii V. told HRW that Russian forces had also detained his stepson during house-to-house searches. He said his stepson was released after three weeks in custody, with six broken ribs and a broken jaw. When a Ukrainian volunteer tried to rescue 17 children from a Mariupol health care facility, Russian-backed forces put the children on a bus and drove them to the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, which is controlled by Russian backed separatist, HRW said. The whereabouts of 11 of the children were still unknown, according to the report. Two teenage brothers feeling Mariupol were forcibly separated from their mother, who previously served in Ukraine's armed forces, the report says. After authorities promised they would be reunited with their mother, they were eventually retrieved by their father who lives in Russia, according the the report. Russian authorities told the man that the younger son would be placed in an orphanage. The mother's fate is unknown, HRW said. Ukrainians told the New York-based international rights group that the conditions in the filtration camps where they were held were squalid, with little food and sickness spreading. ""The evidence of Russian forces interrogating, detaining, and forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, including children, continues to mount,"" U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said last week.

""This is another confirmation of the excellent cooperation between the United States of America and Montenegro and a proof that we can count on their support in any situation,"" the ministry said of the deployment of the Cyber Action Team. Last weekend, Montenegro's Agency for National Security said the country was ""under a hybrid war at the moment,"" blaming the attack squarely on Russia, though without providing evidence. A cybercriminal extortion gang has claimed responsibility for at least part of the attack, infecting a parliamentary office with a variant of ransomware known as Cuba. Russian-speaking cybercriminals generally operate without Kremlin interference, as long as they don't target friendly nations. Montenegrin officials said Russia has a strong motive for such an attack because the Balkan state, once considered a strong Russian ally, joined NATO in 2017 despite strong opposition from the Kremlin. It has also joined Western sanctions against Moscow because of its invasion of Ukraine. Other Eastern European states deemed enemies of Russia have recently also sustained cyberattacks, mostly nuisance-level denial of service campaigns, in recent weeks. Targets have included networks in Moldova, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Albania. But the attack against Montenegro's infrastructure seemed more sustained and extensive, with targets including water supply systems, transportation services and online government services, among many others. On Monday, government officials said that an attack by hackers on the information system of Montenegrin institutions was still ongoing, but that the system will not suffer permanent damage. ""A huge amount of money was invested in the attack on our system"", said Minister of Public Administration Maras Dukaj He added that his ministry cannot determine the source of the attack, but that there is ""strong indication that it is coming from Russia."" The Director of the Directorate for Information Security, Dusan Polovic, said that ""150 cells"" in a dozen state institutions were infected, and that the data of the Ministry of Public Administration was not permanently damaged. ""The infected stations have been removed from the network and hard drives have been removed from them for further forensics,"" he said, adding that ""the priority is to put the tax system into operation, but this will be done only when it is completely secure.""",3,4.665737731807161,6.573185112249359,-1.907447380442198,7
2022-08-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-us-confirms-death-american-citizen/,U.S. confirms death of another American in Ukraine,"An American citizen has been killed in Ukraine, a U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News on Friday. Newsweek first reported the latest death of a U.S. national amid the war, citing claims by a Russian official who said online that an American volunteer was killed fighting alongside Ukraine's military. The U.S. official told CBS News they could not provide any further information about the American who died, out of respect for the privacy of the family. Oleg Kozhemyako, governor of Russia's far eastern Primorsky Krai region, which is thousands of miles away from the fighting in Ukraine, said members of the ""Tiger"" military unit from his area had killed the American during a battle. ""American mercenary was destroyed in Ukraine,"" Kozhemyako said in a Friday post on his channel on the Telegram messaging app. The post was accompanied by photos of both a U.S. passport and Ukrainian state-issued ID identifying the purported American casualty. Kozhemyako claimed the man, whose identity has not been confirmed by family members or U.S. officials, was killed ""in the first clash literally immediately after arriving at the front line."" The Russian politician claimed the American man was killed when a ""trained group of mercenaries from different countries"" tried to move in on Russian positions, but the ""attack was repulsed, the positions were defended."" He did not say where or when the fighting occurred. During the six months since Russia launched its war on Ukraine, several American volunteers, mostly former U.S. servicemembers, have been killed in the fighting. In late July, the families of Luke Lucyszyn and Bryan Young confirmed to CBS News that the men were killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine. The still-unidentified man whose death was confirmed on Friday is at least the seventh American to die in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began.",13,5.995565438656052,3.1602126772878556,2.8353527613681964,2
2022-08-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ukraine-independence-day-attack-reported-six-months-after-start-of-war/,"22 killed in Independence Day attack in Ukraine, Zelenskyy says","President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces launched a rocket attack on a Ukrainian train station on Wednesday, the embattled country's Independence Day, killing 22 people. Zelenskyy had warned for days that Moscow might attempt ""something particularly cruel"" this week. The lethal attack took place in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 people in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukrainian news agencies quoted Zelenskyy as telling the U.N. Security Council via video. The president's office also reported that an 11-year-old child was killed by rocket fire earlier in the day in the settlement. ""Chaplyne is our pain today,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. At one point, Zelenskyy put the number of wounded at about 50. The deputy head of Zelenskyy's office later said 22 people were wounded in the attack, which hit five passenger rail cars. Ukraine had been bracing for especially heavy attacks around the national holiday that commemorates Ukraine's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Wednesday also marked the six-month point in the war. Days ahead of Independence Day, Kyiv authorities banned large gatherings in the capital through Thursday for fear of missile strikes. Residents of Kyiv, which has been largely spared in recent months, woke up Wednesday to air raid sirens, but no immediate strikes followed. As the day wore on, Russian bombardments were reported in the country's east, west and center, with the most serious attack apparently at the train station. Outgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson marked the holiday with a visit to Kyiv — his third since the war broke out — and other European leaders used the occasion to pledge unwavering support for Ukraine, locked in a battle that was widely expected to be a lightning conquest by Moscow but has turned into a grinding war of attrition. U.S. President Joe Biden announced a new military aid package of nearly $3 billion to help Ukrainian forces fight for years to come. Over the weekend, Zelenskyy cautioned that Russia ""may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel"" this week. He repeated the warnings ahead of the train station attack, saying, ""Russian provocations and brutal strikes are a possibility."" Nevertheless, a festive atmosphere prevailed during the day at Kyiv's Maidan square as thousands of residents posed for pictures next to burned-out Russian tanks put on display. Folk singers set up, and many revelers — ignoring the sirens — were out and about in traditionally embroidered dresses and shirts. Others were fearful. ""I can't sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,"" said a retiree who gave only her first name, Tetyana, her voice shaking with emotion. ""This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people."" In a holiday message to the country, Zelenskyy exulted over Ukraine's success in fending off Moscow's forces since the invasion, saying: ""On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!"" Britain's Johnson urged Western allies to stand by Ukraine through the winter. ""This is not the time to put forward flimsy negotiating proposals,"" he said. ""You can't negotiate with a bear when it's eating your leg or with a street robber when he has you pinned to the floor."" A car bombing outside Moscow that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin on Saturday also heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator. Ukraine has denied any involvement. Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of his counterparts from a security organization dominated by Russia and China, claimed the slow pace of Moscow's military action was due to what he said was an effort to spare civilians. Russian forces have repeatedly targeted civilian areas in cities, including hospitals and a Mariupol theater where hundreds of people were taking shelter. But Shoigu said Russia is carrying out strikes with precision weapons against Ukrainian military targets, and ""everything is done to avoid civilian casualties."" ""Undoubtedly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we do it deliberately,"" he said. On the battlefield, Russian forces struck several towns and villages in Donetsk province in the east over 24 hours, killing one person, authorities said. A building materials superstore in the city of Donetsk was hit by a shell and erupted in flames, the mayor said. There were no immediate reports of any injuries. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Russians again shelled the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, damaging several buildings and wounding people, authorities said. Russian troops also shelled the city of Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. In addition, Russian rockets struck unspecified targets in the Khmelnytskyi region, about 180 miles west of Kyiv, the regional governor said. Attacks there have been infrequent.",17,3.7115317211049645,2.3711970260333772,1.3403346950715873,22
2022-08-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-6-months-31-independence-day/,"Ukraine's trademark defiance on display as it marks 31 years of independence, and 6 months fending off Putin's invasion","Kyiv, Ukraine — It has been exactly six months since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine. But that wasn't the only anniversary being marked Wednesday: It's also Ukraine's Independence Day, and officials from Kyiv to Washington have warned that Russia could launch new attacks to mark both occasions. Despite the threat, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta said Ukrainians were choosing to celebrate their country's 31 years of independence from what used to be the Soviet Union with their trademark defiance, not fear. Russian tanks destroyed over the last six months of grueling warfare were put on display in the streets of Kyiv. It was a very different atmosphere from last year's Independence Day celebrations. The country's wartime president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has long swapped his suit and tie for military fatigues. He set the tone on Wednesday when he raised the familiar yellow and blue flag, boldly proclaiming to his people and the world that it would once again fly over the whole country — including the Crimean Peninsula, which Putin unilaterally annexed in 2014. Michael Carpenter, U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, called Russia's six-month, ""barbaric assault on its peaceful, democratic, and sovereign neighbor"" a ""naked attempt to reverse the events that occurred 31 years ago by turning Ukraine once again into a captive nation."" But even Ukraine's seemingly unshakeable resolve couldn't obscure the cloud of risk hanging over Wednesday's celebrations, and Zelenskyy didn't pretend otherwise. ""Repugnant Russian provocations are possible,"" he warned his people. ""Respect curfew and act on air raid sirens."" Economist Andriy Dligach told CBS News that half a year of fighting had taught Ukraine a valuable lesson: That the only way to deal with a bully, is to stand up to them. He said it was ""amazing"" that Ukraine has not only survived, but that it has continued ""to show the whole world… We shouldn't be afraid of Putin or of war."" ""We should be as brave as possible, to be open and to be ready for the new world,"" Dligach said. He knows the costs for his country have been tremendous, but the stakes couldn't be higher. ""We are trying to find a way how to not only survive, but to win quickly, in order to save Ukrainian infrastructure, save Ukrainian economics, and first of all, save our lives."" The capital city of Kyiv has become the defining symbol of Ukraine's bravery. Putin's hopes of a swift victory came to nothing, as his invading forces were prevented from seizing the city. Instead, civilians who fled to the countryside towns of Bucha and Irpin bore the brunt of a month of terror unleashed by Russian troops. Ukrainians are now accustomed to the sound of constant air raid sirens, which routinely sound the alarm in Kyiv. In Russia — where it's not even legal to refer to the invasion as a war, but only as a ""special military operation"" — questions are surfacing. ""I really don't understand who needs this war,"" said Russian cemetery worker Olga Gryaznova. ""The mothers, too, keeping asking: 'Who needs this war?'"" But six months later, it continues. The destroyed Russian tanks on display in Kyiv serve as a clear reminder that Putin's hopes of a swift victory parade down its streets were halted by a nation fighting desperately to hold onto its freedom.",17,2.536747206402007,2.9342658391645764,-0.39751863276256927,22
2022-08-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/daria-dugina-car-bombing-russia-fsb-blames-ukrainian-intelligence/,Russia blames Ukraine for nationalist Daria Dugina's car bombing death,"Russia's top counterintelligence agency on Monday blamed Ukrainian spy services for organizing the killing of Daria Dugina, a 29-year-old political commentator and daughter of a leading Russian nationalist ideologue, in a car bombing just outside Moscow on Saturday night. Dugina's commentary frequently echoed that of her father, Alexander Dugin, a philosopher, writer and political theorist, whom some in the West described as ""Putin's brain."" On Sunday, Ukraine's presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak denied any Ukrainian involvement in the killing. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the main KGB successor agency, said Monday that Dugina's killing had been ""prepared and perpetrated by the Ukrainian special services."" The FSB accused Ukrainian citizen Natalya Vovk of carrying out the bombing, saying she arrived in Russia in July with her 12-year-old daughter and rented an apartment in the building where Dugina lived, in order to shadow her. The agency said Vovk and her daughter were at a Russian nationalist festival which Daria Dugina and her father attended just before the car bombing. The identity of the suspect and any evidence linking her to the attack could not be independently confirmed. The FSB said Vovk and her daughter left Russia for Estonia after Dugina's killing, using a different vehicle license plate on their way out of the country. Russian law enforcement said it would seek to extradite the suspect to Russia, threatening ""tough actions"" if Estonia refuses to cooperate. Russian media reports cited witnesses as saying the SUV that was bombed belonged to Alexander Dugin, and that he had decided at the last minute to travel in another vehicle. On Sunday, Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist ""Donetsk People's Republic"" in Ukraine's east, quickly blamed the blast on ""terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to kill Alexander Dugin."" Dugin, who has been slapped with U.S. and European sanctions, has been a prominent proponent of the ""Russian world"" concept, a spiritual and political ideology that emphasizes traditional values, the restoration of Russia's global clout and the unity of all ethnic Russians throughout the world. He has been vehemently supported Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send troops into Ukraine and urged the Kremlin to step up its operations in the country. Dugina herself was sanctioned by the United States in March for her work as chief editor of United World International, a website that the U.S. described as a disinformation source, as well as by the British government last month. The U.S. sanctions announcement cited a United World article this year that contended Ukraine would ""perish"" if it were admitted to NATO. Dugina had also appeared as a commentator on nationalist TV channel Tsargrad, where Dugin had served as chief editor. In an appearance on Russian television just last Thursday, Dugina said, ""People in the West are living in a dream, in a dream given to them by global hegemony."" She called America ""a zombie society"" in which people opposed Russia but couldn't find it on a map. The car bombing, unusual for Moscow since the turbulent 1990s, is likely to aggravate tensions between Russia and Ukraine. ""My daughter Daria Dugina was brutally killed by an explosion in front of my eyes. She was a beautiful, Orthodox girl. A patriot, a military correspondent, an expert on the central channels, and a philosopher. Her speeches and reporting have always been profound, grounded and restrained. She never called for violence and war,"" Dugin said Monday. ""Our hearts yearn for more than just revenge or retribution. It's too petty, not Russian. We only need our victory.""",3,4.417584827544145,3.6513825850329753,0.7662022425111696,29
2022-08-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bellingcat-tiktok-ukraine-60-minutes-2022-08-21/,How Bellingcat is using TikTok to investigate the war in Ukraine - 60 Minutes,"Staff at the international collective Bellingcat are investigating allegations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine by using publicly available material on the internet — including photos and videos posted on social media. ""We are discovering the enormity of war for the first time in our lifetime in a way that is near us and a way that we can see it in social media, and Instagram, and TikTok videos,"" said Christo Grozev, Bellingcat's executive director. ""And the volume of war crimes that we believe we are discovering in our daily work is overwhelming."" Grozev told 60 Minutes this spring that more open-source information exists from the war in Ukraine than in any other previous war. In previous conflicts, such as the civil war in Syria, static photographs were more common and available than videos. New social media platforms, such as Telegram and TikTok, have changed that. Grozev estimates that about 70% of the evidence Bellingcat is gathering about the war in Ukraine now comes from TikTok content. According to Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, information from the video sharing platform began amassing prior to Russia's February invasion, when civilians posted TikTok videos of tanks driving down Russian streets. These videos not only showed the buildup before the invasion, Higgins said, but they also identified the specific units and equipment the Russian military planned to use. In instances where Bellingcat suspects Russians deployed cluster munitions into Ukraine from rocket launchers fired from inside Russia, Bellingcat says they can identify the units likely responsible. ""In some cases, it's actually possible to see these convoys through their entire journey from their base all the way to the border,"" Higgins said. ""So all these bits of information give us additional evidence that we can use for accountability purposes in the future."" To preserve the evidence of possible war crimes, the U.S. House Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees in May sent letters to social media companies to urge them to archive the content on their platforms. Chairs of the two committees wrote to the CEOs of Meta, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok and asked that they preserve content, including metadata, that could potentially be used in international court to prove war crimes and human rights violations in Ukraine. Bellingcat has also used open-source evidence to dispel Russia's claim that potential war crimes committed in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha were perpetrated after Ukrainian forces had reentered the town. In one example, researchers at Bellingcat verified aerial video filmed by Ukraine's military reportedly on March 3, when Russian forces held Bucha. The video shows a woman walking a bicycle onto a street where a Russian armored vehicle sits. As the woman rounds the corner, the Russian vehicle fires at the woman. Another aerial video shot in late March by Ukrainian forces and verified by Bellingcat shows a body lying in the road at the location where the woman was shot. The Ukrainian military entered Bucha at the beginning of April. The Kremlin has responded to Bellingcat's investigations in the Ukraine war. In a statement released in May, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""In general, the information of Bellingcat must be perceived through special filters: sometimes with a sense of humor, and sometimes as a deliberate lie and distortion of reality."" Russia's Prosecutor-General in mid-March blocked Bellingcat's website, preventing those in Russia from accessing the group's investigations, including research about Russia's assassination program. After all the evidence his team has found while looking into the atrocities Russia has allegedly committed, Higgins knows Bellingcat's work invites the potential for danger. ""It does involve risk,"" Higgins said. ""But then defending liberty, human rights, democracy involves taking risks. It's when we stop taking risks and we let the fear take hold that we see democracy die."" The video above was originally published on May 15, 2022 and was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer. It was edited by Will Croxton.",13,2.734520161309834,2.1545147798244484,0.5800053814853858,26
2022-08-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bellingcat-history-60-minutes-2022-08-21/,Bellingcat's path to tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine - 60 Minutes,"The investigation of alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine is the biggest project in online data detective team Bellingcat's short career. Eliot Higgins started Bellingcat in 2014. ""I was not someone with a professional background. I was doing this merely as a hobby,"" Higgins told Scott Pelley for a report this week on 60 Minutes. ""I was working for a company that housed refugees in the U.K. I then worked for a company that manufactured pipes. And then a company that manufactured lingerie. So, I had a wide range of experience but nothing that was directly related to conflict."" On his off-hours, the conflict in Syria fascinated Higgins—especially how social media was exposing atrocities there. But his search for the truth began with a fairy tale. ""Bellingcat comes from the name of a fable, Belling the Cat. And it's about a group of mice who are very scared of a very large cat,"" Higgins said. ""So, they have a meeting, and they decide to put a bell on the cat's neck. But then they realize that no one knows how to do it, and no one is willing to volunteer to do it. So, what we're teaching people to do is bell the cat."" Higgins belled his first predator in 2014, when Russia went to war in eastern Ukraine. Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was high over Ukraine on its way to Asia when a missile brought it down. 298 were killed. Everyone denied responsibility, but Higgins noticed, in the hours before the shootdown, there were many social media posts from bystanders who saw a missile launcher on a flatbed trailer traveling in eastern Ukraine – the area mostly controlled by Russian-backed rebels. ""We started discovering social media posts of people who had seen the missile launcher being transported,"" Higgins said. ""And we also had social media posts from people who said there's a rocket that's just been shot up from this direction. And we could actually use their social media profiles to figure out where they lived."" Earlier posts, capturing images of the missile battery before it had been transported from Russia to rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine the day MH17 was shot down, were written by Russian soldiers homesick for family. Higgins found clues in each image—billboards, buildings, road signs—that let him fix the location and time of each post. When he arranged all of the social media into a timeline, he could run the convoy backward to its starting point. ""Using all those videos we were able to trace it all the way back to the military brigade it came from, the 53rd Air Defense Brigade,"" Higgins said. ""In Russia. And we used their social media profiles, the soldiers, their family members and everyone around them to reconstruct basically their network online which meant we could get their names, their ranks, their photographs, see who was in that convoy and who traveled to the border. So that allowed us to prove that Russia provided the missile launcher that shot down MH-17."" The Dutch government would later indict four men, three Russians and a Ukrainian, for 298 counts of murder, basing some of its investigation on Bellingcat's work. That trial is underway in the Netherlands, although the defendants refused to appear. After Bellingcat published its findings, Russia imposed a new law. ""The Russian government passed a specific law banning soldiers from carrying-- mobile devices during hostilities, which is dubbed in Russia 'the Bellingcat law.'"" Christo Grozev said. Grozev is executive director of Bellingcat, leading its staff of 30. His personal focus has been on Russian political assassinations, Bellingcat's next big project. Bellingcat's investigation started in 2018 after a Russian defector and his daughter, living in Britain, were poisoned with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent. The British had passport photos and false names of two suspects, who they thought had flown from Russia, but nothing else. Grozev knew that Russia's government and commercial records are for sale on an online black market. So, with the fake names, he bought the suspect's passport records. The numbers on the two passports were identical, except for the last digit. Grozev said that meant the passports were clearly made one after the other. Suspicious, Grozev started data mining. Based on official records, it seemed as though both men were born at the age of 32. They didn't have records such as licenses, vehicle ownership, apartment rentals, dating before that time. And there was an unusual stamp on the passport documents. ""There was a big black stamp in the corner of their file which said, 'Do not provide information on this person. In case of a query, call this number,'"" Grozev said. ""And sure enough, we called that number, and it was the [Russian] Ministry of Defense."" When the Ministry of Defense answered, Grozev knew the would-be assassins were military intelligence agents. To match their faces to their true identities, he spent weeks combing yearbooks and photographs from Russian military academies. ""The end result was that we were able not only to identify the real identities and the affiliation to the military intelligence,"" Grozev said. ""We were able to find a third and a fourth member of the same kill team that the British did not even know about."" Over months, Grozev uncovered a network of Russian hitmen, working throughout Europe, armed with nerve agent from a government lab. Later, he uncovered another network, after buying airline manifests and finding some of the assassins' travel overlapped the campaign stops of Alexei Navalny, the top political opponent of Vladimir Putin. ""And we found a total of 66 overlaps, way beyond any statistical possibility for a coincidence,"" Grozev said. ""They'd been shadowing him for four years. They started shadowing him the moment he announced his presidential aspirations in 2017. Apparently being on standby for a possible assassination whenever they would get the signal."" A signal came in 2020. On a campaign trip, Navalny was poisoned with that same nerve agent. He recovered in a German hospital, returned to oppose Putin, and is now in prison. Bellingcat's investigation found assassins also tailed other Putin opponents. ""And we found, for example, that the team that had poisoned Navalny had tailed at a minimum 12 other opposition figures, three of whom had been killed, in fact, poisoned,"" Grozev said. ""What we have found out is that none of these crimes could have been perpetrated without Vladimir Putin being-- in the know, and not only aware but approving of all of these crimes,"" Grozev said. ""So, in a nutshell, what we found out was that Putin is operating an industrial-scale assassination program on his own people."" Investigations like that are published on Bellingcat's website, which Russia blocked shortly after it invaded Ukraine. Bellingcat is a nonprofit foundation which has trained more than 4,000 journalists and war crime investigators in its techniques of geolocation, verification, and data mining.

Russian shelling collapsed balconies and blew out windows in the southern region of Mykolayiv, injuring at least nine civilians, authorities said. A five-story apartment building and private homes in the town of Voznesensk were badly damaged, the Black Sea region's governor said. ""As of 13.30 p.m. (local time) - nine wounded, including four children. All children in a serious condition. Ages range from 3 to 17 years,"" Gov. Vitaliy Kim wrote in a Telegram post. He added that a young girl lost an eye as a result of Saturday's attack. Meanwhile, there was hope of a possible diplomatic breakthrough at the embattled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports. Russia and Ukraine have agreed to allow inspectors from the nuclear watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency access to the complex. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he's grateful but wary. Reflecting the broadening front lines of the nearly six-month war in Ukraine, a Ukrainian airstrike hit targets in the largest Russian-occupied city in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, according to Ukrainian and Kremlin-backed local officials. The Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol said preliminary reports pointed to ""a precise hit"" on a Russian military base. The head of the Kremlin-backed administration said the attack damaged residential areas and slightly injured one civilian. In its daily update, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said intensified combat took place around Bakhmut, a small city whose capture would enable Russia to threaten the two largest remaining Ukrainian-held urban centers in the eastern Donbas region. Bakhmut has for weeks been a key target of Moscow's eastern offensive as the Russian military tries to complete a monthslong campaign to conquer all of the Donbas, an industrial region that borders Russia where pro-Moscow separatists have self-proclaimed a pair of independent republics. A local Ukrainian official reported sustained fighting Saturday morning near four settlements on the border between Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, which together make up the contested region. Luhansk Gov. Serhii Haidai did not name the settlements or mention Bakhmut, which lies around 16 miles from the border between the two provinces. Russian forces overran nearly all of Luhansk last month and since then have focused on capturing Ukrainian-held areas of Donetsk. Russian shelling killed seven civilians Friday in Donetsk province, including four in Bakhmut, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko wrote Saturday on Telegram. Taking Bakhmut would give the Russians room to advance on the province's main Ukrainian-held cities, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The General Staff update said Sloviansk and Kramatorsk also were targeted Friday along with the Kharkiv region to the north, home to Ukraine's second-largest city. Neither Moscow nor Kyiv commented on the airstrike aimed at Russian-occupied Melitopol in southern Ukraine. Earlier Saturday morning, the Russian Defense Ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, claimed that pro-Russia forces had shot down Ukrainian shells near the city, as well as near a key power station in the Kherson region, which the Russians seized early in the war. The head of the Kremlin-installed administration in Melitopol confirmed Saturday that the city had come under Ukrainian fire. ""During the night, the Kyiv regime launched two attacks on our beautiful Melitopol, on residential areas of the city. Russian air defense systems shot down missiles, but as a result of the shelling, the houses of residents on (two) streets were partially destroyed and damaged,"" Galina Danilchenko said on Telegram. The Ukrainian mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Ferodov, said local Ukrainian authorities were gathering information on the strike. ""Tonight, there were powerful explosions in Melitopol, which the whole city heard,"" Ferodov said. ""According to preliminary data, (it was) a precise hit on one of the Russian military bases, which the Russian fascists are trying to restore for the umpteenth time in the airfield area,"" Shortly after Dalnichenko's post, Ferodov reported that residential areas in the city were hit but he blamed that strike that destroyed about 10 homes on the Moscow-backed forces stationed in Melitopol. He also reiterated his earlier claim that a Ukrainian airstrike badly damaged a Russian military base. The Ukrainian governor of the southern Zaporizhzhia region, which is partly controlled by Russia and where Melitopol is located, said late Friday evening that a child was seriously injured by Russian shelling on the outskirts of the regional capital that day. The governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram that the 8-year-old girl remained on a ventilator following surgery, but was in ""stable"" condition. Starch added that the same attack in the city of Zaporizhzhia left two adult civilians with ""injuries of moderate severity."" Ukrainian officials have indicated plans for a counter-offensive to win back occupied areas in the country's south while Russia had most of its focus on the east. Local authorities reported renewed Russian shelling overnight along a broad front, including of the northern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, which border Russia, as well as of the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region and Mykolayiv.",17,7.308566776896663,1.959916440515872,5.348650336380791,17

With the meetings held at such a high level – it was the first visit to Ukraine by Erdogan since the war began, and the second by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres – some had hoped for breakthroughs, if not toward an overall peace, then at least on specific issues. But none was apparent. Meeting in the western city of Lviv, far from the front lines, the leaders discussed expanding exchanges of prisoners of war and arranging for U.N. atomic energy experts to visit and help secure Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, which is in the middle of fierce fighting that has raised fears of catastrophe. Erdogan has positioned himself as a go-between in efforts to stop the fighting. While Turkey is a member of NATO, its wobbly economy is reliant on Russia for trade, and it has tried to steer a middle course between the two combatants. The Turkish president urged the international community after the talks not to abandon diplomatic efforts to end the war that has killed tens of thousands and forced more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes. He repeated that Turkey is willing to act as ""mediator and facilitator"" and added, ""I remain convinced that the war will end at the negotiating table."" In March, Turkey hosted talks in Istanbul between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators that failed to end the hostilities. One major topic at the talks in Lviv was the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the complex. Condemning the Kremlin for what he called ""nuclear blackmail,"" Zelenskyy demanded that Russian troops leave the plant and that a team from the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency be allowed in. ""The area needs to be demilitarized, and we must tell it as it is: Any potential damage in Zaporizhzhia is suicide,"" Guterres said at a news conference. Erdogan likewise expressed concern over the fighting around the plant, saying, ""We don't want to experience another Chernobyl"" - a reference to the world's worst nuclear accident, in Ukraine in 1986. Zelenskyy and the U.N. chief agreed Thursday on arrangements for an IAEA mission to the plant, according to the president's website. But it was not immediately clear whether the Kremlin would consent to the terms. As for a pullout of troops, a Russian Foreign Ministry official said earlier that that would leave the plant ""vulnerable."" Fears mounted Thursday when Russian and Ukrainian authorities accused each other of plotting to attack the site and then blame the other side. Late Thursday, multiple rounds of Ukrainian shelling struck the city in which the power plant is located, a Russian official reported. Guterres used the talks in Lviv to name Gen. Carlos dos Santos Cruz of Brazil to lead a previously announced U.N. fact-finding mission to the Olenivka prison where 53 Ukrainian POWs were killed in an explosion in July. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the blast. Also on the agenda Thursday: an increase in grain exports. Earlier this summer, the U.N. and Turkey brokered an agreement clearing the way for Ukraine to export 22 million tons of corn and other grain stuck in its Black Sea ports since the Russian invasion. The blockage has worsened world food shortages, driven up prices and heightened fears of famine, especially in Africa. Yet even with the deal, only a trickle of Ukrainian grain has made it out – some 600,000 tons by Turkey's estimate. Zelenskyy said Thursday that he proposed expanding the shipments. Guterres, for his part, touted the operation's success but added, ""There is a long way to go before this will be translated into the daily life of people at their local bakery and in their markets."" On the battlefield, meanwhile, at least 17 people were killed overnight in heavy Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Ukrainian authorities said Thursday. Russia's military claimed that it struck a base for foreign mercenaries in Kharkiv, killing 90. There was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian side. In the latest incident on Russian soil near the border with Ukraine, an ammunition dump caught fire in a village in the Belgorod region, the regional governor said. No casualties were reported. Video posted online, whose authenticity couldn't be verified, showed orange flames and black smoke, with the sound of multiple explosions. Elsewhere, Russian officials reported that anti-aircraft defenses shot down drones in the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula at Kerch and near the Belbek airfield in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol. Explosions in recent weeks on the peninsula have destroyed warplanes and caused other damage at military airfields. Heightening international tensions, Russia deployed warplanes carrying state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to its Kaliningrad region, an enclave surrounded by NATO members Lithuania and Poland.",17,2.9858918152232157,3.034550244322157,-0.04865842909894136,17
2022-08-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-aid-ukraine-scan-eagle-surveillance-drones-mine-resistant-vehicles/,Newest U.S. aid package to Ukraine to include surveillance drones,"The U.S. for the first time Friday said it will give Ukraine Scan Eagle surveillance drones, mine-resistant vehicles, anti-armor rounds and howitzer weapons to help Ukrainian forces regain territory and mount a counteroffensive against Russian invaders. A senior defense official told reporters that a new $775 million aid package will include 15 Scan Eagles, 40 mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles known as MRAPs with mine-clearing rollers, and 2,000 anti-armor rounds that can help Ukraine troops move forward in the south and east, where Russian forces have placed mines. The official said the U.S. is looking to help shape and arm the Ukrainian force of the future as the war drags on. ""These capabilities are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine's position at the negotiating table,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. This latest aid comes as Russia's war on Ukraine is about to reach the six-month mark. It brings the total U.S. military aid to Ukraine to about $10.6 billion since the beginning of the Biden administration. It is the 19th time the Pentagon has provided equipment from Defense Department stocks to Ukraine since August 2021. The U.S. has provided howitzer ammunition in the past, but this is the first time it will send 16 of the weapon systems. The aid package also includes 1,500 anti-tank missiles, 1,000 javelin missiles and an undisclosed number of high-speed, anti-radiation or HARM missiles that target radar systems. The Ukrainian forces have been successfully using various precision artillery systems to try and hold off Russian forces and take back territory Moscow has gained. The defense official briefed reporters on the new weapons aid on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Defense Department. For much of the last four months of the war, Russia has concentrated on capturing the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists have controlled some territory as self-proclaimed republics for eight years. Russian forces have made some incremental gains in the east, but they have also been put on the defensive in other regions, as Ukraine ratchets up its attacks in Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. The Russian-occupied territory was seized by Moscow in 2014. Nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed last week at an airbase on Crimea in strikes that highlighted the Ukrainians' capacity to strike deep behind enemy lines. Russian leaders have warned that striking facilities in Crimea marks an escalation in the conflict fueled by the U.S. and NATO allies and threatens to pull America deeper into the war. One Western official said Friday that the war is at a ""near operational standstill,"" with neither side able to launch major offensives. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said the whole tempo of the campaign has slowed, partly because both sides recognize that ""this is a marathon not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important."" But the U.S. and Western officials both said that Ukraine has been able to launch successful attacks deep behind Russian battle lines, which is eroding logistics support and command and control of Moscow's forces, and harming their morale. The U.S. official said that while Ukrainian troops haven't been able to retake a lot of territory, they have been able to significantly weaken Russian positions in a number of places. Efforts to tamp down the fighting have also continued. On Thursday, Turkey's leader and the U.N. chief met in western Ukraine with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They discussed a range of issues including prisoner exchanges and an effort to get U.N. atomic energy experts to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The facility has been controlled by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began on Feb. 24 and has been the target of a number of explosions. Kyiv and Moscow accuse each other of shelling the plant, stoking international fears of a catastrophe on the continent. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would follow up with Russian President Vladimir Putin, given that most of the matters discussed would require the Kremlin's agreement. Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report.",14,4.30246529409194,6.976722900637342,-2.6742576065454022,12
2022-08-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-crimes-calls-for-nuremberg-style-tribunal-crime-of-aggression/,Could Russia's Vladimir Putin face a Nuremberg-style tribunal over the Ukraine war?,"London — As prosecutors gather evidence of thousands of war crimes allegedly committed by Russian troops in Ukraine, a number of prominent figures have joined the Ukrainian government to call for a new Nuremberg-style tribunal to hold Russia's leaders to account for one specific crime they say is falling through the cracks: the crime of aggression. Ukraine is working with various international bodies to prosecute war crimes, and it's already charging people within its own criminal justice system. But prosecution for the crime of aggression, advocates for a special tribunal say, may be the best way to see Russian President Vladimir Putin himself face justice for the war. ""When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities… it's difficult, of course, to speak about the efficiency of international law,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba said when the call for a tribunal was first announced in March. ""But this is the only tool of civilization that is available to us to make sure that, in the end, eventually, all those who made this war possible will be brought to justice."" Since 1945, there have been four types of defined international crime: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression. The last, articulated under the International Criminal Court's founding Rome Statute, is defined as ""waging a manifestly illegal war,"" professor and international law expert Philippe Sands told CBS News. Aggression ""is a leadership crime,"" Sands explained. ""It is only committed by those who have the power, the capacity to decide to wage or continue a manifestly illegal war. What that means in the context of Ukraine; you're talking about Mr. Putin, Mr. Lavrov [Russian Foreign Minister], the Minister of Defense, the top military officials, the top intelligence people."" But prosecuting Russia for the crime of aggression over the war in Ukraine is no straightforward task under the current international justice system. In the specific case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine — barring an extremely unlikely referral from the United Nations Security Council, where Russia has veto power — the International Criminal Court does not have jurisdiction over aggression. ""There is a gap in the international legal order,"" Sands said. ""The crime exists in international law, but there's no way to enforce it."" With the other war crimes or crimes against humanity allegedly committed by Russian troops in Ukraine, it may be difficult or even impossible to establish a direct connection to Russia's leaders. ""I think it's possible that you can find evidence that links Putin directly to war crimes, crimes against humanity, but there's absolutely no doubt that Putin is guilty of this initial crime — what the Nuremberg trial authors called the 'initial and fundamental and supreme crime' — the crime of actually planning an aggression against a sovereign state,"" former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who's backing the establishment of a tribunal for Ukraine, told CBS News. ""The only thing [Putin] will understand is if there is a strong response from the West, and part of the strong response is to tell him that he cannot escape with impunity for crimes that he himself has committed and is responsible for directing,"" Brown said. Mykola Gnatovsky, a law professor and advisor to Ukraine's foreign minister, agrees that a strong international response to Russia's actions is necessary to show that invading a sovereign state without justification is unacceptable. ""We are dealing with current dramatic, tragic situation, to a significant degree, because in 2014, when Russia attacked Ukraine and seized parts of its territory, the international community has not been able to provide a strong response which would be strong enough to deter any further action by the aggressor, to hold the aggressor to account,"" Gnatovsky said when the initiative to create a tribunal was announced in March. Some major geopolitical powerhouses, including the United States, have yet to explicitly back the call for a special international tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression. ""They're worried that if you create a special tribunal for one permanent member of the Security Council today, then tomorrow another could be created in relation to some allegation of a British crime or a French crime or an American crime,"" Sands told CBS News. ""There is an elephant in the room here, and that, of course, is Iraq."" Brown, who was Britain's leader at the end of the U.K. involvement in the Iraq war, said any special tribunal would not be retrospective. ""The crime of aggression is one that has only been added to the International Criminal Court's statutes in the last few years,"" Brown said. ""So we're talking not retrospectively, we're talking about action taken on the basis of decisions that have been made by the international community very recently."" ""The United States has been a leader, historically, on the international stage with respect to accountability for the most serious crimes and, of course, the United States was one of the countries that formed the Nuremberg Tribunal after the Second World War,"" James Goldston, the executive director of the Open Society Justice Initiative, told CBS News. ""That being said, it is no surprise that major powers including the United States may look with some trepidation at prosecutions for the crime of aggression, given their own historical activities, and given their own desire to preserve freedom of action going forward."" The Open Society Justice Initiative has published a model indictment that could be used to try Russia's leaders for the crime of aggression. ""If Putin is not prosecuted for aggression, I want the historical record to reflect that the legal case against him was clear, and that the failure was purely political,"" said Rebecca Hamilton, an associate professor of law at American University in Washington D.C., who co-authored an early version of a model indictment. ""What Putin has done and is continuing to do against the Ukrainian people is criminal,"" said Hamilton. ""It is as criminal today as it was when he launched this war back in February. And while the rest of the world is start[ing] to get distracted by other issues, the Ukrainian people do not have the luxury of 'moving on.'""",13,7.073363670125624,6.776909893372572,0.29645377675305173,11
2022-08-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/crimea-ukraine-russia-explosions/,Explosions rock ammunition depot in Crimea in suspected Ukrainian attack,"Explosions and fires ripped through an ammunition depot in Russia-annexed Crimea on Tuesday in the second suspected Ukrainian attack on the peninsula in just over a week, forcing the evacuation of more than 3,000 people. Russia blamed the blasts in the village of Mayskoye on an ""act of sabotage,"" without naming the perpetrators. Separately, the Russian business newspaper Kommersant quoted residents as saying plumes of black smoke also rose over an air base in Crimea's Gvardeyskoye. Ukraine stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility for any of the blasts, including those that destroyed nine Russian planes at another Crimean air base last week. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has used it to launch attacks against the country in the war that began nearly six months ago. In another reported act of sabotage, Russia's Tass news agency quoted the FSB security agency as saying Ukrainian operatives blew up six high-voltage transmission towers earlier this month in Russia's Kursk region, close to Ukraine. If Ukrainian forces were behind the explosions in Crimea, that would represent a significant escalation in the war. Such attacks could also indicate that Ukrainian operatives are able to penetrate deeply into Russian-occupied territory, supplementing attempts to weaken Moscow's forces on the front lines. ""Frankly, that changes the front across the board,"" retired U.S. Marine Corps intelligence officer Hal Kempfer told CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata after the attack last week. ""If they can continue the momentum, if they can continue to do deep strikes, if they continue to make gains across the Kherson Oblast, they might be able to push all the way across that southern flank."" That strike drew a quick, brutal response from Russia. President Vladimir Putin's forces retaliated with increased shelling and missile attacks on towns and villages across southern Ukraine. The Kremlin has demanded that Kyiv recognize Crimea as part of Russia as a condition for ending the fighting, while Ukraine has vowed to drive Moscow's forces from the peninsula on the Black Sea. Videos posted on social media showed thick columns of smoke rising over raging flames in Mayskoye, and a series of explosions could be heard. The Russian Defense Ministry said the fires damaged a power plant, power lines, railroad tracks and apartment buildings. ""We came out to take a look and saw clouds of smoke coming from the cowshed where the military warehouses are,"" said resident Maksim Moldovskiy. ""We stayed there until about 7-8 a.m. Everything was exploding — flashes, fragments, debris falling on us. Then the emergency guys came and said they were evacuating everybody."" Crimea's regional leader, Sergei Aksyonov, said two people were injured and more than 3,000 evacuated from two villages. ""The detonations are rather strong. Ammunition is strewn all over the ground,"" he said, adding that several homes burned down. Crimea is a popular summer destination for Russian tourists, and last week's explosions at Crimea's Saki air base sent sunbathers on beaches fleeing as flames and pillars of smoke rose over the horizon. Ukrainian officials warned Tuesday that Crimea would not be spared the ravages of war. Rather than a travel destination, ""Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and a high risk of death for invaders and thieves,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. Russia blamed last week's explosions on an accidental detonation of munitions, but satellite photos and other evidence — including the dispersed blast sites — pointed to a Ukrainian attack, perhaps with anti-ship missiles, military analysts said. Britain's Defense Ministry said in an intelligence update that vessels in Russia's Black Sea Fleet are in an ""extremely defensive posture"" in the waters off Crimea, with ships barely venturing out of sight of the coastline. Russia's flagship Moskva went down in the Black Sea in April, and last month Ukrainian forces retook strategic Snake Island. The Russian fleet's ""limited effectiveness undermines Russia's overall invasion strategy,"" the British said. ""This means Ukraine can divert resources to press Russian ground forces elsewhere."" Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu charged that in addition to supplying arms to Ukraine, Western allies have provided detailed intelligence and instructors to help Ukraine operate weapons that can hit deep in occupied territory. ""Western intelligence agencies not only have provided target coordinates for launching strikes, but Western specialists also have overseen the input of those data into weapons systems,"" Shoigu said. Meanwhile, in the Donbas, the industrial expanse in the east that has been the focus of the fighting in recent months, one civilian was killed in Russian shelling, and two others were wounded, according to the Ukrainian regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. In Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine, one civilian was killed and nine others were wounded by Russian shelling, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. He said the overnight attack was ""one of the most massive shellings of Kharkiv in recent days."" One good piece of news emerged from the region: A United Nations-chartered ship loaded with Ukrainian grain set out for the hunger-stricken Horn of Africa in the first such relief delivery of the war. The shipment was made possible by an internationally brokered deal to free up grain trapped in Ukrainian ports by the fighting.",17,6.914959017828679,1.250426608532916,5.664532409295763,22
2022-08-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-military-pounds-kramatorsk-ukraine-forces-strikes-key-bridge-kherson/,Russian shelling pounds residential areas in east; Ukraine strikes key bridge,"Russia's military pounded residential areas across Ukraine overnight, claiming gains as Ukrainian forces pressed a counteroffensive to try to take back an occupied southern region, striking the last working bridge over a river in the Russian-occupied Kherson region, Ukrainian authorities said Saturday. A Russian rocket attack on the city of Kramatorsk killed three people and wounded 13 others Friday night, according to the mayor. Kramatorsk is the headquarters for Ukrainian forces in the country's war-torn east. The attack came less than a day after 11 other rockets were fired at the city, one of the two main Ukrainian-held ones in Donetsk province, the focus of an ongoing Russian offensive to capture eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Saturday its forces had taken control of Pisky, a village on the outskirts of the city of Donetsk, the provincial capital that pro-Moscow separatists have claimed since 2014. Russian troops and the Kremlin-backed rebels are seeking to seize Ukrainian-held areas north and west of the city of Donetsk to expand the separatists' self-proclaimed republic. But the Ukrainian military said Saturday that its forces had prevented an overnight advance toward the smaller cities of Avdiivka and Bakhmut. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov also claimed that Russian strikes near Kramatorsk, 75 miles north of Donetsk city, destroyed a U.S.-supplied multiple rocket launcher and ammunition. Ukrainian authorities did not acknowledge any military losses but said that Russian missile strikes Friday on Kramatorsk had destroyed 20 residential buildings. Neither claim could be independently verified. The Ukrainian governor of neighboring Luhansk province, which is part of the fight over the Donbas region and was overrun by Russian forces last month, claimed that Ukrainian troops still held a small area. Writing on Telegram, Luhansk Gov. Serhii Haidai said the defending troops remained holed up inside an oil refinery on the edge of Lysychansk, a city that Moscow claimed to have captured, and also control areas near a village. ""The enemy is burning the ground at the entrances to the Luhansk region because it cannot overcome (Ukrainian resistance along) these few kilometers,"" Haidai said. ""It is difficult to count how many thousands of shells this territory of the free Luhansk region has withstood over the past month and a half."" Further west, the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region reported more Russian shelling of the city of Nikopol, which lies across the Dnieper River from Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Gov. Yevhen Yevtushenko did not specify whether Russian troops had fired at Nikopol from the occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. Writing on Telegram, he said Saturday that there were no casualties but residential buildings, a power line and a gas pipeline were damaged. Nikopol has undergone daily bombardment for most of the past week, and a volley of shells killed three people and damaged 40 apartment buildings on Thursday, he said. Russia and Ukrainian officials have for days accused each other of shelling the Zaporizhzhia plant in contravention of nuclear safety rules. Russian troops have occupied the plant since the early days of Moscow's invasion, although the facility's pre-war Ukrainian nuclear workers continue to run it. Ukrainian military intelligence alleged Saturday that Russian troops were shelling the plant from a village just kilometers away, damaging a plant pumping station and a fire station. The intelligence directorate said the Russians had bused people into the power plant and mounted a Ukrainian flag on a self-propelled gun on the outskirts of Enerhodar, the city where the plant is located. ""Obviously, it will be used for yet another provocation to accuse the armed forces of Ukraine,"" the directorate said, without elaborating. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly alleged that Russian forces were cynically using the plant as a shield while firing at communities across the river, knowing that Ukrainian forces were unlikely to fire back for fear of triggering a nuclear accident. They said Russian shelling on Friday night killed one woman and injured two other civilians in the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is a straight distance of about 53 kilometers (33 miles) from the plant. Ukraine's southern Mykolayiv region also said a woman died there in shelling. For several weeks, Ukraine's military has tried to lay the groundwork for a counter-offensive to reclaim southern Ukraine's Russian-occupied Kherson region. A local Ukrainian official reported Saturday that a Ukrainian strike had damaged the last working bridge over the Dnieper River in the region and further crippled Russian supply lines. ""The Russians no longer have any capability to fully turn over their equipment,"" Serhii Khlan, a deputy to the Kherson Regional Council, wrote on Facebook. His claims could not be immediately verified. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly mentioned a planned counter-offensive to retake Russian-occupied parts of the country's south. They urged residents not to post information on social media about military actions related to it and cautioned that any related announcements might come with a time lag. Days after explosions at a Russian air base in Crimea destroyed up to a dozen aircraft, a Ukrainian presidential adviser said Kyiv should make retaking the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow seized more than eight years ago one of its war aims. ""Russia started a war against Ukraine and the world in 2014, with its brazen seizure of Crimea. It is obvious that this war should end with the liberation of Crimea,"" Mykhailo Podoylak, the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, wrote Saturday on Twitter. ""And also with the legal punishment of the initiators of the 'special military operation'"" - the Kremlin's term for its war in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have not claimed responsibility for the explosions at the Saki air base on Tuesday. Russian defense officials denied any aircraft were damaged — or that any attack took place — and attributed the blasts to the sparking of on-site munitions.",17,0.6538113368370655,4.684719126662488,-4.030907789825422,17

New satellite images appear to show deep craters and scorched earth, and the Ukrainian government didn't dispute claims that its forces destroyed at least nine Russian warplanes in a strike. The huge blasts sent stunned beachgoers, who were relaxing well over 100 miles from the nearest front line in the war, running for safety. It was a ""deep strike"" behind Russia's lines for the Ukrainian forces, retired U.S. Marine Corps intelligence officer Hal Kempfer told CBS News. ""Frankly, that changes the front across the board,"" he told CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata. ""If they can continue the momentum, if they can continue to do deep strikes, if they continue to make gains across the Kherson Oblast, they might be able to push all the way across that southern flank."" The strike on the airbase drew a quick, brutal response from Russia. Vladimir Putin's forces retaliated with increased shelling and missile attacks on towns and villages across southern Ukraine. In one of them, D'Agata met local commander Roman Kulyk, proudly wearing a U.S. flag on his Ukrainian uniform. He told CBS News he and his troops were in a ""catastrophic situation"" trying to hold the front line near the southern port city of Mykolaiv, facing a Russian onslaught and running out of weapons fast. Then howitzer artillery pieces arrived from the U.S., and he said they helped save his soldiers' lives. The fighting along the battered front line in southern Ukraine south has been brutal, with the two sides pushing each other back and forth for weeks. A children's playground in the village bears the scars of fighting in the virtually abandoned village, left trapped in a no-man's land between the furthest point the Russian invaders have managed to reach, and Ukraine's forces, determined to hold onto the territory. Anna Shepel, 76, was one of few residents in the village when D'Agata and his team arrived. After evacuating in the first days of fighting, she returned to find her home nearly destroyed, with its windows smashed out and the walls peppered by shrapnel. ""I thought I would have stroke"" she told CBS News about the moment she came back to find her home in such a desperate state. ""I was paralyzed."" She told D'Agata people had replaced her windows three times since she returned, but they keep getting blown out by Russian shelling. ""I wish that the Russians felt what I felt that moment, every minute, every hour,"" she said. As Ukrainian forces prepare for a massive counterattack in the south to try to retake the occupied Kherson region, momentum may be on their side. But even with the steady influx of weapons from the U.S. and its allies, soldiers and civilians alike are bracing for what they know will be a grueling battle ahead. Like thousands of other Ukrainians who either feel they've nowhere else to go, or flat out refuse to be uprooted by Russia's invasion, Anna Shepel told CBS News she intended to stay right where she was.",14,5.07489878283485,5.719520411071918,-0.6446216282370676,20
2022-08-09,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-finland-sweden-nato-ratification/,Biden formalizes U.S. support for Finland and Sweden joining NATO,"Washington — President Biden formally welcomed Finland and Sweden joining the NATO alliance Tuesday as he signed the instruments of ratification that delivered the U.S.'s formal backing of the Nordic nations entering the mutual defense pact, part of a reshaping of the European security posture after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""In seeking to join NATO, Finland and Sweden are making a sacred commitment that an attack against one is an attack against all,"" Mr. Biden said at the signing as he called the partnership the ""indispensable alliance."" The U.S. became the 23rd ally to approve NATO membership for the two countries. The president said he spoke with the heads of both nations before signing the ratification and urged the remaining NATO members to finish their own ratification process ""as quickly as possible."" The Senate last week approved the two, once-neutral nations joining the alliance in a rare 95-1 vote that Biden said shows the world that ""the United States of America can still do big things"" with a sense of political unity. The countries sought out NATO membership earlier this year to guarantee their security in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin's offensive in Ukraine. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's rules require the consent of all of its 30 existing members before Finland and Sweden can officially accede into the alliance, which is expected in the coming months. The candidacies of the two prosperous Northern European nations have won ratification from more than half of the NATO member nations in the roughly three months since the two applied. It marks the speediest expansion of the pact of mutual defense among the United States and democratic allies in Europe in its 73-year history. U.S. State and Defense officials consider the two countries net ""security providers,"" strengthening NATO's defense posture in the Baltics in particular. Finland is expected to exceed NATO's 2% gross domestic product defense spending target in 2022, and Sweden has committed to meet the 2% goal. Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO in May, setting aside their longstanding stance of military nonalignment. It was a major shift of security arrangements for the two countries after neighboring Russia launched its war on Ukraine in late February. Mr. Biden encouraged their joining and welcomed the two countries' government heads to the White House in May, standing side by side with them in a display of U.S. backing. The U.S. and its European allies have rallied with newfound partnership in the face of Putin's military invasion, as well as the Russian leader's sweeping statements this year condemning NATO, issuing veiled reminders of Russia's nuclear arsenal and asserting Russia's historical claims to territory of many of its neighbors.",29,8.387690253718604,6.579640201457983,1.8080500522606213,13

Announcing the drawdown from the U.S. military's stocks, Secretary of State Antony Blinken praised the Ukrainians for already using such weapons ""so effectively to defend themselves"" amid Russia's assault. But as CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports from the key port city of Mykolaiv, Ukraine's defenders say they need more, and fast. The message from the Ukrainian general tasked with keeping the city out of Russian hands as it braces for an expected showdown was unambiguous: If they stand any chance of fighting back, they need more firepower. Major General Dmytro Marchenko spoke to D'Agata in the rubble of the regional government headquarters. He and his troops are hoping to stage a counter offensive, but none of them need reminding that Russia has the upper hand when it comes to heavy weapons. Marchenko told CBS News that for every 100 shells the Russians fire at the city, his forces can respond with only 10. But the Kremlin's forces are running out of precision-guided missiles they used to raze buildings in Mykolaiv in the spring, during the early days of the war. The general listed the weapons the city's people and infrastructure are now facing, from long-range missiles to Soviet-made rockets from the 1960's — even anti-aircraft munitions and cluster bombs. Marchenko credited American-supplied, advanced HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems for helping his forces strike weapons depots and sever supply lines far behind the Russian front lines. More HIMARS rockets were among the items promised by Washington on Monday. The general called the HIMARS ""one of the main factors"" behind his troops' ability to hold their ground so far, and to start seeking an advantage on the battlefield. But the Russian onslaught has been relentless. The front-line town of Bakhmut, hundreds of miles east of Mykolaiv, has suffered ferocious bombardment. The incessant shelling of the eastern Donbas region's main water supply has left residents in the city of Sloviansk without water for two months, adding to the suffering in cities under siege. Mykolaiv is also bombed every night. It was hit again Monday night and early Tuesday morning, and D'Agata and his team could hear the explosions in the distance. General Marchenko said it happens three times a day, and the bombs strike at random, hitting civilians homes, and even hospitals.",14,6.340548214795748,6.870850339639607,-0.5303021248438586,12

""After what happened, Elisabeth Ellingsen's presence in Russia is impossible,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. Earlier in the day, the foreign ministry summoned Norwegian Ambassador Rune Resaland and protested about Ellingsen's ""insulting Russophobic remarks"". The Norwegian diplomat was recorded insulting Russians at a hotel reception in the Arctic city of Murmansk. The video was posted over the weekend by the Mash Telegram channel, reputed to be close to Russia's security services, and sparked an outcry in the country. ""I hate Russians. ... Just give me a room. ... I'm used to clean rooms, I'm from Scandinavia,"" Ellingsen was recorded as saying in English. Ellingsen's outburst comes at a time of tensions between Russia and the West over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has prompted a series of U.S. and European sanctions on Moscow. The Norwegian foreign ministry said over the weekend it ""deeply regretted"" the incident. ""The sentiments expressed do not reflect Norwegian policy or the Norwegian attitude towards Russia,"" the foreign ministry said. On Thursday, Moscow said it had taken note of the Norwegian foreign ministry's statement. A spokeswoman for the Norwegian foreign ministry, Guri Solberg, said on Thursday the country's ambassador had been informed that Moscow had revoked Ellingsen's visa. The ambassador repeated that the consul's statements ""do not reflect Norwegian policy,"" Solberg said, adding that Ellingsen wasn't currently in Russia. Norway said in June that it was temporarily closing the consulate general in Murmansk.",29,6.779922767923264,6.714506735407873,0.0654160325153903,15
2022-07-31,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drone-explosion-russia-black-sea-fleet-sevastopol/,Drone explosion hits headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet,"Kyiv, Ukraine — A small explosive device carried by a makeshift drone blew up Sunday at the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet on the Crimean Peninsula, wounding six people and prompting the cancellation of ceremonies there honoring Russia's navy, authorities said. Meanwhile, one of Ukraine's richest men, a grain merchant, was killed in what Ukrainian authorities said was a carefully targeted Russian missile strike on his home. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the drone explosion in a courtyard at the naval headquarters in the city of Sevastopol. But the seemingly improvised, small-scale nature of the attack raised the possibility that it was the work of Ukrainian insurgents trying to drive out Russian forces. A Russian lawmaker from Crimea, Olga Kovitidi, told Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti that the drone was launched from Sevastopol itself. She said the incident was being treated as a terrorist act, the news agency said. Crimean authorities raised the terrorism threat level for the region to ""yellow,"" the second-highest tier. Sevastopol, which was seized along with the rest of Crimea from Ukraine by Russia in 2014, is about 170 kilometers (100 miles) south of the Ukrainian mainland. Russian forces control much of the mainland along the Black Sea. The Black Sea Fleet's press service said the drone appeared to be homemade. It described the explosive device as ""low-power."" Sevastopol Mayor Mikhail Razvozhaev said six people were wounded. Observances of Russia's Navy Day holiday were canceled in the city. Ukraine's navy and an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the reported drone attack underlined the weakness of Russian air defenses. ""Did the occupiers admit the helplessness of their air defense system? Or their helplessness in front of the Crimean partisans?"" Oleksiy Arestovich said on Telegram. If such an attack is possible by Ukraine, he said, ""the destruction of the Crimean bridge in such situations no longer sounds unrealistic"" — a reference to the span that Russia built to connect its mainland to Crimea after the annexation. Elsewhere in Ukraine, the mayor of the major port city of Mykolaiv, Vitaliy Kim, said shelling killed one of Ukraine's wealthiest men, Oleksiy Vadatursky, and his wife, Raisa. Vadatursky headed a grain production and export business. Another presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Vadatursky was specifically targeted. It ""was not an accident, but a well-thought-out and organized premeditated murder. Vadatursky was one of the largest farmers in the country, a key person in the region and a major employer. That the exact hit of a rocket was not just in a house, but in a specific wing, the bedroom, leaves no doubt about aiming and adjusting the strike,"" he said. Vadatursky's agribusiness, Nibulon, includes a fleet of ships for sending grain abroad. In the Sumy region in Ukraine's north, near the Russian border, shelling killed one person, the regional administration said. And three people died in attacks over the past day in the Donetsk region, which is partly under the control of Russian-backed separatist forces, said regional Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko. Podolyak said on Twitter that images of the prison where at least 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion on Friday indicated that the blast came from within the building in Olenivka, which is under Russian control. Russian officials have claimed the building was attacked by Ukraine with the aim of silencing POWs who might be giving information about Ukrainian military operations. Ukraine has blamed Russia for the explosion. Satellite photos taken before and after show that a small, squarish building in the middle of the prison complex was demolished, its roof in splinters. Podolyak said those images and the lack of damage to adjacent structures showed that the building was not attacked from the air or by artillery. He contended the evidence was consistent with a thermobaric bomb, a powerful device sometimes called a vacuum bomb, being set off inside. The International Red Cross asked to immediately visit the prison to make sure the scores of wounded POWs had proper treatment, but said Sunday that its request had yet to be granted. It said that denying the Red Cross access would violate the Geneva Convention on the rights of POWs.",17,7.266455022656688,1.2240720953563344,6.042382927300354,17

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have a duty to react after shelling of a prison complex in Donetsk province killed the POWs. ""It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address late Friday. ""There should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism."" Both sides alleged the attack on the prison was premeditated and intended to silence the Ukrainian prisoners and to destroy evidence, including of possible atrocities. Russia claimed Ukraine's military used U.S.-supplied precision rocket launchers to target the prison in Olenivka, a settlement controlled by the Moscow-backed Donetsk People's Republic. Separatist authorities and Russian officials said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded another 75. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has organized civilian evacuations in the war and worked to monitor the treatment of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine, said it has requested access to the prison ""to determine the health and condition of all the people present on-site at the time of the attack."" ""Our priority right now is making sure that the wounded receive life-saving treatment and that the bodies of those who lost their lives are dealt with in a dignified manner,"" the Red Cross said in a statement. Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, Russian rockets hit a school building in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, overnight, and another attack occurred about an hour later, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Saturday. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The bus station in the city of Sloviansk also was hit, according to Mayor Vadim Lyakh. Sloviansk is near the front line of fighting as Russian and separatist forces try to take full control of the Donetsk region, one of two eastern provinces that Russia has recognized as sovereign states. In southern Ukraine, one person was killed and six injured in shelling that hit a residential area in Mykolaiv, a significant port city, the region's administration said Saturday on Facebook. Friday's attack on the prison reportedly killed Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in May after the fall of Mariupol, another port city where troops famously held out against a monthslong Russian siege. Moscow opened a probe into the attack, sending a team to the site from Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main criminal investigation agency. The state RIA Novosti agency reported that fragments of U.S.-supplied precision High Mobility Artillery Rocket System rockets were found at the site. The Ukrainian military denied making any rocket or artillery strikes in Olenivka, and it accused the Russians of shelling the prison to cover up the alleged torture and execution of Ukrainians there. The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, said the competing claims and limited information prevented assigning responsibility for the attack but that the ""available visual evidence appears to support the Ukrainian claim more than the Russian.""",17,1.8886615665273838,1.4834627960781888,0.40519877044919506,17

Russia said Ukraine used U.S.-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers in the attack on the prison in Olenivka, in the Russian-controlled Donetsk region. Officials from Russia and the separatist authorities in Donetsk said the attack killed 53 Ukrainian POWs and wounded 75. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov described the strike as a ""bloody provocation"" aimed at discouraging Ukrainian soldiers from surrendering. He said eight prison guards were also wounded in the shelling. The Ukrainian military denied any rocket or artillery strikes on Olenivka, insisting that it wasn't shelling civilian areas and only strikes Russian military targets. It accused the Russian forces of deliberately shelling the prison in order to accuse Ukraine of war crimes and to cover up torture and executions there. The statement denounced the Russian claims as part of an ""information war to accuse the Ukrainian armed forces of shelling civilian infrastructure and the population to cover up their own treacherous action."" Neither claim could be independently verified. The Reuters news agency reports that video from a Russian war correspondent showed Russian-backed military personnel combing through what was left of what he said was the prison, with the roof hanging down. Bodies were also visible in the video. Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-backed separatist leader, said the prison has 193 inmates. He didn't specify how many of them were Ukrainian POWs. Ukrainian authorities in the Donetsk region said Russia has pressed on with the shelling of civilian targets in Ukrainian-held areas. ""The fighting in the region has been intensifying by the day, and civilians must evacuate while it's still possible,"" said Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko. ""The Russian army doesn't worry about civilian casualties. They are pummeling cities and villages in the region."" The Ukrainian troops in Mariupol were taken prisoner after the fierce fighting for Ukraine's Azov Sea port, where they had been holed up at the giant Azovstal steel mill. Their resistance has become a symbol of Ukrainian struggle against the Russian invasion that started on Feb. 24. The Azov Regiment and other Ukrainian units defended the steel mill for nearly three months, clinging to its underground maze of tunnels. More than 2,400 surrendered in May under relentless Russian attacks from the ground, sea and air. Scores of Ukrainian soldiers were taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas such as the Donetsk region, a breakaway area in eastern Ukraine which is run by Russian-backed separatist authorities. Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but families of others have no idea whether their loved ones are alive, or if they will ever come home.",17,1.2322595416495474,6.023969515966754,-4.7917099743172065,9
2022-07-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-guard-troops-training-ukraine-russia-conflict-lessons/,National Guard troops train to avoid pitfalls faced by forces in Ukraine conflict,"One of the most striking images from the early weeks of Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the motionless, miles-long column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. Faced with stronger resistance than they had anticipated, troops were stranded for days as their food and fuel ran low. That stark example inspired U.S. Army readiness experts as they put together this summer's National Guard training exercises. Mid-July weather in Louisiana — where the two-week training is taking place — is nothing like winter in Ukraine, but the commanders are applying the same principles. One trainee scenario, which has been used in past exercises but gains some resonance from the supply shortages seen in Ukraine, forces troops to figure out how to continuously get water to soldiers in the sweltering heat and thick humidity. Brig. Gen. David Gardner, the commanding general of the Army's Joint Readiness Training Center and Fort Polk, told CBS News the challenge of distributing something as low tech as water can be unforgiving, with many variables at play. A soldier can only carry about a gallon at a time and may consume two to three gallons a day in the heat, which means the unit has to solve the problem of ensuring soldiers have enough water to drink, even though they can't each carry all that they'll need. The soldiers must figure out how much transportation is available to move the water and how to protect the delivery routes from enemy interference. Gardner said the same principles apply to other critical resources, like fuel and ammunition. However, the soldiers in the training are kept hydrated and safe throughout the exercise, Gardner added. The exercise is one of about two exercises the Guard does each year at U.S. Army training centers big enough to accommodate the training of a brigade — roughly 5,000 troops. Gen. Dan Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau visited the training center and Fort Polk this week to meet with the commanders leading the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the California National Guard through the training with realistic combat scenarios. ""It's the most difficult training that they will ever do,"" Hokanson said in an interview, ""In fact, what they say is at the training centers, you learn the hardest lessons you'll ever learn and not during actual combat."" While on a tour Tuesday, Hokanson met with different units at the training area, which takes place across more than 150,000 acres. Since the training simulates real scenarios, the soldiers he met with were dressed in full uniform, despite the heat and humidity. The last stop on his vehicle tour brought him down dirt roads in the sprawling forest area to observe a short-range air defense unit. This, too, represents an initiative with elements of the Ukraine conflict. Training for U.S. wars in the early 2000s did not require these systems because the U.S. military largely dominated the air. ""When we were training for Iraq and Afghanistan, we didn't even have air defense units with us because there was no threat, but what we've learned from in the early Russian invasion of the Crimea region and the Donbas, and what we're seeing now is how important it is to have air defense systems on the battlefield to protect us against helicopters, jets, and drones,"" Hokanson said. To make battlefield training scenarios as realistic as possible, the National Guard has added other features, too — obstacles that appeared in the early months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, like drone attacks and disinformation campaigns. The training center has included a 4G network in the exercise so the soldiers have to sift through potential misinformation and counteract it with information useful to the public. ""It's important when you're in an environment that you're providing that balance and truth to the population so they can see something that may be counter to what they may be seeing from the Russians or the Chinese,"" Hokanson said. The exercise in Louisiana consists of two weeks of ""training days,"" but commanders consider the weeks before and after the exercise when soldiers are moving equipment and personnel to Fort Polk as a part of the training. For this event, the California National Guard moved over 1,000 pieces of equipment by rail to Louisiana, the largest rail move in California Guard history. The two-week training ends Friday with a live fire exercise using real bullets and artillery.",14,6.928402875486123,6.347521546653283,0.5808813288328398,8

Kyiv regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba said on Telegram that a settlement in the Vyshgorod district of the region was targeted early on Thursday morning and an ""infrastructure object"" was hit. It wasn't immediately clear if there were any casualties. Vyshhgorod is about 12 miles north of downtown Kyiv. Kuleba linked the strikes with the Day of Statehood, which Ukraine was marking for the first time on Thursday. ""Russia, with the help of missiles, is mounting revenge for the widespread popular resistance, which the Ukrainians were able to organize precisely because of their statehood,"" Kuleba told Ukrainian television. ""Ukraine has already broken Russia's plans and will continue to defend itself."" Chernihiv governor Vyacheslav Chaus reported that multiple missiles were fired from the territory of Belarus at the village of Honcharivska. Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions months ago after failing to capture either. The renewed strikes on the areas come a day after the leader of pro-Kremlin separatists in the east, Denis Pushilin, publicly called on the Russian forces to ""liberate Russian cities founded by the Russian people — Kyiv, Chernihiv, Poltava, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Lutsk."" Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, also came under a barrage of shelling overnight, its mayor Ihor Terekhov said. The southern city of Mykolaiv was fired at as well, with one person sustaining injuries. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military continued to counterattack in the occupied southern region of Kherson, striking a key bridge over the Dnieper River on Wednesday. Ukrainian media on Thursday quoted Ukraine's presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovich, as saying that the operation to liberate Kherson ""has already begun."" Arestovich said Kyiv's forces were planning to isolate Russian troops there and leave them with three options — to ""retreat, if possible, surrender or be destroyed."" Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, in televised remarks on Wednesday said he was ""cautious"" in assessing the timeline of the possible counteroffensive. ""I would really like it to be much faster,"" he said, adding that ""the enemy is now concentrating the maximum number (of forces) precisely in the Kherson direction."" ""A very large-scale movement of their troops has begun, they are gathering additional forces,"" Danilov warned. The British military estimated Thursday that Ukraine's counteroffensive in Kherson is ""gathering momentum"". ""Their forces have highly likely established a bridgehead south of the Ingulets River, which forms the northern boundary of Russian-occupied Kherson,"" the British Defense Ministry said on Thursday. It added that Ukraine has used its new long-range artillery to damage at least three of the bridges across the Dnieper River, ""which Russia relies upon to supply the areas under its control."" The six-tenths-of-a-mile-long Antonivsky bridge, which Ukrainian forces struck on Wednesday, is likely to be ""unusable,"" the British Defense Ministry concluded. Ukraine's presidential office said Thursday morning that Russian shelling of cities and villages over the past 24 hours killed at least five civilians, all of them in the eastern Donetsk region, and wounded nine more. Fighting in recent weeks has focused on the Donetsk region. It has intensified in recent days as Russian forces appeared to emerge from a reported ""operational pause"" after capturing the neighboring Luhansk region. A missile struck a residential building in Toretsk early Thursday morning, destroying two floors. ""Missile terror again. We will not give up. ... We will not be intimidated,"" Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram. Analysts with the Institute for the Study of War believe that Russian forces are focusing their efforts on capturing the cities of Bakhmut and Siversk in Donetsk province. ""Russian forces have committed enough resources to conduct near-daily ground assaults and to seize territory on these two axes but have been unable to sustain a similar offensive operational tempo or to make similar territorial gains elsewhere in Ukraine,"" the Institute said.",14,4.278813519333737,0.4326951840123565,3.846118335321381,0
2022-07-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-antonivskyi-bridge-essential-russian-supply-lines-occupied-kherson/,Ukraine strikes Antonivskyi Bridge essential for Russian supply lines in occupied south,"Ukrainian troops have struck a strategic bridge essential for Moscow to supply its forces occupying the country's south, as Russia pounded several areas in Ukraine with rocket and artillery strikes. The Ukrainian military struck the Antonivskyi Bridge across the Dnieper River late Tuesday, the deputy head of the Moscow-appointed administration for the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, said. He said the bridge was still standing, but its deck was pierced with holes, stopping vehicles from crossing. An official from the Russian-installed regional administration said that, due to the shelling, the bridge had been closed to pedestrians as well, but that it still maintained its structural integrity, the Reuters news agency reported. The nine-tenths-of-a-mile bridge sustained serious damage in Ukrainian shelling last week, when it took multiple hits. It was closed for trucks but had remained open for passenger vehicles until the strike late Tuesday. Ukrainian forces used the U.S.-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to hit the bridge, Stremousov said. The bridge is the main crossing over the Dnieper River in the Kherson region. The only other option is a dam at the hydroelectric plant in Kakhovka, which also came under Ukrainian fire last week but has remained open for traffic. Knocking the crossings out would make it hard for the Russian military to keep supplying its forces in the region amid repeated Ukrainian attacks. Early in the war, Russian troops quickly overran the Kherson region just north of the Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. They have faced Ukrainian counterattacks but have largely held their ground. The Ukrainian attacks on the bridge in Kherson come as the bulk of the Russian forces are stuck in the fighting in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas, where they have made slow gains in the face of ferocious Ukrainian resistance. Supplies of U.S. weapons such as HIMARS have helped slow the Russian advances. Russian forces kept up their artillery barrage in the eastern Donetsk region, targeting towns and villages, according to regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. In Bakhmut, a key city on the front line of the Russian offensive, the shelling damaged a hotel and caused casualties, Kyrylenko said. A rescue operation was under way. Amid Moscow's push to take full control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Russian have gained marginal ground northeast of Bakhmut, according to a Washington D.C.-based thinktank. Russian forces, however, are unlikely to occupy significant additional territory in Ukraine ""before the early autumn,"" the Institute for the Study of War said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Russian military losses have climbed to nearly 40,000 and that tens of thousands more have been wounded and maimed. His claim couldn't be independently verified. The Russian military last reported its losses in March, when it said 1,351 troops were killed in action and 3,825 were wounded.",14,0.5371437481308269,0.6561595600098927,-0.11901581187906585,0

The Kremlin's forces used air-launched missiles in the attack, Ukraine's Operational Command South said in a Facebook post. The command posted video Tuesday that appeared to show smoldering rubble and destroyed buildings with the caption: ""The consequences of today's rocket shelling across the Odessa region."" In the Odesa region, a number of private buildings in villages on the coast were hit and caught fire, the report said. In the Mykolaiv region, port infrastructure was targeted. Hours after the renewed strikes on the south, a Moscow-installed official in the southern Kherson region said the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions will soon be ""liberated"" by the Russian forces, just like the Kherson region further east. ""The Kherson region and the city of Kherson have been liberated forever,"" Kirill Stremousov was quoted as saying by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The developments came as Ukraine appeared to be preparing a counteroffensive in the south. Russia previously attacked Odesa's port at the weekend. The British military said Tuesday there was no indication that a Ukrainian warship and a stockpile of anti-ship missiles were at the site, as Moscow claimed. The British Defense Ministry said Russia sees Ukraine's use of anti-ship missiles as ""a key threat"" that is limiting its Black Sea Fleet. ""This has significantly undermined the overall invasion plan, as Russia cannot realistically attempt an amphibious assault to seize Odesa,"" the military said. ""Russia will continue to prioritize efforts to degrade and destroy Ukraine's anti-ship capability."" It added that ""Russia's targeting processes are highly likely routinely undermined by dated intelligence, poor planning, and a top-down approach to operations."" Russian shelling over the previous 24 hours killed at least three civilians and wounded eight more in Ukraine, the president's office said Tuesday. In the eastern Donetsk region, where the fighting has been focused in recent weeks, the shelling continued along the entire front line, with the largest cities of the region, including Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Toretsk, being targeted by the Russian forces, a statement said. Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko accused Russian troops of using cluster munitions and repeated his call for civilians to evacuate. ""There is not a single safe place left, everything is being shelled,"" Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. ""But there are still evacuation routes for the civilian population."" The Institute for the Study of War, based in Washington, D.C., reported that the Russians are using mercenaries from the shadowy Wagner Group to capture the Vuhledar Power Plant on the northern outskirts of the Novoluhanske village. But the Russian forces have made ""limited gains"" there, according to Ukraine's General Staff. The main Russian focus has been on capturing Bakhmut, which Moscow's forces need in order to press their offensive on the main Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. ""Russian forces made marginal gains south of Bakhmut but are unlikely to be able to effectively leverage these advances to take full control of Bakhmut itself,"" the Institute for the Study of War said. Russian forces continued to launch strikes on civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city in the northeast, and the surrounding region. Kharkiv governor Oleh Syniehubov said the strikes on the city resumed around dawn Tuesday, damaging a car dealership. ""The Russians deliberately target civilian infrastructure objects - hospitals, schools, movie theaters,"" Syniehubov told Ukrainian television. ""Everything is being fired at, even queues for humanitarian aid, so we're urging people to avoid mass gatherings."" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that Moscow wants ""the complete subjugation of Ukraine and its people.""

2022-07-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-international-space-station-exit-2024/,Russia says it will withdraw from the International Space Station after 2024,"Russia will pull out of the International Space Station project after 2024, the new director of the Russian space program said Tuesday, but no firm dates or plans were revealed and it was not immediately clear what, if anything, might change in the near term. Yuri Borisov, who was named earlier this month to replace Dmitri Rogozin as head of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said after a meeting with President Vladimir Putin ""the decision to leave the station after 2024 has been made."" By that time, he added, Russia will be ready to begin building an independent orbital outpost. But it wasn't clear what ""after 2024"" might actually mean in terms of when a withdrawal might start or be complete. ""It's an unfortunate development given the critical scientific work performed at the ISS,"" said Ned Price, a State Department spokesman. ""The United States and Russia have cooperated on space exploration ... over the course of decades. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the agency ""is committed to the safe operation of the International Space Station through 2030, and is coordinating with our partners. NASA has not been made aware of decisions from any of the partners, though we are continuing to build future capabilities to assure our major presence in low-Earth orbit."" Before his abrupt departure, Rogozin made repeated threats about pulling out of the project in response to Western sanctions in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Rogozin's bellicose tweets lacked any concrete endorsement from Putin. John Logsdon, a historian and space policy analyst, said Tuesday he took Borisov's comments ""a bit more seriously, because it was the new guy in the context of a meeting with Putin. You don't do those things casually."" NASA and Russia began building the International Space Station nearly 24 years ago and the outpost has been continuously staffed by rotating astronaut-cosmonaut crews since October 2000. It is one of the most visible signs of East-West cooperation in the wake of the Soviet Union's demise and the end of the Cold War. NASA and its other space station parters — the European Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the Canadian Space Agency — want to operate the lab through 2030, using it for basic research and to test technologies and life support protocols needed for future flights to the moon and Mars. Nelson has repeatedly expressed optimism Russia would agree to continue the program, telling CBS News earlier this year that ""this professional relationship between our astronauts and cosmonauts, it's consistent, and it's going to stay."" On July 15, Russia and NASA finalized a deal to resume launching U.S. astronauts aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and cosmonauts aboard SpaceX Crew Dragon capsules starting in September. The idea is to ensure at least one Russian and one American is on board the station at all times to operate their respective systems, even if an emergency forced a U.S. or Russian vehicle to leave early, along with all its crew members. That agreement runs through June 30, 2025. One of the most complex engineering projects ever attempted, the International Space Station is made up of two primary segments, one managed by NASA and the other by Roscosmos. The U.S. segment, as it's known, features four huge NASA-supplied solar wings, two on each end of a truss as long as a football field, complex cooling systems, computer networks, high-speed communications systems and 10 pressurized modules built by NASA, ESA and JAXA, along with a sophisticated robot arm supplied by the Canadian Space Agency. The U.S. segment also features four docking ports that can accommodate Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, Japanese HTV freighters, SpaceX Dragon crew and cargo ships and Boeing's Starliner crew ferry craft. The back section of the station, made up of six pressurized compartments, is operated by Roscosmos. One of those, known as Zarya, connects the U.S. and Russian segments. It was paid for by NASA but is operated by Russia. Four Russian docking ports are currently used by Progress cargo ships and Soyuz crew ferry vehicles. Russia provides the propellant and thrusters needed to keep the outpost in orbit while NASA provides most of the station's electrical power, satellite communications and day-to-day stability provided by four massive gyroscopes. Periodically boosting the station's altitude is critical because even orbiting 260 miles up, a thin trace of atmosphere is present. As the station plows through those atoms and molecules at 17,000 mph, or more than 80 football fields per second, that slight ""atmospheric drag"" acts to slowly but surely reduce the lab's altitude. Russia delivers the needed propellant aboard unpiloted Progress cargo ships, which can either fire their own thrusters to provide reboost or transfer propellants to tanks aboard the station for use by on-board thrusters. NASA's four control moment gyros, or CMGs, work to re-orient the station as needed without the use of thrusters, saving propellant. While that reduces the amount of fuel needed, it does not provide reboost. Without periodic Russian rocket firings, the lab would slowly descend and eventually re-enter the lower atmosphere and break up. Along with keeping the station in orbit, the Russians were expected to provide the propulsion and control at the end of the station's life to drive it out of orbit over an unpopulated stretch of the south Pacific Ocean to prevent any chance of injury or property damage from debris that might survive re-entry. While NASA recently tested its own reboost capability using a Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship, the agency does not have the capability yet to provide all the propellant and thrusting needed if Russia does, in fact, pull out. One option: NASA possibly could pay Russia for reboost flights like the agency did for post-shuttle seats on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft. ""The other possibility, and I think it's not very probable, is it forces a decision to abandon the station earlier by NASA and its partners,"" Logsdon said, adding that would free up money that could be diverted to the agency's Artemis moon program. While Nelson has expressed optimism Russia would remain on board through 2030, he also has said NASA would come up with a way to keep the station in operation if the Russians ended their support. ""If they abandon the space station? We'd manage, we'd figure it out,"" Nelson told CBS News in March. ""We know we can continue it for the short term. We'd have to do other things, and those contingency plans are already there. But we don't anticipate that.""",3,6.6126731933151035,6.480922744697828,0.13175044861727514,6
2022-07-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-odesa-strike-military-targets/,Russia insists strike on Ukrainian port of Odesa hit military targets,"Kyiv, Ukraine — Russian defense ministry officials on Sunday insisted that an airstrike on the port of Odesa — less than a day after Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement on resuming grain shipments from there — had hit only military targets. ""In the seaport in the city of Odesa, on the territory of a shipyard, sea-based high-precision long-range missiles destroyed a docked Ukrainian warship and a warehouse with Harpoon anti-ship missiles supplied by the U.S. to the Kyiv regime,"" ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said at a daily briefing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly televised address Saturday evening that the attack on Odesa ""destroyed the very possibility"" of dialogue with Russia. The Ukrainian military said on Saturday that Moscow had attacked Odesa's sea port with four cruise missiles, two of which had been shot down by Ukrainian air defense. Command spokeswoman Nataliya Humenyuk said that no grain storage facilities were hit. Turkey's defense minister, however, said he had had reports from Ukrainian authorities that one missile struck a grain silo while another landed nearby, although neither affected loading at Odesa's docks. It was not immediately clear how the airstrike would affect plans to resume shipping Ukrainian grain by sea in safe corridors out of three Ukrainian Black Sea ports: Odesa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny. Russia and Ukraine on Friday signed identical agreements with the U.N. and Turkey in Istanbul aimed at clearing the way for the shipment of millions of tons of desperately needed Ukrainian grain, as well as the export of Russian grain and fertilizer. Senior U.N. officials voiced hopes that the deal would end a months-long standoff brought about by the war in Ukraine that threatened food security around the globe. The agreement, obtained by The Associated Press, committed both Kyiv and Moscow to refraining from strikes on the three Black Sea ports. Elsewhere on Sunday, Ukrainian authorities reported that Russian shelling continued to kill and injure civilians in Ukraine's south and east. The governor of the eastern Donetsk region, one of two which make up Ukraine's industrial heartland of the Donbas and a key focus of Russia's offensive, said that two civilians had been killed and two more had been injured over the previous 24 hours. The U.K. military on Sunday morning reported in its daily intelligence update that Russia was making ""minimal progress"" in its ongoing Donbas offensive, which it said remained small-scale and focused on the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. The Ukrainian General Staff confirmed in its regular update that Russia was ""conducting military operations to create conditions"" for an assault on Bakhmut, while firing on surrounding settlements and battling Ukrainian defenders for control of a nearby thermal plant. In Ukraine's south, regional officials said that at least five civilians were wounded by Russian shells in the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv on Saturday night and Sunday morning. ""Also, as a result of the scattering of munitions and their fragments, fires occurred in open areas in the city,"" said Vitaly Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region.",17,8.61864822646216,2.019705498585669,6.598942727876491,17

The department said it would not provide additional details ""out of respect to the families at this time."" ""We are in touch with the families and providing all possible consular assistance, the spokesperson said. The fighting in Ukraine, which is entering its sixth month, continued with reports in recent days including attacks on Odesa and the region of Kirovohradska region as well as fighting in Kherson region and the Donbas. According to the Associated Press, two Russian missiles hit the port city Odesa, on the Black Sea, just hours after the two nations signed U.N.-brokered deals that would allow grain exports to resume, including from Odesa. Another 13 Russian missiles hit an airfield and a railway facility in Kirovohradska, near Kirovohrad, in attacks that killed at least three people and wounded 16 others. And in the heavily contested Donbas region, the Associated Press reports, Russian forces have been trying to gain ground.",17,3.5053711674248844,4.036971811765109,-0.5316006443402244,17
2022-07-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/british-spy-chief-predicts-russian-forces-will-soon-run-out-of-steam-in-ukraine/,"British spy chief predicts Russian forces will soon ""run out of steam"" in Ukraine","Head of the British intelligence service MI6 Richard Moore said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had thus far suffered a ""strategic defeat"" in Ukraine, failing to achieve any of what Moore described as three key objectives — removing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy from power, taking control of the country's capital, Kyiv, and sowing disunity within NATO. ""On all of those,"" he said, ""I think they count as epic fails."" Moore, who took part in a question-and-answer session at the annual Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado, predicted that Russian forces would be forced to regroup within ""the next few weeks,"" offering Ukraine a crucial window within which to make battlefield reversals. ""I think they're about to run out of steam,"" Moore said of the Russian military, adding that the U.K.'s assessment was that Russian forces ""will increasingly find it difficult to supply manpower and material over the next few weeks."" ""They will have to pause in some way and that will give the Ukrainians opportunities to strike back,"" Moore said. He added that the Ukrainians' ability to notch successes would serve as ""an important reminder to the rest of Europe: that this is a winnable campaign by the Ukrainians"" – especially ahead of what Moore said would be a ""pretty tough winter."" ""We're in for a tough time,"" he said. Still, he said Russia had been hampered since the start of the invasion by what he called a ""toxic combination"" of military miscalculation and intelligence failure. ""I don't think they're having a great war,"" Moore said. ""They clearly completely misunderstood Ukrainian nationalism. They completely underestimated the degree of resistance that the Russian military would face,"" he said. The Kremlin's intelligence shortcomings were now likely exacerbated by the expulsion, earlier this year, of more than 400 Russian intelligence officers from the European continent. ""We reckon in the U.K., that's probably reduced their ability to do their business to spy for Russian in Europe by half,"" Moore said. The British intelligence chief also echoed a more casual remark made at the same forum yesterday by CIA director William Burns, who quipped that Putin appeared ""entirely too healthy"" before noting that was not a formal U.S. intelligence assessment. Moore said Thursday that ""there's no evidence that Putin is suffering from serious ill health."" Like Burns, Moore also said China had been ""conservative"" in weighing whether to provide military assistance to Russia — though it had otherwise supported the Kremlin by purchasing Russian oil. ""[I]t feels pretty tight, but it's not an equal partnership, and Ukraine has made it less equal,"" Moore said. ""Moscow is very much the junior partner and the Chinese are very much in the driving seat."" He also said China's close observation of the West's approach to the conflict made it imperative to continue bolstering Ukrainian forces. ""[T]his is one of the reasons why it is so essential that we tough it out on Ukraine and we keep going through this winter and we help the Ukrainians to win, or at least negotiate from a position of significant strength,"" Moore said, ""is because Xi Jinping is watching this like a hawk.""",14,4.047941358472706,2.5929912144211764,1.45495014405153,28

In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said a ""personnel audit"" of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) was underway, and the dismissal of the 28 officials was being decided. ""Different levels, different areas of focus. But the reasons are similar — unsatisfactory results of work,"" Zelenskyy said. On Sunday, he had fired SBU chief Ivan Bakanov and Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova. Zelenskyy, citing hundreds of criminal proceedings into treason and collaboration by people within their departments and other law enforcement agencies. ""Six months into the war, we continue to uncover loads of these people in each of these agencies,"" said Andriy Smirnov, deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office. Analysts said the moves are designed to strengthen Zelenskyy's control over the army and security agencies, which have been led by people appointed before the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24. ""In the conditions of a war, Zelenskyy needs leaders that are capable of tackling several tasks at the same time — to resist Russia's intrigues within the country to create a fifth column, to be in contact and coordination with international experts, to do their actual job effectively,"" Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst with the Penta Center think tank, told The Associated Press. Bakanov is a childhood friend and former business partner of Zelenskyy, who appointed him to head the SBU. Bakanov had come under growing criticism over security breaches since the war began. Venediktova won international praise for her drive to gather war-crimes evidence against Russian military commanders and officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, over the destruction of Ukrainian cities and the killing of civilians. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price, speaking to reporters in Washington, said when asked about the personnel changes that the two governments were in close contact. ""The fact is that in all of our relationships, and including in this relationship, we invest not in personalities. We invest in institutions and, of course, President Zelenskyy has spoken to his rationale for making these personnel shifts,"" Price said. He said Washington would continue to work with Kyiv on war-crimes investigations and information sharing. Intelligence, he said, is ""an important element of the assistance that we are providing to our Ukrainian partners in an effort to help them defend themselves."" Zelensky appointed the first deputy head of the SBU, Vasyl Maliuk, to be acting head. Maliuk, 39, is known for efforts to fight corruption in the security agencies; his appointment was seen as part of Zelenskyy's efforts to get rid of pro-Russian staffers in the SBU. Fesenko said discontent with Bakanov and Venediktova had been brewing for a while, and it was possible that Ukraine's Western partners pointed out the underperformance of the SBU and the prosecutor general's office to Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, Russia pressed forward with its missile and shelling attacks, which Ukrainian officials said were designed to intimidate the civilian population and create panic. The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, however, said his troops had ""stabilized the situation"" on the front, largely thanks to Western deliveries of technically advanced rocket systems. ""It is complex, tense, but completely controllable,"" Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny wrote on Telegram after a phone call with the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley. ""An important factor contributing to our holding our defensive lines and positions is the timely arrival of the M142 HIMARS, delivering targeted strikes against enemy command posts, ammunition and fuel depots,"" Zaluzhnyy said, referring to the light multiple-rocket launchers recently delivered from the U.S. Ukraine's Emergency Service said at least six people were killed by Russian shelling Monday targeting the city of Toretsk in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Toretsk was taken briefly in the Russian invasion of 2014, but Ukrainian forces ended up taking the city back. Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said Russian shelling there is incessant. Four Russian strikes had been carried out on the city of Kramatorsk, he said, and he urged civilians to evacuate. ""We're seeing that the Russians want to sow fear and panic,"" Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. ""The front line is moving, so civilians must leave the region and evacuate."" Nearly 1,000 civilians were evacuated to Ukraine on Monday from Russian-held territories in the northern Kharkiv region, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. About a third of the region remains in Russian hands after Moscow's troops overran it in April. In Kyiv on Monday, a funeral was held at St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery for a Ukrainian soldier killed when his car hit a land mine near Izium last week. His family couldn't bury him in their hometown in eastern Ukraine because it remains under Russian occupation. The cathedral was packed with mourners paying their last respects to Fanat, as the soldier was known. Whenever the priest paused, the voice of the soldier's mother echoed in the church. ""We will love you forever and ever. We will miss you so much!"" she cried, caressing the closed coffin.

2022-07-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-missile-strike-mykolaiv-vinnytsia/,"Russia strikes southern Ukraine city, presses attacks in east","Vinnytsia, Ukraine — Russian missiles hit industrial facilities at a strategic city in southern Ukraine on Sunday as a funeral was held for a 4-year-old girl killed in an earlier deadly strike elsewhere in the country. Liza, who had Down syndrome, was en route to see a speech therapist with her mother when a Russian missile struck the city of Vinnytsia in central Ukraine on Thursday. At least 24 people were killed, including Liza and two boys aged 7 and 8. More than 200 others were wounded, including Liza's mother, who remains in an intensive care unit in grave condition. ""I didn't know Liza, but no person can go through this with calm,"" priest Vitalii Holoskevych said, bursting into tears as Liza's body lay in a coffin with flowers and teddy bears in the 18th century Transfiguration Cathedral in Vinnytsia. ""We know that evil cannot win,"" he said, his voice trembling. On Sunday, more Russian missiles struck industrial facilities in the strategic southern city of Mykolaiv, a key shipbuilding center in the estuary of the Southern Bug river. There was no immediate information about casualties. Mykolaiv has faced regular Russian missile strikes in recent weeks as the Russians have sought to soften Ukrainian defenses. The Russian military has declared a goal to cut off Ukraine's entire Black Sea coast all the way to the Romanian border. If successful, such an effort would deal a crushing blow to the Ukrainian economy and trade and allow Moscow to secure a land bridge to Moldova's separatist region of Transnistria, which hosts a Russian military base. Early in the campaign, the Ukrainian forces fended off Russian attempts to capture Mykolaiv, which sits near the Black Sea Coast between Russia-occupied Crimea and the main Ukrainian port of Odesa. Since then, the Russian troops have halted their attempts to advance in the city but have continued to pummel both Mykolaiv and Odesa with regular missile strikes. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Lt. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Sunday that Russian missiles destroyed a depot for anti-ship Harpoon missiles delivered to Ukraine by NATO allies, a claim that couldn't be independently confirmed. The Russians also sought to reinforce their positions in the Kherson region near Crimea and part of the northern Zaporizhzhia region that they seized in the opening stage of the conflict, fearing a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The British Defense Ministry said Sunday that Russia is moving manpower and equipment between Kherson, Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia. It said the Russians also are increasing their security measures around Melitopol. It added: ""Given the pressures on Russian manpower, the reinforcement of the south whilst the fight for the Donbas continues indicates the seriousness with which Russian commanders view the threat."" For now, the Russian military has focused its efforts on trying to take control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas, where the most capable and well-equipped Ukrainian forces are located. Ukraine says its forces still retain control of two small villages in the Luhansk region, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas, and are successfully fending off Russian attempts to advance deeper into the second one, the Donetsk region. The Ukrainian military's General Staff said Sunday that Ukrainian troops thwarted Russian attempts to advance toward Sloviansk, the key Ukrainian stronghold in Donetsk, and other attacks elsewhere in the region. During a visit to the front lines Saturday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu issued an order ""to further intensify the actions of units in all operational areas."" The Russian military said it has struck Ukrainian troops and artillery positions in Donbas in the latest series of strikes, including a U.S.-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launcher. The Russian claims couldn't be independently verified. While focusing on Donbas, the Russians hit areas all across the country with missile strikes. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians not to fall for Russia's attempts to scare them with warnings of horrendous missile attacks to come, which he said were aimed at dividing Ukrainian society. ""It's clear that no Russian missiles or artillery will be able to break our unity or lead us away from our path"" toward a democratic, independent Ukraine,"" he said in his nightly video address to the nation. ""And it is also clear that Ukrainian unity cannot be broken by lies or intimidation, fakes or conspiracy theories.""

2022-07-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-report-details-russian-torture-ukrainian-civilians/,New report details Russian torture of Ukrainian civilians,"Washington — An international investigation has found grim new evidence of war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, identifying cases of direct targeting of civilians, torture, rape and forced deportations. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a regional security organization, issued a report Thursday detailing ""clear patterns of serious violations of international humanitarian law"" committed mainly by the Russian army. The report describes in vivid detail the torture of Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops. In a summer camp in Bucha, just outside Ukraine's capital of Kyiv that was occupied for over two weeks by Russian forces, the investigators said they found a series of torture chambers. ""In Zabuchchya, a village in the Bucha district, 18 mutilated bodies of murdered men, women, and children were discovered in a basement: some had their ears cut off, while others had their teeth pulled out,"" according to the report. Speaking Thursday in Vienna, U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter described a Russian missile attack on the central city of Vinnytsia that killed more than 20 people, including 3 children, as ""disgusting,"" but ""a reality that we contend with each and every day."" Ukrainian emergency services showed images of a child's dead body lying on the ground next to a play stroller she had been pushing down the road with her mother when the missiles struck. In an interview with CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov called the strike the latest proof that his country is at war with ""a state of terrorists."" ""They're using that weapon against civilian people, against the civilian facilities, against the hospitals… against the kindergartens,"" he said. The OSCE report says that as Russia is increasingly unable to muster enough of its own forces, it has recently begun resorting to conscripting Ukrainian men between the ages 18-65 from territory it occupies and sending them straight to the front lines, with little to no training. ""The escalation, and rising casualty rates, have begun to spark anger even among pro-Russian communities. Several videos posted online purportedly show the wives of Donetsk and Luhansk conscripts demanding assistance for their husbands and asking why men with no military background are being sent to fight,"" according to the report. Incidences of gender-based violence have remained prevalent throughout the war, the report states. Natalia Karbowska, co-founder and director of strategic development for the Ukrainian Women's Fund, suggested during a June U.N. Security Council briefing that ""the Russian Federation is using sexual violence and rape as instruments of terror to control civilians."" In one instance, 25 girls aged 14 to 24 were allegedly kept in a basement in Bucha where they were gang-raped by Russian troops. Nine of the girls became pregnant, according to Ukraine's Commissioner for Human Rights. Russian President Vladimir Putin bestowed the honorary title of ""guard"" on the military unit accused of war crimes in Bucha, according to a Russian presidential decree. In a Facebook post, the Russian Embassy in the U.S. dismissed the report as an attempt by Washington ""to vilify the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,"" which it suggested was due to ""dissatisfaction with the success of a special military operation."" The Putin regime has consistently referred to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""military operation."" Referring to it as a war can land Russians in prison. The OSCE report also discusses ""filtration centers,"" set up by Russia's occupying forces, where Ukrainian civilians ""are separated from others and often simply disappear."" The report says detained individuals are handed over to authorities in the occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where some are sentenced to death. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for an immediate end to Russia's ""filtration"" operations and for the release of detained Ukrainian civilians. Russian authorities have deported between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens, deliberately separating Ukrainian children from their parents, according to the Biden administration. ""The unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and is a war crime,"" Blinken said in a statement Wednesday. ""Russian authorities must release those detained and allow Ukrainian citizens forcibly removed or coerced into leaving their country the ability to promptly and safely return home.""",13,4.0319559964363325,7.690887975350872,-3.6589319789145396,11

The research equipment includes a $118 million instrument that will be mounted outside the station to study the mineral composition of dust blown into the atmosphere from desert regions around the world in order to learn more about how those widely dispersed materials affect the environment. Also on board: apples, oranges, cherry tomatoes, onions, baby carrots, garlic, tahini, cheese and dry sausage for the astronauts. ""A really nice mix of fresh fruit for the crew,"" said Dana Weigel, deputy program manager of the ISS at NASA's Johnson Space Center. When the Dragon capsule returns to Earth in a little more than a month, it will bring back a spacesuit worn by German astronaut Matthias Maurer during a March spacewalk, or EVA, to find out what caused a small amount of water to leak into his helmet. While the incident was not nearly as serious as a 2013 water intrusion that flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet, normal spacewalks have been suspended until the issue is resolved. ""That's really key for us, we've got to get (Maurer's) suit home to take a look at it ... to really try to understand what happened,"" Weigel said. ""And that'll be part of what we need for our assessment for our eventual readiness when we look at returning back to nominal EVAs."" SpaceX's CRS-25 cargo run got underway at 8:44 p.m. EDT, when the Falcon 9's first stage engines ignited, throttled up to 1.7 million pounds of thrust, and smoothly pushed the rocket away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center. Making its fifth flight, the Falcon 9 first stage dropped away and flew itself to a successful landing on a SpaceX barge 7 ½ minutes after liftoff. One minute after that, the second stage finished the climb to space, and three minutes later, the Dragon cargo ship was released to fly on its it own. The deep twilight climb out of the atmosphere provided a riveting show for area residents and tourists, as the rocket ascended into sunlight with the exhaust plume from its engines billowing outward in a comet-like display, as one stage headed for orbit, and the other toward landing. ""It really was a beautiful launch, and I'm excited to see CRS-25 Dragon headed to the space station,"" said Dina Contella, space station operations integration manager. ""So congratulations to everybody at SpaceX, and I know our scientists and cargo providers are looking forward to seeing the fruits of their labors arriving at ISS."" At the moment of launch, the ISS was sailing 260 miles above the South Pacific Ocean, about 20 minutes away from passing directly over the Kennedy Space Center. The Dragon was launched directly into the plane of that orbit, a requirement for rendezvous missions. Over the next two days, the spacecraft will carry out a series of carefully choreographed rocket firings to catch up with the lab, moving in from behind and below before looping up to a point directly ahead of the outpost. From there, the Dragon will slowly move in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port around 11:20 a.m. Saturday. The Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is carrying 1,200 pounds of equipment: a battery charge-discharge unit for the station's solar power system, and NASA's Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation, or EMIT, instrument. Developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, EMIT will use imaging spectroscopy to measure the mineral composition of dust blown into the atmosphere from desert regions around the world to learn more how such materials are transported, how they affect temperature, air quality and the environment in general. The Dragon's pressurized compartment, the section accessible by the astronauts inside the space station, is packed with 829 pounds of crew supplies, 2,468 pounds of science gear, 400 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 724 pounds of station hardware and 72 pounds of computer equipment. ""This is going to be a really busy mission for us, it's packed with a lot of science,"" Weigel said. The Dragon visit kicks off a busy few months for the ISS program, as training ramps up for Russian Soyuz and NASA Crew Dragon astronaut rotation flights expected in September. The Crew Dragon flight will carry two NASA rookies, Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada, veteran Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata, and Anna Kikina, a Russian cosmonaut making her first flight. Kikina's presence on the Crew 5 Dragon is expected as part of a seat-swap NASA is negotiating with the Russian space agency to ensure there is always at least one Russian and one American aboard the station even if an emergency forces a Soyuz or Dragon capsule to depart early with all its crew members. Assuming the seat swap is finalized as expected, the next Soyuz crew launch, set for mid-September, will carry two cosmonauts –veteran Sergey Prokopyev and rookie Dmitry Petelin – to the ISS, along with NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, also making his first flight. Despite Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and Cold War-like East-West relations, ""we're hopeful that we're pretty close to finalizing the agreement,"" Weigel said. ""It is in the final stages of review with both NASA and Roscosmos,"" Weigel went on. ""Anna Kikina continues training with Crew 5 per the normal plan. Similarly, Frank Rubio's been training with the Soyuz crew. So their crew training's in good shape.""",3,9.067804492314947,5.236457030438164,3.831347461876783,6

The Presidium Network aid charity said Paul Urey's family had been notified of his death by British officials. The U.K. Foreign Office has not publicly confirmed the death but said it was ""urgently seeking clarification from the Russian government."" Daria Morozova, the human rights ombudswoman for the Moscow-backed separatist leadership in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, said a British ""mercenary,"" whom she named as Urey, died in captivity on Sunday. She said he had died of chronic illnesses and stress. Urey, 45, was detained in April at a checkpoint near Zaporizhzhia, some 290 miles southeast of Kyiv, along with another British man, Dylan Healy. The two men had been operating on their own in the war zone, helping to evacuate civilians. Presidium Network co-founder Dominik Byrne said Urey had diabetes and needed a regular supply of insulin. ""It's obvious that his welfare was not looked after,"" Byrne said. ""The Russian authorities and the Donetsk People's Republic knew he had need of insulin but all the way through this the Red Cross has been denied welfare access to him and has never been able to verify his actual conditions in prison."" Byrne said ""multiple agencies"" including the British government and the Red Cross had tried in vain to secure Urey's release. ""We are formally calling for his captors to release his body and help us repatriate it back to the U.K. for his family,"" he said. ""We really feel that is of ultimate importance and the least they can do at this stage."" Pro-Russian separatists have captured several foreign citizens they describe as mercenaries. Among them are Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner who in June were sentenced to death by separatist authorities in the stronghold of Donetsk. Two Americans who are also being held, Alexander Drueke and Andy Huynh, have not yet been charged. ""They are really using these personnel as political pawns in this conflict - which is disgraceful"" Byrne told Reuters.",13,6.531309399900922,8.184939655294366,-1.6536302553934439,2
2022-07-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-space-chief-dismissed-nasa-gets-deal-for-joint-crews/,Russian space chief dismissed; NASA gets deal for joint crews,"Dmitry Rogozin, the bellicose director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos who has railed against NASA and its western space allies over sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is stepping down under orders from President Vladimir Putin, the Russian news agency Tass reported Friday. Rogozin, who once derisively joked that NASA would need trampolines to get its astronauts to space without Russian help and who later said the United States would need ""broomsticks"" to reach orbit without Russian rocket engines, will be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov. The Kremlin announced Rogozin's dismissal on its website by simply saying Putin ""signed the Executive Order on Dmitry Rogozin."" It did not indicate what led to the decision, whether Rogozin was being re-assigned to some other government function or even whether the dismissal was punitive. The shakeup came as NASA and Roscosmos put the finishing touches on a long-sought agreement to resume ""integrated"" launch operations, that is, assigning cosmonauts to SpaceX Dragon crews and NASA astronauts to Russian Soyuz crews for flights to the International Space Station. The ""seat-swap"" arrangement will ensure at least one cosmonaut or astronaut is always aboard the space station to operate or repair their agency's systems even if an emergency forces a Soyuz or Crew Dragon to leave early, taking all that vehicle's crew members home with it. The agreement goes into effect with the next two crew rotation flights in September. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio will join Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin aboard the Soyuz MS-22 vehicle, scheduled for launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Sept. 21. Cosmonaut Anna Kikina also will launch in September aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule along with NASA astronauts Nicole Mann, Josh Cassada and veteran Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata. Launch had been targeted for Sept. 1, but NASA officials are no longer saying when the mission might get underway, indicating a delay may be in the offing. NASA also announced Friday that astronaut Loral O'Hara will launch aboard the Soyuz MS-23 spacecraft next spring, along with Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub. Cosmonaut Andrei Fedyaev will join astronauts Steve Bowen and Woody Hoburg aboard a SpaceX capsule that's also targeting a spring 2023 launch. ""The station was designed to be interdependent and relies on contributions from each space agency to function,"" the NASA statement said. ""No one agency has the capability to function independent of the others."" The agreement comes amid escalating Cold War-level tension between Russia, the United States and Europe over the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Rogozin has been particularly vocal on social media in response to western sanctions and other perceived threats. His departure comes a few days after the European Space Agency pulled out of the joint ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars mission, a high-profile project to land a sophisticated rover on the red planet to search for signs of past life. Roscosmos earlier terminated commercial Soyuz launch operations at ESA's Kourou, French Guiana, flight facility. ESA said it was ending its participation in ExoMars due to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Rogozin responded by saying Roscosmos would not allow use of a new ESA robot arm launched last year as part of the Russian Nauka multi-purpose laboratory module. ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti and Russian station commander Oleg Artemyev are scheduled to carry out a spacewalk next Thursday to outfit the arm and prepare it for operational use. Despite Rogozin's comments, those preparations are continuing and it's not clear how serious he might have been. Rogozin's post-invasion tweets initially triggered widespread concern about the future of the ISS, but as they continued, the posts were taken less seriously and now have become fodder for jokes in the West. SpaceX, which has now launched 164 Falcon 9 rockets — 30 so far this year alone — recently used Rogozin's broomstick comment to make a patriotic affirmation of U.S. rocket technology to the delight of listeners tuned in to a company launch webcast. ""Time to let the American broomstick fly, and hear the sound of freedom!"" SpaceX launch director Julia Black said as a Falcon 9 countdown neared zero. ""LD is go for launch."" But Rogozin's criticisms of American policy and threats to end space station cooperation were not taken lightly. He even joked about nuclear weapons. When sanctions were imposed on three Russian companies that provide propellants and technology for Russian ICBMs, Rogozin tweeted ""now their products will not be able to obtain visas to visit the United States. Strange, because by definition they enjoy a visa-free regime and are always ready to visit the aggressor country."" He has suggested President Joe Biden suffers from Alzheimer's disease and said Russian thrusters are all that allow the space station to dodge threatening ""space garbage, with which your talented businessmen have polluted the near-Earth orbit."" He was presumably referring to SpaceX founder Elon Musk and his company's ongoing effort to launch thousands of Starlink internet satellites. ""If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the United States or Europe? There is also the option of dropping a 500-ton structure to India and China,"" Rogozin said in remarks translated by Google. ""Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? ... All the risks are yours. Are you ready for them?"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and other agency leaders have never responded to Rogozin's broadsides, avoiding any direct criticism of Roscosmos. Instead, they have only said NASA continues to work with the Russian space agency to safely operate the space station, which cannot be operated by either country on its own. Russia provides the propellant and thrusters, either on the station or visiting Progress cargo ships, to change the station's orbit and offset the effects of atmospheric drag. NASA provides the bulk of the lab's electrical power, the massive gyroscopes that help maintain the station's orientation and a station-wide computer and communications network. Russian cosmonauts are not trained to operate U.S. systems and vice versa, meaning at least one astronaut and one cosmonaut must be aboard at all times. If either side pulled out, the other likely would have to depart as well, or quickly come up with alternative systems. NASA wants to operate the space station through 2030, but Russian cooperation is required. And it's not yet known whether Russia will go along.",3,5.505598949374115,7.41937117309802,-1.913772223723905,6
2022-07-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/log4j-cyber-safety-review-board-report/,"Panel finds notorious Log4j internet bug did not lead to any ""significant"" attacks on critical infrastructure","A panel of U.S. government officials and private-sector experts tasked with investigating the nation's major cybersecurity failures has concluded that the notorious Log4j internet bug did not prompt any ""significant"" attacks on critical infrastructure systems. A serious flaw living inside an open-source Java-based software known as ""Log4j"" shook the world last December when officials estimated that it left hundreds of millions of devices exposed to potential breaches. The fledgling Cyber Safety Review Board, loosely modeled off the National Transportation Safety Board and housed under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), released the findings of its investigation into the vulnerability on Thursday. Led by Chair Rob Silvers, the undersecretary for policy at DHS, and Vice Chair Heather Adkins, senior director of security engineering at Google, the new group, which draws its authority from an executive order signed by President Biden last year, determined in its inaugural report that the widespread vulnerability did not compromise critical infrastructure nor result in any ""high impact"" incidents by nation state actors. To date, ""exploitation of Log4j occurred at lower levels than many experts predicted, given the severity of the vulnerability,"" the report indicated. Still, the board's leaders warned the potential for breaches remains. ""I think our recommendation that people need to keep an eye on this emphasizes that this incident is not done and that we will continue to hear about new compromises going forward,"" Adkins said Wednesday during a briefing with reporters. Silvers cautioned, however, that the board is limited in its understanding of current exploits because critical infrastructure owners and operators are not yet required to report cyber breaches to the federal government. In March, Congress passed legislation requiring such incidents to be reported to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), but the agency has up to two years to start rulemaking, setting the program's parameters. ""The board noted that because there is currently no cyber incident reporting requirement in effect federally across critical infrastructure, we have potentially limited visibility into exploitation,"" Silvers said. Silvers vowed that CISA is working toward ""rapid implementation"" of the law to establish the new rules ""as quickly as possible.""' The board's 52-page report outlined a comprehensive timeline of events surrounding the discovery of the Log4j vulnerability, beginning in late-November 2021, when a researcher at the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba reported the flaw to its creators within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). ""We believe the global community benefited from the security researcher at Alibaba, who followed coordinated vulnerability disclosure best practices by bringing the discovery of the vulnerability to the Apache Software Foundation, the open source foundation that maintains Log4j,"" Silvers told reporters Wednesday, applauding the cybersecurity expert who first brought the vulnerability to light. Silvers also revealed that the Cyber Safety Review Board reached out to the Chinese ambassador to the United States in an effort to better understand the Chinese government's correspondence with Alibaba. According to the report, the Chinese government informed the Board that Alibaba first reported the vulnerability to its Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) on December 13, 2021, 19 days after the problem was disclosed to ASF. According to Reuters, China has penalized Alibaba for failing to report the Log4j vulnerability sooner, but the Chinese government declined a request from the board to provide more information on the sanctions, according to its report. Silvers said that China's ""lack of transparency"" only ""heightens concern"" among the board that ""China's regulatory regime will discourage network defenders from [disclosing vulnerabilities] with software developers"" in the future. ""Independent of a possible sanction against Alibaba, the Board noted troubling elements of MIIT's regulations governing disclosure of security vulnerabilities,"" the report added, suggesting that the Chinese government's requirement for providers to report vulnerabilities to them within two days of discovery ""could give the PRC government early knowledge of vulnerabilities before vendor fixes are made available to the community."" ""The Board is concerned this will afford the [Chinese] government a window in which to exploit vulnerabilities before network defenders can patch them. This is a disturbing prospect given the [Chinese] government's known track record of intellectual property theft, intelligence collection, surveillance of human rights activists and dissidents, and military cyber operations,"" the report continued. The report also outlined a series of recommendations for enhanced cybersecurity going forward, including a push for a better ""software ecosystem."" As part of that initiative, the board recommended further investments in open-source software security and urged software developers to generate a ""Software Bill of Materials,"" or ""SBOM,"" that can be shipped with their product. This catalog of sorts would be designed to let consumers know what sort of software lives inside their products and applications, somewhat akin to what a nutrition facts label does for food. ""Our observation is that organizations using open source software should be supporting that community directly – getting them access to training programs, developing the tool sets that will make things like SBOMs adoptable,"" Adkins told reporters. The 15-member panel dealt with nearly 80 organizations and individuals representing software developers, end users, security professionals, and companies to produce Thursday's report. Participants included Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, AT&T and Google, in addition to a slew of private companies, cybersecurity firms and scores of government agencies around the globe. The Cyber Safety Review Board was originally tasked with conducting a postmortem of the massive SolarWinds breach carried out by Russian hackers, but ultimately pivoted to studying the impact of the Log4j flaw. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called the cyber threat environment ""as diverse and critical as it's ever been,"" during Wednesday's briefing. ""We are seeing nation state cyber actors and cybercriminals, including those involved in ransomware operations, routinely use cyber means to steal data, gain financially and hold critical infrastructure at risk,"" the secretary added. CISA in February launched a ""shields up"" campaign to urge U.S. companies to safeguard against possible cyberattacks in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That warning has lasted for 150 days so far.",3,4.071112045813865,7.710517867183171,-3.639405821369306,1

The country's president called the attack ""an open act of terrorism"" against civilians in locations without any military value. Ukraine's national police said three missiles hit an office building and damaged nearby residential buildings in Vinnytsia, which is about 167 miles southwest of the capital, Kyiv. The missile strike ignited a fire that expanded to engulf 50 cars in an adjacent parking lot. The governor of the Vinnytsia region, Serhiy Borzov, said Ukrainian air defense systems shot down another four missiles over the area. Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi told news reporters in Vinnytsya that 21 people were killed in the strike and at least 91 others wounded, 50 of them seriously. He said three children were among the dead. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested the attack was deliberately aimed at civilians. The strike happened as government officials from about 40 countries met in The Hague to discuss coordinating efforts to investigate and prosecute potential war crimes in Ukraine. ""Every day Russia is destroying the civilian population, killing Ukrainian children, directing missiles at civilian objects. Where there is no military (targets). What is it if not an open act of terrorism?"" Zelenskyy wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Speaking Thursday to CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams, Ukraine's Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov echoed Zelenskyy's remarks, calling the strike in Vinnytsia ""the next proof that we have again a war not with a normal state, but we have a war with a state of terrorists."" ""They are using their weapons against civilian people, against civilian facilities,"" the defense chief told CBS News. ""You saw the Kremenchuk tragedy, you saw the atrocities in Bucha, Irpin, and again you saw it in Vinnytsia."" Russia didn't officially confirm the strike, but Margarita Simonyan, head of the state-controlled Russian television network RT, said on her Telegram channel that military officials told her a building in Vinnytsia was targeted because it housed Ukrainian ""Nazis."" Before the missiles hit Vinnytsia the president's office reported the deaths of five civilians and the wounding of another eight in Russian attacks over the past day. One person was wounded when a missile damaged several buildings in the southern city of Mykolaiv early Thursday, Ukrainian authorities said. A missile attack on Wednesday killed at least five people in the city. Russian forces also continued artillery and missile attacks in eastern Ukraine, primarily in Donetsk province after overtaking adjacent Luhansk. The city of Lysychansk, the last major stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in Luhansk, fell to Russian forces at the beginning of the month. Luhansk and Donetsk together make up the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking region of steel factories, mines and other industries. Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko urged residents to evacuate as ""quickly as possible."" ""We are urging civilians to leave the region, where electricity, water and gas are in short supply after the Russian shelling,"" Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. ""The fighting is intensifying, and people should stop risking their lives and leave the region."" The British Defense Ministry said Thursday that despite continued shelling in the Donbas region, Russian forces did not make major territorial gains in recent days. ""The aging vehicles, weapons and Soviet-era tactics used by Russian forces do not lend themselves to quickly regaining or building momentum unless used in overwhelming mass — which Russia is currently unable to bring to bear,"" the British ministry said. Both the Russian forces and Ukrainian militaries are seeking to replenish their depleted stocks of unmanned aerial vehicles to pinpoint enemy positions and guide artillery strikes. Both sides are looking to procure jamming-resistant, advanced drones that could offer a decisive edge in battle. Ukrainian officials say the demand for such technology is ""immense"" with crowdfunding efforts underway to raise the necessary cash for purchases.",17,8.322557479806878,1.7836215629584282,6.53893591684845,17

The head of the Donetsk regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on social media earlier in the day that nine wounded people were rescued from the building in Chasiv Yar. Earlier, video showed a man pulled alive from the rubble of the apartment building. Russia, which denies deliberately targeting civilians, said on Monday it had ""destroyed the temporary deployment point"" of a Ukrainian defense unit in Chasiv Yar, Reuters reported. Yet many in the Donbas, a fertile industrial region in eastern Ukraine made of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, refuse — or are unable — to flee, despite scores of civilians being killed and wounded each week. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and its surrounding region, Russian strikes hit residential buildings, killing four civilians and wounding nine, Ukrainian officials said. ""The Russians continue their tactics of intimidating the peaceful population of the Kharkiv region,"" Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov wrote Tuesday on Telegram. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities said Tuesday that their forces targeted a Russian ammunition depot in southern Ukraine overnight, resulting in a massive explosion captured on social media. The Ukrainian military's southern command said a rocket strike targeted the depot in Russian-held Nova Kakhovka, about 35 miles east of the Black Sea port city of Kherson, which is also occupied by Russian forces. The precision of the strike suggested Ukrainian forces used U.S-supplied multiple-launch High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, to hit the area. Ukraine indicated in recent days that it might launch a counteroffensive to reclaim territory in the country's south as Russia devotes resources to capturing all of the eastern Donbas region. Russia's Tass news agency offered a different account of the blast in Nova Kakhovka, saying a mineral fertilizer storage facility exploded, and that a market, hospital and houses were damaged in the strike. Some of the ingredients in fertilizer can be used for ammunition. A satellite photo taken Tuesday and analyzed by The Associated Press showed significant damage. A massive crater stood precisely where a large warehouse-like structure once stood in the city. Ukraine now has eight of the HIMAR systems, a truck-mounted missile launcher with high accuracy, and Washington has promised to send another four. Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian shelling over the past 24 hours killed at least 16 civilians and wounded 48 more, Ukraine's presidential office said in its Tuesday morning update. Cities and towns in five southeast regions came under Russian fire, the office said. Nine civilians were killed and two more wounded in Donetsk province, which makes up half of the Donbas. Russian rocket attacks targeted the cities of Sloviansk and Toretsk, where a kindergarten was hit, the presidential office said. The British military said Tuesday that Russia was continuing to make ""small, incremental gains"" in Donetsk, where heavy fighting led the province's governor last week to urge its 350,000 remaining residents to move to safer places in western Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities also said that Russian fire struck the southern city of Mykolaiv on Tuesday morning, hitting residential buildings. Twelve people were wounded as the result of the Russian shelling, with some of the rockets hitting two medical facilities, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram. Air raid sirens sounded Tuesday in the western city of Lviv - the first daytime sirens there in over a week - and in other areas of Ukraine as Russian forces continued to make advances. In eastern Luhansk, ""fighting continues near the villages"" on the administrative border with neighboring Donetsk, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai told the Associated Press on Tuesday. ""The Russian army burns down everything in its way. The artillery barrage doesn't stop and sometimes continues for four to six hours on end,"" Haidai said. The British Defense Ministry's intelligence briefing said Russia had seized the Ukrainian town of Hryhorivka and continued to push toward the Donetsk province cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. ""Russian forces are likely maintaining military pressure on Ukrainian forces whilst regrouping and reconstituting for further offensives in the near future,"" the intelligence briefing said. However, Russia may be relying more heavily on private military contractors, like the Wagner Group, to avoid a general mobilization, the British ministry said.

2022-07-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-putin-expands-fast-track-russian-citizenship/,Putin expands fast-track Russian citizenship to all of Ukraine as fighting rages on,"As Russian missiles struck a key Ukrainian city, Russian President Vladimir Putin expanded a fast-track procedure for obtaining Russian citizenship to all Ukrainians on Monday, another effort to strengthen Moscow's influence over war-torn Ukraine. Until recently, only residents of Ukraine's separatist eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as residents of the southern Zaporizhzhia and the Kherson regions, large parts of which are now under Russian control, were eligible to apply for the simplified passport procedure. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Klueba said Putin's signing of a passport decree, which also applies to stateless residents in Ukraine, was an example of his ""predatory appetites."" ""Russia is using the simplified procedure for issuing passports to tighten the noose around the necks of residents of the temporarily occupied territories of our state, forcing them to participate in the criminal activities of the occupying administrations and the Russian army of aggression,"" Ukraine's Foreign Ministry added in a statement. Between 2019, when the procedure was introduced for the residents of Donetsk and Luhansk, and this year, more than 720,000 people living in the rebel-held areas in the two regions — about 18% of the population — have received Russian passports. In late May, three months after Russia invaded Ukraine, the fast-track procedure was also offered to residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. The Russian passport move appears to be part of Putin's political influence strategy, which has also involved introduction of the Russian ruble in occupied territory in Ukraine and could eventually result in the annexation of more Ukrainian territory into the Russian Federation. Russia already annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The Russian president set the stage for such moves even before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, writing an essay last summer claiming that Russians and Ukrainians are one people and attempting to diminish the legitimacy of Ukraine as an independent nation. Reports have surfaced of Russian authorities confiscating Ukrainian passports from some citizens. The passport announcement came hours after Russian shelling of Ukraine's second-largest city on Monday killed at least six people and injured 31, prosecutors and local officials said. Russian troops launched three missile strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, in an attack one official described as ""absolute terrorism."" Russia's Defense Ministry said the attacks struck at the points of deployment for Ukraine's ""nationalist battalions."" Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram that the shelling came from multiple rocket launchers, and those wounded and hospitalized included children aged 4 and 16. ""Only civilian structures — a shopping center and houses of peaceful Kharkiv residents — came under the fire of the Russians. Several shells hit the yards of private houses. Garages and cars were also destroyed. Several fires broke out,"" Syniehubov wrote. Earlier, he said one missile destroyed a school, another hit a residential building, while the third landed near warehouse facilities. ""All (three were launched) exclusively on civilian objects. This is absolute terrorism!"" Syniehubov said. Kharkiv resident Alexander Peresolin said the attacks came without warning, with a blast so fierce he lost consciousness. Neighbors carried him to the basement, where he regained consciousness. ""I was sitting and talking to my wife,"" he said. ""I didn't understand what happened."" The strikes came two days after a Russian rocket attack struck apartment buildings in eastern Ukraine. The death toll in that attack on the town of Chasiv Yar rose to 31 on Monday. Nine people have been rescued from the rubble but more are still believed trapped, emergency officials said. The attack late Saturday destroyed three buildings in a residential quarter used mostly by people who work in factories. Russia's Defense Ministry insisted Monday that the Chasiv Yar target ""was a Ukrainian territorial defense brigade, and that ""more than 300 nationalists"" were killed. The town is also the hometown of Ukraine's president. Russian attacks continued in eastern Ukraine, with Luhansk regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai saying Monday that Russian forces carried out five missile strikes and four rounds of shelling, hitting settlements on the border with the Donetsk region. The Luhansk and Donetsk regions make up Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas, where separatist rebels have fought Ukrainian forces since 2014.

Deadly Russian shelling was reported in Ukraine's east and south. The governor of the eastern Luhansk region, Serhyi Haidai, said Russia launched more than 20 artillery, mortar and rocket strikes on the region overnight and its forces were pressing toward the border with the Donetsk region. ""We are trying to contain the Russians' armed formations along the entire front line,"" Haidai wrote on Telegram. Last week, Russia captured the last major stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in Luhansk, the city of Lysychansk. Analysts predicted Moscow's troops likely would take some time to rearm and regroup. But ""so far there has been no operational pause announced by the enemy. He is still attacking and shelling our lands with the same intensity as before,"" Haidai said. He later said the Russian bombardment of Luhansk was suspended because Ukrainian forces had destroyed ammunition depots and barracks used by the Russians. Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, appealed to residents of Russian-held territories in the south to evacuate quickly so the occupying forces could not use them as human shields during a Ukrainian counteroffensive. ""You need to search for a way to leave, because our armed forces are coming to de-occupy,"" she said. ""There will be a massive fight."" Speaking at a news conference late Friday, Vereshchuk said a civilian evacuation effort was underway for parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. She declined to give details, citing safety. It was not clear how civilians were expected to safely leave Russian-controlled areas while missile strikes and artillery shelling continue in surrounding areas, whether they would be allowed to depart or even hear the government's appeal. The war's death toll continued to rise. Five people were killed and eight more wounded in Russian shelling Friday of Siversk and Semyhirya in the Donetsk region, its governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, wrote Saturday on Telegram. In the city of Sloviansk, named as a likely next target of Russia's offensive, rescuers pulled a 40-year-old man from the rubble of a building destroyed Saturday by shelling. Kyrylenko said multiple people were under the debris. Russian missiles also killed two people and wounded three others Saturday in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih, according to regional authorities. ""They deliberately targeted residential areas,"" Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, said on Telegram. Kryvyi Rih's mayor, Oleksandr Vilkul, asserted on Facebook that cluster munitions had been used and urged residents not to approach unfamiliar objects in the streets. More explosions were reported Saturday evening. Kryvyi Rih is the hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who visited Friday to meet with Vilkul and the brigadier general who commands troops in the region. Zelenskyy's office said he was briefed on the ""construction of defensive structures,"" the support of the troops, the supply of food and medicine to the city and the help given people who had fled to Kryvyi Rih after being driven out of their homes elsewhere in Ukraine. In northeast Ukraine, a Russian rocket strike on Saturday hit the center of Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, injuring six people, including a 12-year-old girl, authorities said. ""An Iskander ballistic missile was probably used,"" the Kharkiv regional prosecutor's office said. ""One of the missiles hit a two-story building, which led to its destruction. Neighboring houses were damaged."" The city has been targeted throughout the war, including several times in the past week. As survivor Valentina Mirgorodksaya dabbed at a cut on her cheek, first responders warily inspected the building shattered in Saturday's strike. Mykolaiv Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych reported on Telegram that six Russian missiles were fired at his city in southern Ukraine near the Black Sea, but caused no casualties. ""On this day alone, Russia hit Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Krivyi Rih, villages in the Zaporizhzhia region,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. ""It hit residential areas, absolutely consciously and on purpose. ... For days on end, the brutal strikes of Russian artillery ... don't stop. Such terrorist action can be stopped only with weapons - modern and powerful ones."" Russian defense officials claimed Saturday that their forces destroyed a hangar housing U.S. howitzers in the Donetsk region, near the town of Chasiv Yar. There was no immediate response from Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Biden administration also confirmed Friday will send an addition $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. It marks the 15th shipment since the war began. The package will include four high mobility artillery rocket systems, according to the Defense Department. The U.S. aid to Ukraine now totals more than $7 billion in ammunition and equipment. In other developments on Saturday, Zelenskyy dismissed several ambassadors, including Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, who has been an outspoken advocate of Kyiv's cause but also ruffled feathers in Berlin. He was persistently critical of Germany's perceived slowness to provide heavy weapons. He also faced criticism for an interview in which he defended Stepan Bandera, a controversial World War II-era Ukrainian nationalist. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying Melnyk was only speaking for himself. Zelenskyy said the dismissals of the ambassadors were part of a routine rotation. Melnyk had served in the post since 2015.",17,1.3984181934366868,1.077490862174282,0.3209273312624048,17

The Saturday night rocket assault is the latest in a recent burst of high-casualty attacks on civilian structures. At least 19 people died when a Russian missile hit a shopping mall in the city of Kremenchuk in late June and 21 people were killed when an apartment building and recreation area came under rocket fire in the southern Odesa region this month. Russia has repeatedly claimed that it is hitting only targets of military value in the war. There was no comment on Chasiv Yar at a Russian Defense Ministry briefing on Sunday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region that includes Chasiv Yar, said the town of of about 12,000 was hit by Uragan rockets, which are fired from truck-borne systems. The Ukrainian emergency services later said the death toll had risen to 15 and that an estimated two dozen people were under the wreckage. Rescuers made voice contact with at least three people trapped in the rubble, it said. Chasiv Yar is about 12 miles southeast of Kramatorsk, a city that is expected to be a major target of Russian forces as they grind westward. The Donetsk region is one of two provinces along with Luhansk that make up the Donbas region, where separatist rebels have fought Ukrainian forces since 2014. Last week, Russia captured the city of Lysychansk, the last major stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in Luhansk. Russian forces are raising ""true hell"" in the Donbas, despite assessments they were taking an operational pause, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said Saturday. After the seizure of Lysychansk, some analysts predicted Moscow's troops likely would take some time to rearm and regroup. But ""so far there has been no operational pause announced by the enemy. He is still attacking and shelling our lands with the same intensity as before,"" Haidai said. He later said the Russian bombardment of Luhansk was suspended because Ukrainian forces had destroyed ammunition depots and barracks used by the Russians.",17,0.6125228335418265,1.31402203765926,-0.7014992041174335,0

Pro-Russia separatists said attacks by Ukrainian forces killed four civilians. The Ukrainian presidential office said Russian forces targeted cities and villages in the country's southeast, with most civilian casualties occurring in Donetsk province, where Russia stepped up its offensive in recent days. Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a Telegram post that two people died in the city of Avdiivka, which is located in the center of the province, and the Donetsk cities of Sloviansk, Krasnohorivka and Kurakhove each reported one civilian killed. ""Every crime will be punished,"" he wrote. Kyrylenko urged the province's more than 350,000 remaining residents to flee late Tuesday, saying that evacuating Donetsk was necessary to save lives and allow the Ukrainian army to put up a better defense against the Russian advance. Donetsk is part of the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking industrial area where Ukraine's most experienced soldiers are concentrated. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday declared the complete seizure of the region's other province, Luhansk, after Ukrainian troops withdrew from the last city under their country. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai denied Wednesday that the Russians had completely captured the province. Heavy fighting continued in villages around Lysychansk, the city Ukrainians soldiers withdrew from and which Russian troops took on Sunday, he said. ""The Russians have paid a high price, but the Luhansk region is not fully captured by the Russian army,"" Haidai said. ""Some settlements have been overrun by each side several times already."" He accused Russian forces of scorched-earth tactics, ""burning down and destroying everything on their way."" CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reported Russia is still bombarding civilian areas deep inside Ukrainian territory, including a recent missile strike that killed retired schoolteacher Vera Maksimenko. She was killed in her own home in the sleepy town of Serhiivka by an airstrike on Saturday, what Ukrainian officials say was a Soviet-era missile designed to destroy warships. For 37 years, she worked as a teacher. Her friend told Williams that the kids loved her, but ""evil people came to our country and brutally killed her."" ""Russia is a terrorist state,"" her son Dmitriy told CBS News. But he doesn't want revenge. He doesn't want any more violence. ""I don't need killing,"" he told Williams. ""I want justice."" Ukrainian officials say they're investigating the strike as a war crime. Up to 15,000 residents remain in Lysychansk and some 8,000 in the nearby city of Sievierodonetsk, which Russian and separatist fighters seized last month, Haidai said. Pro-Russian separatists have fought Ukrainian forces and controlled much of the Donbas for eight years. Before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Putin recognized the independence of the two self-proclaimed separatist republics in the region. Separatist authorities in Donetsk said Wednesday that four civilians were killed and another 14 wounded in Ukrainian shelling over the past 24 hours. News reports said shelling hit an ammunition depot on Tuesday, triggering massive explosions. Since Russian forces failed to make inroads in capturing Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, Moscow has concentrated its offensive on seizing the remaining Ukrainian-held areas of the Donbas. To the north of Donetsk, Russian forces also hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, with missile strikes overnight, the Kharkiv regional governor said Wednesday on Telegram. Three districts of the city were targeted, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. One person was killed and three, including a toddler, sustained injuries, according to the governor. A missile struck a building where military registration takes place. A government building next door remained intact, and people just steps away glanced at the wreckage in passing. Closer to the front line and in a more abandoned district of the city, first responders crunched through the debris of another overnight attack at the national teaching university in Kharkiv. Pages of dusty textbooks flapped in the breeze. The attacks indicated the city, which is located close to the Russian border, is unlikely to get a reprieve as the war grinds on into its fifth month. Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces killed up to 100 Ukrainian troops and destroyed four armored vehicles in Kharkiv, and struck a Ukrainian air-defense radar and a camp housing foreign fighters in southern Ukraine's Mykolaiv region. The ministry's chief spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, said air-launched high precision missiles also destroyed two HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems the U.S. sent to Ukraine. The Ukrainian military denied Moscow's claims, calling them ""nothing more than a fake"" in a Facebook post.

The EU has already imposed sanctions on Russia, including on some energy supplies, and is trying to find other sources. But von der Leyen said the bloc needed to be ready for shock disruptions coming from Moscow. • European Union lawmakers voted to support a plan by the bloc's executive commission to include natural gas and nuclear power in its list of sustainable activities.

2022-07-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-finland-sweden-accession-protocols-russia-ukraine-war/,"NATO allies sign accession protocols for Finland and Sweden in ""truly historic moment""","London — NATO's 30 ambassadors on Tuesday signed accession protocols for Sweden and Finland to join the transatlantic military alliance. It was the next step in the process of NATO's most significant expansion since the mid-1990s, and a direct response by the alliance to Russia's war on Ukraine. The protocols still must be ratified by the legislatures of each allied government before the two Nordic countries become official members, but the group's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called it ""truly an historic moment for Finland, for Sweden and for NATO."" ""With 32 nations around the table, we will be even stronger,"" Stoltenberg said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has pointed to NATO's eastward expansion in Europe as one of the key factors that prompted him to order the invasion of Ukraine in February. But when Finland and Sweden become full-fledged members, it will put two more NATO nations on or very near Russia's land borders. One demand Russia made of Ukraine before the invasion was that it commit to never joining NATO, in part because of Moscow's concerns over having NATO countries on its immediate border. ""With Sweden and Finland, we don't have the problems that we have with Ukraine. They want to join NATO, go ahead,"" Putin said on Russian state television last week. But he added a caveat: ""If military contingents and infrastructure are deployed there, we will have to respond in kind and create the same threats for the territories from which threats towards us are created."" Any prospective NATO member must have the blessing of all existing members, and Turkey initially said it would block the bids by Finland and Sweden to join unless Turkish opposition members in the European nations were handed over to Ankara. Turkey struck a deal with the Nordic countries at a NATO summit last week and dropped that threat, but it has warned it could still block their accession if it feels they're not delivering on their end of the bargain. Stoltenberg said Tuesday that he expects the ratification to go forward. ""There were security concerns that needed to be addressed, and we did what we always do at NATO — we found common ground,"" he said. It could still take months for Sweden and Finland to become official NATO members, as each nation in the alliance has its own specific legislative procedures to go through. But representatives from the two countries can now attend NATO meetings, even if they don't have voting rights, and they'll get greater access to intelligence. Before ratification, they are not protected under the NATO alliance's mutual defense clause, however, which says an attack on one is an attack on all. So far, that clause - Article 5 in the NATO charter - has only been invoked one time, by the United States when it called on its allies to help topple the Taliban regime in Afghanistan that enabled al Qaeda to attack on September 11, 2001. ""We will be even stronger and our people will be even safer as we face the biggest security crisis in decades,"" Stoltenberg said Tuesday.",29,6.764905718086634,5.083739903548897,1.6811658145377377,13

But Ukraine's president said the fight for the city of Lysychansk was ongoing. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin that Russia's troops together with members of a local separatist militia ""have established full control over the city of Lysychansk,"" a ministry statement said. Taking Lysychansk constitutes ""the liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic,"" one of two separatist regions in Ukraine that Russia recognizes as sovereign, the statement said. Ukrainian fighters spent weeks trying to defend Lysychansk and to keep it from falling to Russia, as neighboring Sievierodonetsk did a week ago. ""We cannot give you the final judgment. Lysychansk is still being fought for,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference Sunday alongside Australia's visiting prime minister. He said Ukrainian forces were still battling Russia's soldiers on the city's outskirts and that territory can move quickly from one side to the other. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskyy, had predicted late Saturday that Lysychansk's fate could be determined within days. Earlier Sunday, Luhansk's governor said Russian forces were strengthening their positions in a grueling fight to capture the last stronghold of resistance in the province. ""The occupiers threw all their forces on Lysychansk. They attacked the city with incomprehensibly cruel tactics,"" Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said on the Telegram messaging app. ""They suffer significant losses, but stubbornly advance. They are gaining a foothold in the city."" A river separates Lysychansk from Sievierodonetsk. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said during an online interview late Saturday that Russian forces had managed for the first time to cross the river from the north, creating a ""threatening"" situation. Arestovych said they had not reached the center of the city but that the course of the fighting indicated the battle for Lysychansk would be decided by Monday. Luhansk and neighboring Donetsk are the two provinces that make up the Donbas, where Russia has focused its offensive since pulling back from northern Ukraine and the capital, Kyiv, in the spring. Pro-Russia separatists have held portions of both eastern provinces since 2014, and Moscow recognizes all of Luhansk and Donetsk as sovereign republics. Syria's government said Wednesday that it would also recognize the ""independence and sovereignty"" of the two areas. An occupation of Lysychansk would open the way for the Russians to move west into Donetsk province, where the sizable Ukrainian-held city of Slovyansk has come under rocket attacks several times since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Elsewhere in the war, the exiled mayor of the Russia-occupied city of Melitopol said Sunday that Ukrainian rockets destroyed one of four Russian military bases in the city. The Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine also launched missile and drone attacks in western Russia, on the cities of Kursk and Belgorod, but that the aerial weapons were shot down. Kursk regional governor Roman Starovoit said the town of Tetkino, on the Ukraine border, came under mortar fire. The leader of neighboring Belarus, a Russian ally, claimed Saturday that Ukraine fired missiles at military targets on Belarusian territory several days ago but all were intercepted by an air defense system. President Alexander Lukashenko described the alleged strike as a provocation and noted that no Belarusian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine. There was no immediate response from the Ukrainian military. Belarus hosts Russian military units and was used as a staging ground for Russia's invasion. Last week, just hours before Lukashenko was to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian long-range bombers fired missiles on Ukraine from Belarusian airspace for the first time. Lukashenko has so far resisted efforts to draw his army into the war. But during their meeting, Putin announced that Russia planned to supply Belarus with the Iskander-M missile system and reminded Lukashenko that his government depends on economic support from Russia.",14,4.578047534232696,0.6163706828386297,3.961676851394066,0
2022-07-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/ukrainian-forces-withdraw-from-lysychansk/,Ukrainian Forces Withdraw From Lysychansk,"UKRAINE. (CW44 News At 10 | CNN) -- Russia has taken control of Lysychansk, the last city in the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine that was still under Ukrainian control. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin that the military had taken over Lysychansk and a number of nearby settlements on Sunday, according to the country's Ministry of Defense. Ukraine's military announced Sunday that it had been ""forced to withdraw"" from the critical city. In his nightly televised address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the retreat from Lysychansk was motivated to save the lives of Ukrainian troops. ""We will rebuild the walls, we will win back the land, and people must be protected above all else,"" he said. Luhansk is one of the two regions that form Donbas, the eastern part of Ukraine where the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists started in 2014. The area has became the key centerpiece of Putin's military ambition in Ukraine after his troops failed to take over Kyiv earlier this year. The fall of Lysychansk shifts Russia closer to achieving the goal of taking over Donbas. ""After heavy fighting for Lysychansk, the Defense Forces of Ukraine were forced to withdraw from their occupied positions and lines,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Sunday on Twitter. Accompanying the announcement was a photo that read: ""Lysychansk: We'll be back."" A Facebook post by the Ukrainian military also cited Russian superiority in weapons, ammunition and personnel in the battle for the city. ""We continue the fight. Unfortunately, steel will and patriotism are not enough for success - material and technical resources are needed,"" that post read. Pro-Russia separatists in the area had already claimed a victory in the battle over Lysychansk. Leonid Pasechnik, the leader of the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), declared the Luhansk region ""liberated."" ""Today is the day we have accomplished what we all have been striving to for eight long years. Today our troops, with the support of the Russian armed forces, liberated the town of Lysychansk, thus completing the liberation of the Republic within its historic borders,"" Pasechnik said. Only Russia and Syria recognize the LPR as independent. Ukraine and its western allies consider it part of the Ukrainian territory, currently under Russian occupation. Video shared by Russian state news outlet Ria Novosti on Saturday purports to show residents installing he old Soviet Union flag at the Memorial to the Memory of the Fallen in Lysychansk. The Institute for the Study of War said Russia will likely establish control over the remaining territory of Luhansk region in coming days. After that, the institute said in its latest update, Russian troops will likely focus on Ukrainian positions in Siversk, west of Lysychansk, before turning inland to Sloviansk and Bakhmut. The Donetsk region military administration said Sunday that Russian forces continued shelling Slovyansk and Bakhmut. At least six people have died and 15 were injured in Sloviansk on Sunday, according to Tetiana Tiurina, the head of the Public Information and Communication Department of Donetsk region. The city of Kramatorsk was also hit with three missile strikes Sunday morning but there were no casualties, according to Ukraine's Donetsk Regional Military Administration. Zelensky said the cities of the Luhansk region were ""the epicenter"" of the hostilities. In his nightly address on Saturday, Zelensky acknowledged that more than 2,600 Ukrainian cities and towns were under Russian control. ""The Russian army continued to fire missiles at our cities,"" Zelensky said, urging people to ""help the army, help volunteers, help everyone who was left alone at this time"" and to use their contacts to ""spread the truth about the war and about the crimes of the occupiers on our land."" Meanwhile, Ukraine forces said they destroyed a Russian military base in the occupied Melitopol in southern Ukraine early Sunday morning, the city's exiled mayor Ivan Fedorov said in a video address. Melitopol fell to Russian control in early March, weeks into the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. According to Fedorov, Ukrainian troops filed ""more than 30 shots exclusively at the military base,"" rendering it ""unable to function."" ""Now the whole city is covered in smoke. This has been going on for three to four hours. Warehouses on the territory of the transport aviation base are burning,"" Fedorov added. The head of the Russia-installed council in the Zaporizhzhia region, Evgeny Balitsky, said in a Telegram post Sunday that ""shells fell on the territory on the airfield"" and that ""there were no casualties."" Russian state news agency RIA Novosti also confirmed the attack, reporting that Ukraine had hit the Aviagorodok area of Melitopol, but did not specify what had been targeted. The Russian Defense Ministry also claimed on Sunday that the Ukrainian military launched ""a deliberate strike"" on residential areas of the Russian cities of Belgorod and Kursk. The ministry's spokesperson Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said in a statement that Ukrainian forces targeted the cities with Tochka-U ballistic missiles with cluster munitions and drones. He said three ballistic missiles launched at Belgorod were destroyed by Russian air defense systems in the air, adding that the wreckage of one of the missiles fell on a residential building in the city. Konashenkov also claimed Russian air defense systems destroyed two Ukrainian military drones as they approached the city of Kursk, about 130 km (80 miles) north of Belgorod. CNN has been unable to independently confirm those claims and the Ukrainian military has not yet commented on the strikes. The governor of the Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement posted on his Telegram channel that at least three people were killed, and dozens of residential buildings were damaged by explosions early on Sunday morning. Separately, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday accused Ukraine of launching a missile attack against military facilities on his country two days earlier. In remarks published on the presidential website on Saturday, Lukashenko said Belarusian forces intercepted the missiles. However, he did not provide any evidence of Ukraine's alleged attack. Ukraine's military did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment on Lukashenko's claims. Lukashenko, Putin's key ally in the region, said his country was being dragged into a war with Ukraine and claimed that ""not a single Belarusian soldier is fighting on the territory of Ukraine."" Russian troops launched the invasion on February 24 into Ukraine from Belarus after months amassing manpower and material along Ukraine's border. According to intelligence collected by NATO surveillance aircraft and CNN reporting, Belarus' support for the Russian invasion includes air operations, in addition to ground support.

Ukrainian fighters have spent weeks trying to defend the city and to keep it from falling to Russia, as neighboring Sievierodonetsk did a week ago. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces took control of an oil refinery on Lysychansk's edge in recent days, but Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai reported Friday that fighting for the facility continued. ""Over the last day, the occupiers opened fire from all available kinds of weapons,"" Haidai said Saturday on the Telegram messaging app. Luhansk and neighboring Donetsk are the two provinces that make up the Donbas region, where Russia has focused its offensive since pulling back from the northern Ukraine and the capital, Kyiv, in the spring. Pro-Russia separatists have held portions of both provinces since 2014, and Moscow recognizes all of Luhansk and Donetsk as sovereign republics. Syria's government said Wednesday that it would also recognize the ""independence and sovereignty"" of the two areas and work to establish diplomatic relations with the separatists. In Slovyansk, a major Donetsk city still under Ukrainian control, four people died when Russian forces fired cluster munitions late Friday, Mayor Vadym Lyakh said on Facebook. He said the neighborhoods that were hit did not contain any potential military targets. Elsewhere, investigators combed through the wreckage from a Russian airstrike early Friday on residential areas near the Ukrainian port of Odesa that killed 21 people. Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the investigators were recovering fragments from missiles that struck an apartment building in the small coastal town of Serhiivka. They also were taking measurements to determine the trajectory of the weapons, she said. ""We are taking all the necessary investigative measures to determine the specific people guilty of this terrible war crime,"" Venediktova said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said three anti-ship missiles struck ""an ordinary residential building, a nine-story building"" housing about 160 people. The victims of Friday's attack also included four members of a familystaying at a ""typical"" seaside campsite, he said. 'I emphasize: this is a deliberate direct Russian terror, and not some mistake or an accidental missile strike,"" Zelenskyy said. The British Defense Ministry said Saturday that air-launched anti-ship missiles generally do not have precision accuracy against ground targets. It said Russia likely was using such missiles because of a shortage of more accurate weapons. The Kremlin has repeatedly claimed that the Russian military is targeting fuel storage sites and military facilities, not residential areas, although missiles also recently hit an apartment building in Kyiv and a shopping mall in the central city of Kremenchuk. On Saturday, Kremenchuk Mayor Vitaliy Maletskyy said the death toll in the mall attack had risen to 21 and one person was still missing. Ukrainian authorities interpreted the missile attack in Odesa as payback for the withdrawal of Russian troops from a nearby Black Sea island with both symbolic and strategic significance in the war that started with Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Moscow portrayed their departure from Snake Island as a ""goodwill gesture"" to help unblock exports of grain.",17,1.097828756197233,0.44551250731704656,0.6523162488801866,17

Video of the attack before daybreak showed the charred ruins of buildings in the small town of Serhiivka, about 31 miles from Odesa. The Ukrainian president's office said warplanes fired three missiles that struck an apartment building and a campsite. Ukrainian authorities interpreted the attack as payback for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Snake Island a day earlier, though Moscow portrayed their departure as a ""goodwill gesture"" to help unblock exports of grain. Russian forces took control of the island in the opening days of the war in the apparent hope of using it as a staging ground for an assault on Odesa, Ukraine's biggest port and the headquarters of its navy. ""The occupiers cannot win on the battlefield, so they resort to vile killing of civilians,"" said Ivan Bakanov, head of Ukraine's security service, the SBU. ""After the enemy was dislodged from Snake Island, he decided to respond with the cynical shelling of civilian targets."" Large numbers of civilians were killed in Russian bombardments earlier in the war, including at a hospital, a theater used as a shelter, and a train station. Until this week, mass casualties involving residents appeared to become less frequent as Moscow concentrated on capturing eastern Ukraine's Donbas region. Russian missiles struck the Kyiv region last weekend after weeks of relative calm around the capital, and an airstrike Monday on a shopping mall in the central city of Kremenchuk killed at least 19 people. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy expressed outrage over Friday's attack. ""These missiles, Kh-22, were designed to destroy aircraft carriers and other large warships, and the Russian army used them against an ordinary nine-story building with ordinary civilian people,"" he said. Twenty-one people were killed, including children, said Serhii Bratchuk, a spokesman for the regional administration. Thirty-eight others, including six children and a pregnant woman, were reported hospitalized. Most of the victims were in the apartment building, Ukrainian emergency officials said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated that Moscow is not targeting residential areas. Oleh Zhdanov, an independent Ukrainian military analyst, said the Russian pullback from Snake Island bears ""colossal psychological significance"" for Ukraine. ""Snake Island is key for controlling the Black Sea and could help cover the Russian attack if the Kremlin opted for an amphibious landing operation in Odesa or elsewhere in the region,"" he said. ""Now those plans are pushed back."" Ukraine's military claimed a barrage of its artillery and missiles forced the Russians to flee the island in two small speedboats. The exact number of troops withdrawn was not disclosed. Early in the war, the island became a symbol of Ukrainian defiance. When a Russian warship demanded that its defenders surrender, they supposedly replied: ""Go (expletive) yourself."" Zelenskyy said that although the pullout did not guarantee the Black Sea region's safety, it would ""significantly limit"" Russian activities there. In eastern Ukraine, Russian forces kept up their push to encircle the city of Lysychansk, the last stronghold of resistance in Luhansk, one of two provinces that make up the Donbas. ""The shelling of the city is very intensive,"" Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said. ""The occupiers are destroying one house after another with heavy artillery and other weapons. Residents of Lysychansk are hiding in basements almost round the clock."" Haidai said the Russians were fighting for control of an oil refinery on the city's edge. But Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Russian and separatist forces had taken control of the refinery as well as a mine and a gelatin factory.

In an interview with CBS News, Karins said leaders of countries that aren't experiencing war first-hand can become ""tired or less committed to aiding the country which is in need."" He urged countries struggling with inflation to accept it as a small price to pay, as ""Ukrainians are paying with their lives."" This week, NATO announced the military alliance's high-readiness forces would be significantly increased from 40,000 to more than 300,000 troops, with a focus on increasing the Eastern flank, close to the EU's borders with Russia. Latvia, a NATO member sharing a land border with Russia, will host the largest NATO force on the Eastern flank with 1,887 troops. Lithuania will have 1,632 and Estonia 1,430. Karins praised the U.S. for its decision to increase the troop presence in the east, saying the announcements made at a NATO summit in Madrid had put the security alliance ""on the right track."" As he left that summit, President Joe Biden vowed that the U.S. would continue to support Ukraine for ""as long as it takes,"" and he said more military aid would be announced in the coming days. Earlier in the week, Mr. Biden reiterated America's commitment to defend its NATO allies, referencing the Article 5 collective defense clause in the alliance's charter. ""We mean it when we say an attack against one is an attack against all,"" the president said Wednesday. During a visit to Turkmenistan on Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia would outlast Ukraine — whose sovereignty he has repeatedly called into question — saying he was in no hurry to end the war that he refers to only as a ""special military operation."" And German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also said in an interview with CBS News' Margaret Brennan Thursday that Putin, having prepared for his war on Ukraine for at least a year before inciting it, is likely ready to wage his offensive for a ""long time."" Karins said NATO leaders shouldn't worry about provoking the Russian autocrat, as ""there's nothing that we in Europe, or in NATO, can do to provoke or not to provoke Putin. He is on his own trajectory, regardless of what it is that we do."" In early June, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that ""we must not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means."" Karins argues there is ""political danger"" in the argument ""that we need peace at any cost, because that translates to peace at the cost of Ukraine."" The Latvian leader called it ""ludicrous"" to imagine any world leader being willing to give up any part of their own nation's territory. According to a May survey by the Washington Post, 72% of Latvian speakers in Latvia saw Russia as the primary threat to their country, and almost 80% of Latvian speakers supported a larger NATO presence. With a long history of Russian invasion and occupation, the threat of Russia looms large over the collective Latvian subconscious. Karins warned that a Russian victory in Ukraine ""would radically change world order."" ""It's like giving the devil your little finger. It might seem good at first, but in the end, you're essentially in the first step of giving up your own way of life,"" he said. Latvia has already been on the receiving end of Russia's aggression in the form of cyberattacks and disinformation. Karins described a ""steady barrage"" of Russian cyberattacks, which he said his own country's defense forces had managed to to stay one step ahead of. Latvia has been targeted with cyberattacks by the Russian hacking group ""Killnet"" and its associated groups since May, according to Latvian Radio. Russia's disinformation campaign has also targeted Russian speakers in Latvia in an effort to ""try to split our society,"" according to Karins. Since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Latvia's media watchdog has shut down more than 100 television channels and websites spreading Russian propaganda, Karins told CBS News. Just as important, Karins said, have been Latvia's efforts to fill the void left by those Russian language channels with objective information. ""We all need to do a little more,'' he said. ""If Latvia, which is not the richest of countries in Europe, can donate the equivalent of one third of our annual military budget to Ukraine, then certainly some of our friends and neighbors, who are relatively more wealthy, can probably donate a little bit more than they have today.""",29,6.564022306816894,2.8445863351687066,3.7194359716481875,25
2022-06-30,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-snake-island-early-symbol-ukrainian-defiance/,"Russia abandons strategic Snake Island, the early symbol of Ukrainian defiance","Russian troops have left their positions on a captured Ukrainian island, defense officials said Thursday, a major setback to Moscow's invasion that weakens its blockade of Ukraine's ports. The news from the Black Sea came as NATO leaders met for a second day in Madrid, intent on demonstrating their unity and determination to back up Kyiv with advances weapons in the face of Moscow's assault. Snake Island became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance in the first days of the war, when the rocky outcrop's defenders told a Russian warship that called on them to surrender to ""go f**k yourself,"" an incident that spurred a defiant meme. It was also a strategic target, sitting aside shipping lanes near Ukraine's port of Odessa. Russia had attempted to install missile and air defense batteries while under fire from drones. Now, however, Ukraine has begun to receive longer range missiles and military gear from its Western backers and Russia's position on Snake Island apparently became untenable. And Valeriy Zaluzhny, the Ukraine military's commander-in-chief, said on Telegram that Ukrainian-made howitzers also played an important role, according to the Reuters news service. Reuters says Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's chief of staff, tweeted, ""KABOOM! No Russian troops on the Snake Island anymore. Our Armed Forces did a great job."" The Russian defense ministry statement described the retreat as ""a gesture of goodwill"" meant to demonstrate that Moscow won't interfere with U.N. efforts to organize protected grain exports from Ukraine. But Kyiv claimed it as a win. ""I thank the defenders of Odessa region who took maximum measures to liberate a strategically important part of our territory,"" Valeriy Zaluzhny said. Ukrainian troops on the island were captured by Russian forces but were later freed in a prisoner swap. Then Ukraine began heavily bombarding the small Russian presence there and its air defenses. In peacetime, Ukraine is a major agricultural exporter, but Russia's invasion has damaged farmland and seen Ukraine's ports seized, razed or blockaded -- threatening grain importers in Africa with famine. Western powers have accused President Vladimir Putin of using the trapped harvest as a weapon to increase pressure on the international community, and Russia has been accused of stealing grain. On Thursday, a ship carrying 7,000 tons of grain sailed from Ukraine's occupied port of Berdyansk, said the regional leader appointed by the Russian occupation forces. Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Moscow administration, said Russia's Black Sea ships ""are ensuring the security"" of the journey he said, adding that the port had been de-mined.",14,4.698884389173326,7.017366113371941,-2.318481724198615,17
2022-06-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-us-boosting-force-posture-in-europe-for-russia-threat/,U.S. to boost military presence in Europe for Russia threat,"President Biden said Wednesday that the U.S. will significantly increase its military presence in Europe for the long haul, including by establishing its first permanent presence in Poland, to bolster regional security after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the opening of the alliance's annual leaders' summit in Madrid, Mr. Biden said ""NATO is strong and united"" and that steps to be taken during the gathering will ""further augment our collective strength."" Mr. Biden opened his participation in the summit by announcing the permanent basing of a U.S. military garrison in Poland. He also said the U.S. is sending two additional F-35 fighter jet squadrons to the UK and will send more air defense and other capabilities to Germany and Italy. ""Today I'm announcing the United States will enhance our force posture in Europe and respond to the changing security environment as well as strengthening our collective security,"" he said. Stoltenberg, who earlier Wednesday said the alliance was facing its biggest challenge since World War II because of Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, welcomed Mr. Biden's announcement. ""This really demonstrates your decisive leadership and strength in the trans-Atlantic bond,"" Stoltenberg said, thanking Mr. Biden for the ""unwavering support from you and from the United States to Ukraine."" Mr. Biden said the U.S. will permanently station the U.S. Army V Corps forward command in Poland, a move that he said would strengthen U.S.-NATO interoperability across the alliance's eastern flank. The move marks the first permanent basing of U.S. forces on NATO's eastern edge. Mr. Biden added that the U.S. is also stepping up its rotational deployments of troops to Romania and the Baltic region. Celeste Wallander, an assistant U.S. secretary of defense for international affairs, told reporters that having a permanent presence in Poland will be key to helping NATO navigate the changed security environment in Europe caused by Russia's invasion. The U.S. supplies the bulk of NATO's military power. U.S. officials emphasized that the permanent basing applied only to headquarters units, not combat troops, and was therefore consistent with a 1997 agreement between NATO and Russia in which the alliance agreed not to permanently base combat troops in Eastern Europe as it aimed to build more constructive ties in the post-Cold War environment. Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski told Poland's state PAP news agency that the decision to add U.S. command structure was a ""manifestation of the ever closer cooperation between the U.S. and Poland"" and would give give NATO allies a frontline insight into the Russian threat. The combat units Mr. Biden is sending to Romania and the Baltic region are on rotational deployments, rather than permanent assignment, to remain in compliance with that agreement. ""There has been no communication with Moscow about these changes, nor is there a requirement to do that,"" John Kirby, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's National Security Council. Mr. Biden announced on Tuesday after arriving for the summit that the U.S. would base two additional destroyers at its naval base in Rota, Spain, bringing the total number to six. The U.S. currently has more than 100,000 servicemembers deployed across Europe, up by about 20,000 since just before Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine began four months ago. Mr. Biden predicted that meetings this week would make for a ""history-making summit"" as leaders were set to approve a new strategic framework, announce a range of steps to boost their defense spending and capabilities, and clear the way for historically neutral Finland and Sweden to join NATO. Mr. Biden said Putin thought NATO members would splinter after he invaded Ukraine, but got the opposite response instead. ""Putin was looking for the Finland-ization of Europe,"" Mr. Biden said. ""You're gonna get the NATO-ization of Europe. And that's exactly what he didn't want, but exactly what needs to be done to guarantee security for Europe."" Turkey, the last remaining holdout to approve the Nordic countries' accession into NATO, reached an agreement on the eve of the summit late Tuesday to support adding them to the 30-nation alliance. While the White House said the U.S. was not a direct party to the negotiations, a senior administration official said Mr. Biden spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Tuesday to encourage him to clear the way for Sweden and Finland to join. The two leaders are set to meet Wednesday afternoon to discuss other issues, the White House said. Mr. Biden will also sit down Wednesday with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who are attending the NATO summit as the alliance looks to strengthen its ties in the Indo-Pacific region and address challenges from China. The White House said the three leaders would also discuss North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",29,4.176175967989676,7.105677225515602,-2.929501257525926,25
2022-06-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-video-debunk-russia-lies-missile-strike-kremenchuk-shopping-mall/,Videos debunk Russia's lies about missile strike on Ukraine mall,"Kyiv — Video has emerged that appears to refute Russian propaganda suggesting that a missile strike on a shopping mall in Ukraine never happened. At least 18 people died and about 60 were wounded in the Monday strike, according to Ukrainian officials, but Russia claims it only hit a legitimate military target near the mall. Video from security cameras in the area clearly caught the moment when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a Russian X-22 cruise missile slammed into the shopping center in the central city of Kremenchuk. A shockwave ripples across the area just before people in a park are seen falling to the ground and fleeing for cover. Emergency workers were still searching through the wreckage of the shopping center on Wednesday, with about 20 people still listed as missing. Zelenskyy shared another video that he said showed the X-22 rocket — a long-range cruise missile designed in the former Soviet Union to sink American aircraft carriers — flying at an angle into the mall, sending a huge fireball and debris flying in all directions. The Ukrainian leader pleaded on Tuesday for the United Nations to ""act immediately"" to ""hold Russia accountable"" for what he has described as a terrorist attack on his country. In his post sharing the video, Zelenskyy accused Russia of hitting the mall ""purposefully."" ""They wanted to kill as many people as possible in a peaceful city, in a regular shopping mall,"" he said. The security camera videos appear to debunk Russian propaganda spread online suggesting the attack was faked and that the Russian military only hit a military facility near the shopping center. Various Russian accounts have suggested the site targeted was a depot stocked with Western-supplied weapons or a base for Ukrainian military vehicles. CBS News visited the facility just north of the mall, however, and found an asphalt factory. We met Mykola Danyleiko, chairman of the board for the Kredmash Road Machinery Plant, which mixes asphalt to pave roads. ""It's fake,"" he told CBS News of the Russian claims. ""They said we send products from here by railroad. Do you see a railroad?"" The cement plant was hit by a missile on Monday, too, but there was no railway there. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed fire spread from its strike on the plant to the mall, causing the shopping center to burn down. But our team saw no burn path after walking the third of a mile between the two locations. Russian media also said the mall was ""non-operating"" at the time of the strike, but recent online videos suggest otherwise. And fear can't be faked: As we began interviewing a local woman near the mall a day after the strike, an air raid alert started beeping on her phone, and she bolted. She was clearly afraid of another Russian missile strike — which Moscow might again insist never happened.

2022-06-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nato-sweden-finland-turkey-lift-opposition/,"Sweden, Finland closer to joining NATO after Turkey lifts opposition","Turkey agreed Tuesday to lift its opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO, ending an impasse that had clouded a leaders' summit opening in Madrid amid Europe's worst security crisis in decades, triggered by the war in Ukraine. After urgent top-level talks with leaders of the three countries, alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that ""we now have an agreement that paves the way for Finland and Sweden to join NATO."" He called it ""a historic decision."" Among its many shattering consequences, President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has prompted Sweden and Finland to abandon their long-held nonaligned status and apply to join NATO as protection against an increasingly aggressive and unpredictable Russia — which shares a long border with Finland. Under NATO treaties, an attack on any member would be considered an attack against all and trigger a military response by the entire alliance. NATO operates by consensus, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had threatened to block the Nordic pair, insisting they change their stance on Kurdish rebel groups that Turkey considers terrorists. After weeks of diplomacy and hours of talks on Tuesday, Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said the three leaders had signed a joint agreement to break the logjam. Turkey said it had ""got what it wanted"" including ""full cooperation ... in the fight against"" the rebel groups. Stoltenberg said leaders of the 30-nation alliance will issue a formal invitation to the two countries to join on Wednesday. The decision has to be ratified by all individual nations, but he said he was ""absolutely confident"" Finland and Sweden would become members, something that could happen within months. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said the agreement was ""good for Finland and Sweden. And it's good for NATO."" She said completing the process of membership should be done ""the sooner the better."" ""But there are 30 parliaments that need to approve this and you never know,"" Andersson told the Associated Press. Turkey hailed Tuesday's agreement as a triumph, saying the Nordic nations had agreed to crack down on groups that Ankara deems national security threats, including the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and its Syrian extension. It said they also agreed ""not to impose embargo restrictions in the field of defense industry"" on Turkey and to take ""concrete steps on the extradition of terrorist criminals."" Turkey has demanded that Finland and Sweden extradite wanted individuals and lift arms restrictions imposed after Turkey's 2019 military incursion into northeast Syria. Turkey, in turn, agreed ""to support at the 2022 Madrid Summit the invitation of Finland and Sweden to become members of NATO."" Details of exactly what was agreed were unclear. Amineh Kakabaveh, an independent Swedish lawmaker of Kurdish origin whose support the government depends on for a majority in Parliament, said it was ""worrisome that Sweden isn't revealing what promises it has given Erdogan."" Andersson dismissed suggestions Sweden and Finland had conceded too much. Asked if the Swedish public will see the agreement as a concession on issues like extraditions of Kurdish militants regarded by Ankara as terrorists, Andersson said ""they will see that this is good for the security of Sweden."" U.S. President Joe Biden congratulated the three nations on taking a ""crucial step."" Amid speculation about a U.S. role in ending the deadlock, a senior administration official said Washington did not offer any concessions to Turkey to coax it to accept a deal. But the official said the U.S. played a crucial role in helping bring the two parties closer together, and Biden spoke with Erdogan Tuesday morning at the behest of Sweden and Finland to help encourage the talks. The agreement came at the opening of a crucial summit, dominated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that will set the course of the alliance for the coming years. The summit was kicking off with a leaders' dinner hosted by Spain's King Felipe VI at the 18th-century Royal Palace of Madrid. Top of the agenda in meetings Wednesday and Thursday is strengthening defenses against Russia, and supporting Ukraine. Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 shook European security and brought shelling of cities and bloody ground battles back to the continent. NATO, which had begun to turn its focus to terrorism and other non-state threats, has had to confront an adversarial Russia once again. Biden said NATO was ""as united and galvanized as I think we have ever been."" A Russian missile strike Monday on a shopping mall in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk was a grim reminder of the war's horrors. Some saw the timing, as Group of Seven leaders met in Germany and just ahead of the NATO gathering, as a message from Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is due to address NATO leaders by video on Wednesday, called the strike on the mall a ""terrorist"" act. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko traveled to Madrid to urge the alliance to provide his country with ""whatever it takes"" to stop the war. ""Wake up, guys. This is happening now. You are going to be next, this is going to be knocking on your door just in the blink of an eye,"" Klitschko told reporters at the summit venue. Stoltenberg said the meeting would chart a blueprint for the alliance ""in a more dangerous and unpredictable world"" — and that meant ""we have to invest more in our defense,"" Stoltenberg said. Just nine of NATO's 30 members meet the organization's target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense. Spain, which is hosting the summit, spends just half that. Stoltenberg said Monday that NATO allies will agree at the summit to increase the strength of the alliance's rapid reaction force nearly eightfold, from 40,000 to 300,000 troops. The troops will be based in their home nations, but dedicated to specific countries on NATO's eastern flank, where the alliance plans to build up stocks of equipment and ammunition. Beneath the surface, there are tensions within NATO over how the war will end and what, if any, concessions Ukraine should make to end the fighting. There are also differences on how hard a line to take on China in NATO's new Strategic Concept — its once-a-decade set of priorities and goals. The last document, published in 2010, didn't mention China at all. The new concept is expected to set out NATO's approach on issues from cybersecurity to climate change — and the growing economic and military reach of China, and the rising importance and power of the Indo-Pacific region. For the first time, the leaders of Japan, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand are attending the summit as guests. Some European members are wary of the tough U.S. line on Beijing and don't want China cast as an opponent. In the Strategic Concept, NATO is set to declare Russia its number one threat. Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos marked the summit's opening by releasing satellite images and coordinates of the Madrid conference hall where it is being held, along with those of the White House, the Pentagon and the government headquarters in London, Paris and Berlin. The agency said NATO was set to declare Russia an enemy at the summit, adding that it was publishing precise coordinates ""just in case.""",29,6.414874374956556,6.399451735128801,0.01542263982775438,13

Officials said at least 36 people were still missing. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy labelled the Monday strike on the mall in the central city of Kremenchuk a ""terrorist attack,"" and the country's prosecutor general said it was a ""crime against humanity."" While Russia has claimed the mall was closed at the time of the strike, Zelenksyy said around 1,000 people were inside it when the missile hit. The president said it was a targeted strike by Russia against innocent civilians. CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio was at the scene on Tuesday morning. He said the Amstor shopping mall had been reduced to a charred carcass of its former self. As thick smoke swirled from the building on Monday afternoon, police shouted for people to find shelter while firefighters raced to put out the inferno and bystanders helped load victims into ambulances. Soon, people started gathering to pore over lists posted on walls, looking for the names of missing loved ones. At the local hospital, a wounded Mykola Mykhailets, said he'd seen ""lots of wounded people, burned people, some covered in blood."" His wife Ludmyla was also wounded in the strike. Laying in a hospital bed next to her husband, she said the blast threw her into the air. ""It's really scary,"" she said. ""I'd tell women who left the country with their kids, don't come back."" President Joe Biden and the other G7 leaders were meeting in the German Alps when the missile struck. They called the attack ""abominable"" and promised nearly $30 billion in new aid for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has issued repeated, urgent requests for more modern weaponry to help Ukraine's forces defend the country from Russia's invasion, which has made gains in the eastern Donbas recently. Ukraine has asked for, among other things, advanced missile defense systems, to help shoot down incoming missiles like the one that hit the mall in Kremenchuk. The front line in the war, in the Donbas, is just over 100 miles to the east of the smoldering ruins of the shopping center, and Ukrainians know it's a matter of when, not if, Russian rockets will strike again.",17,2.9126766278716745,1.3247261045545258,1.5879505233171487,23

Zelenskky said that many of the more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and staff inside the mall managed to escape. Giant plumes of black smoke, dust and orange flames emanated from the wreckage, with emergency crews rushing in to search broken metal and concrete for victims and put out fires. Onlookers watched in distress at the sight of how an everyday activity such as shopping could turn into a horror. The casualty figures were changing as rescuers searched the smoldering rubble into early Tuesday. Ukraine's emergency services reported late Monday that at least 16 people were dead and about 60 wounded. Soldiers worked into the night to lug sheets of twisted metal and broken concrete, as one drilled into what remained of the shopping center's roof. Drones whirred above, clouds of dark smoke still emanating from the ruins several hours after the fire had been put out. ""We are working to dismantle the construction so that it is possible to get machinery in there since the metal elements are very heavy and big, and disassembling them by hand is impossible,"" said Volodymyr Hychkan, an emergency services official. At Ukraine's request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack. In the first Russian government comment on the missile strike, the country's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyansky, alleged multiple inconsistencies that he didn't specify, claiming on Twitter that the incident was a provocation by Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilian infrastructure, even though Russian attacks have hit other shopping malls, theaters, hospitals, kindergartens and apartment buildings. The strike unfolded as the leaders of the world's major economies get ready to pursue new sanctions on Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods. Meanwhile, the U.S. prepared to announce the purchase of an advanced surface-to-air missile system for Kyiv, and NATO planned to increase the size of its rapid-reaction forces nearly eightfold to 300,000 troops. Zelenskyy said the target presented ""no threat to the Russian army"" and had ""no strategic value."" He accused Russia of sabotaging ""people's attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry."" The Ukrainian military said the shopping center was hit by missiles fired by Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers from the skies over Russia's western Kursk region. The secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said that one missile hit the shopping center and another struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk. The Russian strike carried echoes of attacks earlier in the war that caused large numbers of civilian casualties — such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that left at least 59 people dead. ""Russia continues to take out its impotence on ordinary civilians. It is useless to hope for decency and humanity on its part,"" Zelenskyy said. Mayor Vitaliy Maletskiy wrote on Facebook that the attack ""hit a very crowded area, which is 100% certain not to have any links to the armed forces."" The attack happened as Russia was mounting an all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk province, ""pouring fire"" on the city of Lysychansk from the ground and air, according to the local governor. Russian forces appeared to step up an offensive centering on trying to wrest the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine after forcing government troops out of the neighboring city of Sievierodonetsk in recent days. Western leaders, meanwhile, pledged steadfast and continued support for Kyiv. NATO will agree to deliver further military support to Ukraine — including secure communication and anti-drone systems — when its leaders convene in Spain for a summit, according to the military alliance's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg. To the west of Lysychansk on Monday, the mayor of the city of Sloviansk — potentially the next major battleground — said Russian forces fired cluster munitions on the city after dawn, including one that hit a residential neighborhood. Authorities said the number of dead and wounded had yet to be confirmed. The Associated Press saw one fatality: A man's body lay hunched over a car door frame, his blood pooling onto the ground from chest and head wounds. The blast blew out most windows in the surrounding apartment blocks and the cars parked below, littering the ground with broken glass. ""Everything is now destroyed. We are the only people left living in this part of the building. There is no power,"" said local resident Valentina Vitkovska, in tears as she spoke about the blast. ""I can't even call to tell others what had happened to us."" Overall, Zelenskyy's office said at least six civilians were killed and 31 others wounded as part of intense Russian shelling against various Ukrainian cities over the past 24 hours — including Kyiv and major cities in the country's south and east, but not counting the attack in Kremenchuk and the shelling of the eastern city of Kharkiv where at least three people were killed and another 15 were wounded. It said Russian forces fired rockets that killed two people and wounded five overnight in and near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and continued to target the key southern port of Odesa. A missile attack destroyed residential buildings and wounded six people, including a child, it said. In Lysychansk, at least five high-rise buildings in the city and the last road bridge were damaged over the past day, the regional governor said. A crucial highway linking the city to government-held territory to the south was rendered impassable by shelling. The city had a prewar population of around 100,000, approximately one-tenth of whom remain. Analysts say that Lysychansk's location high on the banks of the Siverskiy Donets River gives a major advantage to the city's Ukrainian defenders. ""It's a very hard nut to crack. The Russians could spend many months and much effort storming Lysychansk,"" said military analyst Oleh Zhdanov. In other developments, in Germany's Bavarian Alps, leaders of the Group of Seven countries unveiled plans to seek new sanctions and pledged to continue supporting Ukraine ""for as long as it takes."" In a joint statement on Monday after they held a session by video link with Zelenskyy, the leaders underlined their ""unwavering commitment to support the government and people of Ukraine in their courageous defense of their country's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" The U.S. appeared ready to respond to Zelenskyy's call for more air defense systems after Russian troops hit Kyiv with long-range missiles on Sunday. Washington was expected to announce the purchase of an advanced surface-to-air missile system for Ukraine. In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced the plans to greatly expand the alliance's rapid-reaction forces as part of its response to an ""era of strategic competition."" The NATO response force currently has about 40,000 soldiers. Britian's defense ministry said Russia is likely to rely increasingly on reserve forces in the coming weeks of the war. Analysts have said a call-up of reservists by Russia could vastly alter the balance in the war but could also come with political consequences for President Vladimir Putin's government. Meanwhile, senior Biden administration officials have confirmed to CBS News that the White House is planning to announce this week the purchase of an advanced medium- to long-range surface-to-air missile defense system for Ukraine. CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe said Washington was expected to promise more artillery shells and radar systems, too, as it tries to meet the urgent requests coming from Ukraine's leaders. Mr. Biden and his fellow G-7 leaders, meeting Monday in Germany, were likely to hear a fresh appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy, who was to address them virtually from Kyiv. He told his own country on Sunday night, in a daily video address, that Ukraine needed military, financial and humanitarian assistance immediately to fight back against Russia's invasion. As CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio reports from the Ukrainian capital, Russia shattered weeks of relative calm in Kyiv by firing a volley of long-range missiles at the city early Sunday morning. It was an apparent show-of-force by the Kremlin as the Western leaders gathered in Germany to strengthen their military and economic support for Ukraine.",17,3.2834902902242264,2.5724739026518755,0.711016387572351,23
2022-06-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-kyiv-hit-with-missile-strikes-amid-g7-meeting/,Missile strikes rattle Kyiv as world leaders meet,"Russia shattered weeks of relative calm in the Ukrainian capital with long-range missiles fired toward Kyiv early Sunday, an apparent Kremlin show-of-force as Western leaders meet in Europe to strengthen their military and economic support of Ukraine. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the missiles hit at least two residential buildings, and President Volodymr Zelenskyy said a 37-year-old man was killed and his 7-year-old daughter and wife injured. Associated Press journalists saw emergency workers battling flames and rescuing civilians. The strikes also damaged a nearby kindergarten, where a crater pocked the courtyard. U.S. President Joe Biden called the attacks ""barbarism"" after he arrived in Germany for a Group of Seven summit. Later Sunday, a local official reported a second death, telling the Unian news agency that a railroad worker was killed and several others were injured in the attacks while servicing rail infrastructure. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said the first air-launched weapons successfully to target the capital since June 5 were Kh-101 cruise missiles fired from warplanes over the Caspian Sea, more than 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) away. Kyiv's mayor told journalists he thought the airstrikes were ""maybe a symbolic attack"" ahead of a NATO summit in Madrid that starts Tuesday. A former commander of U.S. forces in Europe said the strikes also were a signal to the leaders of G-7 nations meeting Sunday in Germany. ""Russia is saying, 'We can do this all day long. You guys are powerless to stop us,'"" retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commanding general of U.S. Army forces in Europe, said. ""The Russians are humiliating the leaders of the West."" The G-7 leaders were set to announce the latest in a long series of international economic steps to pressure and isolate Russia over its war in Ukraine: new bans on imports of Russian gold. Standing with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the three-day meeting's host, Biden said of the missile strikes on Kyiv: ""It's more of their barbarism."" Zelenskyy, speaking in his nightly video address, appealed to the G-7 leaders for more help, saying stopping Russian aggression ""is possible only if we get everything we ask for, and in the time we need it - weapons, financial support and sanctions against Russia."" A Ukrainian parliament member, Oleksiy Goncharenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging app that preliminary information indicated that Russia launched 14 missiles toward the capital region and Kyiv itself. Zelenskyy said some were intercepted, and he vowed revenge against ""all pilots, dispatchers, technicians and other people who ensure the launch of missiles in Ukraine."" ""We will find you all. Each of you will be responsible for these blows,"" Zelenskyy vowed. ""And if someone thinks he will evade responsibility by saying that this was an order, you are wrong. When your missiles hit homes, it's a war crime. The court is what awaits you all. And you will not hide anywhere - neither on the shores of the Caspian Sea, over which your missiles are launched, nor in Belarus ... Nowhere."" In a phone interview, retired U.S. general Hodges told The Associated Press that Russia has a limited stock of precision missiles and ""if they are using them, it's going to be for a special purpose,"" Russia has denied targeting civilians during the 4-month-old war, and Hodges said it was hard to know if the missiles launched Sunday were intended to strike the apartments buildings. Russian forces tried to seize control of Kyiv early in the war. After Ukrainian troops repelled them, the Kremlin largely shifted its focus to southern and eastern Ukraine. Russian rocket strikes in the city of Cherkasy, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Kyiv, killed one person and injured five, regional governor Ihor Taburets said Sunday. In the east, Russian troops fought to consolidate their gains by battling to swallow up the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Luhansk province. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Sunday that Russia was conducting intense airstrikes on the city of Lysychansk, destroying its television tower and seriously damaging a road bridge. ""There's very much destruction. Lysychansk is almost unrecognizable,"" he wrote on Facebook. For weeks, Lysychansk and the nearby city of Sievierodonetsk have been subject to a bloody and destructive offensive by Russian forces and their separatist allies aimed at capturing all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. They have made steady and slow progress, with Haidai confirming Saturday that Sievierodonetsk, including a chemical plant where hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians were holed up, had fallen. Commenting on the battle for Sievierodonetsk, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said late Saturday that Russian and Moscow-backed separatist forces now control not only the city but the villages surrounding it. He said the Russian military had thwarted Ukrainian forces' attempt to turn the Azot chemical plant into a ""stubborn center of resistance."" Capturing Lysychansk would give Russian and separatist forces control of every major settlement in Luhansk. At last report, they controlled about half of Donetsk, the second province in the Donbas. On Saturday, Russia launched dozens of missiles on several areas across the country far from the heart of the eastern battles. Some of the missiles were fired from Russian long-range Tu-22 bombers deployed from Belarus for the first time, Ukraine's air command said. Reacting to the shelling from the Russian bombers, Zelenskyy appealed to the people of Belarus to resist cooperation with the Russian military. ""The Russian leadership wants to draw you - all Belarusians - into the war, wants to sow hatred between us,"" he said in his video address Sunday. ""You can refuse to participate in this war. Your lives belong only to you, not to someone in the Kremlin."" Belarus hosts Russian military units and was used as a staging ground before Russia invaded Ukraine, but its own troops have not crossed the border. In a meeting Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that Russia planned to supply Belarus with the Iskander-M missile system. On the economic front, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said banning imports of Russian gold would represent a significant escalation of sanctions. ""That is the second-most lucrative export that Russia has after energy."" Blinken told American news channel CNN. ""It's about $19 billion a year. And most of that is within the G-7 countries. So cutting that off, denying access to about $19 billion of revenues a year, that's significant."" Russia is poised to default on its foreign debt for the first time since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, further alienating the country from the global financial system following international sanctions imposed over its war in Ukraine. The country faces a Sunday night deadline to meet a 30-day grace period on interest payments originally due May 27. But it could take time to confirm a default. Russia calls any default artificial because it has the money to pay its debts but says sanctions have frozen its foreign currency reserves held abroad.",17,0.8617605454350513,2.6833694168949545,-1.8216088714599032,17
2022-06-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-nato-high-readiness-forces-increase/,NATO announces massive increase in high-readiness forces as Russian military pushes further into eastern Ukraine,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced Monday, ahead of of a gathering of NATO leaders in Madrid on Tuesday, that the alliance's high-readiness forces will significantly increase to over 300,000 from 40,000, and that more troops will be sent to the member countries bordering Russia. The nearly eightfold increase comes amid Moscow's continuing invasion of Ukraine, where Russian forces have pushed deeper into the eastern Donbas region and are poised to make additional gains. Over the weekend, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Western leaders who had gathered for the G7 summit in Munich, Germany, renewing requests for heavier weaponry to confront Russia's forces, including anti-aircraft defense systems. In a virtual address, Zelenskyy said he wanted to end the war by the end of 2022. Briefing reporters after the address, national security advisor Jake Sullivan said Zelenskyy told the summit the Ukrainian leader believed a ""grinding conflict is not in the interest of the Ukrainian people."" Of the NATO's priorities — set to be outlined in the Strategic Concept, a document seeing its first update since 2010 — Stoltenberg said Russia will no longer be characterized as a strategic partner, but as ""the most significant and direct threat to our security."" For the first time, China will be addressed as a challenger to the alliance's security interests. The document will ""also cover our evolving approach to...terrorism, cyber and hybrid"" threats, Stoltenberg said. He outlined forthcoming changes to the alliance's capabilities, including more pre-positioned equipment and supplies. ""Together, this constitutes the biggest overhaul of our collective deterrence and defense since the Cold War,"" the NATO chief said, adding that NATO investments are set to increase across its membership for the eighth consecutive year. Allies will agree on an additional comprehensive assistance package for Ukraine and put in place a plan to transition its forces from Soviet-era equipment to ""modern NATO equipment,"" he said. Zelenskyy, along with representatives from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Georgia and the EU will participate in the summit. And senior officials from Finland, Sweden are meeting with Turkey in Brussels for continued talks Monday about accession to NATO; the leaders of all three will meet in Madrid Tuesday, although no breakthrough is expected before the summit.",29,3.4523915146900386,4.176083615488776,-0.7236921007987371,13
2022-06-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/tampa/news/ukraine-to-withdraw-from-severodonetsk-as-russias-advance-grinds-on/,Ukraine To Withdraw From Severodonetsk As Russia's Advance Grinds On,"(CW44 News At 10 | CNN) -- Ukrainian forces are withdrawing from Severodonetsk, effectively ceding the city to Russia and putting the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk almost fully under Russian control following months of grueling and bloody fighting. Severodonetsk was one of the last major Ukrainian strongholds in the area. Serhiy Hayday, a top military commander in east Ukraine, said the military made the decision to evacuate ""because the number of dead in unfortified territories may grow every day."" ""It makes no sense to stay,"" Hayday said. It's unclear if Ukrainian forces are currently leaving the city, or if they have already evacuated. Though the capture is a symbolic breakthrough for Russia, it comes after a lengthy and costly battle in which Moscow's forces were met with a stubborn Ukrainian resistance. Russian forces have diverted much of their firepower toward overrunning the city, simply destroying every defensive position the Ukrainians have adopted. The strategy played out slowly, with the Russians making labored and sluggish gains around Severodonetsk throughout the spring and early summer. Ukrainian forces were, little by little, pushed into a few square blocks around the Azot chemical plant, where some 500 civilians, including dozens of children, have taken shelter -- a scene reminiscent of the siege of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. With the military evacuating the city, however, the fate of those inside the Azot plant is unclear. Hayday, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration, has repeatedly accused Moscow of scorched-earth tactics, flattening cities with little regard for casualties as it attempts to take them. ""All the infrastructure of the city is completely destroyed,"" he said of Severodonetsk on Friday. The battle now moves across the Siverskyi Donets river to Lysychansk, the last city in Luhansk held by Ukrainian forces. And there are already signs that the Russians will use the same merciless tactic of aerial bombardment to grind down Ukrainian forces, deploying combat planes, multiple launch rocket systems and even short-range ballistic missiles. Ukraine's control over Lysychansk has become more tenuous in recent days. Russian forces have advanced into several villages south of the city, though not without sustaining losses from Ukrainian artillery fire. The Ukrainian military claims that some Russian battalion tactical groups are being consolidated or withdrawn to restore their combat capabilities. The Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank that follows the campaign closely, said the Russian breakthrough from the south means they ""may be able to threaten Lysychansk in the coming days while avoiding a difficult opposed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets River."" Luhansk and neighboring Donetsk together make up Ukraine's Donbas region, an industrial heartland dotted with factories and coal fields that has been home to sporadic fighting since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists seized control of two territories -- the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The Kremlin has been quietly supporting troops there since 2014, and even began granting passports to residents in 2018, with more than half a million distributed by mid-2021, according to Russian state media. Shortly before invading Ukraine in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the two separatist territories as independent states, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in defiance of international law. The capture of Severodonetsk gives Putin an important propaganda victory in a war which, so far, has been mostly marked by Moscow's military setbacks. A key goal of Russia's so-called ""special military operation"" -- the Kremlin's official euphemism for the invasion of Ukraine -- was to take control of Donbas. Experts expected a quick fight in the region, unlike the battles around Kyiv in the initial days of the war that Russia lost. The fighting near the Ukrainian capital was mostly urban warfare, which allowed Ukraine's military to stymie Russia's advantages in manpower and hardware by keeping the battles in tighter corridors, where Ukraine's highly motivated fighting force could capitalize on its better knowledge of the local environment. Donbas, however, is a region of plains and open spaces. The battles there have involved long-range weaponry, a type of warfare that favors Russia and its superior power and larger armed forces. After little success in the first month of the conflict, Russian forces retreated from around Kyiv, regrouped and concentrated on eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin's new offensive to take the Donbas region was launched April 18, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia's progress was, initially, ""slow and uneven,"" according to US officials, as its army appeared to still be learning from its mistakes in the initial days of the invasion. The tide began turning in mid-May, when Mariupol, a strategically important port city, finally completely fell to Russian forces following an intense, three-month long bombing campaign that Ukrainian officials say left as many as 22,000 people dead. The fight there was markedly similar to the battle for Severdonetsk, both in terms of Russia's tactical decisions and with Ukrainian fighters and civilians holing up in structures that, before the war, were used for heavy industry. Russian then increased the intensity of their bombardment in other parts of the Donbas region, a strategy Zelensky likened to genocide. Some experts have questioned whether Russia's efforts to take Severodonetsk were strategically worth it. ""The loss of Severodonetsk is a loss for Ukraine in the sense that any terrain captured by Russian forces is a loss -- but the battle of Severodonetsk will not be a decisive Russian victory,"" said the Institute for War. ""Ukrainian troops have succeeded for weeks in drawing substantial quantities of Russian personnel, weapons, and equipment into the area and have likely degraded Russian forces' overall capabilities while preventing Russian forces from focusing on more advantageous axes of advance."" If Russian forces capture Lysychansk, and with it the Luhansk region, they will likely concentrate more troops on Donetsk, where progress has come much more slowly. Ukraine's regional military administration says about 45% of Donetsk is held by Ukrainian forces, including the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. It's unclear whether the losses inflicted on Russian forces in recent weeks will impair their ability and desire to gobble up more territory, but the Kremlin has not veered from its ultimate objective of taking those two cities. Equally, it remains to be seen whether the punishment endured by Ukrainian units has left them with enough resources to launch counterattacks against the Russians. Ukrainian officials have made repeated calls for more military assistance from its allies. Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said on June 14 that the country had received just 10% of military assistance it had requested. ""No matter how professional our army is, without the assistance of our Western partners Ukraine will not be able to win this war,"" said Maliar. Ukrainian commanders will now have to decide whether it is strategically worthwhile to keep defending Lysychansk, as Kyiv could abandon the city and divert resources for a more consolidated defense of Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka, the industrial belt of Donetsk. The Kremlin has not veered from its ultimate objective of taking all of Donetsk and Luhansk. It now has almost all of the latter. But completing the so-called ""special military operation"" will likely take many more months, setting up a war of attrition. The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

2022-06-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-war-eastern-ukraine-gains-lysychansk/,"Russia launches missiles across Ukraine, cements gains in east","Russian forces were seeking to swallow up the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in the eastern Luhansk region, pressing their momentum after taking full control Saturday of the charred ruins of Sievierodonetsk and the chemical plant where hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians had been holed up. Russia also launched dozens of missiles on several areas across the country far from the heart of the eastern battles. Some of the missiles were fired from Russian long-range Tu-22 bombers deployed from Belarus for the first time, Ukraine's air command said. The bombardment preceded a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, during which Putin announced that Russia planned to supply Belarus with the Iskander-M missile system. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said late Saturday that Russian and Moscow-backed separatist forces now control Sievierodonetsk and the villages surrounding it. He said the attempt by Ukrainian forces to turn the Azot plant into a ""stubborn center of resistance"" had been thwarted. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk province, said Friday that Ukrainian troops were retreating from Sievierodonetsk after weeks of bombardment and house-to-house fighting. He confirmed Saturday that the city had fallen to Russian and separatist fighters, who he said were now trying to blockade Lysychansk from the south. The city lies across the river just to the west of Sievierodonetsk. Capturing Lysychansk would give Russian forces control of every major settlement in the province, a significant step toward Russia's aim of capturing the entire Donbas. The Russians and separatists control about half of Donetsk, the second province in the Donbas. Russia's Interfax news agency quoted a spokesman for the separatist forces, Andrei Marochko, as saying Russian troops and separatist fighters had entered Lysychansk and that fighting was taking place in the heart of the city. There was no immediate comment on the claim from the Ukrainian side. Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk have been the focal point of a Russian offensive aimed at capturing all of the Donbas and destroying the Ukrainian military defending it — the most capable and battle-hardened segment of the country's armed forces. Russian bombardment has reduced most of Sievierodonetsk to rubble and cut its population from 100,000 to 10,000. The last remaining Ukrainian troops were holed up in underground shelters in the huge Azot chemical plant, along with hundreds of civilians. A separatist representative, Ivan Filiponenko, said earlier Saturday that its forces evacuated 800 civilians from the plant during the night, Interfax reported. Ukrainian military analyst Oleg Zhdanov said some of the troops were heading for Lysychansk. But Russian moves to cut off Lysychansk will give those retreating troops little respite. Some 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) to the west, four Russian cruise missiles fired from the Black Sea hit a ""military object"" in Yaroviv, Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said. He did not give further details of the target, but Yaroviv has a sizable military base used for training fighters, including foreigners who have volunteered to fight for Ukraine. Russian missiles struck the Yaroviv base in March, killing 35 people. The Lviv region, although far from the front lines, has come under fire at various points in the the war as Russia's military worked to destroy fuel storage sites. About 30 Russian missiles were fired on the Zhytomyr region in central Ukraine on Saturday morning, killing one Ukrainian soldier, regional governor Vitaliy Buchenko said. He said all of the strikes were aimed at military targets. In the northwest, two missiles hit a service station and auto repair center in Sarny, killing three people and wounding four, the Rivne regional governor, Vitaliy Koval, said. He posted a picture of the destruction. Sarny is located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the border with Belarus. In southern Ukraine along the Black Sea coast, nine missiles fired from Crimea hit the port city of Mykolaiv, the Ukrainian military said. In the north, about 20 missiles were fired from Belarus into the Chernihiv region, the Ukrainian military said. Ukraine's military intelligence agency said the Russian bombers' use of Belarusian airspace for the first time for Saturday's attack was ""directly connected to attempts by the Kremlin to drag Belarus into the war."" Belarus hosts Russian military units and was used as a staging ground before Russia invaded Ukraine, but its own troops have not crossed the border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address that as a war that Moscow expected to last five days moved into its fifth month, Russia ""felt compelled to stage such a missile show."" He said the war was at a difficult stage, ""when we know that the enemy will not succeed, when we understand that we can defend our country, but we don't know how long it will take, how many more attacks, losses and efforts there will be before we can see that victory is already on our horizon."" During his meeting in St. Petersburg with Lukashenko, Putin told him the Iskander-M missile systems would be arriving in the coming months. He noted that they can fire either ballistic or cruise missiles and carry nuclear as well as conventional warheads. Russia has launched several Iskander missiles into Ukraine during the war. Following a botched attempt to capture Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, in the early stage of the invasion that started Feb. 24, Russian forces have shifted their focus to the Donbas, where the Ukrainian forces have fought Moscow-backed separatists since 2014. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking in Washington on condition of anonymity, on Friday called the Ukrainians' withdrawal from Sievierodonetsk a ""tactical retrograde"" to consolidate forces into positions where they can better defend themselves. The move will reinforce Ukraine's efforts to keep Russian forces pinned down in a small area, the official said. After repeated Ukrainian requests to its Western allies for heavier weaponry to counter Russia's edge in firepower, four medium-range American rocket launchers arrived this week, with four more on the way. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry released a video Saturday showing the first use of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, in Ukraine. The video gave no location or indication of the targets. The rockets can travel about 45 miles (70 kilometers). The senior U.S. defense official said Friday that more Ukrainian forces are training outside Ukraine to use the HIMARS and are expected back in their country with the weapons by mid-July. Also to be sent are 18 U.S. coastal and river patrol boats. The official said there is no evidence Russia has intercepted any of the steady flow of weapons into Ukraine from the U.S. and other nations.

The planned withdrawal from Sievierodonetsk, the administrative center of the Luhansk region, comes after relentless Russian bombardment that has reduced most of the industrial city to rubble and cut its population from 100,0000 to 10,000. Ukrainian troops fought the Russians in house-to-house battles before retreating to the huge Azot chemical factory on the city's edge, where they remain holed up in its sprawling underground structures in which about 500 civilians also found refuge. In recent days, Russian forces have made gains around Sievierodonetsk and the neighboring city of Lysychansk, on a steep bank across a river, in a bid to encircle Ukrainian forces. Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk have been the focal point of the Russian offensive aimed at capturing all of the Donbas and destroying the Ukrainian military defending it — the most capable and battle-hardened segment of the country's armed forces. The two cities and surrounding areas are the last major pockets of Ukrainian resistance in the Luhansk region — 95% of which is under Russian and local separatist forces' control. The Russians and separatists also control about half of the Donetsk region, the second province in the Donbas. Russia used its numerical advantages in troops and weapons to pummel Sievierodonetsk in what has become a war of attrition, while Ukraine clamored for better and more weapons from its Western allies. Bridges to the city were destroyed, slowing the Ukrainian military's ability to resupply, reinforce and evacuate the wounded and others. Much of the city's electricity, water and communications infrastructure has been destroyed. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian troops have been ordered to leave Sievierodonetsk to prevent bigger losses and move to better fortified positions. The head of the regional administration, Roman Vlasenko, said the withdrawal has already begun and will take several days. ""As of now, the Ukrainian military still remains in Sievierodonetsk,"" Vlasenko told CNN. ""They are being withdrawn from the city at the moment. It started yesterday."" Ukraine's military spokesman declined to confirm the retreat order, saying government policy prevents comments on Ukrainian troop movements. ""Regrettably, we will have to pull our troops out of Sievierodonetsk,"" Haidai told The Associated Press. ""It makes no sense to stay at the destroyed positions, and the number of killed in action has been growing."" A senior U.S. defense official, speaking in Washington on condition of anonymity, on Friday called the Ukrainians' move a ""tactical retrograde"" to consolidate forces into positions where they can better defend themselves. This will add to Ukraine's effort to keep Russian forces pinned down longer in a small area, the official said. Haidai noted that while the retreat is under way, some Ukrainian troops remain in Sievierodonetsk, facing Russian bombardment that has destroyed 80% of buildings. ""As of today, the resistance in Sievierodonetsk is continuing,"" Haidai told the AP. ""The Russians are relentlessly shelling the Ukrainian positions, burning everything out."" Haidai said the Russians are also advancing toward Lysychansk — from Zolote and Toshkivka — adding that Russian reconnaissance units conducted forays on the city's edges but its defenders drove them out. The governor added that a bridge leading to Lysychansk was badly damaged in a Russian airstrike and is unusable for trucks. Ukrainian military analyst Oleg Zhdanov told the AP that some of the troops moving away from Sievierodonetsk are heading to the fight in Lysychansk. In other battlefield reports, the Russian Defense Ministry declared Friday that four Ukrainian battalions and a unit of ""foreign mercenaries"" totaling about 2,000 soldiers have been ""fully blocked"" near Hirske and Zolote, south of Lysychansk. The claim couldn't be independently verified.

2022-06-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-aid-package-long-range-rocket-systems-this-week/,$450 million aid package for Ukraine includes four more long-range rocket systems,"The White House announced Thursday a $450 million assistance package for Ukraine that includes four more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) as the fight with Russia in the Donbas grinds on. The four HIMARS the U.S. announced in a previous aid package arrived in Ukraine this week. In the battle in eastern Ukraine, the Russians have a numerical advantage when it comes to firepower. To help Ukraine, the U.S. first sent Howitzers and have since started sending the longer-range and more accurate HIMARS. In addition to HIMARS, the package announced Thursday includes 36,000 rounds of ammunition, tactical vehicles, 2,000 machine guns and over 1,000 grenade launchers. The U.S. has now committed about $6.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia's invasion. In announcing the first shipment that included HIMARS, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Dr. Colin Kahl said, ""The HIMARS, and the guided munitions that go along with them will allow Ukraine to range any target they need for that fight inside Ukrainian territory."" Ukrainian leaders assured the U.S. that the systems would not be used to strike into Russia. The munitions sent by the U.S. with the first shipment of HIMARS have a range of up to 70 kilometers, more than twice the range of M777 Howitzers, but less than the long-range Advanced Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) that can reach hundreds of kilometers. ""We don't assess that they need systems that range out hundreds and hundreds of kilometers for the current fight, and so that's how we settled on it,"" Kahl said earlier this month. Since Ukrainian forces don't use HIMARS, the U.S. organized training that takes about three weeks for Ukrainians outside of Ukraine. The U.S. prepositioned the four HIMARS in Europe so training could start quickly, and the first 60 Ukrainians graduated from training last week. The HIMARS are a priority for Ukraine, which is losing 100 soldiers a day. The HIMARS provide more precision-guided targeting with extended range so the Ukrainians can hit high-valued Russian targets from farther away. Russia is also taking significant losses despite its numerical superiority. The Russian Defense Ministry hasn't given estimated casualties for months, but Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said last week that Russia has lost between 20-30% of its armored forces and has ""suffered a tremendous amount of casualties."" The fight in the east has been described as a street-by-street battle that could take months, if not years. The U.S. has provided more than $5.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded Ukraine. Congress recently approved a $40 billion security package for Ukraine that will allow for more aid shipments through the summer.",14,1.537561115967657,7.916492188690697,-6.37893107272304,12

Captured from Nazi Germany by the Soviet Red Army in 1945 and later ceded to the Soviet Union, the Russian territory is home to about 500,000 people. While it is surrounded on two sides by NATO nations, it's a strategically vital patch of ground for Moscow as it provides Russia's only Baltic Sea coastline. It is home to the Russian military's Baltic Fleet, and a number of advanced nuclear-capable Iskander missile installations. But the isolated patch of ground relies on its rail connection to the rest of Russia for the majority of its civilian imports. That rail line runs through Lithuania and then neighboring Belarus, which is a Russian ally. On June 18, European Union member Lithuania prohibited the transit of all goods subject to EU sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine via the rail link. That includes coal, metals, electronics, and construction materials. Nikolai Patrushev, the Secretary-General of Russia's Security Council and one of the most powerful figures in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, called Lithuania's actions ""hostile"" and ""in violation of the international law"" during a visit to Kaliningrad on Tuesday. ""Russia will certainly respond to such hostile actions,"" Patrushev was quoted as saying by Russian state media. ""The consequences will have a serious negative impact on the population of Lithuania."" In response, Lithuania said it was simply complying with EU decisions and stressed that the transit of passengers and non-sanctioned goods ""continues uninterrupted."" Anton Alikhanov, the Governor of Kaliningrad, said the ban was affecting about half of all imports to the territory. ""We consider this to be a most serious violation... of the right to free transit into and out of the Kaliningrad region,"" he said in a video address posted on the Telegram messaging app the day after Lithuania's announcement. Videos posted on social media last weekend by residents in Kalingrad appeared to show panic buying at stores. Lithuanian authorities have mocked the complaints from Russian officials, saying no ""blockade"" is being imposed on Russia's European exclave. ""It's ironic to hear rhetoric about alleged violations of international treaties from a country which has violated possibly every single international treaty,"" Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte told reporters, according to the Reuters news agency. Western officials have been quick to point to Russia's blockade of all ports along Ukraine's southern Black Sea coast, which has interrupted global food supplies. The United Nations has warned that blockade could lead to a prolonged global food crisis. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell cautioned Moscow against any escalation over Lithuania's enforcement of the bloc's sanctions. ""We are in a precautionary mood,"" Borrell said Monday. ""But Lithuania is not guilty. It is not implementing national [unilateral] sanctions. It is not implementing their will. Whatever they are doing has been the consequence of the previous consultation with the [European] Commission."" With its Baltic Sea port that remains ice-free year-round, Kaliningrad had provided Russia a viable way to try and bypass the myriad international sanctions imposed against it over the Ukraine war. But the restrictions on goods moving through Lithuania will greatly limit that prospect. Both the Kremlin and Russia's Foreign Ministry echoed Patrushev's threats of ""practical"" retaliation against Lithuania, but Moscow hasn't yet indicated what that will entail. Russian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky told state news agency RIA Novosti on Wednesday that Moscow could, as a potential option, disconnect Lithuania from the regional power grid. On Wednesday, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told Reuters that his country was ready for Russia to retaliate by severing its connection to the BRELL power grid, but he added that he did not expect a military confrontation over the transit ban. Three decades after they severed ties with the Soviet Union, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia still depend on Russia for much of their power supply. Last year, however, Lithuania established a way to connect to the continental European grid via Poland, lowering its dependence on Moscow.",29,5.408631872793183,4.190682073772835,1.2179497990203485,15
2022-06-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-death-stephen-zabielski-russia-geneva-convention-alexander-drueke-andy-huynh/,Death of 2nd American fighting in Ukraine confirmed as Russia steps up assault in the east,"Kharkiv, Ukraine — The U.S. State Department confirmed on Tuesday the death of a second American who went to join Ukraine's battle against Russia's invasion. An obituary for Stephen Zabielski, 52, published earlier this month in The Recorder, a local newspaper in Amsterdam, New York, said he was killed in fighting on May 15 in a village in the country's south. The paper did not report any further detail of the battle that claimed Zabielski's life. A spokesperson for the State Department confirmed his death in Ukraine and said staff had been in contact with the family to provide consular assistance, but offered no further information beyond a repeated warning against Americans traveling to the war-torn country for any reason. At least three other Americans have been killed in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on February 24. U.S. Marine veteran Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, was killed fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in late April. James Hill was killed by Russian shelling in the city of Chernihiv, and filmmaker Brent Renaud was killed when Russian troops opened fire on him and colleagues in the town of Irpin, just outside Kyiv. Both of the American civilians were killed in March. And as CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reports from the key eastern city of Kharkiv, that war is not only still raging, but intensifying across Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Livesay said there has been a significant increase in Russian rocket and missile attacks over the last day or so across the country's south and east. Ukrainian officials say it's hardly random, noting that the European Union is expected to decide this week whether Ukraine can join the bloc. Moscow has made it clear that the EU welcoming Ukraine would be viewed as a provocation, and it has accused European powers of ""manipulating"" Kyiv by even offering membership. But President Volodomyr Zeleknskyy says his country's fierce resistance to Russia's invasion has left no one in doubt ""that Ukraine deserves candidacy."" ""We are proving daily that we are already a part of the European Union,"" he said. Vladimir Putin's press secretary has said, meanwhile, that Russia will not rule out the death penalty for two U.S. citizens captured on the battlefield. In an interview aired on Monday night, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, who both flew from Alabama to join the fight in Ukraine, would not be protected by the Geneva Convention, an international treaty that aims to protects prisoners of war from inhuman treatment. ""They're soldiers of fortune,"" Peskov told NBC. ""They were involved in illegal activity in the territory of Ukraine. They were involved in firing [on] and shelling our military personnel."" The men went missing as they fought alongside Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv area, which is one of hottest front lines in the war right now.",13,5.918254239282088,2.148854248672979,3.7693999906091085,2
2022-06-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-americans-captured-andy-huynh-alexander-drueke-video-shows-alive/,"American fighter in Ukraine glad to see friends alive, even in captivity, warns against underestimating Russia's military","Kharkiv, Ukraine — As the brutal battle for control of the strategically essential city of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine rages, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has predicted that Russia will escalate its attacks across his country's east this week. Despite the U.S. government warning against all travel to the country, Americans have been part of the fight, including two who have been captured by Russian forces. CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay is in the eastern city of Kharkiv, and he spoke with another American who fought alongside Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, and Alexander Drueke, 39, before their capture on the battlefield. The U.S. national insisted on remaining anonymous because he's still fighting on the front lines from which Huynh and Drueke vanished. The two men resurfaced in a video aired on Russian media late last week, captive, and speaking under duress. In the video, Drueke says he's been repeatedly beaten and, at one point, the two are seen bound, blindfolded and forced to their knees. Drueke says he fears they're going to be executed. Recalling the fight they were all engaged in just before his comrades were taken prisoner, the American told CBS News they and the Ukrainian forces they were serving with were withdrawing from the area amid a Russian advance. ""The team was supposed to be setting up ambush positions, and instead a hasty defense was set up to allow more Ukrainian troops to withdraw,"" he told Livesay. But then there was an explosion. He and his fellow troops suspected ""the blast had knocked them unconscious, and that's how they were captured."" ""They're not out to be glory hounds,"" the American fighter told Livesay. ""They're not warmongers or any of those other types that are out here for egotistical reasons… They wound up out here a bit by accident in the situation they are currently in, and it's sort of a series of unfortunate events, in hindsight. They wanted to do good, and... This is sort of — it was, I suppose, the unfortunate result of that."" ""We were advised a while back that execution could be a possibility,"" the fighter said, adding that he was ""very happy that they did not follow through with that"" in the case of his two friends. But the two men's whereabouts remain uncertain. At one point in the video aired on Russian media, Drueke's interrogator says they're in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, on ground held by pro-Russian separatists. Earlier this month, two British men and a Moroccan were found guilty of fighting alongside Ukraine's forces and sentenced to death by the pro-Russian administration that controls that region. The American fighter who spoke to CBS News said if he could speak to Huynh and Drueke now, he would apologize to them. ""Because they sort of followed me out here,"" he said. ""We all agreed. There was no leader in the group. But, yeah, I definitely feel a bit guilty. Without a doubt. We should have taken a closer look at more humanitarian options or training options. If we did, then they wouldn't be in the situation they're in."" The American fighter said he hoped his friends were ""focusing on what they want to do when they get home,"" to get them through this period. ""I hope Andy is focusing on getting back and marrying his fiancée, and what needs to be done in planning it out in his head. Things like that can possibly help in their situation."" Huynh was engaged to be married not long before he and Drueke left their homes in Alabama for Ukraine. The U.S. State Department has said it's doing everything it can to locate the Americans and ensure their safety, and the U.S. fighter who spoke to CBS News said he believed that. He said that he, Huynh and Drueke understood the risks before traveling to Ukraine, but he hinted that they might have underestimated the overwhelming military advantage Russia has in firepower — and in its control of the airspace in particular — and he offered a warning to other Americans considering the same trip. ""Anyone who is over here for egotistical glory-seeking, or wants to come over and say they were in a group, but only to malinger and sit in a tent - those people, I would say, don't bother. You're going to be a burden on your teammates and more than likely, you will be hurt. You can be killed, or you can get somebody else killed. People need to realize how intense it can be. It's not the Taliban. It's not the Iraqi army. The Russians have the air support and air superiority here. Without a doubt."" Another American who volunteered to join Ukraine's fight against the Russian invasion, who also spent time with Huynh and Drueke in Ukraine, told CBS News last week that he believed they will get back home, because they're too valuable to Moscow as bargaining chips to be killed. The State Department confirmed late last week that in addition to Huynh and Drueke, it is also looking into reports that a third American man is missing in Ukraine. Retired Marine Captain Grady Kurpasi, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. military, went silent after taking small-arms fire in the Kherson region, according to a family friend. There has been no information on him since.",14,2.7295525657617863,1.7484107179626815,0.9811418477991047,2

Peskov's comments come days after Russian media released video appearing to show the two men, 39-year-old Alexander Drueke and 27-year-old Andy Huynh. Peskov told NBC News' Keir Simmons that he considers the two men to be ""soldiers of fortune"" who were not enlisted in the Ukrainian army — which means, he said, that Russia does not believe they are protected under the Geneva Conventions. When pressed on whether Russia knows for sure that the two men were not members of the Ukrainian military, Peskov said the matter will be ""investigated in due course."" He also alleged the two men, as a result of their supposed status as mercenaries, were involved in ""illegal activity,"" including firing on and shelling members of Russia's military. ""They should be held responsible for those crimes that they have committed,"" he said. Concern began to grow over the whereabouts of Huynh, who served in the Marines, and Drueke, an Iraq War veteran, last week. Fellow soldiers told British newspaper The Telegraph that the pair were volunteering with a unit of foreign fighters in the Ukrainian army when they disappeared. Earlier in June, one Moroccan and two British fighters who had been captured were sentenced to death by firing squad for fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. The three men were tried and convicted in a Russian-backed separatist court in Donetsk, one of the two major regions in Ukraine's Donbas. When asked if he could promise that Huynh and Drueke wouldn't face the same sentence, Peskov said he ""cannot guarantee anything."" ""It depends on the investigation,"" he said. The U.S. State Department said last week that it's also looking into reports of a third American missing in Ukraine. A family friend identified the person as Retired Marine Captain Grady Kurpasi, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. military. Peskov in his interview with Simmons also spoke about Brittney Griner, the American WNBA star who was arrested in Russia in February for allegedly carrying vape cartridges with oil derived from cannabis. Griner's pre-trial detention period has since been extended multiple times. When Simmons said the U.S. government is now approaching Griner's detention as a hostage situation, Peskov said he would ""strongly disagree"" with that characterization. ""We cannot call her hostage,"" he said. ""Why should we call her hostage? She violated Russian law, and now she's being prosecuted. It's not about being a hostage.""

""There are reports of one additional American whose whereabouts are unknown. I can't speak to the specifics of that case. Unfortunately we don't know the full details of that case,"" said State Department Spokesperson Ned Price at a press briefing on Thursday. Price said the department is in contact with the families of the two other US citizens reportedly captured in the country, as well as Ukrainian authorities and the International Committee of the Red Cross, but that they similarly could not confirm reports that these two citizens were captured. On Wednesday, CNN reported that Alexander John-Robert Drueke, 39, from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, from Hartselle, Alabama -- who had been fighting alongside Ukrainian forces north of Kharkiv -- have been missing for nearly a week and there are fears that they may have been captured by Russian forces, according to their families and a fellow fighter. A photo emerged on Thursday of Drueke and Huynh in the back of a Russian military truck, apparently confirming they had been captured by Russian forces north of Kharkiv last week. CNN could not independently verify when the photo was taken. ""We continue to urge in every way we can American citizens not to travel to Ukraine because of the attendant dangers that is posed by Russia's ongoing aggression,"" said Price. Price also said that the US is not in contact with Russia about the reportedly captured American citizens because they do not yet have ""credible reason"" to believe the Russians have captured them and also because Russia has not claimed to have captured them. ""If we feel that such outreach through our embassy in Moscow or otherwise would be productive in terms of finding out more information on the whereabouts of these individuals, we won't hesitate to do that,"" said Price. Price also said the US is in contact with ""other partners,"" including the United Kingdom, over ""this issue broadly."" The newly emerged photo of Drueke and Huynh shows the two men looking up at the camera with their hands behind their backs, as if they are bound. The undated photo was posted on Telegram on Thursday by a Russian blogger. The US State Department on Thursday told the family of one of the Americans missing in Ukraine that there is potential evidence of capture of Drueke, but could not verify the photo at the time, Bunny Drueke, Alexander's mother, told CNN. ""They said that there is a photograph that is being circulated on the Russian media. And they're working hard to verify it,"" Drueke told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead."" ""We're very hopeful."" Drueke said her son went to Ukraine to train soldiers there to fight against Russia because ""he felt that if Putin wasn't stopped now, he would just become bolder with every success, and that eventually he might end up on American shores.""

An Alabama congressman identified Huynh as a 27-year-old from the town of Trinity. Rep. Robert Aderholt said in a statement Wednesday that Huynh's family reached out to his office after they last heard from him on June 8, when he was in the Kharkiv area. ""Huynh, a former U.S. service member, volunteered to go fight with the Ukrainian Army in their current war against Russia,"" Aderholt said.

Severodonetsk is the last city controlled by Ukraine's own forces in the breakaway province of Luhansk, which, along with neighboring Donetsk, makes up Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas. A Ukrainian official in the region has warned that Severodonetsk could face the same fate as Mariupol, the southern port city where, a month ago, Russia's invasion left thousands of Ukrainian civilians and troops trapped in grim conditions, cut off from basic supplies and with no way to escape. CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay says the desperate effort to save Severodonetsk could decide how much of Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin is able to claim as a war prize. In another blow to Ukraine's chances, the last bridge to Severodonetsk, which connected it with its twin city of Lysychansk across the Siverskyi Donets River to the west, was destroyed by Russian forces. Now, for 100,000 Ukrainians stuck in Severodonetsk, there's no way to escape the surrounded city. ""You have two options,"" a commander of the pro-Russian separatists battling to take the city warned Ukraine's defenders. ""Surrender or die."" The Ukrainian army is high on tenacity, but low on ammunition. To make sure none is wasted, they launch American surveillance drones to help their gunners get precise coordinates for attacks. They simply can't afford to miss, according to local commander Major Oleksandr. ""We have to get closer and take more risks, because our enemies have long-range artillery,"" he said. Long-range artillery like Russia's ""grad"" rocket launchers. Ukrainian forces have destroyed some, using howitzers provided by the U.S. But they need more, Joe Goddard, a former British soldier now training Ukraine's National Guard forces, told CBS News. ""That's the sad part,"" he said. ""I mean these guys want to go and fight, they want to take villages, they want to actually push the Russians back."" The problem for Ukraine's defenders, the former British soldier said, is ""the sheer unevenness"" of the battlefield created by Russia's overwhelming hardware advantage. ""So, they are being smashed every day in the trenches with these heavy guns, and they want to do more, but they can't,"" Goddard told CBS News. Ukraine's government has now asked for an additional 1,000 howitzers, 500 tanks and 1,000 drones, among other heavy weapons. Without them, the city of Severodonetsk — a crucial domino in the potential fall of the entire Donbas region — could fall any day.",14,4.491505728161918,2.629817683418659,1.8616880447432593,12

The cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, which are separated by a river, have been targeted for weeks as the last areas still under Ukrainian control in the eastern Luhansk region. Regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said Monday Russian forces were ""gathering more and more equipment"" to ""encircle"" Severodonetsk. Moscow's troops had ""pushed our units from the center and continue to destroy our city,"" he said. The local Azot chemical plant, where hundreds of civilians have reportedly taken refuge, was being ""heavily shelled,"" Gaiday added. Severodonetsk has been ""de facto"" blocked off after Russian forces blew up the ""last"" bridge connecting it to Lysychansk on Sunday, Eduard Basurin, a representative for pro-Russian separatists, said Monday. Ukrainian forces in the area have two choices, he said, ""to surrender or die."" Moscow-backed forces were also carrying out an offensive on the key city of Slovyansk, from ""west, north and east,"" Basurin said. The capture of Severodonetsk would open the road for Moscow to Slovyansk and another major city, Kramatorsk, in their push to conquer the whole of Donbas, a mainly Russian-speaking region partly held by pro-Kremlin separatists since 2014. Ukrainian forces were fighting for ""every town and village where the occupiers came,"" Zelenskyy said Monday in a message to mark the eighth anniversary of the liberation of Mariupol in the 2014 conflict. The port city in southern Ukraine was captured by Russian troops in May after a weekslong siege. ""We are once again fighting for it and all of Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said. Presidential adviser Mikhaylo Podolyak said Monday that Kyiv needed more arms deliveries to stop the conflict. ""Being straightforward -- to end the war we need heavy weapons,"" he said on Twitter. He listed items he said the Ukrainian army required, including hundreds of howitzers, tanks and armored vehicles. Currently, Russia's massed artillery in the area of Severodonetsk gave it a tenfold advantage, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian military, Valeriy Zaluzhny, said Sunday. ""Every meter of Ukrainian land there is covered in blood -- but not only ours, but also the occupier's."" In Lysychansk, Russian bombardments killed three civilians, including a 6-year-old boy, Lugansk governor Gaiday said Monday. While in the city of Donetsk, separatist authorities said three people were killed and four wounded in Ukrainian shelling on a market in the Budonivskyi district of the city. On Monday, Amnesty International accused Russia of war crimes in Ukraine, saying that attacks on the northeastern city of Kharkiv — many using banned cluster bombs — had killed hundreds of civilians. ""The repeated bombardments of residential neighborhoods in Kharkiv are indiscriminate attacks which killed and injured hundreds of civilians, and as such constitute war crimes,"" the rights group said in a report on Ukraine's second biggest city. Away from the battlefield, World Trade Organization members gathered in Geneva Sunday, with the threat posed to global food security by Russia's war top of the agenda. Tensions ran high during a closed-door session, where several delegates took the floor to condemn Russia's aggression, WTO spokesman Dan Pruzin told journalists. Just before Russia's deputy economic development minister Vladimir Ilichev spoke, around three dozen delegates ""walked out,"" the spokesman said. On a farm near the city of Mykolaiv in the south, the harvest has been delayed by the need to undo the damage done by Russian troops that passed through the area in March. ""We planted really late because we needed to clear everything beforehand,"" including bombshells, Nadiia Ivanova, 42, told AFP. The farm's warehouses currently hold 2,000 tons of last season's grain but there are no takers. The railways have been partially destroyed by the Russian army, while any ship that sails faces the threat of being sunk. Russia's invasion of its neighbor has prompted Finland and Sweden to give up decades of military non-alignment and seek to join the NATO alliance. But Turkey is blocking their bids and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday the issue may not be resolved in time for an alliance summit later this month. The United States and Europe have sent weapons and cash to help Ukraine blunt Russia's advance, alongside punishing Moscow with unprecedented economic sanctions. Russian forces said Sunday they had struck a site in the town of Chortkiv in western Ukraine storing U.S.- and EU-supplied weapons. Russia's defense ministry said the strike destroyed a ""large depot of anti-tank missile systems, portable air defense systems and shells provided to the Kyiv regime by the US and European countries.""

At one of the central squares in the city of Kherson, Russian bands played a concert to celebrate Russia Day, the holiday that marks Russia's emergence as a sovereign state after the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti. In the neighboring Zaporizhzhia region, Moscow-installed officials raised a Russian flag in Melitopol's city center. Ukrainian media reported that few, if any, local residents attended the Russia Day festivities in the two cities. Russia Day was also celebrated in other occupied parts of Ukraine, including the ravaged southern port of Mariupol, where a new city sign painted in the colors of the Russian flag was unveiled on the outskirts and Russian flags were flown on a highway leading into the city. Also, the Russia-aligned administration in Melitopol started handing out Russian passports to those who applied for Russian citizenship. RIA Novosti posted video of a Moscow-backed official congratulating new Russian citizens and telling them: ""Russia will not go anywhere. We are here for good."" President Vladimir Putin earlier this year issued a decree fast-tracking Russian citizenship for residents of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. In captured cities in the south and east, Moscow has also introduced the ruble as official currency, aired Russian news broadcasts and taken steps to introduce a Russian school curriculum. The Kremlin's administrators in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions have voiced plans to incorporate the areas into Russia, despite protests and signs of an insurgency among local residents. Russian-installed officials Sunday in Melitopol reported an explosion in a garbage bin near the city's police headquarters and said two residents were injured. Another blast was reported at an electrical substation in the city of Berdyansk, which is also under Russian control. The Kremlin-backed administration pronounced it a terrorist attack, and officials said electricity was shut down in parts of the city. On the battlefield, Russia said it is used missiles to destroy a large depot in western Ukraine that contained anti-tank and air-defense weapons supplied to Kyiv by the U.S. and European countries. It said the attack took place near the city of Chortkiv in the Ternopil region. Ternopil Gov. Volodymyr Trush said four Russian missiles damaged a military installation and four residential buildings in Chortkiv. More than 20 people were wounded, including a 12-year-old girl, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. ""This strike had no tactical or strategic sense, just like the absolute majority of other Russian strikes. It is terror, just terror,"" he said in a video address. In light of the strike, Zelenskyy made another plea for modern missile defense systems from the U.S. and other Western countries, saying, ""These are lives that could have been saved, tragedies that could have been prevented if Ukraine had been listened to."" Also, heavy fighting continued for control of Sievierodonetsk, an eastern city in Luhansk province with a prewar population of 100,000 that has emerged as central to Russia's campaign to capture the Donbas, Ukraine's industrial heartland. Russian forces shelled a Sievierodonetsk chemical plant where up to 500 civilians, 40 of them children, were holed up, Luhansk Gov. Serhii Haidai said. An official with the pro-Moscow, self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, Rodion Miroshnik, said 300 to 400 Ukrainian troops also remained inside the plant. He said that efforts were underway to evacuate the civilians. Leonid Pasechnik, head of the Luhansk People's Republic, said the Ukrainians making their stand in Sievierodonetsk should save themselves the trouble. ""If I were them, I would already make a decision"" to surrender, he said. ""We will achieve our goal in any case.""",17,0.7070048675210806,3.666400150540166,-2.9593952830190853,17
2022-06-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-up-to-200-soldiers-killed-daily-russian-forces-zelenskyy-aide/,"Up to 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being killed every day by Russian forces, Zelenskyy aide says","Up to 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being killed every day in Russia's military onslaught, according to an adviser to Ukraine's president - and only more and more advanced Western weaponry will turn back the Russian offensive, reduce the casualties and force Moscow to the negotiating table. Mykhailo Podolyak told the BBC in an interview aired Thursday that the daily loss of between 100 and 200 Ukrainian soldiers is the result of a ""complete lack of parity"" between Ukraine and Russia, which has ""thrown pretty much everything non-nuclear at the front"" in its bid to advance in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and beyond. Recently Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put the daily death toll at up to 100, but Podolyak said it had grown. Ukrainian officials have pointed at the mounting losses to emphasize their demand for more Western weapons, which have been critical to the country's unexpected success in holding off the larger and better equipped Russian forces. After a bungled attempt to overrun Kyiv in the early days of the war, Russia shifted its focus to the Donbas region of coal mines and factories. But its progress there has been plodding. Podolyak said delivery of state-of-the-art artillery systems would not only curb Ukraine's death toll, it would help its forces reclaim seized territory. ""There's something really important thing that our partners need to understand, and that's until Russia suffers a serious military defeat, no form of dialogue will be possible, and they will continue to be able to try and take parts of our country,"" he said. Podolyak also addressed Western fears that Western rocket launchers in the hands of Ukraine's forces would be used to strike targets inside Russia and potentially escalate the conflict to a wider conflagration, saying that ""it won't happen."" The slog in the Donbas continued Friday, with a Ukrainian governor saying forces are fighting ""for every house and every street"" in Sievierodonetsk, the recent focus of clashes. Sievierodonetsk is in the last pocket of the Luhansk region that has not yet been claimed by Russia. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai told The Associated Press that Ukrainian forces retain control of the industrial zone on the edge of the city and some other sections, and painstaking block-by-block fighting continues. Zelenskyy said late Thursday that while the situation in the Donbas is static, Ukrainian forces had made some progress in the Zaporizhzhia region in the south, where the Ukrainian troops have been able to ""spoil the plans of the occupiers."" He gave no specifics. The British government said Russia must take responsibility for the ""sham trial"" of two Britons and a Moroccan who were sentenced to death for fighting against Russian forces in Ukraine. Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner and Moroccan Brahim Saadoun were convicted by a court run by pro-Moscow separatist authorities in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, which is not recognized internationally. Separatist authorities argued that the men were ""mercenaries"" not entitled to the usual protections accorded prisoners of war. Aslin's and Pinner's families have said that the two men were long-serving members of the Ukrainian military. Saadoun's father told a Moroccan online newspaper that his son is not a mercenary and that he holds Ukrainian citizenship. Government minister Robin Walker said Friday that it was ""an illegal court in a sham government"" but that the U.K. would use ""all diplomatic channels to make the case that these are prisoners of war who should be treated accordingly."" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss spoke by phone with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, and tweeted that the sentences were an ""egregious breach of the Geneva convention."" ""The U.K. continues to back Ukraine against Putin's barbaric invasion,"" Truss tweeted. The U.K. has not announced any plans to speak to Russian officials - and it does not recognize the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic and will not officially contact the authorities there. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the ministry has so far not received any specific appeals about the men from Britain and as such, ""we can make an unambiguous conclusion that until now the fate of these citizens was not of interest to London."" Last month, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta met some of the American volunteers who have been among both the battlefield casualties, and the heroes to emerge from the war.",14,2.8343339798146947,2.4622804150850475,0.37205356472964723,2

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman Jamie Davies said that under the Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war are entitled to combatant immunity and ""shouldn't be exploited for political purposes."" He said: ""We will continue to work with Ukrainian authorities to secure the release of any British nationals who were serving in the Ukrainian armed forces and are being held as prisoners of war."" British Foreign Secretary Luz Truss tweeted: ""I utterly condemn the sentencing of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner held by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine. They are prisoners of war. This is a sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy."" A court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic found Aslin and Pinner, as well as Saaudun Brahim of Morocco, guilty of taking action toward a violent overthrow of power, an offense punishable by death in the internationally unrecognized rebel-held territory in Ukraine's Donbas region. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday that the three would face a firing squad. They have a month to appeal to a higher court, however. The three men fought alongside Ukrainian troops and surrendered to Russian forces weeks ago. CBS News' partner network BBC News said Aslin, 28, and Pinner, 48, were both from England but had lived in Ukraine since 2018. Aslin is engaged to a Ukrainian woman, the BBC said. Their families told the British network that they had been fighting in the Ukrainian military when they were captured in April. People from around the world have traveled to fight alongside Ukraine's forces since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, and that includes Americans. Ukrainian officials have estimated that some 4,000 people, many with previous military experience, came to join the fight from the U.S. In May, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta met some of the American volunteers who have been among both the battlefield casualties, and the heroes to emerge from the war.",13,1.315285940375519,2.852206403236626,-1.536920462861107,2

""Another exchange of bodies of deceased soldiers has taken place: 50 fallen heroes have been returned,"" Ukraine's reintegration ministry, which is responsible for territory under Russia's control, said in a statement. The ministry said the exchange took place on the front lines near the central city of Zaporizhzhia and it had been an even swap of 50 bodies on both sides. It said 37 of those returned died fighting in Azovstal, the last point of resistance in the strategic port city of Mariupol captured by Russia after a months-long operation at the end of May. The exchange comes after a first swap was announced on June 4 by the reintegration ministry. It said that several days earlier, on June 2, the remains of 160 Ukrainian soldiers were swapped with Moscow. The Association of Families of Azovstal Defenders, an advocacy group, said this week those bodies had been returned to Kyiv and that 30% had died at Azovstal. The ministry's statement Wednesday said the process of returning the bodies of killed Ukrainian soldiers was ongoing. A senior official in eastern Ukraine says Russia is sending more troops into the country in a bid to capture another key city. The governor of the Luhansk region, in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas, says Ukrainian forces are having more and more trouble keeping the Russian forces at bay.

She said those reports ""include horrific accounts of sexual violence."" ""Growing evidence of sexual violence is emerging by day from de-occupied areas,"" said Albania's U.N. Ambassador Ferit Hoxha, who hosted the Council meeting. ""We know now from the findings in the liberated towns and cities in Kyiv Oblast that civilians have been targeted, tortured, killed on a large scale, and that women and girls have been subjects of rape as a weapon of war."" Thomas-Greenfield said Russian forces were ""wielding sexual violence as a weapon of war,"" and that the U.S. government had received reports ""that Russian soldiers raped Ukrainian women for hours — and then killed them."" In April, Ukrainian lawmaker Kira Rudyk told CBS News that sexual violence was being used systematically ""in all the areas that were occupied by the Russians."" The U.N.'s special envoy for sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, said the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights' monitoring team in the country had already evaluated 124 reports received from across Ukraine of alleged conflict-related sexual violence targeting women, girls, men and boys in the regions of Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Zakarpattia and Zhytomyr. In grim detail, Patten outlined first-hand accounts given by Ukrainians to a national hotline over less than three months of war, including rape, gang rape, pregnancy following rape, attempted rape, threats of rape, coercion to watch an act of sexual violence committed against a partner or a child, and forced nudity. Addressing the Council on Monday, European Commission President Charles Michel called the violence against Ukrainian civilians ""shameful acts… in a shameful war,"" which he said ""must be exposed to the light of day and prosecuted."" Michel told Council members that Russia was singularly responsible for the current global food supply crisis. ""Let us be honest: The Kremlin is using food supplies as a stealth missile against developing countries,"" said the senior European official. ""The dramatic consequences of Russia's war are spilling over across the globe. This is driving up food prices, pushing people into poverty, and destabilizing entire regions."" Michel said he'd seen ""millions of tons of grain and wheat stuck in containers and ships"" during a recent visit to the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa, blaming Russian warships in the Black Sea, Russia's attacks on transport infrastructure, and ""Russia's tanks, bombs and mines that are preventing Ukraine from planting and harvesting."" As Michel continued to lambast Russia for the ""barbaric"" war, Moscow's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia — who in his own statement to the Council dismissed the accusations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers as lies — walked out in protest. ""You may leave the room,"" Michel said as he left. ""Maybe it's easier not to listen to the truth, dear ambassador."" Russia's Deputy Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy later said Nebenzia had left because the European Commission chief was making ""unsubstantiated claims, many of which have been already debunked.""",13,5.691221030712792,3.693198390093298,1.998022640619494,11
2022-06-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-recovers-bodies-azovstal-steel-plant-mariupol-commander-says/,"Ukraine recovers bodies from steelworks siege in Mariupol, commander says","Russia has begun turning over the bodies of Ukrainian fighters killed at the Azovstal steelworks, the fortress-like plant in the destroyed city of Mariupol where their last-ditch stand became a symbol of resistance against Moscow's invasion. Dozens of fighters' bodies recovered from the bombed-out mill's now Russian-occupied ruins have been transferred to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where DNA testing is underway to identify the remains, said Maksym Zhorin, a military commander and former leader of the Azov Regiment. The Azov Regiment was among the Ukrainian units that defended the factory for nearly three months before surrendering. It isn't clear how many bodies might still remain at the plant, which was relentlessly pounded by surrounding Russian forces from the ground, air and sea. Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to fight for control of Sievierodonetsk, an eastern Ukrainian city that is key to Moscow's goal of completing the capture of the industrial Donbas region. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow's forces also intend to capture the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, home to more than 700,000 people, a move that could severely weaken Ukraine's standing and allow the Russian military to advance closer to the center of the country. ""In the Zaporizhzhia region ... there is the most threatening situation there,"" Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian fighters' dogged defense of the steel mill frustrated the Kremlin's objective of quickly capturing Mariupol and tied down Russian forces in the strategic port city. The last Azovstal holdouts finally relinquished the plant in May, marching out without weapons and carrying their wounded. The survivors' fate in Russian hands is shrouded in uncertainty. Zelenskyy said more than than 2,500 fighters who defended the plant are being held prisoner by the Russians, and Ukraine is working on getting them released. The recovery of the fighters' remains from the Azovstal ruins has not been announced by the Ukrainian government, and Russian officials have not commented. But relatives of soldiers killed at the plant discussed the process with The Associated Press. The Ukrainian government's Ministry for Reintegration of Occupied Territories on Saturday announced the first officially confirmed swap of their military dead since the war began. It said the two sides exchanged 320 bodies in all, each getting back 160 sets of remains. It gave no details on where the bodies were recovered from. The exchange took place Thursday on the front line in the Zaporizhzhia region. The Avoz Regiment is a National Guard unit that grew out of a group called the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 as one of many volunteer brigades that arose to fight Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Azov Battalion drew initial fighters from far-right circles. Zhorin, the former Azov Regiment leader now co-commanding a Kyiv-based military unit, confirmed that remains recovered from Azovstal were among those exchanged in the swap. The brother of an Azov fighter missing and feared dead in the steelworks told the AP that at least two trucks of bodies from Azovstal were transferred to a military hospital in Kyiv for identification. Viacheslav Drofa said the remains of his elder brother, Dmitry Lisen, did not appear to be among those recovered so far. Bodies were recovered last week from the mill and some were severely burned, he said. The mother of a soldier killed in a Russian airstrike on the plant said the Azov Regiment telephoned her and said that her son's body might be among those that were transferred to Kyiv. The mother did not want her or her son to be identified by name, saying she feared that discussing the recovery process might disrupt it. She tearfully referred to her son as a hero. ""I'm just waiting for the body of my son,"" she said. ""It's important for me to bury him in our Ukrainian land."" In other developments Monday, Ukraine's efforts to resist Russia's invasion loomed large over D-Day commemorations in France, where the 78th anniversary of the Normandy invasion was marked. ""The fight in Ukraine is about honoring these veterans of World War II,"" Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the American Cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer, overlooking Omaha Beach in Normandy. He added: ""It's about maintaining the so-called global rules-based international order that was established by the dead who are buried here at this cemetery."" American D-Day veteran Charles Shay, 97, was at Omaha Beach to mark the the anniversary of the June 6, 1944, landings and pay tribute to those who fell that day. Asked about the war raging on the European continent, Shay said, ""It is a very sad situation."" ""In 1944 I landed on these beaches, and we thought we'd bring peace to the world. But it's not possible,"" he added. Meanwhile, the president of Ukraine's separatist Donetsk People's Republic said that the region's supreme court is opening the trial of three British men alleged to have been mercenaries for Ukrainian forces. If convicted on the charges, including of trying to seize power, the men could face the death penalty. Russia also continued to pummel targets in Ukraine. Russian warplanes fired long-range missiles to destroy a plant on the edge of the town of Lozova in the northeastern Kharkiv region that was repairing armored vehicles, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. Russian aircraft hit 73 areas of concentration of Ukrainian troops and equipment, while the Russian artillery struck 431 military targets, Konashenkov said. His claims couldn't be independently verified. Ukrainian forces put up resistance in Sievierodonetsk. There are more of them, they are more powerful, but we have every chance to fight on this direction,"" Zelenskyy said.",17,4.520257469326453,6.531368455144886,-2.0111109858184326,14
2022-06-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-launches-three-taikonauts-to-tiangong-space-station/,China launches 3 taikonauts to Tiangong space station,"Two veteran Chinese taikonauts and a rookie blasted off atop a Long March 2F rocket Saturday evening U.S. time, streaking into orbit and setting off after China's Tiangong ""Palace in the Sky"" space station for a planned six-month stay. The launching marked the third piloted flight to the Chinese outpost and the first in a series of crew rotations intended to establish a permanent Chinese presence in low-Earth orbit. Shenzhou 14 commander Chen Dong, Liu Yang, the first Chinese woman in space, and first-time flier Cai Xuzhe lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert at 10:44 p.m. EDT (10:44 a.m. local time Sunday), climbing directly into the plane of the space station's orbit. After a computer-orchestrated 4-orbit rendezvous, the ferry ship flew itself to an automated docking at a radial port on the station's Tianhe core module at 5:42 a.m. EDT (5:42 p.m. Beijing time), according to Chinese news agencies. The crew floated into the station after leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal. The Shenzhou 14 crew is the third set of taikonauts, or Chinese astronauts, to live and work aboard the growing space station and the first to establish what China hopes will be a permanent residence in low-Earth orbit. During their stay in orbit, Chen's crew will oversee the addition of two laboratory modules, known as Wentian and Mengtian, in July and October, tripling the station's size. Before returning to Earth in December, Chen and his crewmates will turn the lab over to three replacements arriving aboard the Shenzhou 15 ferry ship. ""We are close friends and colleagues,"" Cai said of his crewmates. ""We have supported each other and we have collaborated closely...We have the confidence and the determination to successfully complete this mission and we will never fail the expectations of the CPC (Communist Party of China) and of our people."" The Tianhe core module, launched in April 2021, is the centerpiece of the Tiangong complex, providing crew quarters, life support systems, communications, spacecraft controls, an airlock and multiple docking ports. The new laboratory modules will extend from Tianhe at right angles, forming a T-shaped outpost. ""After entrance into the core module, we will receive the Mengtian and the Wentian lab modules, they will make the system more stable and improve the functionality of the whole complex,"" Chen told reporters before launch. ""We will make full use of this platform to carry out more complicated scientific experiments,"" Chen added. ""The results of those experiments will benefit not only China but the rest of the world."" When completed, the Chinese station is expected to tip the scales at 80 to 100 tons, making it roughly comparable to Russia's retired Mir station. Equipped with state-of-the-art systems, including a multi-joint robot arm, the Tiangong station will serve as a sophisticated research base and engineering facility. The much larger, more mature International Space Station, built by NASA, Russia, the European Space Agency, Japan and Canada over the past two decades, weighs nearly one million pounds, or 500 tons, and is made up of more than a dozen pressurized modules, featuring a solar power truss stretching the length of a football field. The ISS has been permanently staffed since 2000, but the complex's future is in doubt, in large part because of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and growing animosity between Russia and the lab's western partners. NASA wants to operate the lab until 2030, but it's not yet clear if Russia will remain a part of the project through the end of the decade. As it now stands, Russia provides the propellant and thrusters needed to keep the lab in orbit and neither side can operate the station on its own. But once the ISS is retired, whenever that might be, China's space station will be the pre-imminent lab in low-Earth orbit, sharing space with a planned Russian station that may or may not be funded, and by one or more U.S.-backed commercial outposts, assuming any make it off the drawing board. China's space station follows the development of Shenzhou crew ferry ships, and orbital tests of two prototype Tiangong space station modules, launched in 2011 and 2016 respectively. Eight piloted missions of Shenzhou spacecraft were successfully launched before this week's flight. The first was in 2003, and the most recent flight in 2021. Two three-person crews, including two women, visited the Tiangong 1 prototype, while two crews visited the Tiangong complex to pave the way for the Shenzhou 14 mission.",3,7.7995593717007425,8.07138362482075,-0.27182425312000813,3
2022-06-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-kyiv-missile-strikes-putin-warns-west/,Russian missile strikes hit Kyiv as Putin warns West against arming Ukraine,"Kyiv, Ukraine — Russia took aim at Western military supplies for Ukraine with airstrikes in Kyiv on Sunday that it said destroyed tanks donated from abroad, as President Vladimir Putin warned that any Western deliveries of long-range rocket systems to Ukraine would prompt Moscow to hit ""objects that we haven't yet struck."" The cryptic threat of a military escalation from the Russian leader didn't specify what the new targets might be, but it comes days after the United States announced plans to deliver $700 million of security assistance for Ukraine that includes four precision-guided, medium-range rocket systems, helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. Military analysts say Russia is hoping to overrun the embattled eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have fought the Ukrainian government for years, before any weapons that might turn the tide arrive. The Pentagon said earlier this week it will take at least three weeks to get the precision U.S. weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield. Russian forces pounded railway facilities and other infrastructure early Sunday in Kyiv, which had previously seen weeks of eerie calm. Ukraine's nuclear plant operator, Energoatom, said one cruise missile buzzed the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear plant, about 220 miles to the south, on its way to the capital — citing the dangers of such a near miss. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine that the Russian airstrikes had destroyed tanks. Kyiv hadn't faced any such strikes since the April 28 visit of U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. The early morning attack triggered air raid alarms and showed that Russia still had the capability and willingness to hit at Ukraine's heart since abandoning its wider offensive across the country to instead focus its efforts in the east. In a posting on the Telegram app, the Russian Defense Ministry said high-precision, long-range air-launched missiles were used. It said the strikes on the outskirts of Kyiv destroyed T-72 tanks supplied by Eastern European countries and other armored vehicles located in buildings of a car-repair business. Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has led to untold tens of thousands of civilian and troop deaths, driven millions from their homes, sparked vast sanctions against Putin's government and allies, and strangled exports of critical wheat and other grains from Ukraine through Black Sea ports — limiting access to bread and other products in Africa, the Middle East and beyond. In a television interview on Sunday, Putin lashed out at Western deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, saying they aim to prolong the conflict. ""All this fuss around additional deliveries of weapons, in my opinion, has only one goal: To drag out the armed conflict as much as possible,"" Putin said, alluding to U.S. plans to supply multiple launch rocket systems to Kyiv. He insisted such supplies were unlikely to change much for the Ukrainian government, which he said was merely making up for losses of rockets of similar range that they already had. If Kyiv gets longer-range rockets, he added, Moscow will ""draw appropriate conclusions and use our means of destruction, which we have plenty of, in order to strike at those objects that we haven't yet struck."" The missiles hit Kyiv's Darnytski and Dniprovski districts, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app, punctuating the Kremlin's recently reduced goal of seizing the entire Donbas. Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces for eight years in the Donbas and established self-proclaimed republics. In recent days, Russian forces have focused on capturing the city of Sievierodonetsk. A billowing pillar of smoke filled the air with an acrid odor in Kyiv's eastern Darnystki district, and the charred, blackened wreckage of a warehouse-type structure was smoldering. Police near the site told an Associated Press reporter that military authorities had banned the taking of images. Soldiers also blocked off a road in a nearby area leading toward a large railway yard. The sites struck included facilities for the state rail company, Ukrzaliznytsia, said Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, on Telegram. The cruise missiles appeared to have been launched from a Tu-95 bomber flying over the Caspian Sea, the Air Force Command said on Facebook. It said air defense units shot down one missile. Energoatom said one cruise missile came dangerously close to the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant. It said the missile ""flew critically low"" and that Russian forces ""still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak."" Elsewhere, Russian forces continued their push to take ground in eastern Ukraine, with missile and airstrikes carried out on cities and villages of the Luhansk region, with the war now past the 100-day mark. Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said on Telegram that ""airstrikes by Russian Ka-52 helicopters were carried out in the areas of Girske and Myrna Dolyna, by Su-25 aircraft — on Ustynivka,"" while Lysychansk was hit by a missile from the Tochka-U complex. A total of 13 houses were damaged in Girske, and five in Lysychansk. Another airstrike was reported in the eastern city of Kramatorsk by its mayor Oleksandr Goncharenko. No one was killed in the attack, he said, but two of the city's enterprises sustained ""significant damage."" On Sunday morning, Ukraine's General Staff accused Russian forces of using phosphorus munitions in the village of Cherkaski Tyshky in the Kharkiv region. The claim couldn't be independently verified. The update also confirmed strikes on Kyiv, which occurred in the early hours of Sunday. It wasn't immediately clear from the statement which infrastructure facilities in Kyiv were hit. The General Staff said Russian forces continue assault operations in Sievierodonetsk, one of two key cities left to be captured in the Luhansk region of the Donbas. The Russians control the eastern part of the city, the update said, and are focusing on trying to encircle Ukrainian forces in the area and ""blocking off main logistical routes."" The U.K. military said in its daily intelligence update that Ukrainian counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk were ""likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower."" Russian forces previously had been making a string of advances in the city, but Ukrainian fighters have pushed back in recent days. The statement also said Russia's military was partly relying on reserve forces of the separatists in the Luhansk region. ""These troops are poorly equipped and trained, and lack heavy equipment in comparison to regular Russian units,"" the intelligence update said, adding that ""this approach likely indicates a desire to limit casualties suffered by regular Russian forces."" Far from the battlefield, Ukraine's national soccer players are hoping to secure a World Cup spot when the team takes on Wales later Sunday in Cardiff. On the diplomatic front, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was heading to Serbia for talks with President Aleksandar Vucic early this week, followed by a visit to Turkey on Tuesday, where the Russian envoy is expected to discuss Ukraine with his Turkish counterpart. Turkey has been trying to work with U.N. and the warring countries to help clear the way for Ukrainian grain to be exported to Turkish ports, though no deal on the issue appeared imminent. A Ukrainian presidential adviser urged European nations to respond with ""more sanctions, more weapons"" to Sunday's missile attacks. Mykhailo Podolyak referenced remarks Friday by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Putin had made a ""historic error"" by invading Ukraine, but that world powers shouldn't ""humiliate Russia"" so that a diplomatic exit could be found when the fighting stops. Ukrainian authorities said Ukraine and Russia had exchanged bodies of killed troops this week, in the first officially confirmed swap. Ukraine's Ministry for Reintegration of Occupied Territories said Saturday each side had exchanged 160 bodies Thursday on the front line in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, parts of which are under Russian control. Russian officials haven't commented on the exchange. At the Vatican, Pope Francis made one of his strongest appeals for a ceasefire and peace negotiations in Ukraine, urging leaders: ""Don't bring the world to ruins, please. Don't bring the world to ruins."" He made the plea during his traditional Sunday blessing from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square, asking leaders to hear ""the desperate cries of the people who suffer"" more than 100 days after the Russian invasion.",17,6.895779831262287,1.7361991382548467,5.15958069300744,17

""It is dangerous, because we can hear the shells whistling above us,"" said Sergii Marokhin, a water systems engineer in the town of Bakhmut, which has come under increased shelling recently as Russian forces press their offensive in the Donetsk region of the Donbas, Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Shelling the day before had damaged water pipes in a nearby village and in Bakhmut itself that he and his crew had been repairing that morning. There was a sewage pipe to fix, and damage to water lines in other nearby villages. Even on quiet days, there is still regular maintenance work to be done. ""People still go to work during the war,"" he said with a shrug. In some hard-hit places, people have been forced to rely on makeshift outdoor ovens and stoves built out of bricks and stones. ""As of today, half of the city is without water. The other half of the city takes water from boreholes,"" Oleksandr Marchenko, deputy head of the Bakhmut military administration, said Wednesday. A dam to the north had been blown up, drying up the canal that runs past Bakhmut, he said. The city has a backup water supply, but downed power lines disrupted the pumping of the water. Engineers hoped to repair the damage if it was safe to do so. ""Unfortunately, the city gets bombed every day,"" Marchenko said. As if to prove his point, mortar shells whistled over his head, sending him diving onto a grassy riverbank for cover. The mortar fire landed with a thump in the northern part of the city, sending up puffs of black smoke. ""There is no gas, no electricity, no water!"" thundered Viktor Paramonov as he and a few others on the edge of Bakhmut prepared to cook on a makeshift open-air stove consisting of a wood fire and a metal plate balanced on bricks. ""There is nothing."" A nearby construction materials factory had been destroyed in bombing a few days earlier. In mid-May, the apartment building next to his was struck, collapsing part of it. Farther north in Sloviansk, a generator whirred in city hall after power was knocked out because of high-voltage lines downed by fighting just to the east. The water supply was also cut. ""The repair crews have to go to the areas of combat operations, which is dangerous,"" said Vadym Lyakh, head of Sloviansk's military administration. City authorities delivered water from reservoirs to the Sloviansk's inhabitants, who number around 30,000, down from a prewar 100,000, he said. Others used communal water pumps. Behind a series of apartment buildings pockmarked by shrapnel from a recent rocket strike, residents filled buckets and plastic bottles from an old yellow pump in the street. The pump takes too much strength to operate, grumbled an older man. Some women have to wait for a man to come by and work the lever, he said, as he put together a small metal stove to cook lunch outdoors.",17,2.6367303146228296,3.0172926733299805,-0.38056235870715094,17
2022-06-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-timeline-100-days/,100 days of Russia's war in Ukraine: A timeline,"Friday marks the 100th day since Russia launched the invasion of Ukraine intent on taking over the country quickly and overthrowing democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for a puppet government loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. As the war has grown longer and costlier than the Kremlin expected, the Russians have pursued smaller and smaller goals. After failing to take Kyiv, the Russian forces have zeroed in on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014. The Ukrainians, with the help of Western allies, have held off Russia over the past 100 days, but it remains to be seen how many more days the fight will continue. Here is a timeline of some of the key events in the past 100 days of the invasion: Russian forces ""uncoiling"" After weeks of warning a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent, the Biden administration assessed Putin had made the decision to invade. While traveling in Lithuania, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were ""uncoiling and now poised to strike."" Invasion starts Early in the morning on February 24, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion started with about 100 missiles fired from both land- and sea-based platforms, and then with ground incursions on three main axes of assault: in the north, from Belarus down towards Kyiv; in the east, from western Russia down towards Kharkiv; and in the south, from Crimea up to Kherson. The U.S. intelligence assessment was that Russia planned to install a puppet government in Kyiv. Ukrainian Resistance From the start of the invasion, Russians faced greater resistance from Ukrainians than they had anticipated and suffered logistical setbacks. For instance, already, the Pentagon assessed the Russians were having to expend more fuel than they had planned for in the north. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy started posting social media video addresses from the capital asking for help from the international community. He reportedly turned down another nation's offer to evacuate him from Kyiv by saying, ""I need more ammunition, not a ride."" Stalled in the North About a week into the war, the Pentagon characterized the Russian advance in the north around Kyiv, Chernhiv and Kharkiv as ""stalled."" The Russians never made it closer than about 15 kilometers from Kyiv and stayed at this distance until retreating to focus on the Donbas. In the south, Russia made more progress because its supply lines ran from Crimea, where they've had a presence since 2014. The Russians conducted the only amphibious assault of the invasion so far early on, putting troops from the Sea of Azov near the town of Berdyansk. The Russians captured Berdyansk in March as they worked towards the strategic city of Mariupol. Russian repositioning On March 25, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced it would focus on ""fully liberating"" the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Russian battalion tactical groups began to pull out of Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy back into Russia to be refitted and resupplied for the fight in the Donbas. Bucha Massacre As the Russians withdrew from around Kyiv, evidence of brutal atrocities started to emerge. In the town of Bucha, Ukrainian officials said the Russians cruelly killed an estimated dozens of civilians, many of whom were shot in the head while their wrists were tied behind their back. Ukrainian officials also said several mass graves were discovered in Bucha after the Russian retreat. The graves combined with the images of murdered corpses lining the streets in Bucha horrified the international community and prompted Biden again to call Putin ""a war criminal."" Gen. Dvornikov Seven weeks into the invasion, Putin appointed General Alexander Dvornikov to lead the invasion in what was seen by many as an attempt to fix all the screwups at the front. Before his appointment, Russia did not have an overall commander-in-charge of the invasion. Dvornikov was nicknamed the ""butcher of Syria"" because of his disregard for civilian harm while in charge of Russian forces in Syria. It's unclear what effect he has had on the campaign in Ukraine so far. The head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, estimated in Senate testimony in May that between 8 and 10 Russian generals had been killed in Ukraine so far. Heavier security assistance As the Russians began to prioritize the Donbas, the U.S. and other countries shifted the type of assistance to Ukraine in preparation for a long slog of a fight in the Donbas. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate panel in early April that ""The fight down in the southeast, the terrain is different than it is in the north. It is much more open and -- and lends itself to armored mechanized offensive operations on both sides."" On April 13, the Biden administration committed to sending M777 Howitzers to Ukraine, the heaviest piece of weaponry the U.S. had committed up until this point. In addition to the weapons, the U.S. began training Ukrainians on the Howitzers in locations outside of Ukraine. The training was another step beyond what the administration had done previously. Since then, the U.S. has continued to provide heavier equipment and more training for the Ukrainians. Sinking of the Moskva On April 14, the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, sank. The Ukrainians had struck it the day before with two Neptune anti-ship missiles. The ship initially battled a huge fire and eventually sank in the Black Sea. The Moskva was the ship Ukrainians reportedly told to ""f*** off"" in February when it approached Snake Island and demanded Ukrainians surrender. Kharkiv Counteroffensive The Ukrainians launched a counteroffensive in Kharkiv in early May and have successfully pushed the Russians back gradually toward the border. The Ukrainians have attempted counter offensives in other parts of the country too, including in the south around Kherson. The situation elsewhere, and especially in the Donbas, is less clear in this period, with Russians taking control of a hamlet or village one day and then losing control of it to Ukrainians on the next day. Azovstal and the fall of Mariupol Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers and trapped civilians ended their defense of the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant. The soldiers and many civilians had taken refuge in the plant in part because of its vast underground tunnels and defended the compound for weeks against Russian attacks. On May 16, the Ukrainians negotiated with Russian forces to leave the plant. The end of the Azovstal battle brought most of Mariupol under Russian control, giving Russia the land bridge from Crimea across the southern coast of Ukraine it had sought since February. Narrower Ambitions Since mid-May, the Russians have narrowed their focus to the Donbas and started using smaller units to gradually capture towns and villages in the region. A senior defense official said the Russian military's losses were not insignificant and highlighted that Russia had lost nearly 1,000 tanks, 350 artillery pieces, and almost three dozen fighter aircraft. Despite these losses, the official cautioned that the Russian military has a numerical superiority over Ukraine in terms of equipment and manpower it can commit to the fight. On the Ukrainian side, Zelenskyy told Newsmax in an interview this week that the Ukrainian forces are losing up to 100 soldiers a day in eastern Ukraine and called the situation difficult. In an effort to help the Ukrainians, the U.S. and other allies are stepping up their assistance. On June 1, the Biden administration announced it would provide high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) to Ukraine with munitions that have a range of up to 70 kilometers. The HIMARS is the most significant piece of equipment the U.S. has provided Ukraine with so far. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Dr. Colin H. Kahl on Wednesday said the type of weapons the U.S. has provided to Ukraine has shifted over time as the fight has shifted to an artillery duel in the east. Initially, the priority was javelins and anti-tank weapons, then it was M777 Howitzers that have a range of about 30 kilometers, and now the U.S. is shifting to providing HIMARS. The initial tranche includes four HIMARS systems, but it will take some time for the HIMARS to arrive in Ukraine since training Ukrainians on them will take about three weeks, Kahl said. The Russians have made recent gains and are close to capturing the city of Severodonetsk, the last remaining significant city in the Luhansk oblast — or region. The fall of Severodonetsk would put Russia closer to achieving control of the Donbas, which includes the oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk. In 2014, Russian-backed separatists in these regions tried to break away from Ukraine, and Putin claimed the invasion in February was to protect these regions. One hundred days later, Russia is slowly making progress, but it remains to be seen how much longer the fighting will carry on and what victory looks like for either side.",14,2.5777102712011795,2.1777012736750483,0.40000899752613117,12
2022-06-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-us-germany-advanced-weapons/,U.S. and Germany announce weapons packages for Ukraine,"The U.S. and Germany pledged on Wednesday to equip Ukraine with some of the advanced weapons it has long desired for shooting down aircraft and knocking out artillery, as Russian forces closed in on capturing a key city in the east. Germany said it will supply Ukraine with up-to-date anti-aircraft missiles and radar systems, while the U.S. announced it will provide four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition. The U.S. is trying to help Ukraine fend off the Russians without triggering a wider war in Europe. The Pentagon said it received assurances that Ukraine will not fire the new rockets into Russian territory. The Kremlin accused the U.S. of ""pouring fuel on the fire."" Western arms have been critical to Ukraine's success in stymieing Russia's much larger and better-equipped military, thwarting its effort to storm the capital and forcing Moscow to shift its focus to the industrial Donbas region in the east. But as Russia bombards towns in its inching advance in the east, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly pleaded for more and better weapons and accused the West of moving too slowly. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, hailed the new Western weapons. ""I'm sure that if we receive all the necessary weapons and strengthen the efficient sanctions regime we will win,"" he said. The new arms could help Ukraine set up and hold new lines of defense in the east by hitting back at Russian artillery pieces that have been battering towns and cities and by limiting Russian airstrikes, said retired French Gen. Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France's military mission at the United Nations. ""The NATO countries — the European nations and the Americans — have progressively escalated the means that they are putting at Ukraine's disposal, and this escalation, in my opinion, has had the aim of testing Russian limits,"" he said. ""Each time, they measure the Russian reaction, and since there is no reaction, they keep supplying increasingly effective and sophisticated weaponry."" Military analysts say Russia is hoping to overrun the Donbas before any weapons that might turn the tide arrive. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision U.S. weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. But Defense Undersecretary Colin Kahl said he believes they will arrive in time to make a difference in the fight. The rocket systems are part of a new $700 million package of security assistance for Ukraine from the U.S. that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. The rockets have a range of about 50 miles (80 kilometers) and are highly mobile. Ukraine had pushed unsuccessfully for rockets with a range of up to 186 miles (300 kilometers). Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow does not trust assurances that Ukraine will not fire on Russian territory. ""We believe that the U.S. is deliberately and diligently pouring fuel on the fire,"" he said. Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintzev later went further, directly accusing Ukraine of planning to fire U.S.-provided missiles from the northeastern Sumy region at border areas in Russia. The claim, which he said was based on radio intercepts, couldn't be independently confirmed. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine's push for more weapons is a ""direct provocation intended to draw the West into the fighting."" He warned that the multiple rocket launchers would raise the risk of an expanded conflict. ""Sane Western politicians understand those risks well,"" he said. As the new weapons shipments were announced, a Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of Western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Regional Gov. Maksym Kozytskyy said five people were wounded in Wednesday's strike, and the head of Ukrainian railways said the damage was still being assessed. Germany's promise of IRIS-T air defense systems would mark the first delivery of long-range air defense weapons to Ukraine since the start of the war. Earlier deliveries of portable, shoulder-fired air defense missiles have bolstered the Ukrainian military's ability to take down helicopters and other low-flying aircraft but didn't give it enough range to challenge Russia's air superiority. Germany has come under particular criticism, both at home and from allies abroad, that it isn't doing enough. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers that the IRIS-T's surface-to-air missiles are the most modern air defense system the country has. ""With this, we will enable Ukraine to defend an entire city from Russian air attacks,"" he said. The radar systems will also help Ukraine locate enemy artillery. A regional governor said Russian forces now control 80% of Sievierodonetsk, a city that is key to Moscow's efforts to complete its capture of the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists have fought for years and where the separatists held swaths of territory even before the invasion. Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Russian troops were advancing in the city during fierce street battles with Ukrainian forces, though he noted that in some districts the Ukrainian troops managed to push them back. The only other city in Luhansk that the Russians have not yet captured, Lysychansk, is still fully under Ukrainian control, he said, but is likely to be the next target. The two cities are separated by a river. ""If the Russians manage to take full control over Sievierodonetsk within two to three days, they will start installing artillery and mortars and will shell Lysychansk more intensively,"" Haidai said. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said the country is losing between 60 and 100 soldiers a day in the fighting. He turned the focus to children in his nightly video address, saying 243 of them have been killed in the war, 446 have been wounded and 139 are missing. The real numbers could be higher, he added, as his government doesn't have a full picture of areas under Russian occupation. Zelenskyy also said 200,000 children are among the Ukrainians who have been forcefully taken to Russia and dispersed across that vast country: ""The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return."" In southern Ukraine, a regional governor sounded a more positive note, saying Russian troops were retreating and blowing up bridges behind them. ""They are afraid of a counterattack by the Ukrainian army,"" Vitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolayiv region, said on the Telegram messaging app.",14,2.535860904330108,0.5362871992811689,1.9995737050489393,12
2022-06-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-uk-pledges-missiles-new-us-ambassador-in-kyiv/,Fighting rages in Ukraine's east as Russia warns West of weapons repercussions,"Britain pledged Thursday to send sophisticated medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine, joining the United States and Germany in equipping the embattled nation with advanced weapons for shooting down aircraft and knocking out artillery. Western arms have been critical to Ukraine's success in stymieing Russia's much larger and better-equipped military during a war now in its 99th day. But as Russian forces closed in on a key city in recent days, the Ukrainian government said its fighters needed better rocket launchers to prevail. A Kremlin spokesman again warned of ""absolutely undesirable and rather unpleasant scenarios"" if the latest Western-supplied weapons were fired into Russia. ""This pumping of Ukraine with weapons ... will bring more suffering to Ukraine, which is merely a tool in the hands of those countries that supply it with weapons,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russian forces continued to pound towns and cities overnight and to tighten their grip on the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk. The U.K. Defense Ministry reported that Russia had captured most of the city, one of two in Luhansk province that had remained under Ukrainian control. As fighting raged on in Ukraine's east, some residents forced to flee Russian attempts to storm the capital, Kyiv, confronted the overwhelming task of rebuilding their shattered lives. Nila Zelinska and her husband, Eduard, returned this week for the first time to the charred ruins of what used to be their home outside Kyiv. They fled with her 82-year-old mother amid Russian shelling and airstrikes in the days of the war. Zelinska sobbed and recovered from the rubble a doll that belonged to one of her grandchildren, clutching it as if it were a real child. ""May there be peace on earth, peace so that our people are not suffering so much,"" she said. Speaking by video link to a security conference in Slovakia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for even more weapons and sanctions targeting Russia to halt such horrors. ""As of today, the occupiers control almost 20% of our territory, almost 125,000 square kilometers (48,262 square miles,"" he said. Zelenskyy said Russia had fired 15 cruise missiles in the past day and used a total of 2,478 missiles since invading Ukraine, ""most of them targeted civil infrastructure."" British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said the U.K. would send an unspecified number of M270 launchers, which can fire precision-guided rockets up to 80 kilometers (50 miles). Ukrainian troops will be trained in the U.K. to use the equipment, he said. The British government says the decision to provide the launchers was coordinated closely with the U.S. government, which said Wednesday that it would supply High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems to Ukraine. The two missile systems are similar, though the American one has wheels while the British one -- also U.S.-built -- runs on tracks. Germany had come under criticism that it wasn't doing enough to help Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf said Wednesday that his country would supply Ukraine with modern anti-aircraft missiles and radar systems. He told lawmakers that the IRIS-T's surface-to-air missiles Germany planned to provide were the most modern air defense system the country has. Sweden also announced plans Thursday to donate arms to Kyiv. They include missiles, semi-automatic rifles and anti-tank weapons, Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said. The country's parliament is expected to approve the donation. After Western-supplied arms helped Ukraine fend off Russian attempts to storm the capital, Moscow shifted its focus to seizing all of eastern Ukraine's industrial Donbas region. As Russia's military steadily bombarded Ukrainian-held areas, its offensive there resulted in incremental gains in the last week. A Ukrainian military expert said an uptick in Russian missile strikes came in response to the newly promised arms. ""Supplies of Western weapons are of great concern for the Kremlin, because even without sufficient weapons the Ukrainian army is daringly resisting the offensive,"" military analyst Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press. Analysts think Russia is hoping to overrun the Donbas before any weapons that might turn the tide arrive. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision U.S. weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. But Defense Undersecretary Colin Kahl said he believes they will arrive in time to make a difference in the fight. Kyiv also is set to get a diplomatic boost with the formal installation of a new U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink was set to hand her credentials to Zelenskyy on Thursday. Brink will be Washington's first ambassador in Kyiv since former U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly forced out Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in 2019. She later became a key figure in the first impeachment proceedings against Trump. Ahead of her Senate confirmation last month, Brink promised senators she would work to make Russia's invasion of Ukraine a ""strategic failure."" Her work in Kyiv is expected to focus on coordinating Western weapon shipments. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called Ukraine's repeated push for more weapons a ""direct provocation intended to draw the West into the fighting."" He warned that U.S.-supplied multiple rocket launchers would raise the risk of an expanded conflict. Meanwhile, Russian forces kept up their bombardment of the Donbas and other parts of Ukraine while ground troops made an inching advance in the east. A regional governor said Russian forces now control 80% of Sievierodonetsk, a city that is key to Moscow's efforts to complete its capture of the Donbas. Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists have fought in the eastern region for eight years, and the separatists held swaths of territory before the Russian invasion. Military analyst Zhdanov noted that after the fierce fighting in and around Sievierodonetsk, Russian forces will be ""exhausted,"" and military leaders will need to replenish their both their troops and weaponry. ""Ukraine will try to use this pause to accumulate Western weapons, form a strategic reserve and prepare a counteroffensive,"" he said. The only other city in Luhansk province that the Russians have not yet captured, Lysychansk, is still fully under Ukrainian control, the governor said, but is likely to be the next target. The two cities are separated by a river. Moscow's forces also stormed the town of Komyshuvakha in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, large parts of which are under Russian control, the Ukrainian General Staff said Thursday. In the western Lviv region, a Russian missile hit rail lines that were a key conduit for supplies of Western weapons and other supplies, officials said. In his nightly video address, Ukraine's president turned the focus to his country's children. He said 243 of them have died in the war, 446 have been wounded and 139 were missing.

2022-06-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/boston-childrens-hospital-cyberattack-fbi-iran/,"'Despicable' cyberattack attempt on Boston Children's Hospital thwarted, FBI director says","BOSTON - The FBI last year thwarted a planned cyberattack on Boston Children's Hospital that was to have been carried out by hackers sponsored by the Iranian government, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday. ""In the summer of 2021, hackers sponsored by the Iranian government tried to conduct one of the most despicable cyberattacks I've ever seen, right here in Boston, when they decided to go after Boston Children's Hospital,"" Wray said in a speech at a Boston College cybersecurity conference. Wray said a report from an intelligence partner indicated that Children's was about to be targeted, and the hospital was immediately notified. ""Quick actions by everyone involved, especially at the hospital, protected both the network and the sick kids who depended on it,"" he said. FBI Boston special agent in charge Joseph Bonavolonta said attack could've hurt the ""continuity of operations"" at the world-renowned pediatric medical facility. ""It was truly a reprehensible attempt at an attack, when you look at what could have occurred if those systems were shut down,"" he said. A hospital spokesperson told WBZ-TV on Wednesday that ""Thanks to the FBI and our Boston Children's Hospital staff working so closely together, we proactively thwarted the threat to our network."" Wray said the bureau and Boston Children's Hospital had worked closely together after a hacktivist attacked the hospital's computer network in 2014. Martin Gottesfeld launched a cyberattack at the hospital to protest the care of a teenager at the center of a high-profile custody battle and later was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The attack against the hospital and a treatment home cost the facilities tens of thousands of dollars and disrupted operations for days. ""Children's and our Boston office already knew each other well — before the attack from Iran — and that made a difference,"" Wray said. He did not ascribe a particular motive to the planned attack on the hospital, but he noted that Iran and other countries have been hiring cyber mercenaries to conduct attacks on their behalf. When it comes to Russia, he said, the FBI is ""racing"" to warn potential targets about preparatory actions that hackers are taking toward destructive attacks. In March, for instance, the FBI warned that it was seeing increased interest by hackers in energy companies since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine. Hackers from China, meanwhile, have stolen more corporate and personal data from Americans than all other nations combined as part of a broader geopolitical goal to ""lie, cheat and steal,"" Wray said. The speech took place as the FBI continues to combat ransomware attacks from criminal gangs, an ongoing concern for U.S. officials despite the absence of crippling intrusions in recent months. Wray emphasized the need for private companies to work with the FBI to thwart ransomware gangs and nation-state hackers, adding that building those relationships is a key to success. ""What these partnerships let us do is hit our adversaries at every point — from the victims' networks, back all the way to the hackers' own computers,"" Wray said. The FBI and other federal agencies have been working to assure hacking victims that it is in their best interest to report intrusions and cyber crimes. Many companies attacked by ransomware gangs often don't go to the FBI for a variety of reasons. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio and the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, issued a report earlier this year critical of the FBI's response to some ransomware victims. In two cases, the FBI ""prioritized its investigative and prosecutorial efforts to disrupt attacker operations over victims' need to protect data and mitigate damage,"" the report said. One unnamed Fortune 500 company told committee staff that the FBI did not offer any ""helpful assistance"" when responding to a ransomware attack. ""For example, the FBI offered their hostage negotiator who appeared to have little expertise in responding to ransomware attacks,"" the report said. Wray, though, touted the FBI's capacity to get a technically trained agent to any victimized company in an hour — ""and we use it a lot.""",3,5.397107311563255,5.944692779400668,-0.547585467837413,7
2022-05-30,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-donbas-offensive-zelenskyy-kharkiv-civilian-war-efforts/,"Russia taking more ground, but Ukraine's troops and its civilians remain unwavering","Khriviy Rih, Ukraine — Russia is using its devastating firepower advantage over Ukraine to try to breach the country's defenses, slowly but steadily seizing more ground in its eastern industrial heartland, just across the Russian border. Vladimir Putin's forces have been hammering Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, with artillery as ground troops take more and more small villages across the Donbas region. As CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab reports, the Russian forces are going street by street, village by village in their bid to conquer the entire Donbas. Ukraine's prime minister says 10 times more civilians have been killed since Putin launched the invasion on February 24 than military personnel, and as Russia steps up its offensive in the east, it's feared the toll will only rise. President Zelenksyy visited Kharkiv over the weekend. The major city is under Ukrainian control, but battles are still raging across the region, and as Tyab reports, Ukrainian troops defending it are outnumbered 7 to 1 by Russian forces. While Russia's offensive may now be focused more to the north, there's no greater reminder of the horror that Moscow's siege tactics have inflicted than in the southern city of Mariupol. New video from the decimated port city appears to show mass graves stretching as far as the eye can see. The pain for the few people who remain in Ukraine's razed towns and cities can be unbearable. So it was a show of strength and determination by Zelenskyy to visit Kharkiv over the weekend — ground that his troops just wrestled back from Russia a couple weeks ago. Zelenskyy hadn't been seen outside the Kyiv region since Russia's invasion began more than three months ago. He was greeted with near total devastation. But as Russia wages its war of attrition, the Ukrainian people are the country's most potent secret weapon. CBS News visited a facility in the town of Kryvyi Rih, in southern-central Ukraine, where women were working hard to stitch together body armor vests for the troops on the front lines. Kryvyi Rih Deputy Mayor Serheii Miliutin told Tyab that everyone working there that day ""has loved ones in the military, so we're careful to make things as high-quality as possible."" The labor of love couldn't be clearer. Either could most Ukrainians' feelings about Vladimir Putin. Outside another volunteer center in the area, CBS News saw a mock tombstone bearing the Russian leader's name. Local volunteer Oleg Zaboyak showed Tyab's team around the facility, where he and others were turning old household plastics into camouflage for Ukrainian snipers. Some of the most vital work in Ukraine's war effort is being done in centers like that all across the country. Tyab watched as women wove together camouflage netting to cover vehicles and troops on the battlefield. Valentyna Kryvda said she and the others were doing anything they could to help.

BFM TV said in a statement Leclerc-Imhoff, 32, was fatally hit by shrapnel as he was ""covering a humanitarian operation in an armored vehicle"" near Sievierodonetsk, a city which has emerged as the epicenter of Russia's quest to capture all of Ukraine's Donbas region. ""He was accompanied by his colleague Maxime Brandstaetter, who was slightly wounded in this strike, and their ""fixer"" Oksana Leuta, who was not hit,"" BFM TV said. Leclerc-Imhoff worked at the broadcaster for six years and was on his second trip to Ukraine since the start of the war in the country. ""This tragic event reminds us of the dangers faced by all journalists who have been risking their lives to report on this conflict for over three months now,"" BFM TV said. Earlier on Monday, Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, announced Leclerc-Imhoff's death and blamed Russian forces for firing at the vehicle that was traveling to pick up people for evacuation. He shared graphic photos of the aftermath of the attack, including of the journalist's body and blood stains throughout the interior of the vehicle. Because of the attack, Haidai said the evacuation was called off.

2022-05-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sievierodonetsk-ukraine-russian-forces-storming-city/,"Russian forces ""storming"" city in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian officials say","Russian and Ukrainian troops engaged in close-quarter combat in an eastern Ukraine city Sunday as Moscow's soldiers, supported by intense shelling, attempted to gain strategic footholds for conquering the region in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. Ukrainian regional officials reported that Russian forces were ""storming"" Sievierodonetsk after trying unsuccessfully to encircle the city. The fighting knocked out power and cellphone service, and a humanitarian relief center could not operate because of the danger, the mayor said. Sievierodonetsk, located about 143 kilometers (89 miles) south of the Russian border, emerged in recent days as the epicenter of Moscow's quest to capture all of Ukraine's industrial Donbas region. Russia also stepped up its efforts to take nearby Lysychansk, where civilians rushed to escape persistent shelling. The two cities are the last major areas under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province, which makes up the Donbas together with neighboring Donetsk. Russia is focused, after failing to seize Ukraine's capital, on occupying parts of Donbas not already controlled by pro-Moscow separatists. Russian forces made small advances in recent days as bombardments chewed away at Ukrainian positions and kept civilians trapped in basements or desperately trying to get out safely. Attacks to destroy military targets throughout the country also caused casualties in civilian areas In his Saturday night video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the situation in the east as ""very complicated"" and ""indescribably difficult."" The ""Russian army is trying to squeeze at least some result'' by concentrating its attacks there, he said. Civilians who reached the eastern city of Pokrovsk, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) south of Lysychansk, said they held out as long as they could before fleeing the Russian advance. Yana Skakova choked back tears as she described leaving with her 18-month and 4-year-old sons while her husband stayed behind to take care of their house and animals. The family was among 18 people who lived in a basement for the past 2 1/2 months until police told them Friday it was time to evacuate. ""None of us wanted to leave our native city,"" she said. ""But for the sake of these small children, we decided to leave."" Sievierodonetsk Mayor Oleksandr Striuk said there was fighting at the city's bus station on Saturday. Residents risked exposure to shelling to get water from a half-dozen wells, and there was no electricity or cellphone service, Striuk said. Striuk has estimated that 1,500 civilians in the city, which had a prewar population of around 100,000, have died in Russian attacks since the beginning of the war, as well as from a lack of medicine and diseases that couldn't be treated. The Institute for the Study of War. a think tank based in Washington, questioned the Kremlin's strategy of assembling a huge military effort to take Sieverodonetsk, saying it was proving costly for Russia and would bring few returns. ""When the Battle of Sieverodonetsk ends, regardless of which side holds the city, the Russian offensive at the operational and strategic levels will likely have culminated, giving Ukraine the chance to restart its operational-level counteroffensives to push Russian forces back,"" the institute said in an assessment published late Saturday. The deteriorating conditions raised fears that Sieverodonetsk could become the next Mariupol, a port city 281 kilometers (175 miles) to the south that spent nearly three months under siege before the last Ukrainian fighters surrendered. After Russia's forces gained complete control of Mariupol, they piled bodies of dead people inside a supermarket in the occupied city, an aide to Mariupol's Ukrainian mayor said Sunday. The aide, Petro Andryushchenko, posted a photo on the Telegram messaging app of what he described as a ""corpse dump."" It showed bodies stacked alongside closed supermarket counters. It was not immediately possible to verify his account or the authenticity of the photo, which Andryushchenko described as recent. ""Here the Russians bring the bodies of the dead, which were washed out of their graves during attempts to restore the water supply, and partially exhumed. They just dump them like garbage,"" he wrote. Haidai, the provincial governor of Luhansk, said constant shelling created a ""severe"" situation in Lysychansk. ""There are fatalities and wounded people,"" he wrote on Telegram, without elaborating. On Saturday, he said, one civilian died and four were injured after a Russian shell hit a high-rise apartment building. But some Luhansk supply and evacuation routes still functioned Sunday, he said. He claimed the Russians had retreated ""with losses"" around a village around 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Sievierodonetsk but conducted airstrikes on another nearby village on the strategic Siverskiy Donetsk river. The Ukrainian military said Sunday that Russian forces also were trying to strengthen their positions around Lyman, a small city that serves as a key rail hub in the Donetsk region. Moscow claimed Saturday to have taken Lyman, but Ukrainian authorities said their fighters remained engaged in combat in parts of the city. ""The enemy is reinforcing its units,"" the Ukrainian armed forces' General Staff said in an operational update. ""It is trying to gain a foothold in the area."" The Ukrainian army said that heavy fighting was ongoing around Donetsk, the provincial capital. More widely, Russia launched renewed airstrikes overnight on Ukraine's northern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, and in central Ukraine, Ukrainian state agencies said. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine emergency service said Sunday morning that Russian shelling caused fires around Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city. Russia has kept up a bombardment of Kharkiv, located in northeastern Ukraine, after Ukrainian fighters pushed its forces back from positions near the city several weeks ago. The Kharkiv regional prosecutors' office said a Russian shell broke through the room of a house and wounded a 50-year-old man and a 62-year-old woman early Sunday in the town of Zolochiv, around 40 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of Kharkiv. The Ukrainian Border Guard Service said border areas in the Sumy region, east of Kharkiv, were hit with six unguided missiles. The agency did not mention reports of any casualties. Russia claimed its forces destroyed an important Ukrainian ammunition depot in the eastern city of Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy's hometown. High-precision missiles struck a depot located ""within one of the industrial enterprises"" in the city, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Ukrainian emergency services confirmed that ""an industrial plant"" in Kryvyi Rih caught fire after being struck by two Russian rockets and sustaining ""significant damage."" Officials did not say whether it was being used as a military depot.",17,3.984953003540902,0.7792911481817504,3.2056618553591516,17
2022-05-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-claims-lyman/,"Russia claims it captured key city, aims to widen east Ukraine battle","Russia asserted Saturday that its troops and separatist fighters had captured a key railway junction in eastern Ukraine, the second small city to fall to Moscow's forces this week as they fought to seize all of the country's contested Donbas region. Meanwhile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is accusing Moscow of carrying out ""genocide"" amid Russia's rapid advance in two key regions of eastern Ukraine. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the city of Lyman had been ""completely liberated"" by a joint force of Russian soldiers and the Kremlin-backed separatists, who have waged war in the eastern region bordering Russia for eight years. Lyman, which had a population of about 20,000 before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, serves as a regional railway hub. Ukraine's train system has ferried arms and evacuated citizens during the war, and controlling the city would give Russian troops another foothold for advancing on larger Ukrainian-held cities. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin held a telephone call Saturday with the leaders of France and Germany in which he warned against the continued transfers of Western weapons to Ukraine and blamed the conflict's disruption to global food supplies on Western sanctions. During the 80-minute call, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron urged an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of Russian troops, according to the chancellor's spokesperson. Both urged Putin to engage in serious direct negotiations with Zelenskyy to end the fighting, the spokesperson said. A Kremlin readout of the call between Macron, Putin and Scholz said the Russian leader affirmed ""the openness of the Russian side to the resumption of dialogue."" The three leaders agreed to stay in contact, according to the readout. But Russia's recent progress in Donetsk and Luhansk, the two provinces that make up the Donbas, could further embolden Putin. Since failing to occupy Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, Russia has set out to seize the last parts of the region not controlled by the separatists. ""If Russia did succeed in taking over these areas, it would highly likely be seen by the Kremlin as a substantive political achievement and be portrayed to the Russian people as justifying the invasion,"" the British Ministry of Defense said in a Saturday assessment. On Tuesday, Russian troops took over Svitlodarsk, a small municipality that hosts a thermal power station, while intensifying efforts to encircle and capture the larger city of Sievierodonetsk. Fighting continued Saturday around Sievierodonetsk and nearby Lysychansk, which are the last major areas under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk province. Zelenskyy called the situation in the east was ""difficult"" but expressed confidence his country would prevail with help from Western weapons and sanctions. ""If the occupiers think that Lyman or Sievierodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian,"" he said. The governor of Luhansk had warned that Ukrainian soldiers might have to retreat from Sievierodonetsk to avoid being surrounded but reported Saturday that they had repelled an attack. ""We managed to push back the Russians to their previous positions,"" Gov. Serhii Haidai said. ""However, they do not abandon their attempts to encircle our troops and disrupt logistics in the Luhansk region."" Speaking on Ukrainian TV later Saturday, the governor said the Russians had seized a hotel on the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk. The advance of Russian forces raised fears that residents would experience the same horrors as people in the southeastern port city Mariupol in the weeks before it fell. Sievierodonetsk Mayor Oleksandr Striuk said Friday that some 1,500 civilians in the city with a prewar population of around 100,000 have died during the war, including from a lack of medicine or because of diseases that could not be treated. About 12,000 to 13,000 residents remain in the city, Striuk said. Just south of Sievierodonetsk, volunteers worked to evacuate people amid a threatening soundtrack of air raid sirens and booming artillery. AP reporters saw elderly and ill civilians bundled into soft stretchers and slowly carried down apartment building stairs Friday in Bakhmut, a city in northeast Donetsk province. Svetlana Lvova, the manager of two buildings in Bakhmut, tried to convince reluctant residents to leave but said she and her husband would not evacuate until their son, who was in Sieverodonetsk, returned home. ""I have to know he is alive. That's why I'm staying here,"" Lvova, 66, said. A nearly three-month siege of Mariupol ended last week when Russia claimed the city's complete. The city became a symbol of mass destruction and human suffering, as well as of Ukrainian determination to defend the country. More than 20,000 of its civilians are feared dead. Mariupol's port reportedly resumed operations after Russian forces finished clearing mines in the Azov Sea off the once-vibrant city. Russian state news agency Tass reported that a vessel bound for the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don entered Mariupol's seaport early Saturday. The Kremlin said that Putin emphasized during ""an in-depth exchange of views"" with Macron and Scholz that Russia was working to ""establish a peaceful life in Mariupol and other liberated cities in the Donbas."" Ukrainian authorities have reported that Kremlin-installed officials in seized cities have started airing Russian news broadcasts, introduced Russian area codes, imported Russian school curriculum and taken other steps to annex the areas. Russian-held areas of Ukraine's southern Kherson region have switched to Moscow time and ""will no longer switch to daylight-saving time, as is customary in Ukraine,"" Russia's state RIA Novosti agency quoted Krill Stremousov, a Russian-installed local official, as saying Saturday. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian navy said Saturday morning that Russian ships ""continue to block civilian navigation in the waters of the Black and Azov seas"" along Ukraine's southern coast, ""making them a zone of hostilities."" The war in Ukraine has caused global food shortages because the country is a major exporter of grain and other commodities. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations over which side was responsible for keeping shipments tied up, with Russia saying Ukrainian sea mines prevented safe passage. The press service of the Ukrainian Naval Forces said two Russian missile carriers ""capable of carrying up to 16 missiles"" were ready for action in the Black Sea. It said that only shipping routes which had been established through multilateral treaties could be considered safe. Ukrainian officials pressed Western nations for more sophisticated and powerful weapons, especially multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). The appeals from Kyiv have apparently been heard in Washington, where a Biden administration official told CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin that the White House was leaning toward providing multiple launch rocket systems to Ukraine as part of the next package of military aid for the country. No final decision has been made in Washington, officials told CBS News, but if the Biden administration does commit to providing MLRS to Ukraine, they said it would likely be weapons known as HIMARS, made by Lockheed Martin, which would provide slightly longer range and significantly more punch than the 155 mm howitzers the U.S. is currently providing. The highly-portable HIMARS can fire six shells at a time, unlike the single-fire howitzers, and the rockets themselves are considerably larger than the howitzer rounds, at 277 mm. Russia's U.S. ambassador on Saturday branded such a move as ""unacceptable"" and called on the Biden administration to ""abandon statements about the military victory of Ukraine."" A Telegram post published on the Russian embassy's official channel cited Anatoliy Antonov, Moscow's top diplomat in Washington, as saying that ""the unprecedented pumping of weapons into Ukraine significantly increases the risks of an escalation of the conflict."" Russia's Defense Ministry said the Russian navy successfully launched a new hypersonic missile from the Barents Sea. The ministry said the recently developed Zircon hypersonic cruise missile had struck its target about 1,000 kilometers away. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense on Thursday posted aerial video of what it said was Russian rockets hitting Ukrainian positions in the eastern part of the country. The ministry said the video shows a series of rocket blasts hitting targets near Novomykhailivka, in the Donetsk region, triggering shockwaves and large plumes of smoke. ""This is what largest and most horrific war of the 21st century looks like,"" the ministry said.",17,1.4808456359406608,2.8901025970474032,-1.4092569611067425,17

""The only position where Russia is better than us, it's the amount of heavy weapons they have,"" Kuleba said in his video appeal. ""Without artillery, without multiple launch rocket systems, we won't be able to push them back."" Kuleba said the situation in Donbas was ""even worse than people say,"" beseeching Western allies with a repeated plea: ""If you really care for Ukraine, weapons, weapons and weapons again."" The appeals from Kyiv have apparently been heard in Washington, where a Biden administration official told CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin that the White House was leaning toward providing multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to Ukraine as part of the next package of military aid for the country.

The highly-portable HIMARS can fire six shells at a time, unlike the single-fire howitzers, and the rockets themselves are considerably larger than the howitzer rounds, at 277 mm. Ukrainian troops are already relying heavily on the howitzers provided by the U.S. as they try to stop Russia's advance on villages around two major cities in Donbas, Ukraine's long-time industrial heartland which is now largely under Russian control. Some of the latest video to emerge from the war-torn nation shows Russia bombarding Ukrainian positions with next-generation warheads known as vacuum bombs. Russia's overwhelming artillery advantage has allowed its forces to capture more territory in Donbas this week. CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab says the town of Popasna is a clear example of what a Russian ""victory"" in Ukraine looks like. The town is just over 10 miles south of the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, which Russia is trying hard to capture. Popasna was recently taken by pro-Russian troops, and it's now in ruins, with the remains of the dead still lying in the streets. Tyab says Moscow is throwing nearly all of its firepower into efforts to consolidate control of the entire Donbas, with thousands of Russian troops attacking from three sides. If Severodonetsk and Lysychansk fall, nearly all of the province of Luhansk, which makes up about half of the Donbas, would be under Russian control. But Ukrainian forces Tyab and his team have met this week say they won't go down without a fight, and the American howitzers are a big part of how they hope to turn the tide back against Russia. The American-made artillery pieces shoot further, move faster and can be hidden far easier than other weapons already at the Ukrainians' disposal. The Ukrainians currently have about 85 of the 108 howitzers that were promised by the Biden administration. ""The more howitzers we have, the easier it will be to fight Russians,"" Lieutenant Colonel Serhii Zayika, the lead trainer for the Ukrainian forces using the weapons near the southern city of Kherson, told CBS News. It was the howitzer that helped Ukrainian troops push back Russian forces shelling a small village near Kherson, forcing Tyab and his team to duck for cover with the soldiers near the front lines earlier this week. It's a nimble but mighty weapon against Russia's advancing army, but it's clear that Ukraine wants more of them, and even more lethal firepower as its forces face the mounting Russian offensive. It appeared on Friday that Kyiv's wish could be granted, but it wasn't clear when any multiple rocket launch systems from the U.S. might actually arrive, or if they would come soon enough to help Ukraine's defenders stop Russia from seizing the two big cities in Donbas.",14,1.7815602814053704,2.2449003324463743,-0.46334005104100395,12

Russian forces continued to press their offensive in several parts of the eastern Donbas region, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian military. That industrial heartland of coal mines and factories is now the focus of fighting after Russia suffered a series of setbacks and shifted to more limited goals. Regional governors said at least four civilians were killed and seven others injured in shelling Thursday in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv, while three were killed by attacks in and around the eastern city of Lysychansk, which is a key focus of fighting.

The bodies were decomposing and the stench hung over the neighborhood, said Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor. He did not say when they were discovered, but the sheer number of victims makes it one of the deadliest known attacks of the war. Meanwhile, heavy fighting continued in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that Moscow's forces are intent on seizing. Russian troops intensified their efforts to encircle and capture Sievierodonetsk and neighboring cities. Mariupol was relentlessly pounded during a nearly three-month siege that ended last week after some 2,500 Ukrainian fighters abandoned a steel plant where they had made their stand. Russian forces already held the rest of the city, where an estimated 100,000 people remain out of a prewar population of 450,000, many of them trapped during the siege with little food, water, heat or electricity. At least 21,000 people were killed in the siege, according to Ukrainian authorities, who have accused Russia of trying to cover up the horrors by bringing in mobile cremation equipment and by burying the dead in mass graves. During the assault on Mariupol, Russian airstrikes hit a maternity hospital and a theater where civilians were taking shelter. An Associated Press investigation found that close to 600 people died in the theater attack, double the figure estimated by Ukrainian authorities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the Russians of waging ""total war"" and seeking to inflict as much death and destruction as possible on his country. ""Indeed, there has not been such a war on the European continent for 77 years,"" Zelensky said, referring to the end of World War II. Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas for eight years and hold large swaths of territory. Sievierodonetsk and neighboring cities are the only part of the Donbas' Luhansk region still under Ukrainian government control. Russian forces have achieved ""some localized successes"" despite strong Ukrainian resistance along dug-in positions, British military authorities said. Moscow's troops also took over the town of Svitlodarsk and raised the Russian flag there, Ukrainian media reported. Svitlodarsk is about 31 miles southeast of the strategically important city of Kramatorsk. Two top Russian officials appeared to acknowledge that Moscow's advance has been slower than expected, though they vowed the offensive would achieve its goals. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council. said the Russian government ""is not chasing deadlines."" And Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of a Russia-led security alliance of former Soviet states that Moscow is deliberately slowing down its offensive to allow residents of encircled cities to evacuate — though forces have repeatedly hit civilian targets. As Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, recovers from weeks of relentless bombardment, residents formed long lines to receive rations of flour, pasta, sugar and other staples this week. Moscow's forces withdrew from around Kharkiv earlier this month, pulling back toward the Russian border. Galina Kolembed, the aid distribution center coordinator, said that more and more people are returning to the city. Kolembed said the center is providing food to over 1,000 people every day, a number that keeps growing.

2022-05-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-us-biological-weapons-lab-conspiracy-theory/,"Inside the Ukrainian facility at the heart of Russia's ""biological war lab"" disinformation ploy","Kyiv — From cholera to anthrax, Ukraine's Virology Reference Laboratory in Kyiv has housed some of the most infectious diseases known to humankind. Dr. Natalia Vidayko, the lab's chief researcher, led us through a maze of white walls and stainless steel equipment. Researchers in lab coats hovered over petri dishes, each containing genetic samples of diseases sent in for analysis. If you ask the Kremlin, the vials and Bunsen burners at the Ukrainian Health Ministry facility are all part of a sinister plot. On February 27, three days after President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials claimed one reason they did it was because the U.S. was ""filling Ukraine with biolabs, which were — very possibly — used to study methods for destroying the Russian people at the genetic level."" Despite a complete absence of evidence, the claim went viral on social media, eventually making its way onto Fox News, where host Tucker Carlson demanded answers. ""What exactly were they doing in these secret Ukrainian biolabs?"" he asked. Which is what brought us to the laboratory in Kyiv. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has called it a ""biological war lab."" But when we arrived at the entrance, the only security in sight was a geriatric German Shepherd named Rambo, who graced us with a lugubrious walk outside of his doghouse, and then walked back in. We were told we were the first journalists allowed inside since Russia's invasion. But the facility is routinely inspected by international agencies including the World Health Organization. Dr. Vidayko showed us state-of-the-art equipment for containing dangerous pathogens — not to make weapons, she told us, ""but to test for diseases in patients."" But that all changed when Russian forces invaded Ukraine on February 24, she said, when the shelling began. ""They bombed a building right nearby,"" the scientist told CBS News. From that day, the Ukrainian government ordered the lab, and others, to destroy all particularly dangerous strains, she said. ""Because it was a very high biological risk,"" she said, noting that if the building was attacked, dangerous pathogens could have been released into the environment. She walked me over to the machine that technicians used to kill the diseases, known as an autoclave. ""They're completely destroyed,"" she repeated. But the viral conspiracy theory didn't die with them. ""This crazy fake,"" she lamented to CBS News. ""There's no evidence, just blah blah blah."" Nevertheless, a poll found that 26% of Americans believed Russia's baseless claim, and that includes some members of congress, like Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Green, who introduced a bill in March to ban U.S. funding of ""bioweapons"" in Ukraine. Dr. Vidayko said she worried that, because so many people have bought the Kremlin's line, she and her colleagues could become targets.

A court in Kyiv handed a Russian soldier the sentence for the shooting of an unarmed civilian in the early days of the war. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was convicted Monday of shooting and killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov on February 28 — just four days after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion — in the northeast Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka. Shishimarin pleaded guilty, but said he had been acting on orders, and apologized to Shelipov's widow. Russia denies that its military has targeted civilians at all during the invasion, but Ukraine says it is investigating around than 13,000 war crimes already. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would search for ways to defend Shishimarin. ""Of course we are concerned about the fate of our citizen. Unfortunately, we are unable to defend his interests on the ground. This is due to the de facto lack of operations of our institutions [in Ukraine]. But this does not mean we will stop considering ways to continue our efforts through other channels,"" Peskov said Monday. At a previous hearing, prosecutors said Shishimarin had been driving in a private vehicle with other soldiers, which they had stolen in an attempt to escape after their column came under attack by Ukrainian forces. They drove to the village of Chupakhivka, where they came upon Shelipov riding a bicycle and talking on his phone. Prosecutors said Shishimarin was ordered to shoot the civilian to stop him from telling Ukrainian forces about the Russians' location. They said Shishimarin fired several shots out of his open car window at the victim's head, killing him instantly. Shishimarin's defense lawyer said he had fired only after refusing the order to shoot Shelipov two times, and that he had done so out of fear for his own safety. Kateryna Shelipova, Oleksandr Shelipov's widow, confronted Shishimarin during the trial, CBS partner network BBC News reported. ""Tell me please, why did you [Russians] come here? To 'protect' us?"" she said, mocking Putin's own justification for the war. ""Protect us from whom? Did you protect me from my husband, whom you killed?"" Later she told the BBC: ""I feel very sorry for him, but for a crime like that, I can't forgive him.""",13,5.242899862168941,5.485043808853772,-0.24214394668483052,10

The soldier, Vadim Shishimarin, had pleaded guilty to shooting a 62-year-old civilian to death on the fourth day of the conflict in late February. Before delivering the verdict on Monday, the court said that Shishimarin had ""committed a criminal offense"" according to international humanitarian law. ""[Shishimarin] saw a civilian on the pavement, Oleksandr Shelipov,"" the court said. ""Shishimarin knowing that Shelipov is a civilian and is unarmed and does not pose any threat to him -- fired several shots at Shelipov from his AK-gun."" ""The cause of Shelipov's death was a shot in the head that resulted in crushing of the skull,"" the court added. The sentence may be appealed within 30 days. Prosecutor Andriy Sunyuk raised the possibility of more war crimes trials against Russian troops, and said he hoped Shishimarin's conviction could send a message. ""I think that all other law enforcement agencies will move along the path that we have traveled,"" he said. ""This will be a good example for other occupiers who may not yet be on our territory but are planning to come,"" added Sunyuk. ""Or for those who are here now and plan to stay and fight. Or maybe they will think that it's time to leave here for their own territory."" Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin is ""concerned"" about Shishimarin and will seek ways of assisting him. ""Of course, we are concerned about the fate of our citizen,"" Peskov told reporters on a regular conference call. ""We do not have many opportunities to protect his interests on the ground, as foreign institutions actually have no activity [in Kyiv]. But this does not mean that we will not consider the possibility of making attempts through other channels,"" Peskov added, without clarifying which channels he was speaking about. Peskov previously said Russia considers the charges ""unacceptable,"" ""outrageous"" and ""staged."" Speaking Friday, Shishimarin acknowledged he was responsible for the killing but was ""sorry and sincerely repents."" ""I was nervous the moment it happened. I didn't want to kill. But it happened and I do not deny it,"" he said. Shishimarin's lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, argued that while his client was guilty of killing, it was not murder. ""Shishimarin was in a state of stress caused by the combat situation and the pressure from his commander. Analysis of those circumstances allows me to conclude that Shishimarin had no direct intent for the murder,"" Ovsyannikov said. Ovsyannikov attempted to paint his client and other Russian troops as unwitting pawns in the Kremlin's Machiavellian scheme. The soldiers, Ovsyannikov said, were not aware that their actions would ""result in mass deaths not only of servicemen, but civilians too."" Shishimarin, who appeared in court behind glass wearing a blue-gray top with a shaved head, only spoke on several occasions during the proceedings. He said he was ""fully guilty"" when he entered a plea on Wednesday and, on Thursday he was forced to confront his victim's widow. Shishimarin told her: ""I understand that you will not be able to forgive me, but I am sorry."" The woman questioned the Russian soldier as to why he came to Ukraine, asking rhetorically: ""Did you come to defend us? From whom? Did you defend me from my husband you killed?"" ""We were ordered to come with the column, what will follow I did not know,"" Shishimarin said. window.addEventListener('load', function() { (function(c, id, p, d, w){ var i = d.createElement('iframe'); i.height = '0'; i.width = '0'; i.style = { display: 'none', position: 'absolute', visibility: 'hidden' }; i.src = "" + encodeURI(w.location); d.body.appendChild(i); })(""Europe%2FMideast%2FAfrica"", ""h_10fc8c0f92e6242fce2841ee3a977d45"", ""216"", document, window)}) The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

2022-05-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-diplomat-boris-bondarev-resigns-war-in-ukraine/,"Russian diplomat Boris Bondarev resigns over war in Ukraine: ""Never have I been so ashamed of my country""","Davos, Switzerland — A veteran Russian diplomat to the U.N. Office at Geneva says he handed in his resignation before sending out a scathing letter to foreign colleagues inveighing against the ""aggressive war unleashed"" by President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. Boris Bondarev, 41, confirmed his resignation in a letter delivered Monday morning at the Russian diplomatic mission after a diplomatic official passed on his English-language statement to The Associated Press. ""For twenty years of my diplomatic career I have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on Feb. 24 of this year,"" he wrote, alluding to the date of Russia's invasion. He called the war ""not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the people of Russia ... crossing out all hopes and prospects for a prosperous free society in our country."" Reached by phone, Bondarev — a diplomatic counselor who has focused on Russia's role in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva after postings in places like Cambodia and Mongolia — confirmed he handed in his resignation in a letter addressed to Ambassador Gennady Gatilov. A spokesman for the mission didn't immediately respond to calls and a text message from the AP seeking comment. The resignation amounts to a rare — if not unprecedented — public admission of disgruntlement about Russia's war in Ukraine among the Russian diplomatic corps, at a time when Putin's government has sought to crack down on dissent over the invasion and sought to quell conflicting narratives from the government line about how the ""special military operation"" — as it's officially known in Russia — is proceeding. ""It is intolerable what my government is doing now,"" Bondarev told the AP. ""As a civil servant, I have to carry a share of responsibility for that, and I don't want to do that."" Bondarev said he had not received any reaction yet from Russian officials, but added: ""Am I concerned about the possible reaction from Moscow? I have to be concerned about it."" Asked if some colleagues felt the same, he added: ""Not all Russian diplomats are warmongering. They are reasonable, but they have to keep their mouths shut."" He suggested his case could become an example. ""If my case is prosecuted, then if other people want to follow, they would not,"" he suggested. In his English-language statement, which he said he emailed to about 40 diplomats and others, Bondarev said those who conceived the war ""want only one thing — to remain in power forever, live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian Navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity."" He railed against the growing ""lies and unprofessionalism"" in the Russian Foreign Ministry and took particular aim at Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who he said in ""18 years, he went from a professional and educated intellectual … to a person who constantly broadcasts conflicting statements and threatens the world (that is, Russia too) with nuclear weapons!"" ""Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy. It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred."" He added, ""I studied to be a diplomat and have been a diplomat for twenty years. The Ministry has been my home and family. But I simply cannot any longer share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needly ignominy."" At least one Russian diplomat still working for the foreign service dismissed the resignation. ""Every family has its black sheep,"" a Russian diplomat to the United Nations told CBS News. Bondarev told the AP that he had no plans to leave Geneva. He posted his statement on his LinkedIn account with a line at the bottom saying, ""Job offers are welcome..."" Hiller Neuer, executive director of the advocacy group U.N. Watch, said simply: ""Boris Bondarev is a hero."" ""Bondarev should be invited to speak in Davos this week,"" he added, ""and the U.S., the U.K. and the EU should lead the free world in creating a program to encourage more Russian diplomats to follow and defect, by providing protection, financial security and resettlement for diplomats and their families.""

2022-05-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-claims-mariupol-wives-ukraine-fighters-last-messages/,"Russia claims to have full control of Mariupol as wives share last messages from Ukraine fighters: ""Love you. Kiss you. Bye.""","Russia claimed to have captured Mariupol on Friday in what would be its biggest victory yet in its war in Ukraine. The announcement came following a nearly three-month siege that reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin, with over 20,000 civilians feared dead. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the ""complete liberation"" of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol - the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance - and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying that a total of 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at Azovstal had laid down their arms and surrendered since Monday, including over 500 on Friday. The steelworks had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out in the plant, drawing Russian airstrikes, artillery and tank fire before their government ordered them to abandon its defense and save their lives. Wives of fighters who held out at the steelworks spoke emotionally about what may have been their last contact with their husbands. Olga Boiko, wife of a marine, wiped away tears as she said that her husband had written her on Thursday: ""Hello. We surrender, I don't know when I will get in touch with you and if I will at all. Love you. Kiss you. Bye."" Natalia Zaritskaya, wife of another fighter at Azovstal, said that based on the messages she had seen over the past two days, ""Now they are on the path from hell to hell. Every inch of this path is deadly."" She said that two days ago, her husband reported that of the 32 soldiers with whom he had served, only eight survived, most of them seriously wounded. The complete takeover of Mariupol gives Putin a badly needed military victory in the war he began on Feb. 24 - a conflict that was supposed to have been a quick and easy victory for the Kremlin but instead has seen the failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of its forces to refocus on battles in eastern Ukraine and even the sinking of Russia's flagship of its Black Sea fleet, the Moskva. Military analysts say the city's capture at this point holds more symbolic importance than anything else, since Mariupol is already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces that were tied down by the drawn-out fighting have already left. Russia had sought control of Mariupol, on the coast of the Sea of Azov, to complete a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the growing battle for control of the wider industrial Donbas region, home to an 8-year-old Moscow-backed separatist rebellion. It would also deprive Ukraine of a vital port. The city endured some of the worst suffering of the war. An estimated 100,000 people remained from a prewar population of 450,000, many trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Constant bombardment has left behind shattered and charred buildings in row after row of destroyed apartment blocks and ruined neighborhoods. A maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the facility. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600. Officials had written the word ""CHILDREN"" in Russian on the pavement outside to try to forestall an aerial attack. Long traffic jams of cars snaked out of the city, filled with evacuees fleeing past checkpoints of Russian soldiers with heavy weapons who didn't have time to search inside each vehicle in the convoys. Satellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves near Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians. The imagery showed rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery in the town of Manhush, outside the port city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of ""hiding their military crimes"" in the mass graves and labeled it ""the new Babi Yar"" -- recalling the ravine in Kyiv where the Nazis massacred nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews during World War II. It was not the first time Moscow has claimed to have captured Mariupol. At a joint appearance with his defense minister on April 21, Putin declared that ""the completion of combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success."" Even though die-hard Ukrainian forces were still inside the Azovstal plant at that point, Putin ordered the military to seal off the complex ""so that not even a fly comes through."" After continued bombardment, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on May 16 the evacuation of his forces from the bunkers and tunnels beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,"" Zelenskyy said. The Azovstal complex covers 11 square kilometers (4 square miles) and is threaded with about 24 kilometers (15 miles) of tunnels and bunkers. Earlier in May, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian cease-fires. One civilian evacuee from Azovstal, who made it to the Ukrainian controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on May 3, said she went to sleep at the plant every night afraid she wouldn't wake up. ""You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the bomb shelter, in a damp and wet basement, and it is bouncing and shaking,"" said Elina Tsybulchenko, 54. While Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a fulfilled mission. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, described the defense of Mariupol as ""the Thermopylae of the 21st century"" - a reference to one of history's most glorious defeats, in which 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 B.C. before finally succumbing. ""The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war,"" Podolyak said. Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Mariupol's defenders gave Ukraine ""critically important time to form reserves and regroup forces and receive help from partners. And they fulfilled all their tasks."" The U.S. has gathered intelligence that shows some Russian officials have become concerned that Russian forces in the ravaged port city of Mariupol are carrying out grievous abuses, a U.S official familiar with the newly declassified findings told CBS News. The Russian officials are concerned that the abuses will backfire and further inspire Mariupol residents to resist the Russian occupation. The U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Russians, who were not identified, also feared that the abuses will undercut Russia's claim that they've liberated the Russian-speaking city.

The Russian officials are concerned that the abuses will backfire and further inspire Mariupol residents to resist the Russian occupation. The U.S. official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the Russians, who were not identified, also feared that the abuses will undercut Russia's claim that they've liberated the Russian-speaking city. The abuses include beating and electrocuting city officials and robbing homes, according to the intelligence finding. The new intelligence has been declassified and was shared by a U.S. official as some of the last Ukrainian fighters in the devastated city emerged from the ruined Azovstal steelworks. The fighters were ordered by their military to abandon the last stronghold of resistance in the now-flattened port city and face an uncertain fate. Hundreds of the fighters had held out for months under relentless bombardment in the last bastion of resistance in the devastated city. The city has been reduced to rubble and has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war. The seaside city captured worldwide attention after a March 9 Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital, and then after another airstrike a week later on a theater that was serving as the city's largest bomb shelter. At the theater, the word ""CHILDREN"" was written in Russian on the pavement outside to deter an attack. Nearly 600 people were killed, inside and outside the theater, by some estimates. It was unclear the extent of the suspected abuse gleaned in the U.S. intelligence finding, but it comes on the heels of widespread human rights abuses in and around Bucha and the suburbs of Kyiv. Evidence of the massacre in Bucha emerged early last month after Russian forces withdrew from the city. Photographs and video from Bucha showed body bags piled in trenches, lifeless limbs protruding from hastily dug graves, and corpses scattered in streets where they fell. Meanwhile, the first captured Russian soldier to be put on trial by Ukraine on war-crimes charges pleaded guilty on Wednesday to killing a civilian and could face life in prison. Russian Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old member of a tank unit, pleaded guilty to shooting an unarmed 62-year-old Ukrainian man in the head through a car window in the opening days of the war. Ukraine's top prosecutor has said some 40 more war-crimes cases are being readied.",13,2.3356588810853354,7.377603074950303,-5.041944193864968,14

Mr. Biden greeted Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and President Sauli Niinistö of Finland at the White House with handshakes and laughter as they met for trilateral conversations on the NATO mutual defense pact as well as broader European security concerns. His administration has professed optimism for their applications to join the alliance, which would mark a significant embarrassment to Russia, despite continued opposition from Turkey. ""Today I'm proud to welcome and offer the strong support in the United States for the applications of two great democracies, and two close, highly capable partners to join the strongest, most powerful defensive alliance in the history of the world,"" Biden said after escorting his fellow leaders to the Rose Garden. ""They meet every NATO requirement and then some,"" he said, and ""having two new NATO members in the high north will enhance the security of our alliance."" ""I am proud to assure them that they have the full, total, complete backing of the United States of America,"" he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that the alliance stop expanding toward Russia's borders, and several NATO allies, led by the U.S. and Britain, have signaled that they stand ready to provide security support to Finland and Sweden should the Kremlin try to provoke or destabilize them during the time it takes to become full members. While neutral throughout the Cold War, Finland and Sweden now cooperate closely with NATO. The countries will only benefit from NATO's Article 5 security guarantee — the part of the alliance's founding treaty that pledges that any attack on one member would be considered an attack on them all — once the membership ratification process is concluded. Public opinion in Finland and Sweden has shifted massively in favor of membership since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Because the pact must reach consensus on decisions, each of its NATO's 30 member countries has the power to veto a membership bid. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a Thursday video that he remains opposed to the two countries joining the alliance. ""We have told our relevant friends we would say 'no' to Finland and Sweden's entry into NATO, and we will continue on our path like this,"" Erdogan told a group of Turkish youth in the video for Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day, a national holiday. Erdogan has said Turkey's objection stems from grievances with Sweden's — and to a lesser degree with Finland's — perceived support of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, and an armed group in Syria that Turkey sees as an extension of the PKK. The conflict with the PKK has killed tens of thousands of people since 1984. Turkey also accuses Sweden and Finland of harboring the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric whom the Turkish government blames for a 2016 military coup attempt. The objections echo longtime Turkish complaints over even more substantial U.S. support for Kurds, as well as Gulen's presence in America. ""I think we're going to be okay,"" Mr. Biden said Wednesday when asked whether he was confident he could secure their entry into NATO. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that Finland and Sweden were ""working directly"" with Turkey to address its concerns, and that the U.S. was also speaking with Turkish officials to ""try to help facilitate"" a resolution. ""You've got a raucous collection of states that all have opinions, that all have perspectives, that all have interests,"" Sullivan said. ""But they also know how to and when to pull together and how to settle any differences. And I expect these differences will be settled."" He added: ""I expect that NATO will speak with one voice in support of Finland and Sweden at the end of the day.""",29,7.379303760784847,0.639270761457149,6.740032999327698,13
2022-05-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/finland-nato-membership-russia-aggression-turkey-opposition-kai-sauer/,Top Finland diplomat says his country could fend off Russian aggression with or without NATO,"United Nations — Finland, along with Nordic neighbor Sweden, formally applied this week to join the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. Brushing off repeated threats from Russia, Finland's leaders scrapped decades of neutrality to file the application for membership in the bloc — a move backed solidly by the country's legislature and its public. CBS News asked Finland's Under Secretary of State for Foreign and Security Policy Kai Sauer what has driven the dramatic shift in opinion, whether NATO member Turkey could block his country's bid, and if Finland is prepared to defend itself in the face of any hypothetical Russian aggression with or without NATO backup. Finland's President Sauli Niinistö was joining his Swedish counterpart for a Thursday visit with President Joe Biden at the White House. The Finnish president's office said the leaders would ""discuss, among other things, Finland's and Sweden's NATO membership, Russia's warfare in Ukraine and the relationship of Europe and the United States in the changed security situation."" You can read excerpts of CBS News' interview with Sauer below. Under Secretary of State Kai Sauer: Why we arrived here [applying for NATO membership] is basically based on two events: One is Russia's request, or rather demand, made already in 2021, that NATO should not be enlarged. And this we felt is against our national sovereignty. The second argument, why Finland is now striving to join NATO is the Russian brutal aggression in Ukraine, which is of course a breach against international law. It also caused a lot of concern and a big public reaction in Finland. The support for NATO membership which in the past, for the Russian aggression in Ukraine, was 20% has spiked, and we are now looking at popular support around 70%. CBS News correspondent Pamela Falk: Between the time that the actual accession to NATO comes and today, in other words, the period in which you're not protected by NATO or a member of NATO, the U.K. and the U.S. have offered guarantees that if anything happened in between, they would protect Finland. Is that your understanding? Sauer: Well, let me take a step back and just share with you that Finland has the full capability to protect itself. We are actually bringing a number of qualities to the NATO table. We have a capable armed force, defense force. We have a very deep reserve - we are still maintaining a conscript system, which allows us to mobilize a significant number of personnel if needed, and we have the defense spirit… to defend our country if necessary. So, it's not that this is, this is a security vacuum. But nevertheless, of course, we have also partnerships like with the U.S., with the U.K., with our Nordic partners... to support, should there be any troubles during this time. Falk: Could Finland stand up to a Russian attack? Sauer: I think we have a credible deterrence. After the Cold War, many countries started to demobilize, especially in Europe. We didn't. We always maintained the credible defense, credible threshold. Actually, last December the decision was made — congratulations, Lockheed Martin — the decision was made to procure 64 F-35 fighters from the U.S. So, yes, we think we are capable of deterring any potential military activities… We are a net provider of stability, not the consumer, I think this will continue after the NATO membership. Any new state's accession to NATO requires unanimous approval by all 30 of the bloc's current members. The government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, a current member of the bloc, has sent mixed signals about whether it will block Finland's and Sweden's bids. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was to meet Turkey's foreign minister in New York on Wednesday to try to figure out exactly what concessions his country is seeking to back the Nordic countries' applications. Erdogan and his foreign minister have chastised Finland and Sweden for their purported support of Kurdish separatist groups in Turkey, and for curbing some arms sales to the country. But Sauer told CBS News he was optimistic that Ankara could be won over. ""We certainly hope so,"" he said. ""We have a long, good relationship with Turkey, and these are processes which require time and a lot of dialogue."" His relative ease over Turkey's opposition has been echoed by other officials, including NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who said it was his understanding that Turkey aims not to keep Finland or Sweden out of the bloc, but rather to have its concerns addressed.",29,0.4228141915383868,1.0540419473090314,-0.6312277557706447,13
2022-05-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/finland-and-sweden-nato-applications/,Finland and Sweden officially apply to join NATO despite Russia's warnings,"Brussels — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday that Finland and Sweden have formally applied to join the world's biggest military alliance, a move driven by security concerns over Russia's war in Ukraine. ""I warmly welcome the requests by Finland and Sweden to join NATO. You are our closest partners,"" Stoltenberg told reporters after a receiving their application letters from the two Nordic countries' ambassadors. ""All allies agree on the importance of NATO enlargement. We all agree that we must stand together, and we all agree that this is an historic moment which we must seize. This is a good day at a critical moment for our security,"" a beaming Stoltenberg said, as he stood alongside the two envoys, with NATO, Finnish and Swedish flags at their backs. The application must now be weighed by the 30 member countries. That process is expected to take about two weeks, although Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed reservations about Finland and Sweden joining. If his objections are overcome, and accession talks go as well as expected, the two could become members within a few months. The process usually takes eight to 12 months, but NATO wants to move quickly given the threat from Russia hanging over the Nordic countries' heads. Canada, for example, says that it expects to ratify their accession protocol in just a few days. President Biden said in a statement he welcomes and supports Finland and Sweden's applications for NATO membership. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinistö are set to meet with Mr. Biden at the White House on Thursday. ""Finland and Sweden are longtime, stalwart partners of the United States,"" the president said. ""By joining NATO, they will further strengthen our defense cooperation and benefit the entire Transatlantic Alliance."" Mr. Biden said that while Finland and Sweden's applications are being considered, the U.S. will work with the two nations ""to remain vigilant against any threats to our shared security, and to deter and confront aggression or the threat of aggression."" Public opinion in Finland and Sweden has shifted massively in favor of membership since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Finland and Sweden are NATO's closest partners. They have functioning democracies, well-funded armed forces and contribute to the alliance's military operations and air policing. Any obstacles they face would merely be of a technical, or possibly political nature. Russia, and its president Vladimir Putin in particular, has long considered NATO a threat. The Kremlin has defended its war in Ukraine partly as a means of pushing the Western alliance back further from its borders — a tactic which, given Finland and Sweden's accession bids, appears to have backfired spectacularly. Moscow has threatened to react with unspecified ""military-technical measures"" should the Nordic states commit the ""grave mistake"" of joining NATO. The Kremlin warned that ""the general level of military tensions will increase"" in Europe if the alliance does expand on Russia's doorstep.",29,0.8093734688722233,4.178633525221165,-3.3692600563489417,13
2022-05-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-crimes-us-biden-admin-conflict-observatory-icc-investigators/,U.S. launches program to gather evidence of Russia's alleged war crimes in Ukraine as ICC sends investigators,"London — The U.S. State Department announced on Tuesday that it was launching a new program to preserve, analyze and share open-source evidence of suspected Russian war crimes in Ukraine, ""for use in ongoing and future accountability mechanisms."" Called the ""Conflict Observatory,"" the new program will maintain ""rigorous chain-of-custody procedures for future civil and criminal legal processes under appropriate jurisdictions,"" the State Department said. The announcement came as the International Criminal Court deployed its ""largest ever"" team of investigators, forensic experts and support staff to collect evidence and help coordinate activities around war crimes investigations in Ukraine. ""Through the deployment of a team of investigators, we will further expand lead development and collect testimonial accounts relevant to military attacks that may constitute Rome Statute crimes,"" ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said in a statement, referring to the treaty that established the court and outlines its function. He said his team would work with Ukrainian authorities and others on the ground to coordinate efforts and strengthen the chain of custody for evidence. ""It is essential that the work of all actors seeking to support accountability efforts in Ukraine benefit from effective coordination and communication. In doing so, we will significantly strengthen the impact of our collective work in establishing the truth,"" Khan said. On Wednesday, Ukraine's first prosecution for suspected war crimes since the invasion formally got underway. Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin appeared in court and pleaded guilty to shooting a 62-year-old man on a bicycle four days after the start of the war, in a town about 200 miles east of Kyiv. Asked if he was guilty of charges including war crimes and premeditated murder, the 21-year-old sergeant responded: ""Yes"". Human Rights Watch released a report, meanwhile, outlining purported evidence of summary executions and torture by Russian troops in occupied areas around Kyiv and Chernihiv during the early days of the invasion. ""The numerous atrocities by Russian forces occupying parts of northeastern Ukraine early in the war are abhorrent, unlawful, and cruel,"" Giorgi Gogia, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""These abuses against civilians are evident war crimes that should be promptly and impartially investigated and appropriately prosecuted."" In early April, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta and her team visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha to see for themselves the evidence of killings there that Russia has dismissed as ""fake."" The ICC announced its investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine four days after Russia's invasion of the country in February. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is a state party to the Rome Statute, and Russia does not recognise the court. However, Ukraine accepted the jurisdiction of the court for crimes committed in its territory starting in 2014. Khan, the ICC prosecutor, visited Ukraine in April, where he witnessed the aftermath of atrocities carried out in Bucha and called the entire country ""a crime scene."" ""Now more than ever we need to show the law in action,"" Khan said Tuesday. ""It is essential that we demonstrate to survivors and the families of victims that international law is relevant to their experience, that the ideals of the Rome Statute can be applied meaningfully in order to bring them some measure of solace through the process of justice.""",13,4.863473093093886,1.723148028485797,3.1403250646080894,11
2022-05-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-crimes-trial-vadim-shishimarin-pleads-guilty/,Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin accused of war crimes pleads guilty to killing unarmed Ukrainian civilian,"The first Russian soldier to face trial for war crimes in Ukraine pleaded guilty on Wednesday to shooting and killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, who was part of a Russian tank unit captured by Ukrainian forces in early March, just days after the war began, faces a possible sentence of life in prison. Shishimarin appeared Wednesday at a district court in Kyiv. At a preliminary hearing last week, prosecutors said Shishimarin had been driving in a private vehicle with other soldiers, which they had stolen in an attempt to escape after their column came under attack by Ukrainian forces a few days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 28. They drove to the village of Chupakhivka, where they came upon the victim, a 62-year-old man riding a bicycle and talking on his phone. Prosecutors said Shishimarin was ordered to shoot the civilian to stop him from telling Ukrainian defenders about the Russians' location. They said Shishimarin fired several shots out of his open car window at the victim's head, killing him instantly. Ukrainian officials say the shooting was captured on video by the country's State Security Service, but that video has not been seen by CBS News. ""I was ordered to shoot,"" Shishimarin said in a confession video shown last week by prosecutors, which appeared to have been edited by Ukrainian authorities. ""I shot one (round) at him. He falls. And we kept on going."" Ukraine's National Security Service called Shishimarin's video statement ""one of the first confessions of the enemy invaders."" Ukraine, along with the U.S. and others in the international community, has accused Russia of committing atrocities against civilians during its war on Ukraine, and says it has identified over 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia has denied targeting civilians and accused Ukraine of staging atrocities.",13,1.2139925460007017,6.220315294331248,-5.006322748330546,10
2022-05-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-azovstal-steel-mill-defenders-mission-complete/,"Siege of Mariupol over as Russia says Ukraine's holdout forces from steelworks have ""surrendered""","Efforts were underway Tuesday to evacuate the last of the Ukrainian forces who spent weeks holed-up inside the Azovstal steel plant in the ruined port city of Mariupol. Ukrainian officials said the fighters had ""completed their mission"" and there was no way the country's forces could free the plant from Russia's grasp by military means. Russia called it a surrender, and there was no doubt that Moscow and its proxy forces in Ukraine were in full control of the strategic southern port city — even if much of it has been razed to the ground. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports the fighters held out for 82 days under brutal conditions in the steelworks, becoming a collective symbol of Ukraine's resistance and Russia's merciless tactics in the war. But overnight, dozens of buses were seen leaving the plant carrying the bedraggled forces away, many in urgent need of medical care. They were taken under escort by pro-Russian forces to territory held by those rebels, with Ukraine hoping for a prisoner exchange while rescue attempts continued for those still underground. The Ukrainian military avoided using the term ""surrender"" to describe the effort to pull out of the steel plant, but Russia declared it just that. ""Over the past 24 hours, 265 militants laid down their arms and surrendered, including 51 heavily wounded,"" the Russian Ministry of Defense announced in a briefing on Tuesday, saying those in need of medical care were transferred to a hospital in the pro-Russian rebel-held town of Novoazovsk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the evacuation to separatist-controlled territory was done to save the lives of the fighters who endured weeks of Russian assaults in the maze of underground passages below the hulking Azovstal steelworks. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,"" he said. An unknown number of fighters stayed behind, but reports by local media outlets suggested more were preparing to accept evacuation into pro-Russian territory. ""The work to bring the guys home continues, and it requires delicacy and time,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Thanks to the defenders of Mariupol, Ukraine gained critically important time to form reserves and regroup forces and receive help from partners,"" Deputy Ukrainian Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said. ""They fulfilled all their tasks. But it is impossible to unblock Azovstal by military means."" The steel mill's defenders got out as Moscow suffered another diplomatic setback in its war with Ukraine, with Sweden and Finland deciding to seek NATO membership. And Ukraine made a symbolic gain as its forces reportedly pushed Russian troops back to the Russian border in the Kharkiv region. Still, Russian forces pounded targets in the industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas, and the death toll, already many thousands, kept climbing with the war set to enter its 12th week on Wednesday. The eastern city of Sievierdonetsk in Donbas came under heavy shelling that killed at least 10 people, said Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region. In the Donetsk region, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Facebook that nine civilians were killed in shelling. The western Ukrainian city of Lviv was rocked by loud explosions early Tuesday. Witnesses counted at least eight blasts accompanied by distant booms, and the smell of burning was apparent some time later. An Associated Press team in Lviv, which was under an overnight curfew, said the sky west of the city was lit up by an orange glow. But Ukrainian troops also advanced as Russian forces pulled back from around the northeastern city of Kharkiv in recent days. Zelenskyy thanked the soldiers who reportedly pushed them all the way to the Russian border in the Kharkiv region. Video showed Ukrainian soldiers carrying a post that resembled a Ukrainian blue-and-yellow-striped border marker. Then they placed it on the ground while a dozen of the soldiers posed next to it, including one with belts of bullets draped over a shoulder. ""I'm very grateful to you, on behalf of all Ukrainians, on my behalf and on behalf of my family,"" Zelenskyy said in a video message. ""I'm very grateful to all the fighters like you."" The Ukrainian border service said the video showing the soldiers was from the border ""in the Kharkiv region,"" but would not elaborate, citing security reasons. It was not immediately possible to verify the exact location. CBS News' Patta and her team visited the town of Derhachi on Tuesday, which is about as close as the Russian ground forces got to Kharkiv — less than a mile away from Ukraine's second city. Despite their retreat, they can still inflict terrible damage. Mayor Vyacheslav Zadorenko told CBS News that a cultural center used as a distribution hub for humanitarian aid was hit twice in the past week alone. The situation remains critical in four nearby villages still under Russian control. ""They are 'liberating us from the Nazis,'' the mayor told Patta, mocking Vladimir Putin's excuse for the war in Ukraine, ""but in reality, they are 'liberating' us from the peaceful life we used to have."" That peace was still very much under threat on Tuesday. Patta and her team heard shelling throughout the morning. Proof that while Russia's forces may have been pushed back, it clearly wasn't far enough. Russia has been plagued by setbacks in the war, most glaringly in its failure early on to take the capital of Kyiv. Much of the fighting has shifted to the Donbas but also has turned into a slog, with both sides fighting village-by-village. Away from the battlefield, Sweden's decision to seek NATO membership followed a similar decision by neighboring Finland in a historic shift for the counties, which were non-aligned for generations. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said her country would be in a ""vulnerable position"" during the application period and urged her fellow citizens to brace themselves. ""Russia has said that it will take countermeasures if we join NATO,"" she said. ""We cannot rule out that Sweden will be exposed to, for instance, disinformation and attempts to intimidate and divide us."" But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a NATO member, ratcheted up his objection to their joining. He accused the countries of failing to take a ""clear"" stance against Kurdish militants and other groups that Ankara considers terrorists, and of imposing military sanctions on Turkey. He said Swedish and Finnish officials who are expected in Turkey next week should not bother to come if they intend to try to convince Turkey of dropping its objection. ""How can we trust them?"" Erdogan asked at a joint news conference with the visiting Algerian president. All 30 current NATO members must agree to let the Nordic neighbors join. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow ""does not have a problem"" with Sweden or Finland as they apply for NATO membership, but that ""the expansion of military infrastructure onto this territory will of course give rise to our reaction in response."" Putin launched the invasion on Feb. 24 in what he said was an effort to check NATO's expansion but has seen that strategy backfire. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said the membership process for both could be quick. Europe is also working to choke off funding for the Kremlin's war by reducing the billions of dollars it spends on imports of Russian energy. A proposed EU embargo faces opposition from some countries dependent on Russian imports, including Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Bulgaria also has reservations.",17,4.891244050717809,2.9831762333467227,1.9080678173710863,13
2022-05-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/finland-nato-russia-threats-sweden-membership-helsinki-nuclear-bunkers/,Russia's threats aren't scaring Finland or Sweden away from their NATO bids,"Helsinki, Finland — Despite repeated threats from Russia, Finland is poised to join the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. The historic move — set to be mirrored by Sweden — will effectively double the length of NATO's land border with Russia. The Finnish President and Prime Minister announced the Nordic nation's intention to join the bloc last week, calling it ""an historic day."" As CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab reports, Finland's membership bid has seen it ditch decades of neutrality in a dramatic move prompted directly by President Vladimir Putin's ongoing assault on Ukraine. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson echoed her neighbors' sentiments on Monday, telling Sweden's assembled lawmakers that the ""historic change in our country's security policy line"" was needed to secure ""formal security guarantees"" in the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine. Russia, and Putin in particular, has long considered NATO a threat. The Kremlin has defended its war in Ukraine partly as a means of pushing the Western alliance back further from its borders — a tactic which, given Finland and Sweden's accession bids, appears to have backfired spectacularly. Moscow threatened last week to react with unspecified ""military-technical measures"" should the Nordic states commit the ""grave mistake"" of joining NATO. The Kremlin warned that ""the general level of military tensions will increase"" in Europe if the alliance does expand on Russia's doorstep. Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her country would not be deterred by any Russian threats — even nuclear threats — and was instead being driven by them. ""I think that within NATO, it gives us security when it comes to nuclear, because NATO also has nuclear weapons,"" she said. Tyab said that while Russia's war on Ukraine triggered Finland's decision to join the military alliance, it was a much broader shift in public opinion in the country that made it politically possible. Before Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on February 24, only around 20% of Finns supported joining NATO. Now, about 75% do. Tomi Rask, with Finland's Civil Defense Department, gave Tyab a tour of a swimming center in the heart of Helsinki that doubles as a nuclear bomb shelter. He said it's one of 5,500 shelters in the capital city alone — enough space to protect more than 900,000 people. The shelters aren't new. They're a legacy of Soviet Russia's invasion of Finland in the early 1940s. Russia is a different country today, but its recent belligerence against neighbors has made some Finns glad to have the vestiges of the past still at their disposal. ""Finland has had its wars, so we know what war can do, and for that, we need to take all the measures to protect our citizens,"" Rask told CBS News. He said he's ""not afraid"" that Russia will bring another war to Finland's soil, he's ""just thinking there is a possibility,"" and it's ""better [to] be safe than sorry."" Rask said that just as Finns aren't afraid to venture out onto the roads in the Nordic winter thanks to traffic lights, winter tires and seat belts, they aren't afraid of a new war with Russia, because they're prepared. Joining NATO, the country's leaders and most of its people now believe, will make it even better prepared. U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was in Helsinki on Monday, welcoming the Finnish leaders' decision to seek membership in the alliance. ""Frankly, their participation strengthens the alliance,"" McConnell said. As Tyab reports, the speed with which Finland and Sweden are trying to join NATO is unprecedented. But the threat of an increasingly isolated and unpredictable Russia has leaders in both countries saying they've been left with little choice.",29,1.1807986121593552,1.2676654872052675,-0.08686687504591228,13
2022-05-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-nato-says-ukraine-can-win-this-war/,"NATO chief says Ukraine ""can win this war""","Almost three months after Russia shocked the world by invading Ukraine, its military faces a bogged-down war, the prospect of a bigger NATO and an opponent buoyed Sunday by wins on and off the battlefield. Top diplomats from NATO met in Berlin with the alliance's chief and declared that the war ""is not going as Moscow had planned."" ""Ukraine can win this war,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, adding that the alliance must continue to offer military support to Kyiv. He spoke by video link to the meeting as he recovers from a COVID-19 infection. On the diplomatic front, both Finland and Sweden took steps bringing them closer to NATO membership despite Russian objections. Finland announced Sunday that it was seeking to join NATO, citing how the invasion had changed Europe's security landscape. Several hours later, Sweden's governing party endorsed the country's own bid for membership, which could lead to an application in days. If the two nonaligned Nordic nations become part of the alliance, it would represent an affront to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has cited NATO's post-Cold War expansion in Eastern Europe as a threat to Russia. NATO says it is a purely defensive alliance. While Moscow lost ground on the diplomatic front, Russian forces also failed to make territorial gains in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine said it held off Russian offensives in the east, and Western military officials said the campaign Moscow launched there after its forces failed to seize the capital of Kyiv has slowed to a snail's pace. Ukraine, meanwhile, celebrated a morale-boosting victory in the Eurovision Song Contest. The folk-rap ensemble Kalush Orchestra won the glitzy pan-European competition with its song ""Stefania,"" which has become a popular anthem among Ukrainians during the war. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that his nation would claim the customary winner's honor of hosting the next annual competition. ""Step by step, we are forcing the occupiers to leave the Ukrainian land,"" Zelenskyy said. The band's frontman, Oleh Psiuk, said at a news conference Sunday that the musicians were ""ready to fight"" when they return home. Ukraine's government prohibits men between 18 and 60 from leaving the country, but the all-male band's six members received special permission to go to Italy to represent Ukraine in the contest. They will return to a country still fighting for survival. Russian and Ukrainian fighters are engaged in a grinding battle for the country's eastern industrial heartland, the Donbas. Ukraine's most experienced and best-equipped soldiers have fought Moscow-backed separatists in the east for eight years. Even with its setbacks, Russia continues to inflict death and destruction across Ukraine. Over the weekend, its forces hit a chemical plant and 11 high-rise buildings in Siverodonetsk, in the Donbas, the regional governor said. Gov. Serhii Haidaii said two people were killed in the shelling and warned residents still in the city to stay in underground shelters. Russian missiles destroyed ""military infrastructure facilities"" in the Yavoriv district of western Ukraine, near the border with Poland, the governor of the Lviv region said. Lviv is a major gateway for the Western-supplied weapons Ukraine has acquired during the war. The Ukrainian military said it held off a renewed Russian offensive in the Dontesk area of the Donbas. Russian troops also tried to advance near the eastern city of Izyum, but Ukrainian forces stopped them, the governor of Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Oleh Sinegubov, reported. The Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified, but Western officials also painted a somber picture for Russia. Britain's Defense Ministry said in its daily intelligence update that the Russian army had lost up to one-third of the combat strength it committed to Ukraine in late February and was failing to gain any substantial territory. ""Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days,"" the ministry said on Twitter. The assessments of Russia's war performance came as Russian troops retreated from around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which was a key military objective earlier in the war and was bombarded for weeks. The regional governor said there had been no shelling in the city for several days, though Russia continued to strike the wider Kharkiv region. One Ukrainian battalion that had been fighting in the region reached the border with Russia on Sunday and made a victorious video there addressed to Zelenskyy. In the video posted on Facebook by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, a dozen fighters stood around a blue-and-yellow post, Ukraine's colors. One explained that the unit went ""to the dividing line with the Russian Federation, the occupying country. Mr. President, we have reached it. We are here."" While he spoke, other fighters made victory signs and raised their fists. After failing to capture Kyiv, Putin shifted the invasion's focus to the Donbas, aiming to seize territory not already occupied by the Moscow-backed separatists. In the southern Donbas, the Azov Sea port of Mariupol is now largely under Russian control, except for a few hundred Ukrainian troops who have refused to surrender and remain holed up in the Azovstal steel factory. Many of their wives called on the global community to secure the release of ""the entire garrison,"" during an online news conference. The women painted a grim picture of the troops' situation, saying they suffered severe food, water and medicine shortages; untreated injuries were sometimes leading to sepsis. The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office said regional prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into Moscow's alleged use of restricted incendiary bombs at the steelworks. International law allows certain use of incendiary munitions but bars their use to directly target enemy personnel or civilians. Turkey's presidential spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said the country had offered to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers and civilians by ship from Azovstal, according to official state broadcaster TRT. The invasion of Ukraine has other countries along Russia's flank worried they could be next, including Finland, which shares both a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) land border and the Gulf of Finland with Russia. Putin told Finnish President Sauli Niinisto in a Saturday phone call that joining NATO would be an ""error."" In neighboring Sweden, after the ruling Social Democratic Party on Sunday backed plans to join NATO, the plan was to be discussed Monday in parliament, with an announcement by the Cabinet to follow. However, NATO operates by consensus, and the Nordic nations' potential bids were thrown into question over concerns from Turkey. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said he had discussed Turkey's concerns at the NATO meeting, especially Sweden and Finland's alleged support for Kurdish rebel groups and their restrictions on weapons sales to Turkey. But during a Sunday visit to Sweden, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Finland and Sweden would be ""important additions"" to NATO and that the U.S. should swiftly ratify their membership. McConnell is leading a delegation of GOP senators to the region. They made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday in a show of support.",14,2.9430388686355426,3.119303238551877,-0.1762643699163342,13

Russia has long bristled about NATO moving closer to its borders, so the developments will be sure to further anger Moscow. President Vladimir Putin has already warned his Finnish counterpart on Saturday that relations would be ""negatively affected."" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, speaking Sunday after top diplomats from the alliance's 30 member states met in Berlin, said the process for Finland and Sweden to join could be very quick. He also expressed his hope that Ukraine could win the war as Russian military advances appear to be faltering. In Finland, President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin confirmed earlier statements that their country would seek membership in NATO during a joint news conference at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki. The Nordic country, which was nonaligned before changing its stance on NATO, shares a long border with Russia. ""This is a historic day. A new era begins,"" Niinisto said. The Finnish Parliament is expected to endorse the decision in the coming days. A formal membership application will then be submitted to NATO headquarters in Brussels, most likely at some point next week. Sweden, also nonaligned, moved a step closer to applying for NATO membership after the governing Social Democratic party met Sunday and backed joining the trans-Atlantic alliance. The plan to join the alliance will be discussed in Sweden's parliament on Monday, and Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson's Cabinet will make an announcement later that day. ""Our 200-year-long standing policy of military nonalignment has served Sweden well,"" Andersson said during a news conference in Stockholm late Sunday. ""But the issue at hand is whether military nonalignment will keep serving us well?"" ""We're now facing a fundamentally changed security environment in Europe."" NATO's secretary-general, meanwhile, sought to highlight Russian setbacks, which he said may portend a victory for Ukraine. ""Russia's war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned,"" Stoltenberg said by video link to the NATO meeting in Berlin as he recovers from a COVID-19 infection."" ""They failed to take Kyiv. They are pulling back from around Kharkiv. Their major offensive in Donbas has stalled. Russia is not achieving its strategic objectives."" ""Ukraine can win this war,"" he said, adding that NATO must continue to step up its military support to the country. Sweden has also already taken steps toward joining the alliance, while Georgia's bid is again being discussed despite dire warnings from Moscow about the consequences if its neighbor becomes part of NATO. Nordic NATO member Norway said it strongly welcomed Finland's decision to seek membership. Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt described Helsinki's move as ""a turning point"" for the Nordic region's defense and security policies. ""Finnish membership in NATO will be good for Finland, good for the Nordic region, and good for NATO. Finland has Norway's full support,"" Huitfeldt said in comments emailed to The Associated Press. Huitfeldt said the Norwegian government would facilitate ""a swift consent to ratification by the Norwegian Parliament"" for Finland's accession into NATO. ""We are now seeing unprecedented unity in NATO. With the Finnish membership, we will further strengthen the Nordic flank of the military alliance,"" Huitfeldt said. Stoltenberg said he was confident the accession process for Finland and Sweden could be expedited. In the meantime, the alliance would increase its presence in the Baltic region to deter Russian threats, he said. ""All allies realize the historic magnitude of the moment,"" Stoltenberg added. That sentiment was echoed by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. ""Sweden and Finland, if you're ready, we're ready,"" she said. But NATO member Turkey has raised concerns about the two countries joining, alleging they support Kurdish militants that Ankara considers terrorists. The Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, has waged an insurgency against Turkey since 1984 and the conflict has killed tens of thousands of people. Turkey has also been infuriated by U.S. support for PKK-linked Syrian Kurdish militants to fight the Islamic State group. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu told reporters in Berlin that Finland and Sweden had also imposed restrictions on defense sales to Turkey that he called ""unacceptable."" ""It's not because we are against the expansion of NATO but because we believe countries who support terror and follow such policies against us should not be NATO allies,"" Çavuşoğlu said. However, Stoltenberg said his understanding is that Turkey aims not to keep Finland or Sweden out but rather to have its concerns addressed first. ""Turkey has made it clear that their intention is not to block membership,"" he said. Nonetheless, Turkey's raising of its grievances has led to concerns in Washington and Brussels that other NATO members might also use the admission process as a way to wring concessions from allies, possibly complicating and delaying accession. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who spoke with Çavuşoğlu and will see him again on the margins of a special U.N. Security Council meeting later this week in New York, declined to comment on those concerns. But he was optimistic that all NATO members would support bids from Finland and Sweden. ""I'm very confident that we will reach consensus,"" he said after the meeting in Berlin. On the sidelines of the Berlin meeting, Blinken met earlier Sunday with Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba to discuss the impact of the war and how to get Ukraine's grain to international markets Denmark's foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, dismissed suggestions that objections from Putin could hinder the alliance from letting in new members. ""We see now a world where the enemy of democracy number one is Putin and the thinking that he represents,"" Kofod said, adding that NATO would also stand with other countries, such as Georgia, which he said were being ""instrumentalized"" by Russia.",29,1.1806204414882226,8.876870154891146,-7.696249713402922,13

Eliot Higgins started Bellingcat in 2014. ""I was not someone with a professional background. I was doing this merely as a hobby,"" Higgins told Scott Pelley for a report this week on 60 Minutes. ""I was working for a company that housed refugees in the U.K. I then worked for a company that manufactured pipes. And then a company that manufactured lingerie. So, I had a wide range of experience but nothing that was directly related to conflict."" On his off-hours, the conflict in Syria fascinated Higgins—especially how social media was exposing atrocities there. But his search for the truth began with a fairytale. ""Bellingcat comes from the name of a fable, Belling the Cat. And it's about a group of mice who are very scared of a very large cat,"" Higgins said. ""So, they have a meeting, and they decide to put a bell on the cat's neck. But then they realize that no one knows how to do it, and no one is willing to volunteer to do it. So, what we're teaching people to do is bell the cat."" Higgins belled his first predator in 2014, when Russia went to war in eastern Ukraine. Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was high over Ukraine on its way to Asia when a missile brought it down. 298 were killed. Everyone denied responsibility, but Higgins noticed, in the hours before the shootdown, there were many social media posts from bystanders who saw a missile launcher on a flatbed trailer traveling in eastern Ukraine. ""We started discovering social media posts of people who had seen the missile launcher being transported,"" Higgins said. ""And we also had social media posts from people who said there's a rocket that's just been shot up from this direction. And we could actually use their social media profiles to figure out where they lived."" Other posts were written by Russian soldiers homesick for family. Higgins found clues in each image—billboards, buildings, road signs—that let him fix the location and time of each post. When he arranged all of the social media into a timeline, he could run the convoy backward to its starting point. ""Using all those videos we were able to trace it all the way back to the military brigade it came from, the 53rd Air Defense Brigade,"" Higgins said. ""In Russia. And we used their social media profiles, the soldiers, their family members and everyone around them to reconstruct basically their network online which meant we could get their names, their ranks, their photographs, see who was in that convoy and who traveled to the border. So that allowed us to prove that Russia provided the missile launcher that shot down MH-17."" The Dutch government would later indict four men, three Russians and a Ukrainian, for 298 counts of murder, basing some of its investigation on Bellingcat's work. After Bellingcat published its findings, Russia imposed a new law. ""The Russian government passed a specific law banning soldiers from carrying-- mobile devices during hostilities, which is dubbed in Russia 'the Bellingcat law.'"" Christo Grozev said. Grozev is executive director of Bellingcat, leading its 30 full-time researchers. His personal focus has been on Russian political assassinations. ""What we have found out is that none of these crimes could have been perpetrated without Vladimir Putin being-- in the know, and not only aware but approving of all of these crimes,"" Grozev said. ""So, in a nutshell, what we found out was that Putin is operating an industrial-scale assassination program on his own people."" Bellingcat's next big project, the Russian assassination program, started in 2018 after a Russian defector and his daughter, living in Britain, were poisoned with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent. The British had passport photos and false names of two suspects, but nothing else. Grozev knew that Russia's government and commercial records are for sale on an online black market. So, with the fake names, he bought the suspect's passport records. The numbers on the two passports were identical, except for the last digit. Grozev said that meant the passports were clearly made one after the other. Suspicious, Grozev started data mining. Based on official records, it seemed as though both men were born at the age of 32. And there was an unusual stamp on the passport documents. ""There was a big black stamp in the corner of their file which said, 'Do not provide information on this person. In case of a query, call this number,'"" Grozev said. ""And sure enough, we called that number, and it was the [Russian] Ministry of Defense."" When the Ministry of Defense answered, Grozev knew the would-be assassins were military intelligence agents. To match their faces to their true identities, he spent weeks combing yearbooks and photographs from Russian military academies. ""The end result was that we were able not only to identify the real identities and the affiliation to the military intelligence,"" Grozev said. ""We were able to find a third and a fourth member of the same kill team that the British did not even know about."" Over months, Grozev uncovered a network of Russian hitmen, working throughout Europe, armed with nerve agent from a government lab. Later, he uncovered another network, after buying airline manifests and finding some of the assassins' travel overlapped the campaign stops of Alexei Navalny, the top political opponent of Vladimir Putin. ""And we found a total of 66 overlaps, way beyond any statistical possibility for a coincidence,"" Grozev said. ""They'd been shadowing him for four years. They started shadowing him the moment he announced his presidential aspirations in 2017. Apparently being on standby for a possible assassination whenever they would get the signal."" A signal came in 2020. On a campaign trip, Navalny was poisoned with that same nerve agent. He recovered in a German hospital, returned to oppose Putin, and is now in prison. Bellingcat's investigation found assassins also tailed other Putin opponents. ""And we found, for example, that the team that had poisoned Navalny had tailed at a minimum 12 other opposition figures, three of whom had been killed, in fact, poisoned,"" Grozev said. Investigations like that are published on Bellingcat's website, which Russia blocked shortly after it invaded Ukraine. Bellingcat is a nonprofit foundation which has trained more than 4,000 journalists and war crime investigators in its techniques of geolocation, verification, and data mining.",3,9.467804586472349,1.7339632128900386,7.73384137358231,29
2022-05-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bellingcat-tiktok-ukraine-60-minutes-2022-05-15/,How Bellingcat is using TikTok to investigate the war in Ukraine - 60 Minutes,"Staff at the international collective Bellingcat is investigating allegations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine by using publicly available material on the internet — including photos and videos posted on social media. ""We are discovering the enormity of war for the first time in our lifetime in a way that is near us and a way that we can see it in social media, and Instagram, and TikTok videos,"" said Christo Grozev, Bellingcat's executive director. ""And the volume of war crimes that we believe we are discovering in our daily work is overwhelming."" Grozev told 60 Minutes more open-source information exists from the war in Ukraine than in any other previous war. In previous conflicts, such as the civil war in Syria, static photographs were more common and available than videos. New social media platforms, primarily TikTok, have changed that. Grozev estimates that about 70% of the evidence Bellingcat is gathering about the war in Ukraine now comes from TikTok content. According to Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, information from the video sharing platform began amassing prior to Russia's February invasion, when civilians posted TikTok videos of tanks driving down Russian streets. These videos not only showed the buildup before the invasion, Higgins said, but they also identified the specific units and equipment the Russian military planned to use. In instances where Bellingcat suspects Russians deployed cluster munitions into Ukraine from rocket launchers fired from inside Russia, Bellingcat says they can identify the units likely responsible. ""In some cases, it's actually possible to see these convoys through their entire journey from their base all the way to the border,"" Higgins said. ""So all these bits of information give us additional evidence that we can use for accountability purposes in the future."" To preserve the evidence of possible war crimes, the U.S. House Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees on Thursday sent letters to social media companies to urge them to archive the content on their platforms. Chairs of the two committees wrote to the CEOs of Meta, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok and asked that they preserve content, including metadata, that could potentially be used in international court to prove war crimes and human rights violations in Ukraine. Bellingcat has also used open-source evidence to dispel Russia's claim that potential war crimes committed in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha were perpetrated after Ukrainian forces had reentered the town. In one example, researchers at Bellingcat verified aerial video filmed by Ukraine's military reportedly on March 3, when Russian forces held Bucha. The video shows a woman walking a bicycle onto a street where a Russian armored vehicle sits. As the woman rounds the corner, the Russian vehicle fires at the woman. Another aerial video shot in late March by Ukrainian forces and verified by Bellingcat shows a body lying in the road at the location where the woman was shot. The Ukrainian military entered Bucha at the beginning of April. The Kremlin has responded to Bellingcat's investigations in the Ukraine war. In a statement earlier this month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""In general, the information of Bellingcat must be perceived through special filters: sometimes with a sense of humor, and sometimes as a deliberate lie and distortion of reality."" Russia's Prosecutor-General in mid-March blocked Bellingcat's website, preventing those in Russia from accessing the group's investigations, including research about Russia's assassination program. After all the evidence his team has found while looking into the atrocities Russia has allegedly committed, Higgins knows Bellingcat's work invites the potential for danger. ""It does involve risk,"" Higgins said. ""But then defending liberty, human rights, democracy involves taking risks. It's when we stop taking risks and we let the fear take hold that we see democracy die."" The video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer. It was edited by Will Croxton.",13,2.2449199037428142,8.018583091988484,-5.77366318824567,26
2022-05-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vladimir-putin-warns-finland-nato-membership-would-harm-relations/,Putin warns Finland NATO membership would harm relations,"Russian President Vladimir Putin warned his Finnish counterpart Saturday relations between the two neighbors could be ""negatively affected"" if Finland follows through with plans to apply for NATO membership. The Kremlin's press service said in a statement that Putin told Sauli Niinisto that Finland's abandonment ""of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland's security."" ""Such a change in the country's foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial,"" the statement added. The response came after Niinisto told Putin in a phone conversation that the militarily non-aligned Nordic country that has a complex history with its huge eastern neighbor ""will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days."" Niinisto's office said in a statement that the Finnish head of state told Putin how starkly Finland's security environment had changed after Moscow's February 24 invasion on Ukraine, and pointed to Russia's demands on Finland refraining from seeking membership to the 30 member-state Western military alliance. ""The discussion (with Putin) was straightforward and unambiguous and was held without exaggeration. Avoiding tensions was considered important,"" said Niinisto, Finland's president since 2012 and one of a handful of Western leaders who has been in regular dialogue with Putin over the past decade. Niinisto pointed out that he had already told Putin at their first meeting in 2012 that ""each independent nation would maximize its own security."" ""That is still the case. By joining NATO, Finland will strengthen its own security and assume its responsibilities. It is not something away from anybody,"" Niinisto said. Niinisto stressed that Finland, despite its likely future membership in NATO, wants to continue to deal with Russia bilaterally in ""practical issues generated by the border neighborhood"" and hopes to engage with Moscow ""in a professional manner."" According to the Kremlin statement, the two leaders also discussed Russia's military operation in Ukraine, and the possibility of achieving a political solution to the situation. Putin said negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv had been suspended due to Ukraine's ""lack of interest in a serious and constructive dialogue."" The phone call was conducted on Finland's initiative, Niinisto's office said. Finland shares a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Russia, the longest by any European Union member. Niinisto and Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin on Thursday jointly endorsed Finland's NATO bid and recommended that the country ""must apply for NATO membership without delay"" to guarantee the nation's security amid Russia's military maneuvers in Ukraine and Europe's changed geopolitical and security landscape. A formal announcement from Niinisto and Marin of Finland's intention to apply for NATO membership is expected on Sunday. Marin's governing Social Democratic Party approved the membership bid on Saturday, paving way for a parliamentary vote next week to endorse the move. It's expected to pass with overwhelming support. A formal membership application would then be submitted to NATO headquarters in Brussels. Neighboring Sweden is set to decide on its NATO stance on Sunday in a meeting of the governing Social Democratic Party led by Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson. U.S. President Joe Biden held a joint call Friday with both Niinisto and Andersson where, according to a White House statement, he ""underscored his support for NATO's Open Door policy and for the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy and security arrangements.""",29,8.886891643879665,0.16266706305739717,8.724224580822268,13
2022-05-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/finland-nato-russia-sweden-ukraine-united-states-vladimir-putin/,Russia fumes as Finland and Sweden push for NATO membership,"Senior Russian officials have slammed Finland's decision to seek membership in the NATO alliance — which came as a direct reaction to President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Finland's President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin both said on Thursday that their country should apply to join the transatlantic military bloc ""without delay."" Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde said Friday that her country would follow suit without delay, arguing that ""Swedish NATO membership would raise the threshold for military conflicts and thus have a conflict-preventing effect in northern Europe."" As Russian political analyst Fyodor Lukyanov said on his Telegram channel ""Russia in Global Affairs,"" Finland joining NATO would increase Russia's land border with NATO member states by around 800 miles. Putin has repeatedly cited the eastward expansion of NATO — which he calls a threat to Russian security — as one of the primary reasons for launching his war in Ukraine. Russia's Foreign Ministry quickly warned that if Finland was accepted into the alliance Moscow would be forced to respond, including with unspecified ""military-technical"" measures. ""Finland's accession to NATO will cause serious damage to bilateral Russian-Finnish relations and maintenance of stability and security in the Northern European region,"" the Foreign Ministry said. ""Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to neutralize the threats to its national security that arise from this."" On Friday, Putin assembled his Security Council, which includes his top intelligence chiefs and Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, to discuss ""the decisions of Finland and Sweden to join NATO and the resulting potential threats to Russia's security."" Moscow has not said exactly what steps it is prepared to take in response to a NATO expansion on its doorstep. But Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said that if Sweden and Finland join the bloc, it would turn them from neutral into enemy countries overnight and their territories could become a ""target"" for Russia. ""They know that the moment they become members of NATO, it will imply certain mirror moves on the Russian side,"" Polyanskiy said in an interview with the online news outlet UnHerd. ""If there are NATO detachments in those territories, these territories would become a target — or a possible target — for a strike."" ""NATO is a very unfriendly bloc to us — it is an enemy, and NATO itself admitted that Russia is an enemy. It means that Finland and Sweden, all of a sudden, instead of neutral countries, become part of the enemy and they bear all the risks,"" Polyanskiy said. Finland, with its long shared border with Russia, has historically maintained military neutrality. Its accession to NATO would signal a dramatic shift in the country's geopolitics. Putin's stated goal in the Ukraine war of halting the alliance's expansion is being upended by Sweden and Finland's bids for membership and has conversely prompted NATO to bolster its military infrastructure across Eastern Europe, pushing previously neutral countries to take a tough stance on Moscow. ""Both in [Russia's] foreign and domestic policy, the outlook is negative. In general, one can expect that Russia will now continue its aggressive rhetoric. This will be a big militarization of the Baltic and Arctic,"" political analyst Kirill Shamiev said in an interview with the Russian language outlet Meduza. ""There will be an increase in the number and technical strengthening of the ground forces in the Leningrad region, in Karelia, and the potential deployment of nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad,"" Shamiev said, referring to far-western Russian territories. ""In domestic politics,"" Shamiev said, ""the feeling of a surrounded fortress will intensify — that 'the Americans are even more encircling our country.'"" President Biden called the leaders of both Finland and Sweden on Friday. In a readout of the call, the White House said Mr. Biden ""underscored his support for NATO's Open Door policy and for the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements."" On Twitter, the Finnish president thanked Mr. Biden for ""all the necessary support from the U.S."" as his country heads for the ""next steps towards NATO membership."" But the two countries' NATO aspirations do not guarantee membership. NATO requires unanimous approval by all 30 of its members for any new country to be welcomed into the fold. Turkey is a NATO member, and its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has tread a very cautious line during the Ukraine war, positioning himself as a mediator between Russia and the Western powers. He said Friday that he did not have a ""positive opinion"" of the membership bids by Finland and Sweden.",29,0.34076272189391416,5.720951918319466,-5.380189196425552,13

The U.N. refugee agency reported the grim statistic, which, combined with the roughly 8 million Ukrainians who have been displaced within their country, means a third of Ukraine's people have been forced from their homes. The war's effect on Ukraine's youth has been particularly devastating, and Britain's U.N. ambassador said that appeared to extend to sexual violence committed against children by the invading forces. British Ambassador Barbara Woodward, citing the U.N. humanitarian agency, said at least 238 children were believed to be among the thousands of civilians killed since Russia launched its war, with 347 more injured. ""There are credible allegations of sexual violence against children by Russian forces,"" Woodward added. ""As others have said, mass displacement has left children exposed to human trafficking and sexual exploitation."" Last month, Ukrainian lawmaker Kira Rudyk told CBS News that sexual violence was being used systematically ""in all the areas that were occupied by the Russians."" ""Rape is used as a tool of war in Ukraine to break our spirits, to humiliate us and to show us that we can be helpless to protect our women and children and their bodies,"" Kira Rudyk, a member of Ukraine's Parliament, told CBS News. ""It is happening systematically in the occupied territories."" At the Security Council on Thursday, U.N. children's agency (UNICEF) Deputy Executive Director Omar said ""children and parents tell us of their 'living hell,' where they were forced to go hungry, drink from muddy puddles, and shelter from constant shelling and bombardments, dodging bombs, bullets and landmines as they fled."" He called the war ""a child protection and child rights crisis."" ""Children in Ukraine have been displaced, hurt, orphaned, or killed,"" U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Richard Mills told diplomats. ""Of the nearly 14 million people forced to flee their homes since the conflict escalated, approximately half are innocent children; children who deserve a chance to live, grow, and thrive, but instead, are struggling every day to survive in horrific circumstances."" Briefing diplomats at the Security Council, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator Joyce Msuya said ""civilians — particularly women and children — are paying the heaviest price"" in the war. Msuya said the situation was deeply worrying in the Luhansk region, in eastern Ukraine's industrial heartland of Donbas, where Russia is currently focusing its assault. She said there were an estimated 40,000 people cut off from electricity, water and gas supplies there alone. The U.N. Human Rights Council met in a special session in Geneva on Thursday, meanwhile, where High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said ""1,000 civilian bodies had been found in the Kyiv region alone... some had been killed in hostilities, but others appeared to have been summarily executed."" ""These killings of civilians often appeared to be intentional, carried out by snipers and soldiers. Civilians were killed when crossing the road or leaving their shelters to seek food and water. Others were killed as they fled in their vehicles,"" Bachelet said. CBS News partner network BBC News documented one such alleged killing on Thursday. The network obtained video from multiple security cameras around a business outside of Kyiv that appear to show several Russian soldiers shooting an unarmed civilian security guard in the back, and then looting the business. One of the soldiers is seen breaking a security camera with the butt of his rifle, apparently upon realizing that he and his colleagues' actions were being recorded.

In some of the latest, Ukrainian officials claim that Vladimir Putin's forces attacked two schools in the country's north, killing three people and wounded 12. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian commanders ""who give such orders"" were ""simply sick and incurable."" Those reports surfaced as the first trial of a Russian soldier accused of a war crime in Ukraine began on Thursday: Russian Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, stands accused of shooting a 62-year-old Ukrainian civilian man in the head in the northeastern village of Chupakhivka in the early days of the war. He faces up to life in prison if convicted. Journalists filed into a small courtroom in Kyiv on Friday as Shishimarin appeared in a glass defendant's cage. Shishimarin is part of a Russian tank unit that was captured by Ukrainian forces after being driven back by Ukrainian troops from north of the capital city just several days after the invasion began on February 24. He has admitted to shooting the man in the incident, which Ukrainian officials say was captured on video by the state Security Service. ""I was ordered to shoot,"" Shishimarin says in a confession video, which appeared to have been edited by Ukrainian authorities. ""I shot one (round) at him. He falls. And we kept on going."" Ukraine's national security service has called Shishimarin's video statement ""one of the first confessions of the enemy invaders."" But while one Russian soldier was being held to account, reports of atrocities continue to mount, and as CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reported on Friday, battles continue to rage across a vast swathe of eastern Ukraine. What Russia has lacked in military strategy so far, it makes up for with brute force, and a seemingly endless supply of deadly artillery. Zelenskyy said Russian shells rained down on two school buildings near the northern city of Chernihiv on Thursday night. ""What's the point of destroying schools?"" he asked in his nightly address to Ukraine's people. ""The Russian state is in such a state that any education only gets in its way."" In the southern port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian soldiers barricaded inside the Azovstal steel plant were astoundingly continuing to hold off Russian troops with every bit of reserve they have left. In the northeast, Ukraine's troops have steadily pushed Russia's forces back from the country's second largest city of Kharkiv. But for Ukraine's civilians, Patta says the 11 weeks of endless misery is taking a devastating toll. In the village of Stepanki, 52-year-old Olga Karpenko's daughter couldn't hide from the Russian tank that fired directly at her house. It hasn't been safe enough to remove her daughter's body from the rubble, leaving Karpenko to relive the trauma every day. ""She didn't die straight away,"" the bereaved mother said. ""She suffered for almost a whole day."" Where the brutality of Russia's war continues in the east, allegations of new atrocities continue to emerge.

The adviser, Petro Andriushchenko, said there were few apartment buildings left in Mariupol fit to live in after weeks of Russian bombardment, and very little food or drinking water. Andriushchenko said some residents who've remained in the city were cooperating with the Russian occupiers in exchange for food. Ukrainian officials say hundreds of troops remain holed-up in the decimated Azovstal steel plant — the last holdouts against Russia's complete takeover of the strategic city. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta met some of the wives, mothers and sisters of those troops as they gathered on Kyiv's central Maidan Square to beg the world to intervene. The families of the men in the Ukrainian regiment who've been barricaded under the Mariupol plant for two months, living under relentless Russian bombing, are demanding they be rescued. They know time is running out. Video from inside the plant makes it hard to imagine how anyone has survived there for this long. The Ukrainian government has offered to swap the soldiers, some of them badly injured, for Russian prisoners of war. The fighters, members of the Azov Regiment, are close to starving. Many have had limbs amputated by medics operating without proper supplies in the Soviet-era tunnels under the steelworks. Lilia Stupina told Patta that the world is not doing enough to rescue the fighters, including her husband Andrey, whom she met in high school. ""I will take a gun and go to Mariupol by myself,"" she told CBS News. ""I will do everything to save him."" Some of the Azov Regiment family members have launched a global campaign, pushing the West to intervene to allow their soldiers to escape the steel plant. Two wives, Kateryna Prokopenko, 27, and Yuliya Fedosiuk, 29, visited Pope Francis at the Vatican on Wednesday, with one urging the pontiff: ""Please don't let them die.""

But, village by village, Ukraine's defenders are pushing Russia's forces back from the northern outskirts of Kharkiv, toward the Russian border. As Vladimir Putin's troops retreat, they leave a trail of death and destruction in their wake. Countless Ukrainians have lost their homes, their hope — virtually everything but their lives. And thousands more have paid the ultimate price. The loved ones gathered Thursday on Maidan Square in Kyiv were desperate to prevent further losses.

In the Thursday speech, OSCE Ambassador Michael Carpenter said the U.S. believes Russian forces have ""relocated at least several thousand Ukrainians for processing"" in so-called ""filtration camps"" and have also moved ""at least tens of thousands more to Russia or Russia-controlled territory."" Carpenter's description of the detention centers included an explanation of why they're called filtration camps. ""Numerous eyewitness accounts indicate that 'filtering out' entails beating and torturing individuals to determine whether they owe even the slightest allegiance to the Ukrainian state,"" he said. ""According to these reports, those who are judged to have such an allegiance are transferred to the so-called 'Donetsk People's Republic,' where they face a dark fate."" Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, two regions that share a border with Russia, have seen a relentless military offensive, as troops tear through small towns en route to the strategic cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. Carpenter quoted a survivor of the Russian processing who said that those who did not pass the ""filtration"" process were shot. And he referred to satellite images that showed some of these makeshift encampments in southeastern Ukraine. ""Victims describe an invasive and humiliating process of inspection at these centers,"" he said. ""Russia's soldiers photograph victims from various angles, fingerprint and physically examine them for tattoos, inspect their cell phones and download their contacts and data onto devices, and record their biographic information in a variety of databases. Some victims report being interrogated by suspected Russian intelligence officials. In some cases, Russia's soldiers confiscated passports, identification documents, and cell phones altogether."" ""As Russia well knows, the forced displacement or transfer of civilians would contravene international humanitarian law – but as we have seen, the Kremlin treats international law with total contempt,"" he added. In his speech Thursday, Carpenter also decried Russia's ""vicious and brutal military campaign"" and said Russian forces are removing elected officials from local offices. He cited ""very credible"" reports that those officials are being ""kidnapped, interned, disappeared, and sometimes killed."" ""In their place, according to these reports, Russia is substituting its puppets and proxies, who, like their counterparts in the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk ""people's republics,"" operate in the style of a local mafia, relying on violence and terror,"" Carpenter said. He said the U.S. is particularly concerned about Kherson, where Russia has reportedly installed a pro-Russia ""puppet administration"" and mandated the use of the Russian currency, the ruble. Carpenter also said Russia's actions have ""increasingly indicated"" that Russia may move to annex the region. The news comes as Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers that the U.S. believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for ""a prolonged conflict in Ukraine."" Haines said Putin likely believes Russia has a ""greater ability and willingness to endure challenges"" than Ukraine — but also said that if his belief does not match the Russian army's capabilities, there's a risk of a ""more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory"" in the conflict.",13,6.439487866663211,4.298149709221794,2.1413381574414174,19
2022-05-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-putin-setbacks-kharkiv-donbas-cities-trench-warfare/,"As Russia faces apparent setbacks around Kharkiv, Ukraine's forces entrench in eastern cities and brace for battle","Slovyansk, eastern Ukraine — Ukrainian officials say Russia's invading forces have been suffering setbacks around the northeast city of Kharkiv. Video appears to show burnt-out Russian vehicles in the area, backing up President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's claim that his forces have managed to push Russian troops back from Ukraine's second-largest city. Drone video appears to show a Russian tank destroyed near Kharkiv. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata says Ukrainian soldiers who drove Russian forces out of areas northeast of the city found rows of bullet-riddled cars, scattered clothes, a baby's car seat and a stroller among other possible evidence of civilians being killed even as they tried to flee. The Ukrainian military — and Ukrainian civilians — have little defense against Russia's overwhelming firepower. As D'Agata reports, the Russians have made gains elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, where their brutal assault has been focused. Nadiya, who lives in the front-line town of Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region, said that when she and her husband found out where a recent airstrike had hit, they rushed to the neighborhood as fast as they could. They quickly found the bodies of their relatives. ""They were kind, very good people,"" she said. The Russian offensive in Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together form Ukraine's industrial Donbas region, has been relentless. Vladimir Putin's forces have flattened small towns in their march toward the strategic cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. But if and when they reach those cities, D'Agata says they will hit a major hurdle. Across a vast section of eastern Ukraine, the fight has become a bloody battle of trench warfare, and the country's defenders have dug in deep. D'Agata and his team found heavily-fortified cities protected by well-armed troops in seemingly endless bunkers, with concrete blocks and anti-tank defenses ringing the outskirts. Right in the center of Slovyansk, about 100 miles southeast of Kharkiv, D'Agata found Ukrainian troops ready and waiting for any Russian forces in vast network of trenches. The soldiers told CBS News that any Russian invaders would face guerrilla warfare at every turn. D'Agata asked Volodymyr Kutnenko, a medic who's been battling Russian separatists in the region since Putin last invaded in 2014, if he had treated any wounded Russian soldiers? ""Yes, yes,"" he said. ""We provide them with the full range of medical support, exchange them for our prisoners of war. But our prisoners of war are returned in a terrible medical condition."" As the ground war inches ever closer to the city, the soldiers told CBS News they know the most difficult days lie ahead.",14,2.8515355561538174,0.7217588673255331,2.1297766888282843,20
2022-05-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-us-says-putin-failing-odesa-missile-strikes/,Russian missiles pound Ukraine's port city of Odesa as dozens of bodies discovered in front-line town to the north,"Kyiv — Russia has stepped-up missile strikes on the vital port city of Odesa, with a Ukrainian thinktank saying the latest attacks include the use of hypersonic missiles. A local official said at least one person was killed and several wounded when the rockets slammed into a shopping mall and a warehouse in the southern coastal city on Monday. Russia has hammered Ukraine's southern Black Sea coast with missiles and artillery since President Vladimir Putin ordered his invasion on February 24. While his forces have now seized Mariupol, anther strategic port to the east of Odesa, an estimated 1,000 Ukrainian forces remain holed-up in tunnels under a sprawling steelworks there. An aide to Mariupol's mayor said Tuesday that about 100 civilians were still there, too, waiting for evacuation from the decimated plant. To the north, a local official near the battered city of Kharkiv said 44 bodies were discovered in the rubble of a residential building flattened by Russian bombs in March. ""This is another horrible war crime of the Russian occupiers against the civilian population!"" regional governor Oleh Synehubov said on social media. As CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports, the grim reality on the ground is completely detached from what Putin's government is telling the Russian people. While Putin attended jubilant ""Victory Day"" celebrations Monday in Moscow, which mark the former Soviet Union's role in defeating Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime in World War II, present-day Russia has nothing to celebrate about the war in Ukraine. Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Kristina Kvien told Patta bluntly that Putin's war is failing. ""It would be hard to find something that he could claim victory for,"" she told CBS News. ""Frankly, I haven't seen any clear victories at all in this war so far for President Putin."" No victories, perhaps, but Patta says the Russian leader's 76-day war has caused untold misery. Across the east and south of the country, his military continues to punish towns and villages for refusing to capitulate. The jagged remains of the shopping mall in Odesa are just the latest testament to the seemingly sadistic nature of Russia's assault. The city has been bracing for an all-out Russian attack for weeks but so far, Putin's war machine is keeping a distance. The horrors of the Russian leader's war of attrition extend hundreds of miles to the north, and all the way to the border with Russia in the east, with the worst of the fighting focused on the Donetsk and Luhansk breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine's Donbas. It's hard to believe that anyone or anything survived the devastation in the front-line village of Seversk, in Donetsk, where the ashes of Russia's onslaught were still smoldering this week. But an elderly pensioner said she had escaped heavy shelling over the weekend, laying flat on her bed and clinging to hope during the bombing raids. ""My son is dead,"" she wept. ""I have no one to protect me."" But for all the damage caused by its heavy artillery, Russia has become locked in a modern-day David versus Goliath battle, and it has suffered significant losses. Up north, Ukrainian forces have been pushing Russian troops back from Kharkiv, just as they did around Kyiv in April. People have been slowly returning to the capital, which Russia's ground forces never managed to penetrate. ""I've just returned to the house for the first time. It was a little emotional,"" said Ambassador Kvien, who was back in Kyiv after spending weeks further west — even outside of Ukraine — as the capital was deemed unsafe. ""It was really special to be back. I'm so happy to be here and see all my old friends."" And as Patta reports, the American diplomat is not alone. Amidst all the pain, there are occasional moments of joy, including a moment on Monday when a mother was reunited with her son after he spent 74 days fighting on the front lines.",17,1.5957124609573858,0.8145335069044077,0.7811789540529781,20

Russian forces are accused of striking the school — where dozens of civilians were sheltering — in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, which is bearing the brunt of Putin's war. The regional governor of Ukraine's Luhansk province said the school in the village of Bilohorivka was set alight by Saturday's bombing. He said rescue crews managed to save about 30 people, but dozens more were feared dead amid the debris as there were believed to be about 90 civilians taking shelter there when the building was hit. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, Russian forces continue to pummel front-line cities and towns across the two regions of the Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk. As the bombs continue to fall, many are already calling the attack on the school in Bilohorivka yet another war crime by Russian troops. The building was reduced to smoldering rubble after what Ukrainian authorities say was a direct hit. Terrified families were among those who had sought shelter from Russia's bombardment in the basement of the school. D'Agata says he and his team have found evidence of indiscriminate Russian shelling everywhere they've visited across eastern Ukraine. The battle-scarred village of Velyka Novosilka, which sits right on the warpath Russian forces advancing from the south, is no exception. A U.S. defense official tells CBS News that about 10,000 Russian troops are believed to be on the move north of Mariupol, massing on the outskirts of Velyka Novosilka which, judging from the heavy damage, has clearly come under repeated attack already. D'Agata came upon residents Iryna Ilyenko and her neighbor Valentyna Hadjynova surveying the ruins of their homes. Even as they looked at the damage, the crack of mortar fire and artillery echoed constantly around the village. Ilyenko told CBS News she couldn't leave her bedridden husband behind, so ""whatever God has prepared from me, let it be."" Northeast of the village, the city of Kramatorsk is also in the firing line. Residential neighborhoods there have already been devastated by Russian firepower. Walking through the ruins, D'Agata saw children's toys and other personal belongings — evidence of more lives torn apart by Putin's relentless drive to seize a vast chunk of eastern Ukraine for Russia. Ukraine's forces have managed to slow down Russia's ground offensive, but they've got little defense against Putin's artillery and airstrikes, and the intensity of Russia's bombardment has only worsened by the day.",17,0.33385222740093023,4.065625040423532,-3.7317728130226016,20
2022-05-08,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-bombs-school-bilohorivka/,Dozens feared dead after Russian bomb levels school in Ukraine,"Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine — Dozens of Ukrainians were feared dead Sunday after a Russian bomb destroyed a school sheltering about 90 people in the basement as Moscow's invading forces kept up their barrage of cities, towns and villages in eastern and southern Ukraine. The governor of Luhansk province, one of two areas that make up the eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas, said the school in the village of Bilohorivka caught fire after Saturday's bombing. Emergency crews found two bodies and rescued 30 people, he said. ""Most likely, all 60 people who remain under the rubble are now dead,"" Gov. Serhiy Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Russian shelling also killed two boys, ages 11 and 14, in the nearby town of Pryvillia, he said. Since failing to capture Ukraine's capital, Russia has focused its offensive in the Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014 and occupy some territory. The largest European conflict since World War II has developed into a punishing war of attrition due to the Ukrainian military's unexpectedly effective defense. To demonstrate success, the Russian military worked to complete its conquest of the besieged port city of Mariupol, which has been under relentless assault since the start of the war, in time for Victory Day celebrations on Monday. A sprawling seaside steel mill is the only part of the city not under Russian control. All the remaining women, children and older civilians who had been sheltering with Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal plant were evacuated Saturday. The troops still inside have refused to surrender; hundreds are believed to be wounded. After rescuers evacuated the last civilians Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address that the focus would turn to extracting the wounded and medics. Zelenskyy said in his nightly address that work would also continue Sunday on securing humanitarian corridors for residents of Mariupol and surrounding towns to leave. The Ukrainian government has been reaching out to international organizations to try to secure safe passage for the estimated 2,000 fighters remaining in the plant's underground tunnels and bunkers. Zelenskyy acknowledged the difficulty, but said: ""We are not losing hope, we are not stopping. Every day we are looking for some diplomatic option that might work."" The Ukrainian leader was expected to hold online talks Sunday with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, President Biden and leaders from other Group of Seven countries. The meeting is partly meant to display unity among Western allies on Victory in Europe Day, which marks Nazi Germany's 1945 surrender. Elsewhere on Ukraine's coast, explosions echoed again Sunday across the major Black Sea port of Odesa, which Russia struck with six cruise missiles on Saturday. Authorities offered no immediate damage reports. The Odesa city council said four of the missiles launched Saturday hit a furniture company, with the shock waves and debris badly damaging high-rise apartment buildings. The other two hit the Odesa airport, where a previous Russian attack destroyed the runway. Ukrainian leaders warned that attacks would only worsen in the lead-up to Victory Day. Russian President Vladimir Putin is believed to want to proclaim some kind of triumph in Ukraine when he addresses the troops on Red Square on Monday. In neighboring Moldova, Russian and separatists troops were on ""full alert,"" the Ukrainian military warned. The region has increasingly become a focus of worries that the conflict could expand beyond Ukraine's borders. Pro-Russian forces broke off the Transnistria section of Moldova in 1992, and Russian troops have been stationed there since, ostensibly as peacekeepers. Those forces are on ""full combat readiness,"" Ukraine said, without giving details on how it came to the assessment. Moscow has sought to sweep across southern Ukraine both to cut off the country from the Black Sea and to create a corridor to Transnistria. But it has struggled to achieve those objectives. In a sign of the dogged resistance that has sustained the fighting into its 11th week, Ukraine's military struck Russian positions on a Black Sea island that was captured in the war's first days and has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press showed Ukraine targeting Russian-held Snake Island in a bid to impede Russia's efforts to control the sea. A satellite image taken Sunday morning by Planet Labs PBC showed smoke rising from two sites on the island. On the island's southern edge, a fire smoked next to debris. That corresponded to a video released by the Ukrainian military showing a strike on a Russian helicopter that had flown to the island. A Planet Labs image from Saturday showed most of the island's buildings, as well as what appeared to be a Serna-class landing craft, destroyed by Ukrainian drone attacks. The most intense combat in recent days has taken place in eastern Ukraine. A Ukrainian counteroffensive near Kharkiv, a city in the northeast that is the country's second-largest, ""is making significant progress and will likely advance to the Russian border in the coming days or weeks,"" according to the Institute for the Study of War. The Washington-based think tank added that ""the Ukrainian counteroffensive demonstrates promising Ukrainian capabilities."" However, the Ukrainian army withdrew from Luhansk province's embattled city of Popasna, Haidai, the regional governor, said Sunday. In a video interview posted on his Telegram channel, Haidai said that Kyiv's troops had ""moved to stronger positions, which they had prepared ahead of time."" The Russia-backed rebels have established a breakaway region in Luhansk and neighboring Donetsk, which together make up the Donbas. Russia has targeted areas still under Ukrainian control. ""All free settlements in the Luhansk region are hot spots,"" Haidai said. ""Right now, there are shooting battles in (the villages) of Bilohorivka, Voivodivka and towards Popasna.""",17,1.8680110656274045,0.8446328474792855,1.023378218148119,17
2022-05-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ukraine-war-russia-destroys-bridges-massive-bombardments/,"""Massive bombardments"" in Ukraine as Russia blows up bridges to slow counter-offensive, officials say","Ukraine hoped to evacuate more civilians from a besieged Mariupol steel plant on Saturday as Russian forces unleased new bombardments across the country ahead of Victory Day festivities in Moscow. The Azovstal steel mill is the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the devastated port city and its fate has taken on a symbolic value in the broader battle unleashed by Russia's invasion. Ukraine's defense minister said Russian forces had resumed their assault on the site, despite earlier talk of a truce to allow trapped civilians to flee the complex. Vice Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said rescuers would try to evacuate more civilians on Saturday. Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive of their own. According to the defense ministry, Russian forces were forced to demolish three road bridges near Tsyrkuny and Ruski Tyshky outside Kharkiv, to slow the Ukrainian advance. According to British intelligence, Ukrainian forces equipped with high-end weaponry by the western allies, have been able to destroy at least one of Russia's most advanced tanks, the T-90M. On Monday, Moscow and President Vladimir Putin will celebrate the World War II Soviet victory over Nazi Germany with a traditional Victory Day parade. Russia's campaign in Ukraine has run into tough resistance -- and provoked Kyiv's western allies into slapping massive economic sanctions on the Russian economy and Putin's inner circle. But with Victory Day fast approaching, Ukrainian officials fear more intense missile and artillery bombardments and renewed assaults as Moscow scrambles for symbolic wins. The Ukrainian rescue service said a missile hit a technical college in Kostiantynivka, in the eastern region of Donetsk, causing a fire and at least two deaths. Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said there had been ""massive bombardments"" along the frontline. Strikes were also reported in the north of Ukraine near the city of Kharkiv and in the southern city of Mikoleyev, a key Russian target. As CBS News' senior foreign affairs correspondent and ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan reported, the ""war of attrition"" has begun in Ukraine, as Russian forces make a grinding push using heavy artillery shelling in the south and east of the country alongside deep strikes further west into Ukraine in an attempt to disrupt logistical supply lines used by the West. Predicting when the Russian offensive will end is very complicated, a European official in Washington told reporters. In the long term, Russian President Vladimir Putin's objective is to capture the broader Donbas region, where Ukrainians and Russians have been fighting since 2014, as well as the land bridge linking mainland Ukraine to Russian-occupied Crimea. However, Russian forces — pushing from the east, south, and from the north area of Izium, in eastern Ukraine, while using heavy artillery shelling — have still not made much progress on the ground, the European official said. ""The conflict in Ukraine is taking a heavy toll on some of Russia's most capable units and most advanced capabilities,"" U.K. Defense Intelligence said. ""It will take considerable time and expense for Russia to reconstitute its armed forces following this conflict,"" it said, warning sanctions on advanced components would make it harder for Russia to re-arm. The west, meanwhile, is stepping up arms deliveries to Ukraine's defenders. US President Joe Biden on Friday announced another package of military assistance worth $150 million, including counter-artillery radars used for detecting the source of enemy fire. This brings the total value of US weaponry sent to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began to $3.8 billion. Biden had urged Congress to approve a further $33 billion package, including $20 billion in military aid, ""to strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" The G7 leaders, including Biden, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky are to meet in videoconference on Sunday to discuss Western support for Kyiv. On Friday, Zelensky said ""diplomatic options"" were also under way to rescue Ukrainian soldiers from the Mariupol steelworks, as civilian evacuations continued. The Russian defence ministry said 50 people were evacuated from the site, including 11 children. It added they were handed over to the UN and Red Cross, which are assisting in the operation, and that the ""humanitarian operation"" would continue on Saturday. About 200 civilians, including children, are thought to be trapped in the tunnels and bunkers beneath Azovstal, along with Ukrainian soldiers making their last stand. Russia announced a day-time ceasefire at the plant for three days starting Thursday but the Ukrainian army said Russian ""assault operations"" had continued by ground and air. Ukraine's Azov battalion, leading the defense at Azovstal, said one Ukrainian fighter had been killed and six wounded when Russian forces opened fire during an attempt to evacuate people by car. Since failing to take Kyiv early on in the war, Russia has refocused its offensive on the south and east of Ukraine. Taking full control of Mariupol would allow Moscow to create a land bridge between the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, and separatist, pro-Russian regions in the east. In those regions, separatists said they had removed Ukrainian and English language traffic signs for Mariupol and replaced them with Russian ones. Locals want to see proof that ""Russia has come back here forever,"" said Denis Pushilin, head of the breakaway region of Donetsk. In neighboring Lugansk, Ukrainian officials said on Friday that Russian forces had almost encircled Severodonetsk -- the easternmost city still held by Kyiv -- and are trying to storm it. Kherson in the south remains the only significant city Russia has managed to capture since the war began. A senior official from the Russian parliament visiting the city on Friday also emphasized that Russia would remain in southern Ukraine ""forever"". ""There should be no doubt about this. There will be no return to the past,"" Andrey Turchak said. As European countries have sought to clamp down on Russian assets overseas, Italian authorities impounded a mega yacht as speculation swirled it might even belong to the Russian president. ""Scheherazade"" is worth an estimated $700 million. Financial police have been able to ""establish significant economic and business links"" between the owner and ""eminent people in the Russian government"".

2022-05-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-azovstal-dozens-more-civilians-rescued-from-ukrainian-steel-plant/,Dozens more civilians rescued from Ukrainian steel plant,"Dozens more civilians were rescued Friday from the tunnels under the besieged steel mill where Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol have been making their last stand to prevent Moscow's complete takeover of the strategically important port city. Russian and Ukrainian officials said 50 people were evacuated from the Azovstal plant and handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Russian military said the group included 11 children. Russian officials and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said evacuation efforts would continue Saturday. The latest evacuees were in addition to roughly 500 other civilians who got out of the plant and city in recent days. The fight for the last Ukrainian stronghold in a city reduced to ruins by the Russian onslaught appeared increasingly desperate amid growing speculation that President Vladimir Putin wants to finish the battle for Mariupol so he can present a triumph to the Russian people in time for Monday's Victory Day, the biggest patriotic holiday on the Russian calendar. As the holiday commemorating the Soviet Union's World War II victory over Nazi Germany approached, cities across Ukraine prepared for an expected increase in Russian attacks, and officials urged residents to heed air raid warnings. ""These symbolic dates are to the Russian aggressor like red to a bull,"" said Ukraine's first deputy interior minister, Yevhen Yenin. ""While the entire civilized world remembers the victims of terrible wars on these days, the Russian Federation wants parades and is preparing to dance over bones in Mariupol."" By Russia's most recent estimate, roughly 2,000 Ukrainian fighters are holed up in the vast maze of tunnels and bunkers beneath the Azovstal steelworks, and they have repeatedly refused to surrender. Ukrainian officials said before Friday's evacuations that a few hundred civilians were also trapped there, and fears for their safety have increased as the battle has grown fiercer in recent days. Kateryna Prokopenko, whose husband, Denys Prokopenko, commands the Azov Regiment troops inside the plant, issued a desperate plea to also spare the fighters. She said they would be willing to go to a third country to wait out the war but would never surrender to Russia because that would mean ""filtration camps, prison, torture and death."" If nothing is done to save her husband and his men, they will ""stand to the end without surrender,"" she told The Associated Press on Friday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ""influential states"" are involved in efforts to rescue the soldiers, although he did not mention any by name. ""We are also working on diplomatic options to save our troops who are still at Azovstal,"" he said in his nightly video address. U.N. officials have been tight-lipped about the civilian evacuation efforts, but it seemed likely that the latest evacuees would be taken to Zaporizhzhia, a Ukrainian-controlled city about 140 miles northwest of Mariupol where others who escaped the port city were brought. Some of the plant's previous evacuees spoke to the AP about the horrors of being surrounded by death in the moldy, underground bunker with little food and water, poor medical care and diminishing hope. Some said they felt guilty for leaving others behind. ""People literally rot like our jackets did,"" said 31-year-old Serhii Kuzmenko, who fled with his wife, 8-year-old daughter and four others from their bunker, where 30 others were left behind. ""They need our help badly. We need to get them out."" Fighters defending the plant said Friday on the Telegram messaging app that Russian troops had fired on an evacuation vehicle on the plant's grounds. They said the car was moving toward civilians when it was hit by shelling, and that one soldier was killed and six were wounded. Moscow did not immediately acknowledge renewed fighting there Friday. Russia took control of the rest of Mariupol after bombarding it for two months. Ahead of Victory Day, municipal workers and volunteers cleaned up what remains of the city, which had a prewar population of more than 400,000. Perhaps 100,000 civilians remain there with scarce supplies of food, water, electricity and heat. Bulldozers scooped up debris, and people swept streets against a backdrop of hollowed-out buildings. Russian flags were hoisted. The fall of Mariupol would deprive Ukraine of a vital port. It would also allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free some Russian troops to fight elsewhere in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that the Kremlin says is now its chief objective. Its capture also holds symbolic value since the city has been the scene of some of the worst suffering of the war and a surprisingly fierce resistance. While they pounded away at the plant, Russian forces struggled to make significant gains elsewhere, 10 weeks into a devastating war that has killed thousands of people, forced millions to flee the country and flattened large swaths of cities. Ukrainian officials said the risk of massive shelling increased ahead of Victory Day. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said authorities would reinforce street patrols in the capital. A curfew was going into effect in Ukraine's southern Odesa region, which was the target of two missile attacks Friday. The Ukrainian military's general staff said Friday that its forces repelled 11 attacks in the Donbas region and destroyed tanks and armored vehicles, further frustrating Putin's ambitions after his attempt to seize Kyiv. Russia made no acknowledgement of the losses. The Ukrainian army also said it made progress in the northeastern Kharkiv region, recapturing five villages and part of a sixth. Meanwhile, one person was reported dead and three more were wounded Friday as a result of Russian shelling in Lyman, a city in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region.",17,0.8378479164365061,1.3152004771627317,-0.47735256072622556,14

The Ukrainian troops holed-up at the plant are the last holdouts in a city Russia now controls. British intelligence suggests there's new urgency in Moscow for President Vladimir Putin's invading forces to seize the facility, for reasons of propaganda. A senior Red Cross official confirmed to CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata that another rescue operation was underway Friday. Between the relentless bombing raids on the besieged steelworks, rescue teams have somehow managed to evacuate almost 500 civilians over the last week or so in what the Red Cross official called a ""very difficult and dangerous operation."" The gun battles have continued, and a commander of the Russian-backed separatist forces in the region claimed the Ukrainian troops in the plant had run out of ammunition. He said his fighters would ""try to take it all"" by May 9. That's ""Victory Day,"" when Russia celebrates the defeat of Nazi Germany. Definitively conquering Mariupol ahead of that date would hand President Putin a badly needed war trophy. But as D'Agata reports, it would come at a horrific human cost. Survivors have described escaping from ""a living hell"" under the steelworks, and many carry deep psychological scars from the ordeal, International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman Chris Hanger told CBS News. He said when ICRC teams met some of the civilians who had made it out, ""they were obviously devastated that they had not seen the sky for over two months, and the moment they got out, they saw their city — their home — completely destroyed, so some people were asking for a priest. Some people were just crying, and some people were just silent."" Tetyana Trotsak, 25, cuddled her dog Daisy and marveled at ""the blue sky and the bright sun"" when she emerged. ""I hope there will never be any kind of booms here,"" she said, ""just fireworks and thunder."" Having survived the Russian onslaught in Bucha, Yana Melnychenko drove down to the southern city of Zaporizhzhia to meet her brother and mother, who fled from Azov, just north of Mariupol. D'Agata asked her brother Oleksiy about the conditions in the town. ""It was hard,"" he said. ""We didn't have water. No internet connection. We were hiding in the basement, and the Russians looted the supermarkets."" With the whole family back together and exchanging hugs, they said it was ""the best day."" But the whole region — a vast swathe of eastern Ukraine stretching from north to south — is bracing for much darker days to come.

Because of the station's position in its orbit relative to the Gulf of Mexico landing zone, the astronauts will have to spend nearly a full day cooped up inside the SpaceX capsule before they'll be in the right place, at the right time, to drop out of orbit on a trajectory to splashdown Friday at 12:43 a.m. SpaceX recovery crews will be standing by to haul the capsule aboard a company ship and help the returning astronauts get out for initial medical checks as they begin re-adapting to gravity after nearly six months in weightlessness. At splashdown, the crew will have completed 2,832 orbits covering 75 million miles. Monitoring the descent from the space station will be Soyuz cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov, along with SpaceX Crew-4 commander Lindgren, pilot Robert Hines, geologist-astronaut Jessica Watkins and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. ""It's been an interesting day for us, we've been flying around the station, collecting our last-minute photos or last minute items, and getting ready to come home,"" Marshburn said during a brief farewell ceremony Thursday. ""So a bit of a bittersweet day for all of us."" All four crew members thanked flight controllers, scientists and support personnel in the United States, Japan, Europe and Russia for providing around-the-clock assistance since their launch from the Kennedy Space Center on November 10. Said Barron: ""It's just been the honor of a lifetime to contribute to the legacy of this incredible vessel that's been up here for more than 20 years. And I think for all of us, it's really hard to leave (but) we're really looking forward to getting back to our families and our amazing support network on the ground."" Marshburn, commander of Expedition 67, then turned the outpost over to Artemyev, saying ""the lasting legacy of the space station is very likely to be international cooperation and a place of peace."" As one might expect, there was no mention of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and no signs of the international tension that now exists between Russia and its space station partners. ""So Oleg, you're a very strong and experienced cosmonaut,"" Marshburn said. ""I know I will be leaving the space station in good hands with you."" Artemyev, speaking in heavily accented English, thanked Marshburn and his crewmates for their friendship, accepting a symbolic ""key"" to the station. ""It was an unbelievable time together,"" he said. ""Tom, Kayla, Raja and Matthias... now brothers, sister. More important thing for us, for me, for Sergey, for Denis, is our family, our children, peace between our countries, our friendship. Thank you for friendship."" Artemyev, Matveev and Korsakov arrived at the space station aboard the Soyuz MS-21/67s spacecraft on March 18. Lindgren and the Crew-4 astronauts arrived April 27 and have spent the last several days learning the ins and outs of station operations from their Crew-3 colleagues. Shortly after undocking, the Crew-3 Dragon moved away for the space station with a series of thruster firings, culminating in a planned departure ""phasing burn"" just after 4 a.m. Thursday. After spending a final ""night"" in space, the crew will get up and rig their ship for re-entry. Jettisoning the Crew Dragon's no-longer-needed lower trunk section, the spacecraft will fire its braking thrusters for nearly eight minutes starting at 11:53 p.m. Thursday, slowing the ship just enough to drop the far side of its orbit into the atmosphere on a trajectory toward the Gulf of Mexico. A half hour later, the capsule will plunge back into the discernible atmosphere and eight minutes after that, the spacecraft's four main parachutes will deploy, lowering the Crew Dragon to a gentle splashdown at 12:43 a.m. Assuming an on-time landing, mission duration will be 176 days two hours and 40 minutes.",3,4.135195104041919,6.449011245341925,-2.3138161413000065,3
2022-05-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-of-attrition-begun/,"Russia and Ukraine's ""war of attrition"" has begun, says European official","The ""war of attrition"" has begun in Ukraine, as Russian forces make a grinding push using heavy artillery shelling in the south and east of the country alongside deep strikes further west into Ukraine in an attempt to disrupt logistical supply lines used by the West. Predicting when the Russian offensive will end is very complicated, a European official in Washington told reporters Thursday. In the long term, Russian President Vladimir Putin's objective is to capture the broader Donbas region, where Ukrainians and Russians have been fighting since 2014, as well as the land bridge linking mainland Ukraine to Russian-occupied Crimea. However, Russian forces — pushing from the east, south, and from the north area of Izium, in eastern Ukraine, while using heavy artillery shelling — have still not made much progress on the ground, the European official said. The remaining part of the Donbas that the Russians are trying to secure has complex terrain with substantially sized rivers and urban areas. If they succeed in securing and moving past the southern Kherson region, the Russians could push on to the port city of Odesa further west. But this is unlikely because it would require a complex amphibious operation, and Russia also does not have enough troops in place to expand to the southern coast, the official said. If logistical access for supplies isn't secured, troop morale will collapse, the official also pointed out. Russia has also been carrying out deep strikes beyond the line of contact to target resupply lines and western military assistance flowing into Ukraine, carrying out intense bombardment of storage facilities, bridges and railways, as well as missile strikes on power stations in the western city of Lviv on Tuesday. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Wednesday, with regard to Russia's most recent airstrikes, ""we are still assessing the degree to which they hit what they targeted. They are not good at precision strikes. They are not discriminate with how they target."" ""The Russians have not made the kind of progress in the Donbas and in the south that we believe they wanted to make. We do believe they're behind schedule,"" Kirby said. ""It's been slow, and at every turn they have met a stiff Ukrainian resistance. What we're focused on is making sure that that resistance stays as stiff as possible."" Other factors that may affect the duration of the war include morale, agility and intelligence, the European official said. It is difficult to assess the number of Russian casualties, but the European official suggested that Russia has suffered heavy losses during the war, with between 10,000 to 20,000 Russian soldiers killed so far, as well as thirty 30,000 wounded. Ukraine has not released an official death toll of its forces, though President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in mid-April that 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since Russia's invasion began. Ukrainian officials did not respond to a request by CBS for their latest figures. The European official also noted it is difficult to predict Russian President Vladimir Putin's mindset, pointing out that while he can stop his invasion of Ukraine at any moment, he has so far shown no willingness to end his campaign. Meanwhile, the Ukrainians have shown they are committed to defend every kilometer of their land. And as the war drags on, Russia will feel the economic effects of the sanctions, which is likely to have practical consequences for Putin's ambition. The Ukrainians, who are receiving a continuous supply of western security assistance, are agile in terms of their military movement, compared with the Russian's heavy and less mobile military, making it easier for the Ukrainians to target them according to this European official. It remains difficult to assess whether Russia is receiving military or security assistance from its allies including China. Ukraine has been able to kill a number of high-level Russian generals who have had to move to the frontlines deeper within the country to try unsnarl their forces' failure to progress. Intelligence from the U.S. and other countries has helped Ukraine achieve this, but it also has its own network of intelligence within its population for generating HUMINT (human intelligence) toward effectively informing their military operations, the European official said. A National Security Council official told CBS News Thursday, ""The United States provides battlefield intelligence to help the Ukrainians defend their country. We do not provide intelligence with the intent to kill Russian generals."" The U.S. assesses that Russia will try to forcibly annex the newly occupied Kherson region, along with the so-called ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk in the ""coming weeks or months,"" U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter said this week. Carpenter told State Department reporters Monday, ""We believe that the Kremlin may try to hold sham referenda, to try to add a veneer of democratic or electoral legitimacy"" in these regions. Russia is already switching the local schools to using the Russian curriculum, forcing civilians to use the ruble as currency, renaming towns and has cut off internet and cell phone transmission in those areas, Carpenter also said.

He said city officials had ""lost contact"" with Ukrainian forces inside the plant and had no way of knowing ""what's going on, whether they are safe or not"". The Ukrainian military said Tuesday that Russian forces had launched an offensive to rout troops inside Azovstal shortly after the United Nations and Red Cross confirmed that more than 100 civilians had been evacuated from the plant. Russia confirmed it was attacking Ukrainian positions at the plant with ""artillery and aircraft"" but earlier Wednesday the Kremlin denied Russia was storming Azovstal. Boichenko said Russia was attacking with heavy artillery, tanks and war planes, adding that war ships next to coastal steel works were also involved in the attack. ""There are local residents there, civilians, hundreds of them there. There are children waiting for rescue. There are more than 30 kids,"" the mayor said.

Whether the civilian infrastructure is being targeted or just hit by random fire, the effect is the same.

As CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reports, a ceasefire finally enabled the evacuation of about 100 civilians from tunnels under the Azovstal steel plant over the weekend. That first group — rescued after two months of relentless Russian shelling of the city and the plant — were still headed for safety in Ukrainian-held territory on Tuesday. It's estimated that about 100,000 people are still sheltering in basements and other hiding places around Mariupol. The strategic port city has been pummelled by Russian rockets and artillery since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on February 24. It is now controlled by the invading forces, with only a couple thousand members of the Ukrainian National Guard's Azov Regiment still holding out under the steel plant. With Russia, Ukraine and aid organizations reportedly negotiating to secure the evacuation of the remaining 200 civilians at the steelworks, Livesay said the shelling continued. After six weeks of war, weary residents like Tatyana no longer even flinch at the sound of exploding Russian bombs. She's watched as some 300,000 people have either escaped from the city, or died there. ""You wake up and cry, then you cry in the evening,"" she said. ""I have nowhere else to go."" In much of Russian-occupied Mariupol, the living have become the undertakers. Pharmacist Kristina Burdiuk, 25, said she was offered about $460 ""to sort through the rubble and take out the corpses."" To the north, in what is left of Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, 95-year-old Yefrosiniia Aksionova left her home for what she feared could be the last time. ""I want this Putin to be battered,"" she said through sobs, ""so he feels what we are going through."" Outgunned and outsized in its war with Russia, Livesay said Ukraine has compensated with heart, and creativity. The country has been unafraid to blow up its own bridges and roads - anything to slow down the Russian advance. Just outside Kyiv, that meant breaching a dam. Doing so inundated the nearby town of Demydiv, flooding homes, possessions and vehicles, but residents were happy to do it because they knew the Russians would have destroyed their town for them otherwise. The drastic measure helped stop Russian troops from reaching Kyiv. One resident, Vladimir, rowed Livesay and his team through the flooded town in a small boat. He said the Russians were stopped there, but a neighbor, Maria, shouted a warning to us in the boat: Some of the invaders' unexploded shells remain — including in her flooded vegetable garden, lurking invisibly under the murky water. Many of the shells did explode, however. Some tore into Maria's neighbor Valentina's house as her family of six hid in the basement, while it slowly filled with water from the breached dam. ""We had to climb out,"" Valentina told CBS News. ""But at the same time, the Russians had to retreat. This water saved us."" Ukraine's ingenuity on the battlefield is paying off. The Pentagon says Russia's invasion has shown ""minimal progress at best,"" suffering from ""poor command and control,"" and ""low morale."" But the fight is far from over. A senior U.S. diplomat said Monday that the U.S. believed Putin was planning to annex large swathes of eastern Ukraine — where the fighting continues to rage — this month, as he did eight years ago with the Crimean Peninsula. Michael Carpenter, U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the expectation was that Russia would orchestrate ""sham referenda"" in the two separatist-held regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which would see them accept Russian dominion. He called the predicted move ""straight out of the Kremlin's playbook,"" and said the U.S. and its allies would not recognize any further unilateral Russian annexations of Ukrainian territory. No Western nation has recognized Putin's claim over Crimea, despite Russia's undisputed control of the Ukrainian peninsula.",17,1.1286428188833928,0.7179058012409192,0.4107370176424736,20

Osnat Lubrani, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said that thanks to the evacuation effort over the weekend, 101 people — including women, the elderly, and 17 children, the youngest 6 months old — were able to emerge from the bunkers under the Azovstal steelworks and ""see the daylight after two months."" One evacuee said she went to sleep at the plant every night afraid she wouldn't wake up. ""You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing, shaking,"" 54-year-old Elina Tsybulchenko said upon arriving in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles northwest of Mariupol, in a convoy of buses and ambulances. She added: ""We were praying to God that missiles fly over our shelter, because if it hit the shelter, all of us would be done."" Evacuees, a few of whom were in tears, made their way from the buses into a tent offering some of the comforts long denied them during their weeks underground, including hot food, diapers and connections to the outside world. Mothers fed small children. Some of the evacuees browsed racks of donated clothing, including new underwear. The news for those left behind was more grim. Ukrainian commanders said Russian forces backed by tanks began storming the sprawling plant, which includes a maze of tunnels and bunkers spread out over 4 square miles. How many Ukrainian fighters were holed up inside was unclear, but the Russians put the number at about 2,000 in recent weeks, and 500 were reported to be wounded. A few hundred civilians also remained there, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. ""We'll do everything that's possible to repel the assault, but we're calling for urgent measures to evacuate the civilians that remain inside the plant and to bring them out safely,"" Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of Ukraine's Azov Regiment, said on the messaging app Telegram. He added that throughout the night, the plant was hit with naval artillery fire and airstrikes. Two civilian women were killed and 10 civilians wounded, he said. The U.N.'s Lubrani expressed hope for further evacuations but said none had been worked out. In other battlefield developments, Russian troops shelled a chemical plant in the eastern city of Avdiivka, killing at least 10 people, Donetsk regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. ""The Russians knew exactly where to aim — the workers just finished their shift and were waiting for a bus at a bus stop to take them home,"" Kyrylenko wrote in a Telegram post. ""Another cynical crime by Russians on our land."" Explosions were also heard in Lviv, in western Ukraine, near the Polish border. The strikes damaged three power substations, knocking out electricity in parts of the city and disrupting the water supply, and wounded two people, the mayor said. Lviv has been a gateway for NATO-supplied weapons and a haven for those fleeing the fighting in the east. A rocket also struck an infrastructure facility in a mountainous area in Transcarpathia, a region in far western Ukraine that borders Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, authorities said. There was no immediate word of any casualties. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian aircraft and artillery hit hundreds of targets in the past day, including troop strongholds, command posts, artillery positions, fuel and ammunition depots and radar equipment. Ukrainian authorities said the Russians also attacked at least a half-dozen railroad stations around the country. The assault on the Azovstal steelworks began almost two weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military not to storm the plant to finish off the defenders but to seal it off. The first — and so far only — civilians to be evacuated from the shattered plant got out during a brief cease-fire in an operation overseen by the U.N. and the Red Cross. At a reception center in Zaporizhzhia, stretchers and wheelchairs were lined up, and children's shoes and toys awaited the convoy. Medical and psychological teams were on standby. Some of the elderly evacuees appeared exhausted as they arrived. Some of the younger people, especially mothers comforting babies and other young children, appeared relieved. ""I'm very glad to be on Ukrainian soil,"" said a woman who gave only her first name, Anna, and arrived with two children, ages 1 and 9. ""We thought we wouldn't get out of there, frankly speaking."" A small group of women held up signs in English asking that fighters also be evacuated from the steel plant. The arrival of the evacuees was a rare piece of good news in the nearly 10-week conflict that has killed thousands, forced millions to flee the country, laid waste to towns and cities, and shifted the post-Cold War balance of power in Eastern Europe. ""Over the past days, traveling with the evacuees, I have heard mothers, children and frail grandparents speak about the trauma of living day after day under unrelenting heavy shelling and the fear of death, and with extreme lack of water, food and sanitation,"" Lubrani said. ""They spoke of the hell they have experienced."" In addition to the 101 people evacuated from the steelworks, 58 joined the convoy in a town on the outskirts of Mariupol, Lubrani said. About 30 people who left the plant decided to stay behind in Mariupol to try to find out whether their loved ones were alive, Lubrani said. A total of 127 evacuees arrived in Zaporizhzhia, she said. The Russian military said earlier that some of the evacuees chose to stay in areas held by pro-Moscow separatists. About a dozen people taken out in the convoy were sick or injured, none of them critically, according to Pascal Hundt, head of the Ukraine office of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Tsybulchenko rejected Russian allegations that the Ukrainian fighters wouldn't allow civilians to leave the plant. She said the Ukrainian military told civilians that they were free to go but would be risking their lives if they did so. ""We understood clearly that under these murder weapons, we wouldn't survive, we wouldn't manage to go anywhere,"" she said. Mariupol has come to symbolize the human misery inflicted by the war. The Russians' two-month siege of the strategic southern port has trapped civilians with little or no food, water, medicine or heat, as Moscow's forces pounded the city into rubble. The plant in particular has transfixed the outside world. Russian forces have also tried to overrun the frontline town of Lysychansk for weeks. As CBS News arrived, an artillery barrage echoed through deserted streets. With the Russians less than three miles away, only a handful of mostly elderly residents remain in the eastern town in desperate conditions. A Russian airstrike left a crater on the doorstep of an apartment block as people were taking shelter in the basement. Residents gathered water from a broken pipe. A resident named Vladymyr said he can't leave because his 84-year-old mother can't travel. His neighbor, Ludmilla, described explosions throughout the night that sent shards of glass flying. ""People who were able to, have left — those with kids,"" she said. ""We, the old ones, are staying here."" Despite Russia's tactics to bombard from a distance, its ground forces have so far made only modest gains. It's because Russian forces won't fight toe-to-toe with Ukrainian soldiers, Special Forces Major Oleksandr told CBS News. ""They're just burning everything to the ground,"" he said. After failing to take Kyiv in the early weeks of the war, Russia withdrew from around the capital and announced that its chief objective was the capture of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, known as the Donbas. Mariupol lies in the region, and its fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops for fighting elsewhere in the Donbas. But so far, Russia's troops and their allied separatist forces appear to have made only minor gains in the eastern offensive. Ukraine's resistance has been significantly bolstered by Western arms, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced 300 million pounds ($375 million) in new military aid, including radar, drones and armored vehicles. In a speech delivered remotely to Ukraine's parliament, he pronounced the battle Ukraine's ""finest hour,"" echoing the words of Winston Churchill during World War II. ""Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free,"" Johnson said.",17,0.7007825754186763,1.2509975387681744,-0.5502149633494982,14

Video posted online by Ukrainian forces showed elderly women and mothers with small children bundled in winter clothing being helped as they climbed a steep pile of debris from the sprawling Azovstal steel plant's rubble, and then eventually boarded a bus. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 100 civilians, primarily women and children, were expected to arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday. ""Today, for the first time in all the days of the war, this vitally needed (humanitarian) corridor has started working,"" he said in a pre-recorded address published on his Telegram messaging app channel. The Mariupol City Council said on Telegram that the evacuation of civilians from other parts of the city would begin Monday morning. People fleeing Russian-occupied areas in the past have described their vehicles being fired on, and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of shelling evacuation routes on which the two sides had agreed. Later Sunday, one of the plant's defenders said Russian forces resumed shelling the plant as soon as the evacuation of a group of civilians was completed. Denys Shlega, the commander of the 12th Operational Brigade of Ukraine's National Guard, said in a televised interview Sunday night that several hundred civilians remain trapped alongside nearly 500 wounded soldiers and ""numerous"" dead bodies. ""Several dozen small children are still in the bunkers underneath the plant,"" Shlega said. ""We need one or two more rounds of evacuation."" Sviastoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, which is helping defend the steel plant, told The Associated Press in an interview from Mariupol on Sunday that it has been difficult even to reach some of the wounded inside the plant. ""There's rubble. We have no special equipment. It`s hard for soldiers to pick up slabs weighing tons only with their arms,"" he said. ""We hear voices of people who are still alive"" inside shattered buildings. As many as 100,000 people may still be in blockaded Mariupol, including up to 1,000 civilians hunkered down with an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters beneath the Soviet-era steel plant — the only part of the city not occupied by the Russians. Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov, is a key target because of its strategic location near the Crimea Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. U.N. humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu said civilians who have been stranded for nearly two months at the plant would receive immediate humanitarian support, including psychological services, once they arrive in Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles (230 kilometers) northwest of Mariupol. Mariupol has seen some of the worst suffering. A maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian airstrike in the opening weeks of the war, and about 300 people were reported killed in the bombing of a theater where civilians were taking shelter. A Doctors Without Borders team was at a reception center for displaced people in Zaporizhzhia, in preparation for the U.N. convoy's arrival. Stress, exhaustion and low food supplies have likely weakened civilians trapped underground at the plant. Ukrainian regiment Deputy Commander Sviatoslav Palamar, meanwhile, called for the evacuation of wounded Ukrainian fighters as well as civilians. ""We don't know why they are not taken away, and their evacuation to the territory controlled by Ukraine is not being discussed,"" he said in a video posted Saturday on the regiment's Telegram channel. Video from inside the steel plant, shared with The Associated Press by two Ukrainian women who said their husbands were among the fighters refusing to surrender there, showed men with blood-stained bandages, open wounds or amputated limbs, including some that appeared gangrenous. The AP could not independently verify the location and date of the video, which the women said was taken last week. Meanwhile, Pelosi and other U.S. lawmakers visited Kyiv on Saturday. She is the most senior American lawmaker to travel to the country since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Her visit came just days after Russia launched rockets at the capital during a visit by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. Rep. Jason Crow, a U.S. Army veteran and a member of the House intelligence and armed services committees, said he came to Ukraine with three areas of focus: ""Weapons, weapons and weapons."" In his nightly televised address Sunday, Zelenskyy said more than 350,000 people had been evacuated from combat zones thanks to humanitarian corridors pre-agreed with Moscow since the start of Russia's invasion. ""The organization of humanitarian corridors is one of the elements of the negotiation process (with Russia), which is ongoing,"" he said. Zelenskyy also accused Moscow of waging ""a war of extermination,"" saying Russian shelling had hit food, grain and fertilizer warehouses, and residential neighborhoods in the Kharkiv, Donbas and other regions. ""What could be Russia's strategic success in this war? Honestly, I do not know. The ruined lives of people and the burned or stolen property will give nothing to Russia,"" he said. In Zaporizhzhia, residents ignored air raid sirens and warnings to shelter at home to visit cemeteries Sunday, when Ukrainians observe the Orthodox Christian day of the dead. ""If our dead could rise and see this, they would say, 'It's not possible, they're worse than the Germans,'"" Hennadiy Bondarenko, 61, said while marking the day with his family at a picnic table among the graves. ""All our dead would join the fighting, including the Cossacks."" Russian forces have embarked on a major military operation to seize significant parts of southern and eastern Ukraine following their failure to capture the capital, Kyiv. Russia's high-stakes offensive has Ukrainian forces fighting village-by-village and more civilians fleeing airstrikes and artillery shelling. Ukrainian intelligence officials accused Russian forces of seizing medical facilities to treat wounded Russian soldiers in several occupied towns, as well as ""destroying medical infrastructure, taking away equipment, and leaving the population without medical care."" Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in eastern Ukraine is difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Also, both Ukraine and Moscow-backed rebels have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone. But Western military analysts have suggested the offensive was going much slower than planned. So far, Russian troops and separatists appeared to have made only minor gains in the month since Moscow said it would focus its military strength in the east. Hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance has flowed into Ukraine since the war began, but Russia's vast armories mean Ukraine will continue to require huge amounts of support. With plenty of firepower still in reserve, Russia's offensive could intensify and overrun the Ukrainians. Overall the Russian army has an estimated 900,000 active-duty personnel, and a much larger air force and navy. In Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, an explosive device damaged a railway bridge Sunday, and a criminal investigation has been started, the region's government reported in a post on Telegram. Recent weeks have seen a number of fires and explosions in Russian regions near the border, including Kursk. An ammunition depot in the Belgorod region burned after explosions were heard, and authorities in the Voronezh region said an air defense system shot down a drone. An oil storage facility in Bryansk was engulfed by fire a week ago.",17,1.652512254066187,5.965140642861657,-4.312628388795471,14

Kozytskyy shared a videos and photos of Jolie — a special envoy to the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR — via Telegram. The governor said Jolie was ""very moved"" by the children's stories and that ""one girl was even able to privately tell Ms. Jolie about her dream."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the April 8 strike on the train station in eastern Ukraine amounted to another war crime for an international tribunal to consider. At least 52 people were killed. Jolie also visited a boarding school and spoke to students, promising to visit again, Kozytskyy said. She met with volunteers who provide medical and psychological assistance at the main railway station in Lviv. The governor said many people who saw the Hollywood star in Lviv couldn't believe it was her, ""But since February 24 [the start of the Russian invasion], Ukraine has show the world that we have a lot of incredible things."" Several people spotted Jolie when she was out in Lviv. One video from a bystander shows her visiting a cafe; another showed her speaking with Ukrainians on the street. Before becoming a special envoy representing UNHCR, Jolie served as a goodwill ambassador for the agency from 2001 to 2012 and has carried out nearly 60 field missions, according to the UN. In March, Jolie traveled to Yemen as a UNHCR special envoy, visiting a settlement where 130 families live after being displaced by the conflict there. ""Only 20 of them receiving any food aid at all — and then, it was only when funding is available,"" Jolie wrote in a statement about her visit. She also visited a school and another site for displaced families.

""Two Russian Raptor boats were destroyed at dawn today near Snake Island,"" Ukraine's defense ministry said in a statement distributed on social media. The defense ministry also released grainy black-and-white aerial footage showing an explosion on a small military vessel. ""The Bayraktars are working,"" Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, was cited as saying in the statement, referring to Turkish-made military drones. Raptor patrol boats can carry up to three crew and 20 personnel. They are usually equipped with machine guns and used in reconnaissance or landing operations. Snake Island became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance after a radio exchange went viral in which Ukrainian soldiers rebuffed demands from crew of a Russian warship to surrender. The Russian ship involved, the Moskva, sank in the Black Sea in mid-April following what Moscow said was an explosion on board. Ukraine said it had hit the warship with missiles. The reported drone strikes come more than two weeks after the Ukrainian military said that it had badly damaged one of Russia's most essential warships with a missile strike off Ukraine's battered southern coast. Meanwhile, a long-awaited effort to evacuate people from a steel plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol has begun, the International Committee on the Red Cross (ICRC) and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday. The operation to bring people out of the sprawling Azovstal steel plant was being done by the ICRC with the United Nations and in coordination with Ukrainian and Russian officials, an ICRC spokesperson told CBS News. Zelenskyy tweeted that the ""1st group of about 100 people is already heading to the controlled area,"" and said Ukrainian officials are ""working on the evacuation of other civilians from the plant.""",17,6.910319725462631,2.135239172935135,4.775080552527496,17

About 100 of the estimated 1,000 civilians who've been hiding out in the makeshift shelter during weeks of relentless Russian bombardment managed to escape on Sunday, officials said, and the ceasefire enabling those evacuations appeared to be holding. Ukraine's president said more than 100 civilians had been evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant and were due to arrive in Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia on Monday, with more evacuations planned. The civilians have been hiding in the Soviet-era tunnels under the plant along with about 2,000 Ukrainian forces — the last holdouts after Russia's devastating effort to completely capture the strategic port city of Mariupol. ""For the first time, there were two days of real ceasefire on this territory. More than 100 civilians have already been evacuated — women and children first of all,"" said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, they emerged as dazed survivors from beneath the rubble and remains of the pummeled plant. ""I can't believe it,"" said Natalia Usmanova as she stepped into the daylight on Sunday. ""Two months of darkness. We did not see any sunlight. We were so scared."" Families — many with children and even pets — are among those now headed for the relative safety of Ukrainian-held territory. D'Agata says that their rescue, after so many failed attempts, marks a significant achievement for both the United Nations and the Red Cross which spent weeks negotiating the humanitarian ceasefire. It has also raised some hope that lives can be saved in Ukraine, even from besieged cities like Mariupol. But D'Agata says that while the guns fell silent in the port city, fighting has continued to rage along the front-line battlefields of eastern Ukraine. A grinding Russian offensive there has forced the few remaining residents in towns like Lyman to flee. There, D'Agata and his team saw volunteers risking their own lives to save others. Right after the CBS News team left, a Russian airstrike destroyed a railway bridge leading out of the town. It was part of a wider campaign by Russia's military to try to stop more weapons from the U.S. and other Western nations from reaching the Ukrainian forces fighting on the front lines. As the fighting in the eastern Donbas regions escalates, however, there have been further indications that the war President Vladimir Putin started is extending beyond those front lines to Russian soil. Explosions were reported in the Russian border town of Belgorod, where social media video captured a military installation on fire. Russia's forces are also being targeted on the water. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said a new video showed its forces using drones to destroy two high-speed Russian patrol boats in the Black Sea. Ukraine's exhausted soldiers remain outnumbered and outgunned, however, and they can only hope the latest $33 billion worth of promised heavy weapons from America gets to them before the Russian military does.",17,3.1948854610418516,2.206153936365927,0.9887315246759245,20

Like other evacuations, success of the mission in Mariupol depended on Russia and its forces, deployed along a long series of checkpoints before reaching Ukrainian ones. Zaporizhzhia, a city about 141 miles northwest of Mariupol, is the destination of the evacuation effort. Zaporizhzhia was the destination of Mariupol residents who managed to flee the city on their own when previous Red Cross- and Ukrainian-organized evacuations had to be called off due to ongoing shelling or concerns about route safety. Zelenskyy tweeted that he planned to visit the city on Monday to greet the evacuees. The ICRC said the convoy to evacuate civilians started on Friday, travelling some 140 miles before reaching the plant in Mariupol on Saturday morning.

2022-05-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-pelley-ukraine-60-minutes-2022-05-01/,What Scott Pelley has seen in Ukraine - 60 Minutes,"This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley reported from Odesa, Ukraine, where he followed the efforts of the United Nations' World Food Programme. It is the latest trip Pelley has made to Ukraine to cover Russia's war there. Shortly before Pelley and the 60 Minutes team arrived in Odesa for this week's report, Russian forces had destroyed a residential building in the city. The missile strike, which killed eight people including a three-month-old infant, came the day before Eastern Orthodox Easter. Pelley met Odesa Mayor Gennadiy Trukhanov, who told Pelley that, because he had been born in the Soviet Union, he struggled to understand what Russia was doing now. ""I couldn't imagine that the Soviet people would do such a thing,"" Mayor Trukhanov told Pelley. ""But today I see what Russian soldiers are doing. Russian soldiers are raping our women today. Russian soldiers are killing children. Russian soldiers are killing defenseless civilians today. Therefore, we all understand today that we have no other chance but to resist aggression, to win, and to expel them from our land."" Across the border, many Russians seem unable — or unwilling — to fathom what their troops are doing in Ukraine. At one of the World Food Programme food distribution sites in Odesa, the 60 Minutes team met Hanna, a woman from Mariupol who told Pelley that her parents live in Russia. When she connects with them on the phone, she tries to explain to them what has been happening in Ukraine. ""When you tell them about the events, about what happened, they just don't get that information, or they don't want to hear the essence and understand that it's true,"" Hanna explained. What her family refuses to hear is that Russia has besieged her home, shelling it to ruin. The Associated Press has reported that Ukrainian officials say more than 100,000 civilians are still trapped in Mariupol, with little food, water, or heat. Although Odesa has not been hit as hard, Russia has still struck it with regularity. While Pelley and his team were on the ground, Russian missiles damaged a bridge across Dniester Estuary. According to Reuters, the bridge connects mainland Ukraine with the area of Odesa near the mouth of the Danube River and would give Ukraine a link to continue exporting goods if Russia blocks the Black Sea ports. On Saturday, a fresh Russian missile attack destroyed a runway at Odesa's airport. In his reporting throughout the country, Pelley said he has seen something that he has not seen in all his years covering conflicts around the world: the wholesale destruction of civilian neighborhoods. When he interviewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Kyiv compound in April, Pelley visited Bucha, the site of a Russian massacre of civilians. There, behind the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints, Pelley stood at the edge of a sandy trench, where he saw victims who had been hastily and incompletely buried ahead of Russia's retreat. ""It is the most shocking thing that I have ever seen in a war setting in my entire career,"" Pelley said. ""It is industrial madness."" The video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer. It was edited by Will Croxton and Robert Zimet.",17,3.367715722744127,4.3308901829030795,-0.9631744601589527,17

The United Nations continued trying to broker an evacuation of civilians from the increasingly hellish ruins of Mariupol, a southern port city that Russia has sought to capture since it invaded Ukraine more than nine weeks ago. Citizens are ""begging to get saved"" from a steel mill that has become Mariupol's last defense stronghold, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said Friday. ""There, it's not a matter of days. It's a matter of hours."" An estimated 2,000 fighters were holed up in the plant with about 1,000 civilians. Russian state media outlets reported Saturday that 25 civilians had been evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks, though there was no confirmation from the U.N. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said 19 adults and six children were brought out, but gave no further details. A top official with the Azov Regiment, the Ukrainian unit defending the plant, said 20 civilians were evacuated during a cease-fire, though it was not clear if he was referring to the same group as the Russian news reports. After two months of hellish resistance, video footage showed border guards singing the Ukrainian national anthem, barricaded inside the mill, CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesay reports. They're propped up by the love of their wives, now refugees in Rome, like Yulya, who has no hope in Russian promises for a safe evacuation. ""They are very bad people,"" she said. ""They lied, and no trust to Russia."" Video and images from inside the plant, shared with The Associated Press, showed unidentified men with stained bandages; others had open wounds or amputated limbs. Local media reports indicated that some of the soldiers still trapped inside the plant are suffering from gangrene. Two Ukrainian women whose husbands are members of the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard said they feared soldiers will be tortured and killed if left behind and captured by the Russians. They asked for a Dunkirk-style mission to evacuate the fighters, a reference to the World War II operation launched to rescue surrounded Allied troops in northern France. ""We can do this extraction operation ... which will save our soldiers, our civilians, our kids,"" Kateryna Prokopenko, 27, told AP. ""We need to do this right now, because people — every hour, every second — are dying."" Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in the east has been difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Both Ukraine and the Moscow-backed rebels fighting in the east also have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone. Numerically, Russia's military manpower vastly exceeds Ukraine's. In the days before the war began, Western intelligence estimated Russia had positioned near the border as many as 190,000 troops; Ukraine's standing military is about 200,000, spread throughout the country. But so far, Russia's troops and separatist forces appeared to have made only minor gains in the Donbas in the month since Moscow said it would focus its military strength in eastern Ukraine. In part because of the tenacity of the Ukrainian resistance, the U.S. believes the Russians are ""at least several days behind where they wanted to be"" as they try to encircle Ukrainian troops in the east, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the American military's assessment. The British Defense Ministry offered a similar assessment in its daily assessment of the war, saying it believes Russian forces in Ukraine are likely suffering from ""weakened morale,"" along with a lack of unit-level skills and ""inconsistent air support."" It did not say on what basis it made the evaluation. Despite the village-by-village nature of the fight to gain ground in the Donbas, Russia's promised offensive still could materialize. Overall, the Russian army has an estimated 900,000 active-duty personnel. Russia also has a much larger air force and navy than Ukraine and possesses tactical nuclear weapons. In Mariupol, around 100,000 people were believed to still be in the city with little food, water or medicine. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the organization was negotiating with authorities in Moscow and Kyiv to create the conditions for safe passage. Ukraine has blamed the failure of numerous previous evacuation attempts on continued Russian shelling. For those who are in the Soviet-era Azovstal steel plant, a vast underground network of tunnels and bunkers has provided safety from airstrikes. But the situation has grown more dire after the Russians dropped ""bunker busters"" and other bombs on the plant, the mayor said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV that the real problem is that ""humanitarian corridors are being ignored by Ukrainian ultra-nationals."" Moscow has repeatedly claimed right-wing Ukrainians were thwarting evacuation efforts and using civilians as human shields. The claims have not been verified. The Azov Regiment helping to defend the steel plant has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed in 2014 by far-right activists at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. In further comments published Saturday by Xinhua, Lavrov said Russia has evacuated over 1 million people from Ukraine since the war began, including more than 300 Chinese civilians. The foreign minister offered no evidence to support his claim in the interview. Ukraine has accused Moscow of forcefully sending Ukrainians out of the country. Lavrov also partly blamed the lack of progress in discussions to end the war on ""the bellicose rhetoric and inflammatory actions of Western supporters of the Kyiv regime."" Russian state TV nightly features guests suggesting Moscow use nuclear weapons in the conflict. Russia also recently unveiled a new nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile. Marko Suprun, an expert on Russian propaganda, told CBS News' Chris Livesay that the treat of using nuclear weapons is a psychological ploy meant to keep the U.S. and other allies from aiding Ukraine. ""Letting Russia decide whether or not you're going to arm Ukraine because they have nuclear weapons, that's already a win of Russian disinformation, because you've convinced them of your greatness,"" Suprun said. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to destroy the Donbas and all who live there. The constant attacks ""show that Russia wants to empty this territory of all people,"" he said. ""If the Russian invaders are able to realize their plans even partially, then they have enough artillery and aircraft to turn the entire Donbas into stones, as they did with Mariupol,"" Zelenskyy said. In a neighborhood on the outskirts of Kharkiv that is regularly shelled by Russian forces, some residents remained in their apartments even though the buildings have charred gaping holes. There is no running water or electricity, so they gather outside to cook on an open flame. Ukrainian reservists staying in a neighborhood cellar said the Russians have hit the buildings with rockets, artillery and tank fire. ""A tank can come at a short distance and fire all of its ammunition on residential areas. It doesn't care where. And it's impossible to figure out where it will fire,"" said Vladislav, who like others in the unit would only give his first name. Another reservist, who goes by the nickname Malysh, expressed frustration that he wasn't able to do more to stop the Russian advance. ""I took up arms, but unfortunately I can't catch flying missiles with my bare hands and throw them back,"" he said. In the nearby village of Ruska Lozava, hundreds of people were evacuated after Ukrainian forces retook the city from Russian occupiers, according to the regional governor. Those who fled to Kharkiv spoke of dire conditions under the Russians, with little water or food and no electricity. ""We were hiding in the basement. It was horror. The basement was shaking from the explosions. We were screaming, we were crying and we were praying to God,"" resident Ludmila Bocharnikova said.",17,2.6045240036629558,1.0746101956018157,1.52991380806114,14
2022-04-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-zelenskyy-kyiv-attack-guterres/,Zelenskyy denounces Russian attack on Kyiv during U.N. chief's visit,"Kyiv, Ukraine — Ukraine's leader accused Russia of trying to humiliate the United Nations by raining missiles on Kyiv during a visit by Secretary-General António Guterres, an attack that shattered the capital's tentative return to normality as the focus of the war moved east. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's forces were holding off Russia's attempted advance in the south and east, as efforts continued to secure safe passage for residents of the key coastal city of Mariupol, which has been largely reduced to rubble in a 2-month-long siege. Hundreds of soldiers and civilians, many of them wounded, continue to resist bombardment inside a steel mill in Mariupol, CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reports. Russia pounded targets all over Ukraine on Thursday, including the attack on Kyiv that struck a residential high-rise and another building. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday that one body was found in the rubble of the attack. Ten people were wounded, including at least one who lost a leg, according to Ukraine's emergency services. Moscow said it used ""high-precision, long-range air-based weapons"" in the attack, according to Agence France-Presse. In an apparent reference to the same strike, Russia's Defense Ministry said Friday that it had destroyed ""production buildings"" at the Artem defense factory in Kyiv. U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty said Friday that one of its producers, Vera Gyrych, was killed when a Russian missile hit her house during Thursday's attack on Kyiv, AFP reports. The boldest Russian bombardment of the capital since Moscow's forces retreated weeks ago came barely an hour after Zelenskyy held a news conference with Guterres, who toured some of the destruction in and around Kyiv and condemned attacks on civilians. ""This says a lot about Russia's true attitude towards global institutions, about attempts of Russian authorities to humiliate the U.N. and everything that the organization represents,"" Zelenskyy said in an overnight video address to the nation. ""Therefore, it requires corresponding powerful reaction."" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko derided the attack as equivalent to Russian President Vladimir Putin showing Guterres ""his middle finger."" Meanwhile, AFP says the president of the host nation of this fall's G20 summit, Indonesia's Joko Widodo, said Friday he'd invited Zelenskyy to attend, confirming earlier word from Zelenskyy along those lines. It was unclear whether he would. Widodo said Russian President Vladimir Putin has confirmed that he'll be there. Russia is a G20 member. Ukraine isn't. One aim of Guterres' visit to Kyiv was to secure the evacuation of people from the ruined southern port city of Mariupol, including a shattered steelworks where Ukrainian defenders are holed up and hundreds of civilians are also sheltering, It was unclear whether it had borne fruit. Previous evacuation attempts have collapsed. But Zelenskyy's office said plans were in place yet again for an evacuation of civilians from the plant Friday, AFP reports. Mariupol has seen some of the most dramatic suffering of the war. Under siege since the early days of the invasion, many of its residents became trapped with scarce access to food, water, medicine or electricity. An estimated 100,000 people are believed to still be in the city, and the city council warned Thursday that a lack of safe drinking water or a working sewer system could lead to outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and dysentery. It added that bodies were decaying under the rubble. Russian forces largely control the city, but some 2,000 Ukrainian fighters are holed up at the steel plant, the last known pocket of resistance. About 1,000 civilians are with them, and the fighters said recent concentrated bombings killed and wounded people. Video posted online by Ukraine's Azov Regiment inside the steel plant showed people combing through the rubble to remove the dead and help the wounded. The regiment said the Russians hit an improvised underground hospital and its operating room, killing an unspecified number of people. The video couldn't be independently verified. The governor of Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said two towns there were hit by Russian Grad rockets on Friday. There was no immediate word on casualties or damage. Separately, the governor of Russia's Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said a border post came under mortar fire from Ukraine and that Russian border forces returned fire. He said there were no casualties on the Russian side. That came a day after explosions were reported across the country - in Polonne in the west, Chernihiv in the north near the border with Belarus, and Fastiv, a large railway hub southwest of the capital. The mayor of Odesa, in southern Ukraine, said rockets were intercepted by air defenses. Ukrainian authorities also reported intense Russian fire in the Donbas - the eastern industrial heartland that the Kremlin says is its main objective - and near Kharkiv, a northeastern city outside the Donbas that is seen as key to the offensive. In Kyiv, explosions shook the city and flames poured out the windows of the residential high-rise and another building. The capital had been relatively unscathed in recent weeks since Moscow refocused its efforts on seizing all of the Donbas. The explosions in northwestern Kyiv's Shevchenkivsky district came as residents have been increasingly returning to the city. Cafes and other businesses have reopened, and a growing numbers of people have been out and about, enjoying the spring weather. On his visit to Ukraine, Guterres surveyed the destruction in small towns outside the capital that saw some of the worst horrors of the first onslaught of the war. He condemned the atrocities committed in towns like Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found after Russia withdrew in early April in the face of unexpectedly stiff resistance. ""Wherever there is a war, the highest price is paid by civilians,"" the U.N. chief lamented. On Friday, the secretary general's spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, spoke with Mola Lenghi and Michelle Miller from Rzeszow, Poland. Dujarric said that Guterres' meeting with Zelenskyy in Kyiv lasted an hour and a half and he told the president that the U.N. was scaling up humanitarian aid and they also discussed how to get a civilians out of the steel plant in Mariupol. ""We have condemned and will continue to condemn these missile strikes on what is or apparently is pretty clearly, civilian infrastructure,"" Dujarric said. On the meeting of Guterres with Putin earlier in the week, Dujarric said, ""There was a agreement in principle from the Russian Federation, that the U.N. would work with the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Russia and Ukraine"" to evacuate civilians from the steel plant. ""But let's be clear, a meeting is not going to end with this conflict, meetings are not ending this conflict. What will end this conflict is when Russia decides to end this conflict,"" he said. ""What we saw firsthand yesterday was the devastation, the heartbreaking devastation of just a few villages around Kyiv.""

2022-04-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-behind-goal/,"Russians are several days behind their goal in Ukraine, Pentagon assesses","The Pentagon assesses that Russian forces are several days behind where they wanted to be at this point in eastern Ukraine, according to a senior defense official. The Russians expected to be farther along in their goal to trap Ukrainian troops in the east and thought this would be accomplished by now, according to Pentagon assessments. They are ""nowhere close"" to their goal of totally encircling Ukrainian forces, the official said. Russian forces have been making slow, uneven and incremental progress in east and south Ukraine, according to the official, in part, because they're wary of outrunning supply lines, as they did in northern Ukraine at the start of the invasion and also because of the effectiveness of Ukrainian resistance. ""They're not moving very fast,"" the official said. ""A few kilometers a day is about the most they can handle."" The Russians have now committed 92 battalion tactical groups, generally made up of 800 to 1,000 troops, to the fight in Ukraine. The official warned that though the Russians have a numeric advantage over the Ukrianians, the fighting in the Donbas could be a long slog, since both sides know the terrain and both sides are utilizing long-range artillery in the fight. In the east, the Russians are focusing on moving out from Izyum along three main axes - southwest towards Dobropillya, slightly southeast towards Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, and farther southeast toward Lyman. The Russians are also trying to push toward Lyman from an eastern town they control, Kremmina. About a dozen Russian battalion tactical groups have been in and around Mariupol, but some of them have started this week to move north towards the Zaporizhzhia oblast. The Russians continue to strike Mariupol from the air, which indicates they don't control the city yet. The Russians have been conducting limited offensives in the east at the same time they're conducting what the Pentagon calls ""shaping operations"" to prepare for a larger offensive. Russia initially invaded Ukraine on a number of axes and have now focused on the smaller geographic area of the Donbas where Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting Russian-backed separatists since 2014. With the shift to the east, the U.S. and NATO allies have started giving Ukraine heavier weapons like artillery in advance of an expected prolonged battle. So far, more than 60% of the 90 U.S. provided howitzers have made it into Ukrainian hands, according to the Pentagon. Once weapons enter Ukraine, the U.S. does not track them, so it is unclear if the howitzer artillery pieces have made it to the frontlines in the Donbas region yet. The howitzers are new to the Ukrainian armed forces and require some training. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced Friday that some Ukrainians are receiving training on the howitzers and other systems at U.S. military installations in Germany. One hundred-sixty members of the Florida National Guard had been training Ukrainian soldiers in Ukraine before leaving in early February ahead of the invasion, and now, they are conducting most of the training on the systems, according to Kirby. All of the training is taking place outside of Ukraine. There were emotional moments between the guardsmen and some of the Ukrainian soldiers during their recent reunion because of the bonds formed before the invasion, Kirby said. The artillery pieces and other equipment announced in recent assistance packages are geared to what the Ukrainians have requested, in anticipation of an intense battle in the east.",14,3.8646087475366304,2.572624610980137,1.2919841365564935,12

At least one person was killed and several were injured in the attack on Kyiv, including some who were trapped in the rubble when two buildings were hit, rescue officials said. The bombardment came barely an hour after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a news conference with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who said Ukraine has become ""an epicenter of unbearable heartache and pain."" A spokesperson said Guterres and his team were safe. One of several Russian missiles that hit Kyiv struck near the hotel where the U.N. chief is staying, the secretary-general's spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, told CBS News correspondent Pamela Falk, although the U.N. delegation was meeting with the prime minister in his office and were not in the hotel at the time. ""I was shocked to be informed that two rockets have exploded in the city where I am,"" Gutteres was quoted as telling the BBC. ""So this is a dramatic war, and we absolutely need to end this war and we absolutely need to have a solution for this war."" Ukraine's defense minister said in a tweet, ""This is an attack on the security of the Secretary General and on world security!"" Guterres' visit came two days after he met one-on-one with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Meanwhile, explosions were reported across the country, in Polonne in the west, Chernihiv near the border with Belarus, and Fastiv, a large railway hub southwest of the capital. The mayor of Odesa in southern Ukraine said rockets were intercepted by air defenses. Ukrainian authorities also reported intense Russian fire in the Donbas — the eastern industrial heartland that the Kremlin says is its main objective — and near Kharkiv, a northeastern city outside the Donbas that is seen as key to the offensive. In the ruined southern port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian fighters holed up in the steel plant that represents the last pocket of resistance said concentrated bombing overnight killed and wounded more people. And authorities warned that a lack of safe drinking water inside the city could lead to outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and dysentery. In Zaporizhzhia, a crucial way station for tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Mariupol, an 11-year-old boy was among at least three people wounded in a rocket attack that authorities said was the first to hit a residential area in the southern city since the war began. Shards of glass cut the boy's leg to the bone. Vadym Vodostoyev, the boy's father, said: ""It just takes one second and you're left with nothing."" The fresh attacks came as Guterres surveyed the destruction in small towns outside the capital that saw some of the worst horrors of the first onslaught of the war. He condemned the atrocities committed in towns like Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found after Russia withdrew in early April in the face of unexpectedly stiff resistance. ""Wherever there is a war, the highest price is paid by civilians,"" the U.N. chief lamented. After visiting the town of Borodianka, he told local press, ""The war is an absurdity in the 21st century. The war is evil. And when one sees these situations our heart, of course, stays with the victims."" Separately, Ukraine's prosecutor accused 10 Russian soldiers of being ""involved in the torture of peaceful people"" in Bucha. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova did not say her office had filed criminal charges, and she appealed to the public for help in gathering evidence. Russia denies it targets civilians. In the attack on Kyiv, explosions shook the city and flames poured out of windows in at least two buildings — including one residential one — in the capital, which has been relatively unscathed in recent weeks. Plumes of smoke could be seen over the city. The explosions in northwest Kyiv's Shevchenkivsky district came as residents have been increasingly returning to the city. Cafes and other businesses have reopened, and a growing numbers of people have been out and about, enjoying the spring weather. Getting a full picture of the unfolding battle in the east has been difficult because airstrikes and artillery barrages have made it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around. Several journalists have been killed in the war, now in its third month. Also, both Ukraine and the Moscow-backed rebels fighting in the east have introduced tight restrictions on reporting from the combat zone. Western officials say the Kremlin's apparent goal is to take the Donbas by encircling and crushing Ukrainian forces from the north, south and east. But so far, Russia's troops and their allied separatist forces appear to have made only minor gains, taking several small towns as they try to advance in relatively small groups against staunch Ukrainian resistance. Russian military units were mauled in the abortive bid to storm Kyiv and had to regroup and refit. Some analysts say the delay in launching a full-fledged offensive may reflect a decision by Putin to wait until his forces are ready for a decisive battle, instead of rushing in and risking another failure that could shake his rule amid worsening economic conditions at home because of Western sanctions. Many observers suspect Putin wants to be able to claim a big victory in the east by Victory Day, on May 9, one of the proudest holidays on the Russian calendar, marking the defeat of Nazi Germany during World War II. As Russia presses its offensive, civilians again bear the brunt. ""It's not just scary. It's when your stomach contracts from pain,"" said Kharkiv resident Tatiana Pirogova. ""When they shoot during the day, it's still OK, but when the evening comes, I can't describe how scary it is."" Ukraine's military said that Russian troops were subjecting several places in the Donbas to ""intense fire"" and that over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian forces had repelled six attacks in the region. Four civilians were killed in heavy shelling of residential areas in the Luhansk region of the Donbas, according to the regional governor. Columns of smoke could be seen rising at different points across the Donetsk region of the Donbas, and artillery and sirens were heard on and off. In Mariupol, video posted online by Ukraine's Azov Regiment inside the steel plant showed people combing through the rubble to remove the dead and help the wounded. The regiment said the Russians hit an improvised underground hospital and its surgery room, killing an unspecified number of people. The video couldn't be independently verified. An estimated 100,000 people remained trapped in Mariupol. ""Deadly epidemics may break out in the city due to the lack of centralized water supply and sewers,"" the city council said on the messaging app Telegram. It reported bodies decaying under the rubble and a ""catastrophic"" shortage of drinking water and food. Loud bangs were also reported in Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, but there was no immediate explanation. In recent days, fuel and ammunition sites on Russian soil have been hit with explosions and fires, and suspicion has fallen on Ukraine. Ukraine has urged its allies to send even more military equipment to fend off the Russians. U.S. President Joe Biden asked Congress for an additional $33 billion to help Ukraine.",17,2.747897288865435,0.9352123236965271,1.812684965168908,14
2022-04-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-offensive-in-east/,"Russia is stepping up its offensive in the east, Ukraine says","Ukraine said Thursday that Russia's offensive in the east picked up momentum, with several towns coming under intense attack as Moscow's forces attempt to surround Ukrainian troops. In a reminder of the horrific toll the war has taken since it began Feb. 24, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres visited towns outside the capital of Kyiv, including Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found after Russia's retreat from the area. ""Ukraine is an epicenter of unbearable heartache and pain,"" Guterres told reporters in Kyiv, alongside Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Guterres' visit came two days after he met one-on-one with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Russia suddenly cut off natural gas to two NATO nations, Poland and Bulgaria, on Wednesday, in what was seen as a bid to punish and divide the West over its support for Ukraine ahead of the potentially pivotal battle in the eastern industrial region of the Donbas. The General Staff of Ukraine's military said Russian forces were ""exerting intense fire"" in several places as they pushed on with the second phase of their invasion. The most intense action was around Donetsk and close to Kharkiv, which lies outside the Donbas but is seen as key to Russia's apparent bid to encircle Ukrainian troops there. The General Staff said that over the past 24 hours, the Ukrainian forces have repelled six attacks in the Donbas, control of which is now Moscow's primary focus ever since its initial offensive faltered and failed to take the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian Special Forces Battalion Commander Ihor Lapin told CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata, who's on the front lines in eastern Ukraine, his troops simply don't have the firepower to match Russia. The need for more high-caliber ammunition is urgent, he said, adding that the fighting's been so intense, the Russians launched 1500 mortars on a single position in a single day. Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said the Russian army shelled the residential area in his region ""29 times by aircrafts, multiple rocket launches, tube artillery and mortars."" Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press also showed evidence of intense Russian fire on Mariupol in recent days. The images show how concentrated attacks have greatly damaged a central facility at the Azovstal steelworks, the last holdout of Ukrainian fighters in the key battleground port city. An estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters in the steelworks, a massive Soviet-era complex with complex underground facilities built to withstand airstrikes. Russia, meanwhile, said a city under its control in the south also came under fire. With the war now in its third month, Guterres on Thursday toured towns outside Kyiv that have seen some of the most horrific attacks of the war. ""Civilians always pay the highest price,"" he said as he visited the bombed out suburb of Irpin. ""And this is something everyone should remember, everywhere in the world. Wherever there is a war the highest price is paid by civilians."" After visiting the town of Borodianka, he told local press, ""The war is an absurdity in the 21st century. The war is evil. And when one sees these situations our heart, of course, stays with the victims."" Evidence of atrocities was discovered in the towns after the Russians retreated from the area in the face a fiercer than expected Ukrainian resistance, bolstered by Western arms. Guterres spoke of ""the senseless loss of life, the massive destruction, the unacceptable violations of human rights and the laws of war."" ""I am here to focus on ways on how the U.N. can expand support for the people of Ukraine, saving lives, reduce suffering and help find the path of peace,"" he said. ""I want the Ukrainian people to know that the world sees you, hears you, and is in awe of your resilience and resolve."" He pledged to increase U.N. efforts to provide ""life-saving humanitarian aid"" to millions of civilians inside Ukraine. ""This war must end, and peace must established in line the charter of the United Nations and international law. Many leaders have made many good efforts to stop the fighting, though these efforts, so far, have not succeeded."" In what could be a further Ukrainian counterattack, a series of explosions boomed near the television tower late Wednesday in southern Ukraine's Kherson, which has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the war. The blasts at least temporarily knocked Russian channels off the air, Ukrainian and Russian news organizations reported. Ukraine has urged its allies to send even more military equipment so it can continue its fight. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that ""to date, NATO allies have pledged and provided at least 8 billion U.S. dollars in military support to Ukraine. And we see the importance of further stepping up our support to Ukraine."" He also said Finland and Sweden would be embraced with open arms should they decide to join the 30-nation military organization and could become members quite quickly. While Russia's initial blitz was stunted — and it suffered the humiliating loss of a massive warship — Britain's Defense Ministry said the Russian navy still has the ability to strike coastal targets in Ukraine. In an intelligence briefing posted Thursday morning, the ministry says that about 20 Russia naval vessels, including submarines, are currently operating the Black Sea zone. But the ministry says Russia isn't able to replace the guided-missile cruiser Moskva, which sank earlier this month in the Black Sea, because the Bosporus Strait remains closed to all non-Turkish warships. Russia also lost the landing ship Saratov, which was destroyed by explosions and fire on March 24. While it presses its campaign in the east, Moscow has also piled on the pressure by leveraging its biggest export product, energy, cutting off NATO members Poland and Bulgaria from its natural gas on Wednesday. European leaders blasted that decision as ""blackmail,"" saying the move and the Kremlin's warning that it might cease shipments to other countries is a failed attempt to divide the West over its support for Ukraine. The tactic against the two EU countries could eventually force targeted nations to ration gas and deal another blow to economies suffering from rising prices. At the same time, it could deprive Russia of badly needed income to fund its war effort. The gas cuts do not immediately put the two countries in any dire trouble. Poland, especially, has been working for many years to line up other suppliers, and the continent is heading into summer, making gas less essential for households. Still, the cutoff and the Kremlin warning that other countries could be next sent shivers of worry through the 27-nation European Union. Germany is the world's biggest buyer of Russian energy, and Italy is also a significant consumer, though they, too, have been taking steps to reduce their dependence on Moscow. An independent research group said Thursday that Germany was the biggest buyer of Russian energy during the first two months of the war in Ukraine. The study published by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air calculates that Moscow Russia has earned 63 billion euros ($66.5 billion) from fossil fuel exports since Feb. 24, the date Russian troops attacked Ukraine.

In the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said Russia had hit a sprawling steelworks plant with 35 airstrikes in just 24 hours. An estimated 2,000 Ukrainian forces are holed up at the Azovstal plant, along with about 1,000 civilians taking shelter there. CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay has been talking with people caught up in the violence, and as he reports, energy is being used as a weapon in this war. Russia's state-run energy firm Gazprom said Wednesday that it had cut off the gas supply to Poland and Bulgaria because they were refusing to pay in Russian rubles. Ukraine called it the start of Russian ""gas blackmail"" aimed at its European allies. NATO member Poland agreed, with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki calling the gas cutoff ""a direct attack"" on his country and vowing that it would not give in to ""this blackmail."" Livesay said Mariupol was still standing on Thursday, with Ukrainian fighters there holding out against Russia's overwhelming firepower. Elsewhere in the east, however, Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had managed to capture several villages in the Donbas region that has become the focus of the invasion — but not the only front. As Ukraine fiercely fights back in the south and east, Livesay said a new front may be opening further west, directly south of Ukraine's capital along the country's border with Moldova. For two days, mysterious explosions have rung out in Transnistria, a pro-Russian breakaway region of Moldova where Russia has based some of its own forces. Moldova, without naming names, has said the blasts were aimed at creating ""pretexts for straining the security situation."" The worrying development comes as the global security situation grows increasingly fragile, with Russia repeatedly firing missiles right over Ukraine's nuclear power plants. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, saying Russia's actions had left him ""speechless,"" accused Vladimir Putin on Tuesday of threatening to turn nuclear power into a weapon. He said it on the anniversary of the Chernobyl explosion that shot a fireball high into Ukraine's sky 36 years ago. Amid the threat of Russian shelling, no light was allowed, save for some candles lit to honor the dead in the nearby town of Slavutych, which was built from scratch for the evacuees of that nuclear disaster. But Slavutych's current Mayor Yuri Fomichov told Livesay that Russia's current invasion was ""even more traumatic than the worst nuclear disaster in history."" When a Russian tank battalion occupied the Chernobyl plant, risking yet another catastrophe before retreating after a month, Fomichov himself was taken hostage. Enraged citizens rose up, waving Ukrainian flags and standing defiant before the occupiers. Soldiers fired warning shots and stun grenades, but the residents refused to disperse until their mayor was freed and their town was liberated. Many of them are now survivors of not one, but two historic tragedies in Ukraine. Resident Alexey told CBS News he was among those who witnessed both Chernobyl's reactor, and this war explode before him. ""We never expected either of them,"" he told Livesay. ""Chernobyl 36 years ago, or Russia attacking its brothers today. I can't wrap my head around it."" All they can do is remember those lost in one nuclear disaster, and hope not to bear witness to another.",17,0.8283962432298783,4.005397659527811,-3.177001416297933,15

2022-04-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-prime-minister-denys-shmyhal-face-the-nation/,"Ukrainian prime minister says Russia committing ""terrible war crimes"" in Mariupol","As the death toll mounts in Mariupol — the key port city in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has focused its efforts since failing to capture the capital of Kyiv — Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal accused the invading forces of committing ""terrible war crimes"" in the city. In an exclusive interview on ""Face the Nation,"" Shmyhal said ""small children and babies"" have died of dehydration in Mariupol since the war began two months ago. More than 100,000 people are believed to remain in the city with little access to water, food or heat. About 430,000 people lived in the city before the war. ""So there are terrible atrocities, terrible war crimes on the Mariupol territory,"" Shmyhal said at the end of his trip last week to Washington, where he met with President Biden and top lawmakers. Ukrainian officials estimate that more than 20,000 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine in February. After failing to capture the capital city of Kyiv, Russian forces have shifted their focus to Mariupol and other strategic towns and cities in the east and south of the country. On the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russia launched new attacks in the region, including in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, where Ukrainian officials said Russian missile strikes killed a 3-month-old baby and at least five other people. Shmyhal said Mariupol is like a ""symbol of brave Ukrainian soldiers and civilians"" who have tried to protect the city amid heavy Russian bombardment. But the only part of the city that remains under Ukrainian control is a steel plant where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering with some 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. ""We will protect our cities. And Mariupol will stay till the end,"" Shmyhal said, adding that Ukrainian soldiers would fight as long as it takes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin were heading to Kyiv on Sunday to meet with Ukraine's leaders. Shmyhal told ""Face the Nation"" that it would be a ""very important political symbol"" to have U.S. officials visit Ukraine so they can see with ""their own eyes what's happened, which atrocities and war crimes"" Russia has allegedly carried out. The prime minister said he was grateful for the support the U.S. and other Western nations have provided Ukraine, but he said his country needs more weapons, ammunition and financial assistance, and urged the West to impose additional sanctions on Russia. He also suggested using seized Russian assets, including yachts, to pay for the estimated $600 billion it would take to rebuild Ukraine. ""All of this should be paid by Russia. Absolutely,"" Shmyhal said.",17,2.839711175924853,0.9371648488977528,1.9025463270271001,17
2022-04-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-mariupol-steel-plant-zelenskyy-blinken-austin/,Zelenskyy pushes visiting U.S. officials for more aid to Ukraine,"Kyiv, Ukraine — The U.S. secretaries of state and defense met Sunday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the highest-level visit to the war-torn country's capital by an American delegation since the start of Russia's invasion, according to Zelenskyy's adviser. ""Yes, they're meeting with the president. Let's hope something will be decided on further help,"" presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV of the meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. It came as Ukraine pressed the West for more powerful weapons against Russia's campaign in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where Moscow's forces sought to dislodge the last Ukrainian troops in the battered port of Mariupol. Before the session, Zelenskyy said he was looking for the Americans to produce results, both in arms and security guarantees. ""You can't come to us empty-handed today, and we are expecting not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons,″ he said. The visit would be the first by senior U.S. officials since Russia invaded Ukraine 60 days ago. Blinken stepped briefly onto Ukrainian soil in March to meet with the country's foreign minister during a visit to Poland. Zelenskyy's last face-to-face meeting with a U.S. leader was February 19 in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris. While the West has funneled military equipment to Ukraine, Zelenskyy has stressed repeatedly it needs more heavy weapons, including long-range air defense systems, as well as warplanes. In an apparent boost for Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron won reelection over far right candidate Marine Le Pen. The result was hailed by France's allies in the European Union as a reassuring sign of stability and continued support for Ukraine. France has played a leading role in international efforts to punish Russia with sanctions and is supplying weapons systems to Ukraine. Zelenskyy's meeting with U.S. officials was set to take place as Ukrainians and Russians observed Orthodox Easter, when the faithful celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. Speaking from Kyiv's ancient St. Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, highlighted its significance to a nation wracked by nearly two months of war. ""The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win!"" he said. Still, the war cast a shadow over celebrations. Residents of rural villages battered by the war approached the day with some cautious defiance. ""How do I feel? Very nervous. Everyone is nervous,"" Olena Koptyl said as she prepared her Easter bread in the northern village of Ivanivka, where Russian tanks still littered the roads. ""The Easter holiday doesn't bring any joy. I'm crying a lot. We cannot forget how we lived."" Earlier, during his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy claimed that intercepted communications recorded Russian troops discussing ""how they conceal the traces of their crimes"" in Mariupol. The president also highlighted the death of a 3-month old girl in a Russian missile strike Saturday on the Black Sea port of Odesa. Zelenskyy said the military equipment received from Western supporters had been a big help so far, but he also has stressed that Ukraine needs more heavy weapons, including long-range air defense systems, as well as warplanes to fend off the Russian attacks. The Russian military reported that it hit 423 Ukrainian targets overnight, including fortified positions and troops concentrations, while Russian warplanes destroyed 26 Ukrainian military sites, including an explosives factory and several artillery depots. Most of the fighting Sunday focused on the eastern Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces are concentrated and where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war. Since failing to capture Kyiv, the Russians are aiming to gain full control over Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on a Mariupol steel plant where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. The Azovstal steel mill where the defenders are holed up is the last corner of resistance in the city, which the Russians have otherwise occupied. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, called for a localized Easter truce. He urged Russia to allow civilians to leave the plant and suggested talks to negotiate an exit for the Ukrainian soldiers. Podolyak tweeted that the Russian military was attacking the plant with heavy bombs and artillery while accumulating forces and equipment for a direct assault. Mariupol has been the focus of fierce fighting since the start of the war due to its location on the Sea of Azov. Its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere, and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. More than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed to remain in Mariupol with scant food, water or heat. Ukrainian authorities estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed. Satellite images released this week showed what appeared to be mass graves dug in towns to the west and east of Mariupol. Zelenskyy accused the Russians of committing war crimes by killing civilians, as well as of setting up ""filtration camps"" near Mariupol for people caught trying to leave the city. From there, he said, Ukrainians are sent to areas under Russian occupation or to Russia itself, often as far as Siberia or the Far East. Many of them, he said, are children. The claims could not be independently verified. In attacks on the eve of Orthodox Easter, Russian forces pounded cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. The 3-month-old baby was among eight people killed when Russia fired cruise missiles at Odesa, Ukrainian officials said. Ukrainian news agency UNIAN, citing social media posts, reported that the infant's mother, Valeria Glodan, and grandmother also died when a missile hit a residential area. Zelenskyy promised to find and punish those responsible for the strike. ""The war started when this baby was one month old,″ he said. Can you imagine what is happening? ""They are filthy scum, there are no other words for it."""" For the Donbas offensive, Russia has reassembled troops who fought around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine earlier. The British Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Ukrainian forces had repelled numerous assaults in the past week and ""inflicted significant cost on Russian forces."" ""Poor Russian morale and limited time to reconstitute, re-equip and reorganize forces from prior offensives are likely hindering Russian combat effectiveness,"" the ministry said in an intelligence update. The spiritual leaders of the world's Orthodox Christians and Roman Catholics appealed for relief for the suffering population of Ukraine. From Istanbul, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I said a ""human tragedy"" was unfolding. Bartholomew, considered the first among his Eastern Orthodox patriarch equals, citing in particular ""the thousands of people surrounded in Mariupol, civilians, among them the wounded, the elderly, women and many children."" Pope Francis, speaking from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square, renewed his call for an Easter truce, calling it ""a minimal and tangible sign of a desire for peace."" ""The attacks must be stopped, to respond to the suffering of the exhausted population,"" Francis said without naming the aggressor.",17,1.3631316724259228,1.5100372980297787,-0.1469056256038559,17
2022-04-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-mariupol-evacuation-attempts-death-toll-mounts/,"Mariupol evacuation ""thwarted"" by Russian forces, official says, as death toll mounts","An attempted Ukrainian evacuation of civilians from the shattered city of Mariupol, where many remain trapped, was ""thwarted"" by Russian forces on Saturday, a city official said. ""The evacuation was thwarted,"" Mariupol city official Petro Andryushchenko said on Telegram, adding that around 200 residents had gathered at the evacuation meeting point announced by Kyiv, but Russian forces ""dispersed"" them. He claimed others were told to board buses headed to Dukuchayevsk, about 50 miles north, which is controlled by Russia. ""The people did not have the right to leave the bus,"" he said. Russian forces blamed ""firing by (Ukrainian) nationalists at the evacuation point"" for changing the destination, he added. ""Once again the Russians have disrupted an evacuation,"" he said. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk had earlier announced that Ukraine would make a new attempt on Saturday to evacuate civilians from Mariupol and warned that Russian forces could try to organize a parallel evacuation route to Russia. The attempted evacuation came a day after a senior Russian military officer said ""the second phase of the special operation"" -- as Moscow terms its invasion of Ukraine -- had begun, with the aim of controlling a huge, strategic part of Ukrainian territory. ""One of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine,"" Major General Rustam Minnekaev said on Friday. The announcement marked far wider war goals than what Moscow previously stated. Russian forces, which withdrew from around Kyiv and the north of Ukraine after being frustrated in their attempts to take over the capital, already occupy much of the eastern Donbas region and the south. Minnekaev said their focus was now to ""provide a land corridor to Crimea,"" which Russia annexed in 2014, and towards a breakaway pro-Russian region of Moldova, Transnistria, where the general claimed Russian-speaking people were ""being oppressed."" The Moldovan government has been rattled by the Russian attack on its neighbor, with Moldovans fearing that Russian President Vladimir Putin could potentially then move further West. Moldova has accepted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees since the war broke out on February 24. Its government has condemned Russia's war and submitted a bid to join the European Union along with Georgia and Ukraine. It is also seeking the EU's support in handling the influx of refugees and calling on the bloc to step up support for the country. Ukrainian authorities have vowed to fight on and drive the Russian troops from their land, but they also sought an Easter pause. ""Unfortunately, Russia rejected the proposal to establish an Easter truce,"" said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week. In his regular Friday night address, Zelenskyy said the Russian general's comments were a clear articulation of Moscow's goals. ""This only confirms what I have already said multiple times: Russia's invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning,"" he said. Ukraine's government, emboldened by an influx of Western weaponry, said its beleaguered forces were still holding out inside a sprawling steelworks in the razed port city of Mariupol. The Kremlin has claimed the ""liberation"" of Mariupol, which is pivotal to its war plans nearly two months after President Vladimir Putin ordered the shock invasion of Russia's Western-leaning neighbor. In a phone call to Putin, EU chief Charles Michel appealed for humanitarian access to Mariupol, which has been largely destroyed by weeks of intense Russian bombardment. ""Strongly urged for immediate humanitarian access and safe passage from Mariupol and other besieged cities all the more on the occasion of Orthodox Easter,"" Michel tweeted. Putin however accused Kyiv of refusing to allow its troops to surrender in Mariupol. ""All servicemen of the Ukrainian armed forces, militants of the national battalions and foreign mercenaries who laid down their arms are guaranteed life,"" Putin told Michel, the Kremlin said. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported Friday that thousands of Ukrainians remained trapped inside a steel plant in Mariupol, surrounded by forces loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who earlier claimed victory in the city. Ukrainian officials said 100,000 people could still be stuck in Mariupol, which has been the site of some of the worst fighting in the war. Russia's defense ministry earlier said it was ready to observe a humanitarian pause if Kyiv's troops surrendered. ""The enemy's offensive operation in the south hinges on Mariupol. The enemy is trying to focus all its efforts on it,"" Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the eastern region of Donetsk, told AFP. Near the frontlines in eastern Ukraine, a smattering of residents still held out amid frequent bouts of shelling. After two months of sustained Russian artillery fire, the hamlet of Lysychansk, located just 9 miles from Russian ground forces, has largely turned into a ghost town. Only a small sheltered market in the center of town is still operating, providing food and other supplies after the town's other market was bombed. ""Everyone, this is going to end badly,"" said an elderly woman in line for vegetables, fearing a targeted strike by Russian forces similar to a deadly train station rocket attack in the nearby town of Kramatorsk on April 8 that killed at least 52 people. In Severodonetsk, just 6 miles from Russian positions, the city's volunteers and medical personnel continue to hold the fort in a local hospital that is littered with broken windows and some floors are plunged into darkness. Shelling resumed recently, and the city is likely to soon be surrounded by advancing Russian troops. ""We will stay here until the last patient,"" says Roman Vodianik, the hospital's chief, whose office is decorated with Orthodox Christian icons. Russia's change of strategic focus to southern and eastern Ukraine saw invading forces leave behind a trail of indiscriminate destruction and civilian bodies around Kyiv, including in the commuter town of Bucha. A United Nations mission to Bucha documented ""the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of some 50 civilians there"", the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said. Its spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said Russian forces had ""indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure, actions that may amount to war crimes"". Ukrainian officials say the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians have been retrieved from areas around Kyiv.",17,2.4969542733071495,2.4649794615376406,0.03197481176950889,14

Andriy Yermak, chief of staff for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in a Telegram post that two missile strikes from Russian troops struck a residential area in the city ""Nothing is sacred,"" Yermak wrote. ""Evil will be punished."" Meanwhile, Russian forces in Ukraine tried to storm a steel plant housing soldiers and civilians in the southern city of Mariupol on Saturday while attempting to crush the last corner of resistance in a place of deep symbolic and strategic value to Moscow, Ukrainian officials said. The reported assault on the eve of Orthodox Easter came after the Kremlin claimed its military had seized all of the shattered city except for the Azovstal plant, and as Russian forces pounded other cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. The fate of the Ukrainians in the sprawling seaside steel mill wasn't immediately clear; earlier Saturday, a Ukrainian military unit released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun. ""We want to see peaceful skies, we want to breathe in fresh air,"" one woman in the video said. ""You have simply no idea what it means for us to simply eat, drink some sweetened tea. For us, it is already happiness."" As the battle for the port ground on, Russia claimed it had taken control of several villages elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region and destroyed 11 military Ukrainian military targets overnight, including three artillery warehouses. Russian attacks also struck populated areas of Ukraine. Associated Press journalists also observed shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city; regional governor reported Oleh Sinehubov said three people were killed. In the Luhansk area of the Donbas, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said six people died during the shelling of a village, Gorskoi In Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas. The AP witnessed two soldiers arriving at the town's hospital, one of them mortally wounded. Nearby, a small group of people gathered outside a church, where a priest blessed them with water on Holy Saturday. While British officials said the Russians hadn't gained significant new ground, Ukrainian officials announced a nationwide curfew ahead of Easter Sunday, a sign of the war's disruption and threat to the entire country. Mariupol, a part of the industrial region in eastern Ukraine known as the Donbas, has been a key Russian objective since the Feb. 24 invasion began and has taken on outsize importance in the war. Completing its capture would give Russia its biggest victory yet, after a nearly two-month siege reduced much of the city to a smoking ruin. Occupying Mariupol would deprive the Ukrainians of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere and allow Russia to create a land corridor with the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russia-backed separatists control parts of the Donbas. Russian forces have claimed victory in the city. But Russia's recent defeats in and around Kyiv expose unresolved weaknesses, starting with Russia's armored vehicles. To date, Ukraine says Russia has lost close to 3,000 armored vehicles — but only half in combat. ""It's not good military leadership if you are losing so many men and so much equipment,"" Ukrainian military expert Yuri Zbanatski told CBS News' Chris Livesay. An advisor to Ukraine's presidential office, Oleksiy Arestovich, said during a Saturday briefing that Russian forces had resumed air strikes on the Azovstal plant and were trying to storm it. A direct attempt to take the plant would represent a reversal from an order Russian President Vladimir Putin gave two days earlier. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin on Thursday that the whole of Mariupol, with the exception of Azovstal, had been ""liberated"" by the Russians. At the time, Putin ordered him not to send Russian troops into the plant but instead to block off the facility, an apparent attempt to starve out the Ukrainians and force them to surrender. Ukrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops are inside the plant along with the civilians sheltering in the facility's underground tunnels. Arestovic said the Ukrainian forces were trying to counter the new attacks. Earlier Saturday, the Azov Regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, which has members holed up in the plant, released the footage of around two dozen women and children. The contents could not be independently verified. If authentic, it would be the first video testimony of what life has been like for civilians still trapped in Mariupol's underground bunkers. The video showed soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl says she and her relatives ""haven't seen neither the sky, nor the sun"" since they left home on Feb. 27. The regiment's deputy commander, Sviatoslav Palamar, told The AP the video was shot Thursday. The Azov Regiment has its roots in the Azov Battalion, which was formed in 2014 by far-right activists at the start of the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine and elicited criticism for some of its tactics. More than 100,000 people - down from a prewar population of about 430,000 - are believed trapped in Mariupol with little food, water or heat, according to Ukrainian authorities, who estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in the city during the Russian blockade. Satellite images released this week showed what appeared to be a second mass grave near Mariupol, and local officials accused Russia of burying thousands of civilians to conceal the slaughter taking place there. The Kremlin hasn't responded to the satellite images. Ukrainian officials had said they would try again Saturday to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Telegram that the effort was to get underway at midday. Like previous plans to get civilians out of the city, this one failed. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol's mayor, said Russian forces did not allow Ukrainian-organized buses to take residents to Zaporizhzhia, a city 227 kilometers (141 miles) to the northwest. ""At 11 o'clock, at least 200 Mariupol residents gathered near the Port City shopping center, waiting for evacuation,"" Andryushchenko posted on the Telegram messaging app. ""The Russian military drove up to the Mariupol residents and ordered them to disperse, because now there will be shelling."" At the same time, he said, Russian buses assembled about 200 meters away. Residents who got on board were told that they were being taken to separatist-occupied territory and not allowed to disembark, Andryushchenko said. His account could not be independently verified. During the attack on Odesa, the Russians fired at least six missiles, Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's interior minister. Defense forces repelled some of the rockets, but at least one landed and exploded, he said. ""Residents of the city heard explosions in different areas,"" Gerashchenko wrote in a Telegram post. ""Residential buildings were hit. It is already known about one victim. He burned in his car in a courtyard of one of the buildings."" The Ukraine presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, later reported that the 3-month-old baby was among the five people killed in the missile attack. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced all the war's casualties, noting that the Easter holiday commemorates Christ's resurrection after his death by crucifixion. ""We believe in the victory, of life over death,"" he said. ""No matter how fierce the battles are, there is no chance for death to defeat life. Everyone knows that. Every Christian knows that.""",17,4.540180243097299,2.0978630871274397,2.4423171559698593,14

""First and foremost, this senseless war must stop. But as the fighting shows no sign of abating, it is vital that all parties to the conflict give clear instructions to their combatants to strictly respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law,"" U.N. Human Rights spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in a briefing to journalists. Satellite images released late Thursday appeared to show more than 200 new graves in a town where Ukrainian officials say the Russians have been burying Mariupol residents killed in the fighting. The eastern port city of Mariupol has seen some of the worst suffering of the war, and the imagery, from Maxar Technologies, showed long rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery in the town of Manhush, some 12 miles from Mariupol. Local officials accused Russia of burying up to 9,000 Ukrainian civilians in mass graves in an effort to conceal the slaughter taking place in the city, which has been under siege since the early days of the war. ""The bodies of the dead were being brought by the truckload and actually simply being dumped in mounds,"" Piotr Andryushchenko, an aide to Mariupol's mayor, said on Telegram. There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin on the satellite pictures. When mass graves and hundreds of dead civilians were discovered in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv after Russian troops retreated three weeks ago, Russian officials denied that their soldiers killed any civilians there and falsely accused Ukraine of staging the atrocities. People fleeing Mariupol have described being trapped in horrible conditions. Yuriy and Polina Lulac said they spent nearly two months living in a basement with at least a dozen other people with no running water and little food. ""What was happening there was so horrible that you can't describe it,"" said Yuriy Lulac, who used a derogatory word for the Russian troops, saying they were ""killing people for nothing."" ""Mariupol is gone. In the courtyards there are just graves and crosses,"" he said. ""Over these eight weeks, international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored but seemingly tossed aside,"" Shamdasani said. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights' mission in Ukraine has verified 5,264 civilian casualties, including 2,345 deaths, since the war began on Feb. 24. It said that 92.3% of those were recorded in Ukrainian government-controlled territory. The office uses strict methodology and has long acknowledged that its confirmed figures are far short of the real numbers. ""The actual numbers are going to be much higher"" as more details emerge from places such as Mariupol where there is intense fighting,"" Shamdasani said. ""Almost every resident in Bucha our colleagues spoke to told us about the death of a relative, a neighbour or even a stranger. We know much more needs to be done to uncover what happened there and we also know Bucha is not an isolated incident,"" Shamdasani said. The office said in a statement that ""Russian armed forces have indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure - actions that may amount to war crimes."" It added that the U.N. mission also has ""documented what appears to be the use of weapons with indiscriminate effects, causing civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects, by Ukrainian armed forces in the east of the country."" On April 9, U.N. human rights officers visiting Bucha documented the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of around 50 civilians. ""The scale of summary executions of civilians in areas previously occupied by Russian forces is emerging,"" Shamdasani said.

2022-04-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-pizza-man-delivers-little-slice-of-happiness/,"Amid the violence of war, a Ukrainian pizza man delivers ""a little slice of happiness""","Dnipro, Ukraine - There was more evidence of war crimes in Ukraine as satellite images appeared to show mass graves just outside the southern city of Mariupol, in a territory controlled by Russia. Local officials accused Russia of burying thousands of civilians to hide the horrors that have taken place there, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported. Thousands more Ukrainians remained trapped inside a steel plant in Mariupol, surrounded by forces loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who earlier claimed victory in the city. Ukrainian officials said 100,000 people could still be stuck in Mariupol, which has been the site of some of the worst fighting in the war. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a proposed truce for the upcoming Orthodox Easter weekend had been rejected by Russia. Civilian casualties continued to mount along the front lines of the fighting. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has suffered intense bombardment since the conflict began, the mayor said Russia continued to furiously bomb the city. Yana Bachek was on her way to visit her father when she found out he had been killed by a chunk of shrapnel after stepping out of his apartment to buy bread. ""Even in a war, he tried to smile, to joke, to support us. He said, 'you are my brave girls, you are heroes,'"" Bachek said. Those daily risks prompted some of those seeking safety to live in the shelter of a subway tunnel for two months. On the platform, Pavel Fedosenko, who works at Daddy's Pizza, handed out slices to excited children and their parents. The tab was picked up by complete strangers — people who fled the city, who called up and ordered pizzas for those left behind. ""Now, we have foreigner donors who say they want to treat soldiers, military or paramedics to pizza,"" Fedosenko told CBS News. Daddy's Pizza has gotten a PayPal account to keep up. Fedosenko said it made him happy to bring a bit of joy to people who are suffering through so much. ""Bringing a little slice of happiness here, seeing kids laugh, a taste of normal life, it feels fantastic,"" he said.",17,1.614246226783251,3.7521683733010764,-2.1379221465178255,14
2022-04-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/russia-seeks-full-control-southern-ukraine-moldova-access-general-says/,"Russia aims to take ""full control"" of southern Ukraine, general says","Russia's military on Friday said it wants to seize all of Donbas and southern Ukraine -- and reach far as south as Moldova -- as it outlined its objectives in ""the second stage"" of the attack on Ukraine. The announcement marks far wider war goals than what Moscow previously stated. ""Since the beginning of the second stage of the special operation, and it started just two days ago, one of the tasks of the Russian army has been to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine. That will ensure the opening of a land corridor to Crimea and influence critical elements of the Ukrainian economy,"" acting Central Military District Commander Rustam Minnekayev said at an annual meeting of the Union of Defense Plants of the Sverdlovsk Region on Friday. ""Establishing control over southern Ukraine would also give the Russian army access to Transdniestria, where facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population have also been observed,"" Minnekayev said. Transdniestria is the de-facto breakaway region of Moldova that is not internationally recognized but has pro-Russian leaders and about 1,500 Russian troops stationed there. The Kremlin used claims of discrimination against the Russian-speaking population to justify its invasion of Ukraine two months ago, along with accusations against Ukraine and NATO that supposedly infringed on Russia's security. The Moldovan government has been rattled by the Russian attack on its neighbor, with Moldovans fearing that Russian President Vladimir Putin could potentially then move further West. Moldova has accepted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees since the war broke out on February 24. Its government has condemned Russia's war and submitted a bid to join the European Union along with Georgia and Ukraine. It is also seeking the EU's support in handling the influx of refugees and calling on the bloc to step up support for the country. But it is also trying to carefully balance its neutral stance with NATO to signal it is not willing to be the next target for Russia. Before the Russian military retreated from the capital city Kyiv, Moscow claimed that ""the first stage"" of the attack had been completed, and it is now focusing efforts on the ""liberation"" of two regions in the east to bring them under the control of pro-Russian leaders in the so-called breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. Military experts and Western officials linked the Russian retreat from Kyiv to significant losses in personnel and hardware as Ukrainian resistance appeared to have exceeded Russian expectations and toppled the initial goal of swiftly capturing the capital and claiming quick victory. But now, Russia appears to scale up its official goals again, targeting southern Ukrainian cities, even though its previous attempts to attack them have stalled. If Russia proceeds in this direction of attack, its primary targets would be the key port city of Odesa along nearby Mykolayiv. The tenacity of Mykolayiv's resistance in March kept the invading force from advancing to Odesa on the ground, but Russian warships off the coast have been firing missiles into nearby towns.",14,4.630198980599777,3.7787659076817905,0.8514330729179869,17
2022-04-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mariupol-ukraine-war-russia-satellite-images-mass-graves/,Satellite images of Mariupol appear to show new mass graves allegedly made for residents killed in the war,"Satellite images released Thursday appeared to show more than 200 new graves in a town where Ukrainian officials say the Russians have been burying Mariupol residents killed in the fighting. The imagery, from Maxar Technologies, shows long rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery in the town of Manhush, some 12 miles from Mariupol. Ukrainian officials said four buses with civilians managed to escape from the city after several unsuccessful attempts. Thousands more remained the city, much of which has been reduced to a smoking ruin in a nearly two-month siege, with over 20,000 people feared dead. The satellite images were released as Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory in the battle for Mariupol, even as he ordered his troops not to take the risk of storming the giant steel plant where the last Ukrainian defenders in the city were holed up. Instead, he directed his forces to seal off the Azovstal plant ""so that not even a fly comes through."" After nearly two lethal months of bombardment that have largely reduced Mariupol to a smoking ruin, Russian forces appear to control the rest of the strategic southern city, including its vital but now badly damaged port. But the Ukrainian troops have stubbornly held out. A few thousand defenders, by Russia's estimate, have been holed up for weeks along with hundreds of civilians in the sprawling steel plant, as Putin's forces pounded the site and repeatedly demanded they surrender. But on Thursday, the Russian leader declared victory without taking the plant, which covers 4 square miles and is threaded with some 15 miles of tunnels and bunkers. ""The completion of combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success,"" he said in an appearance with his defense minister. ""Congratulations."" Instead of mounting a frontal attack on the plant, Russia apparently intends to maintain the siege and wait for the defenders to surrender when they run out of food or ammunition. Ukraine scoffed at the notion of a Russian victory. ""This situation means the following: They cannot physically capture Azovstal. They have understood this. They suffered huge losses there,"" said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Leaving the plant in Ukrainian hands robs the Russians of the ability to declare complete victory in Mariupol, which has seen some of the most dramatic fighting of the war and whose capture has both strategic and symbolic importance. The scale of suffering there has made it a worldwide focal point, and its definitive fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, and free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas. ""If it weren't for the Ukrainian soldiers, we would have no food,"" one young mother, who is among the civilians sheltering in the steel plant, said. Children in the plant were using empty food containers as toys and said they couldn't wait to go to the grocery store, CBS News' Chris Livesay reported. Another woman said some of the children's ""teeth are starting to rot because they lack vitamin D. There's not enough sun."" ""Please help us,"" another mother begged. ""And to those who started this war against us, I hope you feel our pain on your own skin, and that your kids can feel this pain too.""",17,3.1957531213076327,0.9991964030046693,2.1965567183029635,14

A few thousand Ukrainian troops, by the Russians' estimate, remained in the plant, and its labyrinth of tunnels and bunkers spread out across about 4 square miles.

Ukrainian officials did not comment on Putin's remarks, but earlier said four buses with civilians managed to escape from the city after several unsuccessful attempts. Thousands more remained the city, much of which has been reduced to a smoking ruin in a nearly two-month siege, with over 20,000 people feared dead. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said another attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol would be made Thursday, though it was not clear how the latest comments would affect that. In Kyiv, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Denmark's Mette Frederiksen became the latest European leaders to show support with a visit to the capital. They were due to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who warned in a video address overnight that the Russians were not ""abandoning their attempts to score at least some victory by launching a new, large-scale offensive."" ""The West stands together to support the Ukrainian people,"" Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said in a statement. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said it submitted a draft of its demands for ending the war, and the West raced to supply Ukraine with heavier weapons to counter the Russians' new drive to seize the industrial east. Britain's Defense Ministry said in an assessment that Russia likely desires to demonstrate significant successes ahead of its annual May 9 Victory Day celebrations. ""This could affect how quickly and forcefully they attempt to conduct operations in the run-up to this date,"" he said. As fears grew for the fate of civilians in Mariupol, the Kyiv regional police said Thursday that two mass graves with nine bodies were discovered in the city of Borodyanka, northwest of the capital. The findings added to thousands of civilians reported killed by Russian forces, who have been accused of wholesale abuses of Ukrainians. The head of the Kyiv regional police, Andriy Nebytov, said two women and a teenager were among the ""civilians killed by the Russian occupiers."" ""I want to stress that these people are civilians. The Russian military deliberately shot civilians that didn't put up any resistance and didn't pose any threat,"" Nebytov said, adding that some of the victims were apparently tortured. With global tensions running high, Russia reported the first successful test launch of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, the Sarmat. Putin boasted that it can overcome any missile defense system and make those who threaten Russia ""think twice."" The head of the Russian state aerospace agency called the launch out of northern Russia ""a present to NATO."" The Pentagon described the test as ""routine"" and said it wasn't considered a threat. On the battlefield, Ukraine said Moscow continued to mount assaults across the east, probing for weak points in Ukrainian defensive lines. Russia said it launched hundreds of missile and air attacks on targets that included concentrations of troops and vehicles. The Kremlin's stated goal is the capture of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern region that is home to coal mines, metal plants and heavy-equipment factories. Detaching it from the rest of Ukraine would give Putin a badly needed victory two months into the war, after the botched attempt to storm the capital, Kyiv. The U.K. Defense Ministry said Russian forces were advancing from staging areas in the Donbas toward Kramatorsk, which continues to suffer from persistent rocket attacks. The Luhansk governor said Russian forces control 80% of his region, which is one of two that make up the Donbas. Before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Kyiv government controlled 60% of the Luhansk region. Gov. Serhiy Haidai said the Russians, after seizing the small city of Kreminna, are now threatening the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna. He urged all residents to evacuate immediately. ""The occupiers control only parts of these cities, unable to break through to the centers,"" Haidai said on the messaging app Telegram. Analysts have said the offensive in the east could become a war of attrition as Russia faces Ukraine's most experienced, battle-hardened troops, who have fought pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas for eight years. Russia said it presented Ukraine with a draft document outlining its demands for ending the conflict, days after Putin said the talks were at a ""dead end."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that ""the ball is in their court, we're waiting for a response."" He gave no details on the draft, and it was not clear when it was sent or whether it offered anything new to the Ukrainians, who presented their own demands last month. Zelenskyy said he had not seen or heard of the proposal, though one of his top advisers said the Ukrainian side was reviewing it. Moscow has long demanded Ukraine drop any bid to join NATO. Ukraine has said it would agree to that in return for security guarantees from other countries. Other sources of tension include the status of both the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Moscow in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where the separatists have declared independent republics recognized by Russia. A Zelenskyy adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter that he and other Ukrainian negotiators were ready to hold talks without conditions to save the lives of trapped Mariupol defenders and civilians. There was no immediate response from Russia. Elsewhere, some residents of the eastern city of Kharkiv have lived in basements for weeks, trying to stay safe from Russian shelling. With no running water, gas or electricity, they collect rainwater and cook on open fires, burning debris from destroyed wooden buildings. In one neighborhood, they sought safety in a school basement - using desks, tables and chairs to fashion beds. More than 300 people slept there during the first days of the war, but most have left for safer places, and only a few dozen remain. As Russia funneled troops and equipment into the Donbas, Western nations rushed to boost the flow of military supplies to Kyiv for this new phase of the war - likely to involve trench warfare, long-range artillery attacks and tank battles across relatively open terrain. President Joe Biden was set to announce plans Thursday to send more military aid to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Zelenskyy said Ukraine's Western allies have ""come to understand our needs better,"" adding that Ukraine is receiving new shipments of Western weapons ""now, when Russia is trying to step up its attacks, not in weeks or in a month.""",17,2.081006105625108,1.2743887207857107,0.8066173848393974,14

The fighting unfolded along a boomerang-shaped front of hundreds of miles in what is known as the eastern Donbas region. If successful, Russian President Vladimir Putin would be able to claim a victory following his failed attempt to storm the capital, Kyiv, and heavier-than-expected Russian casualties. Key to the Russian campaign is the capture of the city of Mariupol, which would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. It would also free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas region. Ukrainian troops said the Russian military dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of a sprawling steel plant in Mariupol - believed to be the city's defenders' last holdout, and hit a hospital where hundreds were staying. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said there was a ""preliminary"" agreement to open a humanitarian corridor for women, children and the elderly to leave Mariupol west to the Ukraine-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Wednesday afternoon. She said on the messaging app Telegram that civilians in Mariupol were facing a ""catastrophic humanitarian situation."" Vereshchuk previously said no agreement had been reached with Russia on an evacuation route on each of the past three days. There was no immediate confirmation from the Russian side, which issued a new ultimatum to the Ukrainian defenders to surrender Wednesday after a previous ultimatum was ignored. Ukraine and Russia have frequently blamed each other for obstructing evacuations from Mariupol or firing along the agreed route, which has typically only been open to people in private vehicles. ""We are probably facing our last days, if not hours,"" a commander of the Ukrainian marines fighting in the steel plant, Serhiy Volyna, said in a video posted on social media. ""The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks. We are only defending one object, the Azovstal plant where, in addition to military personnel, there are also civilians who have fallen victim to this war. We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us. We ask them to use the procedure of 'extraction' and take us to the territory of a third party state. All of us, Mariupol military battalion of soldiers, more than 500 wounded, and hundreds of civilians including women and children, we plead to take us to safety on the territory of a third party state,"" Volyna said. ""I can confirm that there are a lot of civilians,"" Deputy Mayor of Mariupol Sergei Orlov told CBS News partner network BBC News. ""They know that steel plants had good bomb shelter and some stocked food and water in the bomb shelter. That's why they decided with their families to live in this bomb shelter."" Orlov said no help was currently possible for the people in the steel plant. ""They have an absolute lack of everything. A lack of water, food, medicines, help, and Russia totally blocks everything, any humanitarian help or evacuation,"" Orlov said. The eastern cities of Kharkiv and Kramatorsk also came under deadly attack. Russia said it struck areas around Dnipro and Zaporizhia with missiles. Near Zaporizhia, 29-year-old paratrooper Vyacheslav Dimovon was laid to rest after a Russian anti-tank mine took his life on Saturday. His mother, Alla, told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata how important it had been for Dimovon to fight for his country. ""He dreamed like crazy of becoming a soldier,"" Alla said. ""But I didn't bring him into this world for war, but for a peaceful life. So he could live with his beloved wife Ivanna."" Dimovon and his 23-year old widow had only been married for 18 months. They were planning to start a family when the war broke out. ""Every time we spoke, I told him: 'I love you, look after yourself,'"" Ivanna told CBS News. She said she had known every video call with her husband could be their last. ""'Now, it's: 'I love you, look after me,'"" she said. Both sides have described the Russian assault that began Monday as a new phase of the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian military was throwing everything it has into the battle, with most of its combat-ready forces now concentrated in Ukraine and just across the border in Russia. ""They have driven almost everyone and everything that is capable of fighting us against Ukraine,"" he said in his nightly video address to the nation. Despite claims that they are hitting only military sites, the Russians continue to target residential areas and kill civilians, he said. He also said the Kremlin has not responded to a proposal to exchange Viktor Medvedchuk, the jailed leader of a pro-Russia party, for the Mariupol defenders. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon's assessments of the war, said the Russians had added two combat units, known as battalion tactical groups, in Ukraine over the preceding 24 hours. That brought the total units in the country to 78, all of them in the south and the east, up from 65 last week, the official said. That would translate to 55,000 to 62,000 troops, based on what the Pentagon said at the start of the war was the typical unit strength of 700 to 800 soldiers. But accurately determining Russia's fighting capacity at this stage is difficult. A European official, likewise speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said Russia also has 10,000 to 20,000 foreign fighters in the Donbas region. They are a mix of mercenaries from Russia's private Wagner Group and Russian proxy fighters from Syria and Libya, according to the official.",17,1.1272067548246434,4.2688286400590645,-3.141621885234421,14

The recently approved $800 million in security assistance includes Howitzer artillery systems, 40,000 artillery rounds, armored personnel vehicles and other weapons. A senior U.S. defense official said Monday that four flights of shipments from the assistance package arrived in the region over the weekend with a fifth expected in the next 24 hours. The official did not detail which weapons from the recent package landed in the region first. On Tuesday, a senior defense official said that assistance to Ukraine can be deployed incredibly fast: in as little as 48-72 hours, the process of receiving necessary approvals, gathering and shipping the equipment can be completed. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby in a press briefing said the Defense Department expects to start training Ukrainian trainers outside of Ukraine on how to use the U.S.-provided Howitzers in the coming days. The Ukrainian trainers will then return to Ukraine and train more troops. According to Kirby, the training isn't expected to take long since the Ukrainians already know how to use artillery systems and merely need to familiarize themselves with the American systems. The Ukrainians use 152mm artillery systems, and the U.S. is providing 155mm artillery systems. The Russians have refocused on the Donbas region after failing to control Kyiv. The Pentagon assesses they are now conducting ""staging operations,"" which involves ""setting the conditions for more aggressive, more overt and larger ground maneuvers"" in the east, according to Kirby. The impending fight in the east is expected to rely more on armored vehicles and artillery systems than in the north since the terrain in southeastern Ukraine is more flat and wide open. ""The artillery is a specific item the Ukrainians asked for because of the specific fighting they expect is going to occur in the Donbas,"" Kirby said on Monday. ""And we know the Russians also believe the same thing because we see them moving artillery units into the Donbas as well."" On Tuesday, Kirby observed that fighting in the Donbas would be characterized by ""a whole different type of fighting,"" that would entail long-range firing and artillery. He acknowledged that in the future, ""it is certainly within the realm of the possible that the Ukrainians will want additional artillery systems and additional artillery rounds and we will have those conversations with them and we will if that's the need, we'll do everything we can to meet it."" The recently approved $800 million in assistance to Ukraine also includes Switchblade drones, more Javelin anti-tank missiles, and armored personnel carriers. Overall, the U.S. has provided $2.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded at the end of February.",14,2.075762182753133,7.974395831113285,-5.898633648360152,12
2022-04-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-commits-to-barring-anti-satellite-missile-tests/,White House commits to barring anti-satellite missile tests,"The Biden administration says it is barring anti-satellite missile testing by the United States, a move that White House officials say is meant to underscore its hopes of establishing new norms for military action in space. The U.S. has sharply criticized Russia and China for conducting anti-satellite missile tests, although it also used an interceptor missile fired from a U.S. Navy warship more than 14 years ago to destroy a malfunctioning spy satellite. The issue is one that's taken on greater urgency after Russia in November launched a missile to destroy a defunct Soviet-era satellite. Vice President Kamala Harris, in a speech Monday at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the central coast of California to highlight the administration's move, criticized the Russian action as ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible."" The strike created more than 1,500 pieces of space debris that increased risk to U.S. and Russian astronauts aboard the International Space Station and China's Tiangong space station, according to U.S. Space Command. ""Simply put, these tests are dangerous,"" Harris said. ""And we will not conduct them."" The Russian test occurred as it was massing troops ahead of its latest invasion of Ukraine. The more than seven-week-old war has left thousands dead and has caused to U.S. and its allies to hit Russia with massive economic sanctions. A similar weapons test by China in 2007 also resulted in widespread debris. Harris stressed that the debris created by the missile tests threatens not only astronauts and U.S. military interests but also could impact commercial satellites that the world relies on for weather forecasts, GPS systems that help drivers navigate streets, television broadcasts and critical infrastructure. ""A piece of space debris the size of a basketball, which travels at thousands of miles per hour, would destroy a satellite. Even a piece of debris as small as a grain of sand could cause serious damage,"" Harris said. The announcement of the anti-satellite missile testing ban comes months after Harris announced at a meeting in December that White House National Security Council officials would work with officials at the Pentagon, State Department, and other U.S. national security agencies to develop proposals for national security space norms. The U.S. is the first country to announce such a ban. Harris said she hoped other nations would quickly follow. The kind of direct-ascent weapon that the Biden administration is committing not to fire relies on interceptor missiles that travel from the Earth's surface to strike a satellite target hundreds of miles into space. Since the 1960s, the United States, China, India and Russia have conducted more than a dozen anti-satellite tests in space that destroyed satellites and created more than 6,300 pieces of orbital debris, according to the Secure World Foundation, a nongovernmental group that advocates for sustainable and peaceful uses of outer space. At least 4,300 pieces of that debris are still in orbit today and pose long-term threats to human spaceflight, science and national security missions, and the future economic development of space, according to the foundation. Anti-satellite missile tests by the U.S. in 2008 as well as one by India in 2019 targeted satellites at much lower altitudes, well below the space station at about 260 miles (420 kilometers). Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the destruction of a satellite in low-earth orbit by missile was meant to demonstrate India's capacity as a ""space power"" alongside the U.S., Russia and China. He ordered the launch weeks before national elections. The defunct Russian satellite Cosmos 1408 was orbiting about 40 miles (65 kilometers) higher when it was destroyed in November by a missile fired from northern Russia. Brian Weeden, director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation, called the Biden administration's move a significant one that puts pressure on China and Russia to take similar action. ""They have made a lot of diplomatic noise the last decade about preventing a space arms race, while also testing their own (anti-satellite) weapons and creating orbital debris,"" Weeden said of Russia and China.",3,7.110597212042189,7.895138096694055,-0.7845408846518653,5

Several propaganda clips aired on Rossia 1 and RT channels on Sunday and Monday, picturing U.K. citizens Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28. They fought in Mariupol as part of Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade. On Sunday, Pinner, who appeared to be tired and bruised, spoke to Russian TV war reporter Andrey Rudenko and gave some details about the battle of Mariupol. ""I was fighting in Mariupol for five to six weeks and now I'm in Donetsk People's Republic,"" Pinner said in English, referring to the eastern region where Russia and pro-Russian separatists have been fighting Ukraine for years. It is not clear how exactly he was captured or when the video was filmed. Rudenko can be heard telling Pinner in Russia that his unit ""had no chance"" in Mariupol. ""The servicemen of the 36th brigade say their command specially sent them to be killed in order to make heroes out of them later,"" Rudenko says, without evidence. ""You didn't have a single chance to reach this settlement Zachatovka, since Russian and DPR [Donetsk People's Republic] troops were everywhere."" Earlier in the video, Pinner described how he and his unit attempted to evacuate from the area. ""We were in the industrial zone of Mariupol, it was decided to leave, but I can't say exactly where. At four o'clock on Tuesday morning, we started moving,"" Pinner said. ""It was dark, we took the wounded with us. Mortar and artillery attacks began, military aviation worked, panic began."" In another clip posted Monday, Pinner appealed to U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to secure his and Aslin's release by swapping them with pro-Kremlin Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk. Medvedchuk, a close personal friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was recently captured by Ukrainian special forces as he tried to flee the country towards Russia, Ukrainian officials said. Pinner's plea was aired a few minutes after the Ukrainian security service released a video of Medvedchuk pleading to swap him with ""defenders and residents of Mariupol."" In another Russian propaganda video over the weekend, Aslin was shown handcuffed and with cuts and bruises on his face, perpetuating Russian state TV talking points about alleged ""Nazi atrocities"" in Ukraine, which is how Moscow justified its invasion. Aslin is a former care worker who joined the Ukrainian marines in 2018 and previously fought for the Syrian Kurdish YPG against the Islamic State throughout 2015, The Guardian reported. Russian state TV claimed that they both were ""British mercenaries"" who surrendered in Mariupol. Pinner's family refuted this claim, saying that the former British soldier moved to Ukraine four years ago and joined the Ukrainian army. ""Shaun enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country over the last four years. During this time, he met his Ukrainian wife who is very focused on the humanitarian needs of the country,"" the family told the BBC. In a late February interview, Pinner himself told the Daily Mail that he previously served in the Royal Anglian Regiment and now fought with the Ukrainian army as a ""contract soldier."" Speaking from outside Mariupol, he said: ""I am here defending my family and adopted city. Russia started this war — it's funded by Russia and driven by Russia. But we will fight them; make no mistake about that."" Aslin's relatives also told The Guardian that Ukraine was ""his adopted country,"" and he is engaged to a Ukrainian woman. The families said in a statement they are working with the U.K. Foreign Office to ""ensure their rights as prisoners of war are upheld according to the Geneva Convention,"" which calls for humane treatment of people captured during hostilities. The Foreign Office also called on the Kremlin to treat the U.K. citizens humanely and condemned ""the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes."" The battered port city of Mariupol appears to be on the brink of falling to Russian forces after weeks under siege, which could give Moscow a crucial military success following a failed attempt to seize the capital and the loss of its flagship Black Sea cruiser Moskva. Capturing Mariupol, which appears to have been practically razed to the ground, would give Russians control over significant territory in the south and could potentially free up forces to double down on the attack in other areas in Ukraine's east.",13,6.471016020682713,2.759697103436544,3.711318917246169,2

His comments came hours after Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia's offensive in the east of the country had started. ""The Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address late Monday. A ""significant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive."" The eastern Donbas region of Ukraine is mostly Russian-speaking. Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces there for the past eight years and have declared two independent republics that have been recognized by Russia. In recent weeks, after its attempt to storm Kyiv failed, the Kremlin declared that its main goal of the war was to capture the Donbas region. After withdrawing from the capital, Russia began regrouping and reinforcing its ground troops in the east for an all-out offensive. ""No matter how many Russian troops are driven there, we will fight,"" Zelenskyy said. ""We will defend ourselves. We will do it every day."" Moscow said it struck 1,200 targets in Ukraine overnight and told the last Ukrainian forces defending Mariupol's giant Azovstal steel mill that if they surrendered before noon, they would ""keep their lives."" Ukrainian troops who have defended the city for seven weeks have ignored previous, similar offers. The Azovstal plant, which covers the territory of about 4 square miles, is the last major Ukrainian pocket of resistance in Mariupol. Mariupol is a strategic port on the Sea of Azov. Its capture is important for Russia because it stands in the way of a land bridge to Crimea. Earlier Tuesday, Eduard Basurin, a spokesman for the Russia-backed separatists in the Donbas region, said assault groups had moved into Azovstal in a bid to uproot the Ukrainian troops there, following bombing and an artillery barrage. Meanwhile, the Reuters news agency reported that the governor of the eastern Luhansk region said Russian troops had captured the city of Kreminna. If true, Kreminna would appear to be the first city captured in the new Russian offensive. ""Kreminna is under the control of the 'Orcs' (Russians). They have entered the city. Our defenders had to withdraw. They have entrenched themselves in new positions and continue to fight the Russian army,"" Serhiy Gaidai said in a briefing, according to Reuters.",14,2.7777329204891434,1.152866099497239,1.6248668209919044,12

""The Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced in a video address. He said a ""significant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive."" The Donbas is Ukraine's mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland in the east, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for the past eight years and have declared two independent republics that have been recognized by Russia. In recent weeks, the Kremlin declared the capture of the Donbas its main goal of the war after its attempt to storm Kyiv failed. After withdrawing from the capital, Russia began regrouping and reinforcing its ground troops in the east for an all-out offensive. ""No matter how many Russian troops are driven there, we will fight,"" Zelenskyy vowed. ""We will defend ourselves. We will do it every day."" The offensive got underway after Russia bombarded the western city of Lviv and a multitude of other targets across Ukraine in what appeared to be an intensified bid to grind down the country's defenses. The Ukraine military's general staff said Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces were increasing assaults in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions — both of which are part of the Donbas — as well as in the area of Zaporizhzhia. ""This morning, almost along the whole front line of the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions, the occupiers attempted to break through our defenses,"" Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's national security council, was quoted as telling Ukrainian media. ""Fortunately, our military is holding out. They passed through only two cities. This is Kreminna and another small town."" He added: ""We are not giving up any of our territories."" A Ukrainian military official said street battles had begun in Kreminna and that evacuation was impossible. Luhansk regional military administrator Serhiy Haidai said heavy artillery fire set seven residential buildings on fire and targeted the sports complex where the nation's Olympic team trains. Haidai later told Ukrainian television that Russians took control of the city after ""leveling everything to the ground,"" so his forces retreated to regroup and keep on fighting. Meanwhile, in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov Regiment of the Ukrainian National Guard that was holding out against Russian forces, said in a video message that Russia had begun dropping bunker-buster bombs on the Azovstal steel plant where the regiment was holed up. The sprawling plant contains a warren of tunnels where both fighters and civilians are sheltering. It is believed to be the last major pocket of resistance in the shattered city. At least seven people were reported killed in missile strikes on Lviv, a city close to the Polish border that has seen only sporadic attacks during almost two months of war and has become a haven for civilians fleeing the fighting elsewhere. To the Kremlin's increasing anger, Lviv has also become a major gateway for NATO-supplied weapons. The attack on Lviv hit three military infrastructure facilities and an auto shop, according to the region's governor, Maksym Kozytskyy. He said the wounded included a child. A Lviv hotel sheltering Ukrainians who had fled the fighting in other parts of the country was also badly damaged, Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said. The city has seen its population swell with elderly people, mothers and children trying to escape the war. ""The nightmare of war has caught up with us even in Lviv,"" said Lyudmila Turchak, who fled with two children from the eastern city of Kharkiv. ""There is no longer anywhere in Ukraine where we can feel safe."" Lviv, the biggest city and a major transportation hub in western Ukraine, is about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Poland, a NATO member. Russia has strongly complained about the increasing flow of Western weapons to Ukraine and warned that such aid could have consequences. On Russian state media, some anchors have charged that the supplies amount to direct Western engagement in the fight against Russia. A powerful explosion also rocked Vasylkiv, a town south of the capital of Kyiv that is home to an air base, according to residents. It was not immediately clear what was struck. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, was hit by shelling that killed at least three people, according to Associated Press journalists on the scene. One of the dead was a woman who appeared to be going out to collect water in the rain. She was found with a water canister and an umbrella by her side. Military analysts say Russia was increasing its strikes on weapons factories, railroads and other infrastructure ahead of its assault on the Donbas. Moscow said its missiles struck more than 20 military targets in eastern and central Ukraine in the past day, including ammunition depots, command headquarters and groups of troops and vehicles. It also reported that its artillery hit an additional 315 Ukrainian targets and that warplanes conducted 108 strikes on troops and military equipment. The claims could not be independently verified. Gen. Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, told Sky News that Russia was waging a ""softening-up"" campaign ahead of the Donbas offensive. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon's assessments of the war, said there are now 76 Russian combat units, known as battalion tactical groups, in eastern and southern Ukraine, up from 65 last week. That could translate to around 50,000 to 60,000 troops, based on what the Pentagon said at the start of the war was the typical unit strength of 700 to 800 soldiers, but the numbers are difficult to pinpoint at this stage in the fighting. The official also said that four U.S. cargo flights arrived in Europe on Sunday with an initial delivery of weapons and other materials for Ukraine as part of a $800 million package announced by Washington last week. And training of Ukrainian personnel on U.S. 155 mm howitzers is set to begin in the next several days. The capture of Mariupol, where Ukraine estimates 21,000 people have been killed, is seen as key, and not just because it would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, seized from Ukraine from 2014. The U.S. defense official said that if Russian forces succeed in taking full control of Mariupol, that could free up nearly a dozen battalion tactical groups for use elsewhere in the Donbas.",14,0.5775673646052406,2.565630189427329,-1.9880628248220884,12

Maksym Kozytsky said four Russian strikes had targeted military infrastructure but that a car tire factory had also been hit. Lviv, which is near Ukraine's border with Poland, has been considered a place of relative safety for those fleeing fierce fighting in other parts of the country. ""What happened today is very disturbing and alarming because this is a very powerful missile strike [on] civilian infrastructure,"" Yuri Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defense minister, told CBS News partner network BBC News. ""What happened today proves one more time that, while the major build-up of Russian forces continues in the east of Ukraine, the whole of the country continues to be at risk."" Russian state media claimed Russia had struck 315 targets in Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian officials in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk also reported multiple missile attacks on Monday, saying some projectiles hit areas close to a railway station. Strikes intensified near the capital city of Kyiv as well. Meanwhile, new pictures emerged that appeared to show Russia's Moskva warship, with smoke billowing from the rear, starting to sink after allegedly being struck by Ukrainian missiles. After weeks of unrelenting onslaught, Ukraine's Prime Minister said his forces were continuing to make a stand in the coastal city of Mariupol, despite renewed threats from Russia that any remaining Ukrainian soldiers would be ""eliminated."" In a sprawling steel plant and the series of tunnels beneath it, a pocket of Ukrainian troops were holding out, defying the ultimatum from Russia to surrender or die. On Sunday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told CBS News' Face the Nation that Russia was razing the city at any cost. ""The situation in Mariupol is both dire militarily and heartbreaking. The city doesn't exist anymore,"" Kuleba said. Russia's ministry of defense on Monday claimed Ukraine had so far lost 23,367 troops in the war. NATO estimates that up to 45,000 Russian troops have been killed, captured, or injured since the invasion began. Amid the suffering and fear, worshippers in Ukraine gathered over the weekend for the start of Holy Week. Easter is celebrated next Sunday. In Vinnytsia, southwest of the capital, Protodeacon Vladyslav prayed for the lives of the injured and the souls of the dead. ""When people undergo all this grief and atrocities, and they still hope, still believe, still say that they feel the hand of God that guides them, this belief becomes their reality,"" Vladyslav said. But the war has turned the church into a battlefield too, after Russian Orthodox leaders gave their blessing to the war and President Putin. Vladyslav said that makes the Russian Orthodox Church ""an accomplice."" ""It's a position no church should ever take. Russia started this war not defending their territory but attacking the territory of our country,"" he said.

""It's a place I've described as a center of hell,"" he said. He said the U.N. receives offers ""day by day"" to create humanitarian corridors that are ""not cleared by"" one side or the other, and families have been trapped. ""We don't really know the numbers of people still caught and blocked and unable to get out from Mariupol,"" Griffith said. Mariupol has been under relentless bombardment for seven weeks, leaving much of the city in ruins. Officials estimate roughly 21,000 people there have been killed, and 120,000 are still in the city, which is nearly encircled by Russian forces. ""The situation in Mariupol is both dire militarily and heartbreaking. The city doesn't exist anymore,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Sunday on ""Face the Nation."" ""This is something, which as each week goes by, is becoming more difficult,"" Griffith said, ""this is a generational problem that we're going to have to face."" The U.N. refugee agency says nearly 5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the war began on February 24. A smaller number — over 870,000 people — have now returned, as Russian troops pulled back from areas around Kyiv to focus on fighting in the east.The influx leaves the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), which Griffiths heads, ""concerned about deteriorating food security."" Despite security concerns, ""most Ukrainians want to return as quickly as possible and as long as they can be safe,"" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told CBS News on Monday. The U.N. has rallied agencies that are staying on the ground in Ukraine to be a lifeline for food, clean water and medicine but have been powerless to stop what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council nations earlier this month was the devastation of his country, where Russian troops ""killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" The Ukraine Prosecutor General and the International Criminal Court as well as the U.N. Human Rights Council and several countries have begun to collect evidence for investigations of war crimes, amid widespread reports that Russian forces deliberately killed civilians. Griffiths, who has traveled to several countries, most recently speaking with officials in Moscow and Kyiv, said mediation efforts have not yet succeeded. He said his agency has asked both countries to meet to discuss humanitarian proposals including a ceasefire, monitoring, safe passage, corridors, and other priorities, and he is traveling to Turkey this week to follow through on President Erdogan's effort to mediate. Griffiths said that the international agencies need several-day windows to evacuate civilians, and Russia has not given those yet. Although UNOCHA has ""had a number of successful movements of convoys,"" he said the number is ""completely inadequate.""

2022-04-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mariupol-ukraine-war-siege-port-city/,Ukraine remains defiant as key port city of Mariupol teeters on the brink,"Kyiv, Ukraine — The battered port city of Mariupol appeared on the brink of falling to Russian forces Sunday after seven weeks under siege, a development that what would give Moscow a crucial success in Ukraine following a botched attempt to storm the capital and the loss of the Russian navy's Black Sea flagship. The Russian military estimated that about 2,500 Ukrainian fighters holding out at a hulking steel plant with a warren of underground passageways provided the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol. Russia gave another deadline for their surrender, saying those who put down their weapons were ""guaranteed to keep their lives,"" but Ukraine remained defiant. ""All those who will continue resistance will be destroyed,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Defense Ministry's spokesman, said. He said intercepted communications indicated there were about 400 foreign mercenaries along with the Ukrainian troops at the Azovstal steel mill, a claim that couldn't be independently verified. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that the situation in the city is ""dire"" and ""heartbreaking."" ""The city doesn't exist anymore. The remainings of the Ukrainian army and large group of civilians are basically encircled by the Russian forces,"" Kuleba said. ""They continue their struggle, but it seems from the way the Russian army behaves in Mariupol, they decided to raze the city to the ground at any cost."" Seizing Mariupol would free up Russian forces to weaken and encircle Ukrainian soldiers forces in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has focused its war aims for now and is deploying personnel and equipment withdrawn from the north after the failure to take Kyiv. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar described Mariupol as a ""shield defending Ukraine"" as Russian troops prepare for a full-scale offensive in Donbas, the country's eastern industrial heartland where Moscow-backed separatists already control some territory. In a reminder that no part of Ukraine was immune until the war ends, Russian forces carried out new missile strikes Sunday near Kyiv and elsewhere in an apparent effort to weaken Ukraine's military capacity before the anticipated assault in the east. After the humiliating loss of the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, Russia's military command vowed Friday to step up missile strikes on the capital. The Russian military said Sunday that it had attacked an ammunition plant near Kyiv overnight with precision-guided missiles, the third such strike in as many days. Russia's stepped-up attacks on Kyiv came after it accused Ukraine on Thursday of wounding seven people and damaging about 100 residential buildings with airstrikes in Bryansk, a region bordering Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed hitting targets in Russia. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a Saturday strike on what Russia's Defense Ministry identified as an armored vehicle plant killed one person and wounded several. He advised residents who fled the city earlier in the war not to return. The Russian military also claimed Sunday to have destroyed Ukrainian air defense radars in the east, near Sievierodonetsk, as well as several ammunition depots elsewhere. Explosions were reported overnight in Kramatorsk, an eastern city where rockets killed at least 57 people at a train station crowded with civilians trying to evacuate before the expected Russian offensive. The ongoing siege and relentless bombardment of Mariupol has come at a terrible cost, with officials estimating Russians had killed at least 21,000 people. Just 120,000 people remain in the city, out of a prewar population of 450,000. Malyar, the deputy defense minister, said the Russians have continued to hit Mariupol with airstrikes and could be getting ready for an amphibious landing to beef up their ground forces. Capturing the city with a land area about half the size of Hong Kong's and home to a Sea of Azov port would also allow Russia to secure a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. So far, tunnels at the sprawling Azovstal steel mill, which covers an area of more than 4.2 square miles, have allowed the defenders to hide and resist until they run out of ammunition. With Russia apparently poised to declare victory, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the city's fall could scuttle any attempt at a negotiated peace. ""The destruction of all our guys in Mariupol — what they are doing now — can put an end to any format of negotiations,"" Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian journalists. In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy called on the West to send more heavy weapons immediately if there is any chance of saving the city, adding Russia ""is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there."" Like Mariupol, the northeast city of Kharkiv has been an ongoing target of Russian aggression. Mayor Ihor Terekhov said three people were killed and 34 wounded Saturday. One explosion believed to have been caused by a missile sent rescue workers scrambling near an outdoor market. The workers said one person was killed and at least 18 wounded. Local officials said 10 people died in rocket attacks on residential areas of Kharkiv on Friday. Nate Mook, a member of the World Central Kitchen NGO run by celebrity chef José Andrés, said in a tweet that four workers in Kharkiv were wounded by a strike. Andrés tweeted that staff members were unnerved but safe. Zelenskyy estimated that 2,500 to 3,000 Ukrainian troops have died in the war, and about 10,000 have been wounded. The office of Ukraine's prosecutor general said Saturday that at least 200 children have been killed, and more than 360 wounded. Despite the war still raging, Zelenskyy spoke in his nightly address about Ukraine's plans for a memorial to honor the dead and the sacrifices of the Ukrainian people. One proposal is to tell the story of the destroyed bridge near the capital that people used to escape, ""to remind all generations of our people of the brutal and senseless invasion Ukraine has been able to fend off,"" he said.",17,5.126163379940566,1.2190283616594106,3.9071350182811555,17

""The remainings of the Ukrainian army and large group of civilians are basically encircled by the Russian forces.

Russian troops have suffered a series of setbacks since President Vladimir Putin launched his war against Ukraine in late February, with his forces failing to take Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv and the Russian navy losing the flagship of its Black Sea fleet. Ukrainian security agents also captured Viktor Medvedchuk, an oligarch who was the Kremlin's main agent of influence in Kyiv, in another loss for Putin. Kuleba said that as a citizen of Ukraine, Medvedchuk will have ""all procedural rights."" ""His future will be decided as part of, on the one hand, legal process and on the other hand, the political process. We do not exclude any political options,"" he said. ""But as I said, we are a country of the rule of law. And first and foremost, he will face responsibility for the crimes he committed against Ukraine."" But Mariupol, a key port city for Ukraine, appeared on the brink of falling to Russian forces Sunday, which would give Moscow a land corridor to the Crimean peninsula. The Russian military estimated roughly 2,500 Ukrainian fighters are still at the Azovstal steel plant, providing a remaining pocket of resistance. Officials estimate roughly 21,000 have been killed by Russian troops in Mariupol, and 120,000 people are still in the city. Before the war, the city's population was 450,000. Echoing comments from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about possible talks with Russia, Kuleba said the fall of Mariupol could significantly hamper any negotiations. ""After Bucha, it became particularly difficult to continue talking with the Russians,"" he said, referring to atrocities against civilians committed by Russian troops in the city outside of Kyiv. ""But as my president mentioned, Mariupol may be a red line."" With Russia appearing to be nearing victory in Mariupol, Ukrainian officials are also preparing for intensified attacks in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have control of some territory. Kuleba said he also expects ""desperate attempts of the Russian forces … to finish with Mariupol at any cost,"" and for missile attacks on Kyiv and other cities to continue. To bolster Ukraine's defenses in the war, the U.S. has sent more than $2.6 billion in security aid, with President Biden last week approving an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition and other equipment. The U.S. is also considering sending a high-level official to Kyiv as a show of support, though the White House has repeatedly said there are no plans for Mr. Biden to visit the country. Kuleba praised the president for the military aid that has been sent to Ukraine and said a visit by Mr. Biden would be an ""important message of support"" to the Ukrainians. ""A personal meeting between two presidents could also pave the way for new supplies and of U.S. weapons to Ukraine and also for discussions on the political- possible political settlement of this conflict,"" he said.",17,1.344005155645642,5.511792174466271,-4.167787018820628,16

""The Russians pose a serious and persistent threat,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told correspondent Bill Whitaker for a report on 60 Minutes this week. ""It is very much the type of activity that we are warning about today when it comes to Russia's response to the world's response to the horror in Ukraine."" Between 2012 and 2017, the Justice Department says, three Russian intelligence agents and accomplices targeted the energy sector, hacking hundreds of companies and organizations around the world. Russian hackers also managed to get inside the computer network at a nuclear power company in Kansas, the indictment says. Monaco said that although these incidents occurred in the past, Americans should be prepared for similar attacks. ""We are seeing Russian state actors scanning, probing, looking for opportunities, looking for weaknesses in our systems on critical infrastructure, on businesses,"" Monaco said. In the summer of 2017, a DOJ indictment says, Russian hackers launched a cyberattack on the safety system of an overseas oil refinery, which forced the entire plant to shut down. Investigators have identified the plant as Saudi Arabia's Petro Rabigh petrochemical and refinery complex. Robert Lee, a former NSA hacker and co-founder of cybersecurity company Dragos, investigated the attack. He said the hackers could have set off explosions and released toxic chemicals in the Saudi plant with the malware they installed, known as ""Triton."" ""It's the first time in history we've ever seen a cyberattack explicitly designed to kill people,"" Lee said. ""It targets safety systems. And these safety systems are only there to protect lives. So going after that system explicitly, the only reason to do it is to hurt people."" Lee says disaster was averted, only because the hackers made a small error in their software. ""Instead of actually causing the effects they were looking to achieve, like an explosion where you'd kill people, instead it simply shut down the plant,"" he said. Lee also investigated two incidents in Ukraine widely considered the most destructive cyberattacks on civilian infrastructure the world has ever seen. In 2015, Lee says, Russian hackers from the military intelligence agency, the GRU, broke into three different Ukrainian power companies' networks, and waited quietly before launching their full-scale attack. ""They broke in over the summer, got into position and they started learning how to operate those systems,"" Lee said. ""And as a result, they disconnected over 60 substations across Ukraine and caused blackouts for around 225,000 customers in the dead of winter."" A year later, Lee says, GRU hackers were back with a much more sophisticated attack – an automated piece of malware that could cripple multiple transmission stations with one keystroke. ""It was a shock to everybody because there's been a lot of theory around how you could do this,"" Lee said. ""People in my community on the cybersecurity side have been talking about this for a long time on – it's possible. But to actually see it demonstrated is a giant proof that you can do it.

2022-04-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/ukraine-war-prompts-new-u-s-army-readiness-training-exercises-in-california-desert/,Ukraine War Prompts New U.S. Army Readiness-Training Exercises in California Desert,"FORT IRWIN, Calif. (AP) -- In the dusty California desert, U.S. Army trainers are already using lessons learned from Russia's war against Ukraine as they prepare soldiers for future fights against a major adversary such as Russia or China. The role-players in this month's exercise at the National Training Center speak Russian. The enemy force that controls the fictional town of Ujen is using a steady stream of social media posts to make false accusations against the American brigade preparing to attack. In the coming weeks, the planned training scenario for the next brigade coming in will focus on how to battle an enemy willing to destroy a city with rocket and missile fire in order to conquer it. If the images seem familiar, they are, playing out on televisions and websites worldwide right now as Russian forces pound Ukrainian cities with airstrikes, killing scores of civilians. The information war on social media has showcased impassioned nightly speeches by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Russian efforts to accuse Ukraine's forces of faking mass killings in towns such as Bucha — massacres that the West blames on Moscow's troops. ""I think right now the whole Army is really looking at what's happening in Ukraine and trying to learn lessons,"" said Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. Those lessons, she said, range from Russia's equipment and logistics troubles to communications and use of the internet. ""The Russia-Ukraine experience is a very powerful illustration for our Army of how important the information domain is going to be,"" said Wormuth, who spent two days at the training center in the Mojave Desert watching an Army brigade wage war against the fictional ""Denovian"" forces. ""We've been talking about that for about five years. But really seeing it and seeing the way Zelenskyy has been incredibly powerful. ... This is a world war that the actual world can see and watch in real time. "" At the center, the commander, Brig. Gen. Curt Taylor, and his staff have ripped pages out of the Russian playbook to ensure that U.S. soldiers are ready to fight and win against a sophisticated near-peer enemy. It's a common tool. For example, his base and the Joint Readiness Training Center in Louisiana both shifted to counterinsurgency training during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. And the military services have focused other training on how to fight in cold weather -- mimicking conditions in Russia or North Korea. But these latest changes have happened quickly in the early months after Russia invaded Ukraine. About 4,500 soldiers from 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, based at Fort Hood, Texas, are out in the vast desert training area at Fort Irwin, where they will spend two weeks fighting the NTC's resident 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which acts as the enemy military. Soldiers from the regiment -- known as Blackhorse -- are arrayed in and around Ujen, which also includes role-players acting as the locals. As the sun was rising earlier this past week, Army Col. Ian Palmer, the brigade commander, stood on Crash Hill, on the outskirts of the town, preparing his soldiers to launch an attack. Lines of tanks spread out in the distance. Heavy winds the night before hampered his progress, so the attack was a bit behind. He said the exercise is using more drones by the friendly and enemy forces, both for surveillance and attacks. So his forces are trying to use camouflage and tuck into the terrain to stay out of sight. ""You know if you can be seen, you can be shot, where ever you are,"" he said. Down in the makeshift town, the opposition forces are confident they can hold off Palmer's brigade despite the size difference. The Denovians only have about 1,350 forces but they are throwing everything they have at the brigade, from jamming and other electronic warfare to insurgency attacks and propaganda. The role-players have their phones ready to film and post quickly to social media. The Denovian forces want to portray the unit in the worst possible light, said Taylor, and constantly twist the narrative on social media so Palmer's troops realize they are in a battle for the truth. That's a challenge, he said, because ""when I've got a bunch of casualties and I'm getting overrun on my left flank and my supply trains aren't where they need to be and I can't find the bulldozers, it's hard to think about something that someone said about me on Twitter."" The training goal, said Taylor, is teaching the brigades that come in how to fuse all elements of their combat power into a coordinated assault. ""Everyone can play an instrument but it's about making music -- bringing it all together in a synchronized fashion. And what you saw today was the artillery was doing the artillery thing, the aviation was doing the aviation thing and the maneuver guys were doing the maneuver thing. But part of the delay in their assault on the town was they couldn't synchronize those three,"" he said. Again, they can look to Ukraine to see how Russia failed to do that in the early weeks of the war. U.S. leaders repeatedly noted that in Russia's initial multipronged assault in Ukraine, commanders consistently failed to provide the airstrikes and support their ground troops needed to move into key cities such as Kyiv. That failure led to Russian troops bombing the cities from the outskirts, hitting hospitals, apartment buildings and other structures and killing civilians. So when the next brigade arrives as the training center, Taylor said it will face an enemy on board with doing just that. ""We will be very focused on how to fight against an adversary that is willing to destroy infrastructure because that's how we think our adversaries will fight,"" Taylor said. ""We've got to be prepared for urban combat where we have an adversary that is indiscriminately firing artillery."" Wormuth, the Army secretary, said seeing the training also underscored other lessons the U.S. is taking from the war in Ukraine. ""As we're watching what's happening to the Russians now, it's informative for us to think about what is right, from a modernization standpoint,"" she said, noting that some U.S. tanks are very heavy and the terrain in Europe is muddier, not like the hard-packed sand of the desert. The Army, she said, has to determine ""what's the right balance between the mobility of a tank, the survivability of a tank and the lethality of a tank? If you want to make it more mobile, you make it lighter, but that makes it less survivable. And so you have to decide where you're going to take risks."" © Copyright 2022 Associated Press.

2022-04-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/volodymyr-zelenskyy-urges-europe-end-russia-energy-dependence/,"As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urges Europe to end energy dependence on Russia, more weapons head to Ukraine","President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants Europe to end its energy dependence on Russia — and stop the flow of cash it funnels to Moscow. In a video message, the Ukrainian leader said the length of this war — and how many Ukrainians are killed — will be decided by how quickly Ukraine's friends supply it with weapons and enforce an oil embargo against Russia. While U.S. and allied nations' economic sanctions on Russia are painful, they are not severe enough to stop Russia's offensive, he said Friday. Russian forces have failed to capture Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, plagued by military failures and a Ukrainian resistance much tougher than many expected. But explosions were reported in the capital, which Russia had recently threatened to invade before retreating, and in the western city Lviv on Saturday morning. Ukraine is also bracing for a fresh assault in the east, which is still being pummeled from the air, as Russian forces regroup. Nadezhda Aleksandrova says she wanted to flee her home in eastern Ukraine — but left it too late. Her son Sergei was killed by Russian shelling in their apartment. ""The glass from the window fell down, she says, and I saw him lying in a pool of blood,"" she told CBS News. Officials in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih say they managed to stop Russian forces seizing control of this strategically important airport at the start of the war. Their plan was low tech, but ingenious: parking trucks and construction vehicles on the runway. On the second day of war, a cargo plane normally used by airborne troops and three fighter jets tried to land, Oleksander Vilkul, head of the military administration, told CBS News foreign correspondent Holly Williams. They descended to about 200 meters, made a few circles and once they realized they couldn't land, they left. Creative tactics help, but Ukrainian forces are massively outgunned by Russia. Vilkul said Ukrainian forces can't win the war without more weapons from the West. ""We need fighter jets, tanks, missiles, the whole spectrum of weapons,"" he told CBS News. The White House says another $800 million in weapons should arrive in Ukraine soon, including heavy artillery and more javelin anti-tank missiles. ""We're continuing to supply Ukraine with the weapons and resources to defend their country,"" President Joe Biden said earlier this month. ""You know, we won't be able to advertise every piece of security we give because our allies and partners are supplying to Ukraine through us, but advanced weapons and ammunition are flowing in every single day.""",14,3.267607420111379,2.8953063907930137,0.3723010293183653,20
2022-04-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kyiv-ukraine-russia-attack-moskva-sink/,Russia warns of further attacks on Kyiv after sinking of flagship Moskva warship,"Russia's defense ministry warned Friday that Moscow would intensify its missile attacks on Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv, one day after Russia's flagship military vessel, the Moskva, sank in the Black Sea due to what Ukraine claimed was a Ukrainian missile strike. Russia said the symbolically important ship sank because of a fire. Moscow said it would intensify strikes around Kyiv in retaliation for what it called Ukrainian ""terrorist attacks"" or ""sabotage"" on Russian territory. On Thursday, it accused Ukraine of carrying out attacks on Russian border areas. In response, Ukraine's security services published audio it alleged was an intercepted phone call in which a Russian serviceman said Russian forces had carried out the attacks themselves. Neither the Russian nor the Ukrainian reports could be independently verified. The Kyiv area was hit Friday by some of the most powerful explosions heard in two weeks, and Russia said it had targeted a Ukrainian missile plant. A renewed bombardment of the capital city itself could return residents to a heightened state of caution, after Russia's pullback from the area to refocus its attack on the eastern Donbas region. Evidence of Russian atrocities continued to be collected by authorities around Kyiv from areas that had been occupied by Russian forces. Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, told CBS News' Tony Dokoupil earlier this week that her department was investigating at least 6,000 cases of war crimes. ""It's very important to collect all evidence and to find all possibilities to work with international partners for all future proceedings in the court,"" she said. Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksii Honcharenko took CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesay to the village of Havronschyna, where a family of five was allegedly gunned down as they tried to flee. The youngest was only two years old. A stroller could be seen in the family's burned out car, as well as snacks like apples and granola bars. ""I have son. My own son is three years old. It's so hard,"" Honcharenko said. Local farmer Yuriy Patsan said he witnessed a Russian armored vehicle open fire on the family car with high-caliber explosive rounds, even though the car had a sign in the back window that read ""children."" He said he tried to save the family, but they died in his arms. ""All I could do was bury them. We're not dogs like the Russian soldiers,"" Patsan said. Once the Russians left the area, Patsan and the Ukrainian police exhumed the bodies for investigation. ""It's definitely a war crime, because without any reason, civilians were killed,"" said Honrachenko. ""The world should know that it is not fake. The world should know who is Russian regime. Who is Putin.""",17,1.53000885099061,1.864771101081359,-0.334762250090749,22
2022-04-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kyiv-ukraine-civilian-deaths-execution-style-police/,"More than 900 civilian bodies found in Kyiv region, and many were ""simply executed,"" police say","More than 900 civilian bodies have been discovered in the region surrounding the Ukrainian capital following the withdrawal of Russian forces — most of them fatally shot, police said Friday, an indication that many people were ""simply executed."" The jarring numbers emerged shortly after Russia's Defense Ministry promised to step up missile attacks on Kyiv in response to Ukraine's alleged aggression on Russian territory. That ominous warning followed the stunning loss of Moscow's flagship in the Black Sea, which a senior U.S. defense official said Friday was indeed hit by at least one Ukrainian missile. Amid its threats, Moscow continued preparations for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine. Fighting also went on in the pummeled southern port city of Mariupol, where locals reported seeing Russian troops digging up bodies. In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, shelling of a residential area killed seven people, including a 7-month-old child, and wounded 34, according to regional Gov. Oleh Sinehubov. Around Kyiv, Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv's regional police force, said bodies were abandoned in the streets or given temporary burials. He cited police data indicating that 95% died from gunshot wounds. ""Consequently, we understand that under the (Russian) occupation, people were simply executed in the streets,"" Nebytov said. More bodies are being found every day, under rubble and in mass graves, he added. The largest number of victims were found in Bucha, where there were more than 350, he said. According to Nebytov, utilities workers in Bucha gathered and buried bodies in the Kyiv suburb while it remained under Russian control. Russian troops, he added, were ""tracking down"" people who expressed strong pro-Ukrainian views. More damage could be on the way for Kyiv after Russian authorities accused Ukraine of wounding seven people and damaging about 100 residential buildings with airstrikes in Bryansk, a region bordering Ukraine. Authorities in another border region of Russia also reported Ukrainian shelling Thursday. ""The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Russia used missiles to destroy a facility for the repair and production of missile systems in Kyiv, Konashenkov said. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed striking targets in Russia, and the reports could not be independently verified. However, Ukrainian officials said their forces did strike a key Russian warship with missiles. And after more than a day of the Pentagon saying it could not confirm the claim, a senior U.S. defense official said it now believes the Moskva was hit Wednesday by at least one, and probably two, missiles, creating the large fire aboard. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence assessment. The guided-missile cruiser Moskva, named for the Russian capital, then sank while being towed to port Thursday after suffering heavy damage. Though Moscow did not acknowledge any attack, the loss of the ship represents an important victory for Ukraine and a symbolic defeat for Russia. The Moskva had the capacity to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles. The last time a warship as large as the Moskva sank in combat was 1982. A British submarine torpedoed an Argentine navy cruiser called the ARA General Belgrano during the Falklands War, killing over 300 sailors. The sinking of the Russian warship reduces Russia's firepower in the Black Sea, although military analysts disagreed on the event's significance to the course of the war. Either way, the loss was viewed as emblematic of Moscow's fortunes in a seven-week invasion widely seen as a historic blunder following the retreat from the Kyiv region and much of northern Ukraine. ""A 'flagship' Russian warship is a worthy diving site. We have one more diving spot in the Black Sea now. Will definitely visit the wreck after our victory in the war,"" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov tweeted Friday. In his nightly address Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainians they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders ""gave us a maximum of five."" Russia's warning of renewed airstrikes did not stop Kyiv residents from taking advantage of a sunny and slightly warmer spring day as the weekend approached. More people than usual were out on the streets Friday, walking dogs, riding electric scooters and strolling hand in hand. In one central park, a small group of people including a woman draped in a Ukrainian flag danced to the music of a portable speaker. In Kyiv, a renewed bombardment could mean a return to the steady wail of air raid sirens heard during the early days of the invasion and to fearful nights sheltering in subway stations. Tentative signs of pre-war life have resurfaced in the capital after Russian troops failed to capture the city and retreated to concentrate on eastern Ukraine, leaving behind evidence of possible war crimes. Residents reported hearing explosions in parts of Kyiv overnight, but it was not clear what sites were targeted. News about the Moskva overshadowed Russian claims of advances in the southern port city of Mariupol, which Moscow's forces have blockaded since the early days of the invasion. Dwindling numbers of Ukrainian defenders have held out against a siege that has come at a horrific cost to trapped and starving civilians. Mariupol's mayor said this week that more than 10,000 civilians had died and the death toll could surpass 20,000. Other Ukrainian officials have said they expect to find evidence in Mariupol of atrocities against civilians like the ones discovered in Bucha and other towns outside Kyiv. The Mariupol City Council said Friday that locals reported seeing Russian troops digging up bodies that were buried in residential courtyards and not allowing new burials ""of people killed by them."" ""Why the exhumation is being carried out and where the bodies will be taken is unknown,"" the council said on the Telegram messaging app. Mariupol's capture would allow Russian forces in the south, which came up through the annexed Crimean Peninsula, to fully link up with troops in the Donbas region, Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland and the target of the looming offensive. Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas since 2014, the same year Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine. Russia has recognized the independence of two rebel-held areas of the region. Also Friday, a Russian rocket hit an airport at night in the central city of Oleksandriia, Mayor Serhiy Kuzmenko said via Facebook. He made no mention of casualties. Although it's not certain when Russia will launch the full-scale campaign, a regional Ukrainian official said Friday that seven people died and 27 were injured after Russian forces opened fire on buses carrying civilians in the village of Borovaya, near the northeastern city of Kharkiv. The claim could not be independently verified. Dmytro Chubenko, a spokesman for the regional prosecutor's office, told Ukraine's Suspilne news website that Ukrainian authorities had opened criminal proceedings in connection with a suspected ""violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with premeditated murder."" A large explosion also struck the eastern city of Kramatorsk, where a missile strike on a train station a week earlier killed more than 50 people as thousands heeding warnings to evacuate the Donbas area waited to leave. Associated Press journalists in Kramatorsk heard the sound of a rocket or missile and then the blast, followed by sirens wailing Friday. It was not immediately clear what was hit or whether there were casualties. A day earlier, a factory in the same city was hit by an airstrike. The Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that Russian strikes in the Kharkiv region ""liquidated a squad of mercenaries from a Polish private military company"" of up to 30 people and ""liberated"" an iron and steel factory in Mariupol. The claims could not be independently verified. On Thursday, the Defense Ministry explained the damage to the Moskva by saying that a fire had caused ammunition on board to detonate. Apart from the cruise missiles, the Moskva also carried air-defense missiles and other guns. The ministry did not say what might have caused the blaze but reported that the crew, which usually numbers about 500, abandoned the vessel. It was not clear if there were any casualties. Maksym Marchenko, governor of Ukraine's Black Sea region of Odesa, said Ukrainian forces struck the Moskva with two Neptune missiles and caused ""serious damage."" The Neptune is an anti-ship missile recently developed by Ukraine based on an earlier Soviet design.",17,1.7553634701791718,5.643692958916602,-3.88832948873743,17

A photo of the note was shared on Twitter by Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs. Galia wrote the letter on March 8, less than two weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the deadly attack. ""Mum, this letter is your present,"" she wrote. ""...If you think that you nurtured me for no reason, you are not right. Thank you for the 9 years of my life. Thank you so much for my childhood. You are the best mother in the world!

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that the situation there is even worse than those in its neighboring city of Bucha, where horrific images have surfaced of slaughtered civilians. Last Thursday, investigators found 26 bodies among rubble in Borodyanka. Ukrainian troops were able to recently regain control over the city from Russian troops, according to Reuters. As of Monday, local rescuers were still attempting to find missing residents. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said that ""tens of thousands of people have already been killed"" in Ukraine.

The crash happened some 34 miles south of the ancient city of Luxor, as it was travelling to the temples of Esna on the west bank of the Nile River, provincial authorities said in a statement. Along with the tourists, five Egyptians were killed in the crash. At least 14 others were injured, including eight from France and six from Belgium, they said. They had ""broken bones, bruises and superficial injuries"" but all were in a stable condition, the governor of the southern province of Aswan said, AFP reported. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Footage that circulated online showed a tourist bus in flames with people trying to put out the fire. ""A guest is dying inside,"" one person was heard screaming. The bus in the video bore the logo of state-owned Misr Travel. The Cairo-based agency did not respond to a request for comment. Aswan Provincial Governor Ashraf Attia said the injured were taken to hospitals and were in stable condition. Wednesday's accident came five days after a bus crashed on a highway near the Red Sea, killing three including two Polish tourists. Deadly traffic accidents claim thousands of lives every year in Egypt, which has a poor transportation safety record. The crashes and collisions are mostly caused by speeding, bad roads or poor enforcement of traffic laws. Egypt's official statistics agency says there were around 10,000 road accidents in 2019, the most recent year for which statistics are available, leaving over 3,480 dead. In 2018, there were 8,480 car accidents, causing over 3,080 deaths. Egypt had begun reviving its vital tourism industry by promoting its ancient heritage, after the country's 2011 revolution and ensuing unrest struck the sector. But the arrival of the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the subsequent global travel bans resulted in a plunge in tourism revenues to $4 billion, from $13 billion the previous year. The sector employs some two million people in a country of 103 million and generates more than 10 percent of GDP. In August 2021, Russia resumed flights to Egyptian resorts six years after a Russian airliner crashed after taking off from Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all 224 people on board. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has yet again cut off much of the flow of tourists to Egypt, as the two countries accounted for about 40 percent of visitors prior to the war. The current administration of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has invested heavily in promoting tourism, having organized major events in a bid to attract visitors. Last April, the North African country staged a procession of floats carrying the mummified remains of 22 pharaohs, including Egypt's most powerful ancient queen, to a new resting place in Cairo. And in November, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities held a grand ceremony to mark the reopening of the ancient Avenue of Sphinxes in the city of Luxor. Since last year, visitors from dozens of additional countries have been permitted to obtain visas on arrival to Egypt, than applying in advance. While attacks on tourists have largely ceased since they peaked in the 1990s, deadly incidents have occurred. In September 2015, eight Mexicans were mistakenly killed by security forces in the vast Western Desert. And in February 2019, a German woman and two Egyptian children were killed when a building collapsed in a residential neighborhood of the southern city of Luxor.

2022-04-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-rape-allegations-russian-occupied-areas/,"Rape ""happening systematically"" in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, Ukrainian lawmaker Kira Rudyk says","As Russian troops retreated from areas around Kyiv, officials, aid workers and journalists received reports from local residents that soldiers had raped them. A Ukrainian lawmaker said that sexual violence is ""systematic in all the areas that were occupied by the Russians."" ""Rape is used as a tool of war in Ukraine to break our spirits, to humiliate us and to show us that we can be helpless to protect our women and children and their bodies,"" Kira Rudyk, a member of Ukraine's Parliament, told CBS News. ""It is happening systematically in the occupied territories."" Rudyk has been gathering evidence and testimonials in the hope that the perpetrators will eventually face justice. ""At first, we were working on making sure that women are safe and receive medical help. And I can tell you that some of them were indeed pregnant of Russian soldiers who raped them,"" Rudyk said. She visited Bucha shortly after Russian troops left, and once people's immediate medical needs were attended to, she said she used a combination of phone records and documents that were left behind ""to get the names and last names of the soldiers who were committing those crimes… We are right now collecting more and more evidence and information about them."" Horrifying accounts of sexual violence and rape have been reported from areas which had been previously occupied by Russian forces as they pull back to refocus their attack on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The full the scale of the atrocities is not and may never be known. Rudyk heard a story of a women being raped in front of her family members, as well as one of a woman being repeatedly visited and raped over many days. ""I wish he had killed me instead of what he did,"" 83-year-old retired school teacher Vera told CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams, who visited the small village in southern Ukraine where she lives shortly after the Russian soldiers who had been occupying it left. Visibly distressed, Vera said that a Russian fighter from Donetsk had raped her in her house with her disabled husband in the next room. ""I asked [the soldier], 'What do you have against our government? We weren't the ones who started the war.' God, I wish I hadn't said that. I tempted fate. He said I was too smart,"" Vera told CBS News. ""He said get up. I got up. He grabbed me by the back of the neck. He squeezed it. I started to choke. I couldn't breathe. He asked me who was in the house. I said only my sick old man, no one else… and then it started."" Vera said the police told her that two other women in her small village had also been raped — another retiree and a younger woman — and that there was a similar case in a neighboring town that had also been occupied. Vera said that, even though the occupiers had left her village, she was still petrified every night. ""I'm sad. Everything hurts. I'm in a state where I'm neither dead nor alive."" Under international law, rape during conflict can be a war crime, a crime against humanity and — when linked with the intent to eliminate a group — part of genocide. Rudyk said Russian forces used rape as a tool to terrorize people, because Ukrainians were putting up such fierce resistance to the invasion. ""They're trying to figure out ways to break us. Well, it's not working right now. It's just making us angry and bringing more and more people wanting to fight, wanting to protect our peaceful cities from this atrocity,"" she said. Rudyk said she didn't believe Russian troops had been ordered to rape Ukrainian women, ""but they were told to do whatever they want, which is basically allowing them to do that."" Aid organizations are working to help send rape kits and emergency contraception to Ukraine to attend to immediate medical needs and facilitate the collection of evidence. On Wednesday, the United Nations announced a set of global guidelines on how to collect evidence from witnesses, victims and survivors of sexual violence in conflict zones.

2022-04-12,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-hackers-ukraine-power-plant/,"Russian military hackers targeted Ukrainian power company, Ukrainian officials say","Sandworm, a Russian state-sponsored hacking group, attempted to infiltrate Ukrainian power substations of a private energy company to deploy malicious code capable of shutting off electricity to two million people, Ukrainian government officials and cyber researchers said Tuesday. The cyberattack, which Russia's military spy agency originally planned for Friday evening, appears to have fallen short of cutting off power. The Ukrainian government's computer emergency response team said it was able to stop the hackers from ""carrying out [their] malicious intent.""Top Ukrainian cyber official Victor Zhora said the attack was ""effectively rebuffed."" According to cyber researchers, the hacking group, which the Justice Department has previously linked to GRU Russian military intelligence, used damaging malware known as ""Industroyer ICS,"" which is designed to disrupt civilian electrical supply by targeting high-voltage electrical substations, according to cybersecurity firm ESET. This was the work of ""military IT hackers from the Russian Federation,"" Zhora said, and the investigation is ongoing. The malware ""was empowered to send commands to the switchers,"" Zhora explained, noting the malicious code was more sophisticated than the version deployed during the NotPetya attack. Russian-backed hackers tried to cover their tracks by deploying CaddyWiper and other data-wiping malware after the intrusion. For years, Russia-backed hackers have tested their cyber weapons on Ukraine. The 2017 NotPetya attack by the GRU, deployed the same tactics as the 2020 SolarWinds attack that compromised nine U.S. government agencies and scores of American companies, sabotaging a widely-used piece of software to break into thousands of Ukraine's networks. CISA Director Jen Easterly tweeted Tuesday that the agency is working closely with Ukrainian officials to understand the incident and relay relevant information to U.S. infrastructure partners. The Sandworm hacking group has succeeded in cutting power to parts of Ukraine in the past, in 2015 and 2016. ""Proud of Ukrainian cyber defenders and ESET this morning,"" John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis at Mandiant tweeted Tuesday. ""This is a big win against a determined adversary. You're setting the standard for defenders."" Ukrainian officials said they first learned of the intrusion on April 7, the eve of the planned attack on April 8. Ukrainian officials declined to say which specific energy company or facilities had been targeted. ""The name of the facility cannot be put into public domain,"" Zhora said. But he added that the cyber attack ""was supposed to inflict serious damages and consequences both for the staff of the facility who were renovating and renewing the electricity supplies of the facilities [targeted] and for the ordinary customers coming back home."" Since the hackers planned to launch their attack on Friday evening, Ukrainian officials speculated that any outage could have affected Ukrainians who ""were looking to television to know what was going on in the country, the news from the front line."" While this incident failed to cause any electricity outages, Zhora noted the malware code ""has been successful at getting into the management technological system."" He added, ""There were some disruptions at one of the components in the system, but we detected it immediately and fixed it."" The attack did impact a few networks within one company. Investigators are continuing to check ""to see if remnants of codes are in other energy facilities,"" in an effort to prevent similar attacks. Ukraine's computer security team indicated in a Facebook post Tuesday that the targeted organization ""suffered two waves of attacks."" The first compromise occurred ""no later than February 2022,"" and ""the power outage and the removal of the company's infrastructure were scheduled for Friday evening, April 8, 2022,"" but ""at the moment has been prevented."" Ukrainian officials stressed that despite the seriousness of this attack, the onslaught isn't new. ""We are dealing with an opponent that has been constantly draining us for eight years in the cyber space, drilling us since 2014. We've been on the end of constant aggression,"" Zhora said.",3,5.627970254779237,4.13241279918622,1.4955574555930173,1
2022-04-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-putin-new-commander-dvornikov-donbas/,"After failures, Russia puts general with a worrying history in Syria in charge of Putin's Ukraine war","Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine — Military analysts say Russia's war in Ukraine has been marked by ineptitude and a lack of professionalism. Now, it seems Moscow is trying to fix that problem. President Vladimir Putin's military — accused of committing war crimes in its failed attempt to capture the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv — has put General Alexander Dvornikov in charge of Russia's invasion, according to a U.S. official. Dvornikov previously led Russia's forces in Syria, where the United Nations accused them of committing war crimes including airstrikes targeting civilian areas and infrastructure. The commander's appointment to take over Russian operations in Ukraine comes after a catalogue of military failures. Russian forces were defeated in the battle for Kyiv and have withdrawn from around the capital city. The security situation in Kyiv has improved so dramatically that on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky walked through the middle of the city with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""We simply wish to keep on supporting the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Johnson said. His mere presence in the heavily fortified capital was a powerful message. Ukrainian officials claim nearly 20,000 Russian troops have been killed in the country since Putin launched his invasion on February 24. The Kremlin admits to only a small fraction of those losses, but plenty of videos have shown Russia's tanks and armored vehicles being picked off by Ukrainian forces — with everything from advanced anti-tank missiles from the U.S., to Molotov cocktails. Now, under the command of Dvornikov, Russia is switching its focus to eastern Ukraine's Donbas regions, where Ukrainian forces have already been fighting against Russian-backed separatists for eight years. Just a few days ago a column of Russian vehicles at least eight miles long was spotted heading for the region. Ukraine is bracing for a renewed onslaught in Donbas, and with Dvornikov's brutal history of levelling Syrian cities to quash resistance, and Russia's recent record of pummeling southern Ukrainian towns from afar, there's every reason to fear a new wave of attacks on civilians. President Zelenskyy said Monday that tens of thousands of Ukrainians were thought to have been killed in the port city of Mariupol alone after weeks of relentless Russian bombardment. As the city remains under siege, it hasn't yet been possible for people to emerge from their hiding places to take account of the true cost of Russia's assault.",14,3.824758659863016,4.81730417913846,-0.9925455192754438,12

The specific Russian phrase has a meaning closer to ""on behalf of children"" or ""in retaliation for an attack on children,"" rather than ""aimed at children."" The attack came as workers elsewhere in the country unearthed at least 67 bodies from a mass grave near a church in Bucha, a town near Kyiv, where graphic evidence of dozens of killings emerged following the withdrawal of Russian forces. Russia has falsely claimed that the scenes in Bucha were staged. Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk has said investigators found at least three sites of mass shootings of civilians and were still finding bodies in yards, parks and city squares — 90% of which were victims who had been shot. Some of the grisliest evidence so far has been found in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv, from which Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops pulled back in recent days. An international organization formed to identify the dead and missing from the 1990s Balkans conflicts is sending a team of forensics experts to Ukraine to help put names to bodies that might otherwise remain anonymous amid the fog of war. In an excerpted interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that aired Friday, Zelenskyy cited communications intercepted by the Ukrainian security service as evidence of Russian war crimes. ""There are (Russian) soldiers talking with their parents about what they stole and who they abducted. There are recordings of (Russian) prisoners of war who admitted to killing people,"" he said. ""There are pilots in prison who had maps with civilian targets to bomb. There are also investigations being conducted based on the remains of the dead."" Zelenskyy's comments echoed reporting from German news magazine Der Spiegel saying Germany's foreign intelligence agency had intercepted Russian military radio traffic in which soldiers may have discussed civilian killings in Bucha. The weekly also reported that the recordings indicated the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was involved in atrocities there. German government officials would not confirm or deny the report, but two former German ministers filed a war crimes complaint Thursday. Russia has denied that its military was involved in war crimes. After failing to occupy Kyiv in the face of stiff resistance, Russian forces have set their sights on the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking, industrial region where Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years and control some of the area. Although the Kramatorsk train station is in Ukrainian government-controlled territory in the Donbas, the separatists, who work closely with Russian troops, blamed Ukraine for the attack. Western experts, however, dismissed Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov's assertion that Russian forces ""do not use"" Tochka-U missiles, the type that hit the station. A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, told the Associated Press that Russian forces have used the missile — and that given the strike's location and impact, it was likely Russia's. Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, pointed to other occasions when Russian authorities have tried to deflect blame by claiming their forces no longer use an older weapon ""to kind of muddy the waters and try and create doubt."" He suggested Russia specifically chose the Tochka-U because Ukraine also possesses them. Ukrainian authorities and Western officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of committing atrocities in the war that began with Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. A total of 176 children have been killed in Ukraine since the start of the war, while 324 more have been wounded, the country's Prosecutor General's Office said Saturday. Ukrainian authorities have warned they expect to find evidence of more mass killings once they reach the southern port city of Mariupol, which is also in the Donbas and has been subjected to a monthlong Russian blockade. A senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal military assessments said Friday that the Pentagon believes Russia has lost between 15% and 20% of its combat power overall since the war began. While some combat units are withdrawing to be resupplied in Russia, Moscow has added thousands of troops around Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, in the country's east, the official said. Ukrainian officials have almost daily pleaded with Western powers to send more arms, and to further punish Russia with sanctions, including the exclusion of Russian banks from the global financial system and a total European Union embargo on Russian gas and oil. In Kharkiv, Lidiya Mezhiritska stood in the wreckage of her home after overnight missile strikes turned it to rubble. ""The 'Russian world,' they say,"" she said, wryly invoking Putin's nationalist justification for invading Ukraine. ""People, children, old people, women are dying. I don't have a machine gun. I would definitely go (fight), regardless of age.""",17,0.8651569066545156,3.7123641790006454,-2.8472072723461297,9

It's been done in full view of Bellingcat or New York Times satellites that are reporting on the facts,"" says International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband. ""It's the first cell phone war."" Miliband, a former Labour Party politician and former British foreign secretary, joined CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on ""The Takeout"" this week to discuss the war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis spawned by Russia's invasion. Miliband identified three categories of people suffering in the weekslong conflict so far: those still trapped in cities and unable to receive aid, like the citizens of Mariupol, those internally displaced inside Ukraine, and those who have fled to neighboring countries outside of Ukraine. He also criticized the U.S. and allies for their slowness to act. They ""should have taken literally and seriously the buildup that happened before February 24,"" when Russia launched its invasion. While Russia appears to have consolidated its forces and withdrawn from the area around Kyiv, the nation's capital, ""there remains real danger,"" he told Garrett. The targeting of civilian structures in Ukraine over the last several weeks has raised accusations of war crimes against Russia. ""If you're a soldier in a conflict, you don't have a right to life. But if you're a civilian in the conflict, you have a right to life,"" he told Garrett.

Around 4,000 people, mostly women and children, were at the train station at the time of the attack, the mayor of Kramatorsk said. Graphic images shared on social media appeared to show a number of casualties in civilian clothing. At least 52 people were killed, Ukrainian authorities said, according to the Associated Press. ""This is a deliberate strike on the passenger infrastructure of the railway and the residents of Kramatorsk,"" the head of the country's national railway, Alexander Kamyshin, wrote on social media.

""All statements by representatives of the Kyiv nationalist regime about the 'rocket attack' allegedly carried out by Russia on April 8 at the railway station in the city of Kramatorsk are a provocation and are absolutely untrue,"" the Russian defense ministry said. Officials have been warning that Russia would pull troops out of other areas of Ukraine and intensify its attacks on the eastern Donbas region, and civilians have been rushing to evacuate the area. ""We're going to get a lot of forces concentrating down there,"" Nick Reynolds, research analyst for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank, told CBS News. The speed at which the West can send military aid to help Ukraine will make a big difference in the country's ability to hold off a further Russian advance from the east. ""We're in a bit of an awkward position at the moment in supporting Ukraine because a lot of the stuff that's quite easy to transfer and easy to put into the field… these stocks have diminished,"" Reynolds said. Larger systems that would be useful to Ukraine, like the S-300, are more difficult to transport and will take time to arrive at the front. ""To a degree, this next month will decide quite a few things. The battle for Mariupol will significantly shape the political situation: what is possible and what is not possible for both the Ukrainians and the international community and for Russia,"" Reynolds told CBS News. He said that if the Russians are able to take the southeastern city of Mariupol, their strategic aims will become much more viable. ""But also, for the international community, it's very important,"" Reynolds said.

2022-04-08,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/spacex-launch-tourists-private-mission-international-space-station/,"SpaceX Launches First, All Private Mission To The International Space Station","CAPE CANAVERAL (CBSMiami/CNN) -- In a historic first, a crew of four civilians are taking a ride into orbit after successfully launching on a journey to the International Space Station on Friday as part of an inaugural mission for the commercial spaceflight company Axiom Space. A SpaceX rocket carrying the three paying customers and a former NASA astronaut took off at 11:17 a.m. from Kennedy Space Center, kicking off a first-of-its-kind mission that is taking the group on a 10-day mission to the International Space Station. The trip was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which seeks to book rocket rides, provide all the necessary training, and coordinate flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. It's all in line with the US government's and the private sector's goal to boost commercial activity on the ISS and beyond. On board this mission, called AX-1, are Michael Lopez-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut turned Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor. It's not the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts have visited the ISS, as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft for various wealthy thrill seekers in years past. But this is the first mission that will include a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps. It's also the first time private citizens will travel to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft. Here's everything you need to know. Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission — beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the ""tens of millions."" The mission is made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated. And the space agency has revealed some details on how much it'll charge for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory. Food alone costs $2,000 per day, per person, in space. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day. For each mission, bringing on the necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers another $5.2 million, and all the mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million. Lopez-Alegría, a veteran of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA, will command this mission as an Axiom employee. Russia is the United States' primary partner on the ISS, and the space station has long been hailed as a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation. US-Russian relations on the ground, however, have hit a fever pitch amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The United States and its allies have slapped hefty sanctions on Russia, and the country has retaliated in numerous ways, including by refusing to sell Russian rocket engines to US companies. The head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, has even taken to social media to threaten to pull out of the ISS agreement. Despite all the bluster, NASA has repeatedly sought to reassure that, behind the scenes, NASA and its Russian counterparts are working together seamlessly. ""NASA is aware of recent comments regarding the International Space Station. US sanctions and export control measures continue to allow US-Russia civil space cooperation on the space station,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a recent statement. ""The professional relationship between our international partners, astronauts and cosmonauts continues for the safety and mission of all on board the ISS."" This is a question stewing in the spaceflight community right now. The US government has traditionally awarded astronaut wings to anyone who travels more than 50 miles above the Earth's surface. But commercial astronaut wings — a relatively new designation handed out by the Federal Aviation Administration — might not be handed out quite so liberally. Last year, the FAA decided to end the entire Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program on January 1, 2022. Now, the FAA plans to simply list the names of everyone who flies above the 50-mile threshold on a website. Whether it's fair to still refer to people who pay their way to space as ""astronauts"" is an open question, and countless observers — including NASA astronauts — have weighed in. Not everyone is too concerned about mincing words. ""If you're strapping your butt to a rocket, I think that's worth something,"" former NASA astronaut Terry Virts told National Geographic when asked about the issue. ""When I was an F-16 pilot, I didn't feel jealous about Cessna pilots being called pilots. I think everybody's going to know if you paid to be a passenger on a five-minute suborbital flight or if you're the commander of an interplanetary space vehicle. Those are two different things."" If you ask the AX-1 crew, they don't love being referred to as ""tourists."" ""This mission is very different from what you may have heard of in some of the recent — especially suborbital — missions. We are not space tourists,"" Lopez-Alegría told reporters earlier this month, referring to the brief supersonic flights put on by Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin. ""I think there's an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Axiom is about."" The crew did undergo extensive training for this mission, taking on much of the same tasks as professional astronauts-in-training. But the fact is that the three paying customers on this flight — Stibbe, Pathy, and Connor — weren't selected from a pool of thousands of applicants and aren't dedicating much of their lives to the endeavor. Axiom itself has been more flippant about word usage in the past. ""Commercial human spaceflight. Space Tourism. Whatever you call it — it's happening. And soon,"" the company wrote on its website. Each of the crew members has a list of research projects they plan to work on. Connor will be doing some research on how spaceflight affects senescent cells, which are cells that have ceased the normal replication process and are ""linked to multiple age-related diseases,"" according to Axiom. That research will be done in partnership with the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic. Among the items on Pathy's to-do list is some additional medical research, focused more on children's health, that he'll conduct in partnership with several Canadian hospitals, and some conservation-awareness initiatives. Stibbe will also do some research and focus on ""educational and artistic activities to connect the younger generation in Israel and around the globe,"" according to Axiom. Stibbe is flying on behalf of the Ramon Foundation — a space education non-profit named for Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. ​Stibbe's Axiom bio says he and Ramon shared a ""close"" friendship. During downtime, the crew will also get a chance to enjoy sweeping views of Earth. And, at some point, they'll share a meal with the other astronauts on board. Their food was prepared in partnership with celebrity chef and philanthropist Jose Andrés. Their meals ""lean on flavors and traditional dishes of Commander López-Alegría's native Spain,"" according to Axiom. (©2022 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

2022-04-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-military-officials-facebook-hackers-russia-belarus/,Russian-backed hackers broke into Facebook accounts of Ukrainian military officials,"A group of hackers with ties to the Belarusian government broke into the Facebook accounts of Ukrainian military officials and posted videos calling on the Ukrainian army to surrender. According to Facebook's parent company, Meta, the posts appeared as if they were coming from the legitimate account owners. The group of hackers, known in the security industry as Ghostwriter, typically targets victims by compromising their email addresses and using them to gain access to social media accounts. ""When it comes to persistent threat actors, we've seen a further spike in activity by Ghostwriter,"" Ben Nimmo, Meta's global threat intelligence lead for influence operations, said on a call with reporters. He added that since February, ""they've attempted to hack into the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military personnel."" Meta's head of security policy, Nathaniel Gliecher, said the videos posted on the accounts of Ukrainian military officials were not seen by users and were taken down by the platform before it could be shared with others. Meta also removed a network of 200 accounts operating from Russia that were falsely filing hundreds — and in some cases thousands — of reports against users, mainly in Ukraine and Russia, for various policy violations. The mass reporting was an attempt to silence critics and Ukrainians, Meta said. The operation spiked in mid-February, just before Russia invaded Ukraine. The actors used a variety of fake, authentic and duplicate accounts to falsely report users for violations of hate speech and bullying. Meta said in an attempt to evade detection, the threat actors coordinated their mass reporting activity in a cooking-themed Facebook group that had about 50 members when discovered. ""Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've seen attacks on internet freedom and access to intensify information sharply,"" said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Meta. He said those attacks are manifested through Russian state propaganda, media influence operations, espionage campaigns and attempts to close the flow of credible information. Meta said threat actors with links to Russia and Belarus who are engaging in cyber espionage and covert influence operations have an interest in the Ukrainian telecom industry, defense and energy sectors, tech platforms and journalists. But Ukrainian officials believe Russia is behind the disinformation efforts, timed to coincide with conventional warfare. ""Cyberwar is a component of conventional war, provided by Russia against Ukraine,"" said top Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora during a briefing with reporters on Tuesday. One group with ties to the Belarusian KGB, which Meta previously took down in November, returned with a new operation a day before Russia's invasion began. Meta said the group ""suddenly"" began posting in Polish and English about Ukrainian troops surrendering and leaders surrendering without a fight. On March 14, the group created an event in Warsaw calling for a protest against the Polish government, Meta alleged. The event was on the platform for ""a few hours at most"" and taken down along with the account behind it, Nimmo said. New information about threat actors with ties to Russia who are targeting Ukrainian officials and public figures on Facebook is part of the company's new quarterly Adversarial Threat report. It builds on the existing quarterly community standards report and the monthly coordinated inauthentic behavior report. The disinformation campaign by Russian-aligned actors targeting Ukrainians on social media and online comes at the same time as other cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian government agencies, media groups and telecommunications. The Security Service of Ukraine announced Thursday it uncovered another text message campaign pushing 5,000 SMS messages to Ukrainian military and law enforcement officers demanding that they defect and surrender to Russian forces. ""The outcome of events is predetermined!"" the messages said, according to Ukrainian officials. ""Be prudent and refuse to support nationalism and leaders of the country who discredited themselves and already fled the capital!!!"" Between March 23 and March 29, Ukrainian critical infrastructure registered 65 cyberattacks – five times more than the previous week – according to a report by Ukraine's State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection (SSSCIP). The agency said top targets included state and local authorities, the security and defense sector, financial companies, satellite telecommunications and the energy sector. ""We do not see serious and complicated attacks on critical infrastructure which can be successful so far,"" said Zhora, deputy chief of Ukraine's SSSCIP. ""We register attempts, but I hope we will be able to effectively counteract them and provide security to our IT systems."" But hackers did launch a ""sophisticated and massive"" attack against the infrastructure of one of Ukraine's largest providers, Ukrtelecom, on March 28, Kirill Goncharuk, the company's chief information officer, told reporters on Tuesday. The attack against Ukrtelecom was launched from inside Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory, though Goncharuk did not disclose the specific location, citing security reasons. Goncharuk said hackers used an employee's compromised account to gain entry. The employee is currently safe, but the CIO declined to say whether the individual was physically coerced into handing over access. Traffic in the network fell to 13% of the regular regime of the network's functioning but, according to the SSSCIP, Ukrtelecom security experts detected the attack within 15 minutes after its launch and restored 85% of service within 24 hours. During the attack, intruders attempted to disable the company's servers and take control of Ukrtelecom's network by attempting to change the passwords of employees' accounts as well as the passwords to equipment and firewalls, according to Goncharuk. Investigators say it appears that the attackers did not access customer data. Officials have not yet attributed the attack. The investigation – in coordination with Microsoft and Cisco – is ongoing. ""The majority of [cyber]attacks that come to Ukrainian infrastructure at the moment have Russian origins,"" Zhora told reporters. ""And it doesn't matter whether the FSB or GRU originate it. Different APT groups can sit on the same floor in the same buildings."" The hack follows an attack on U.S. telecommunications firm Viasat on February 24 that targeted terminals in Ukraine but also caused outages in Germany and other European countries at the start of the Russian invasion. A U.S. official tells CBS News that American intelligence officials believe Russian state-actors were behind the Viasat hack, though the White House has not publicly said so. U.S. officials believe it was meant to disrupt service in Ukraine but spread beyond the intended targets. The Biden administration remains concerned that cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure could ""spill over"" to the U.S. and its allies, similar to events surrounding the 2017 NotPetya malware attack. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell on Wednesday that Russian actors ""have not attacked our critical infrastructure in retaliation to the sanctions we've imposed."" ""We are preparing for an attack,"" Mayorkas added, noting that U.S. officials are on high alert for potential breaches of critical infrastructure, including U.S. banks, the energy grid and water system. ""We are poised to defend ourselves."" Testifying in the Senate this week, U.S. Cyber Command chief Gen. Paul Nakasone cautiously supported the creation of a ""social media data threat analysis center"" to help combat foreign influence campaigns. ""Based on my experience, watching two different election cycles and the work of our adversaries attempt to garner greater influence, I think such a center would be helpful,"" he told lawmakers, adding that researchers must evaluate ""the full spectrum"" of adversaries' capabilities, including tactics, tradecraft and procedures.""",3,4.417927738933295,5.118470595307431,-0.7005428563741365,1
2022-04-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-removed-un-human-rights-council/,U.N. votes to remove Russia from Human Rights Council,"United Nations — Russia was suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council on Thursday for what the Resolution called reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" and ""violations of international humanitarian law"" in its invasion of Ukraine. The 193-nation General Assembly vote - the only one in 11 years that suspended a nation from the Human Rights Council - required a ⅔ super majority of those present and voting, a count that excludes abstentions. The resolution passed 93-24, with 58 nations abstaining. The General Assembly vote Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the U.N.'s main human rights body was an initiative driven by the Biden administration in response to the brutal killing of hundreds of civilians in Ukraine by Russian forces. The move by the U.S., UK and their allies to remove Russia from the powerless 47-nation Geneva-based human rights council - in which many member nations are human rights abusers - further isolates Russia politically from the world despite Russia's veto power on the Security Council, diplomats said after the vote. Because abstensions would not count in the tally of the resolution's passage and the vote was expected to be more divided than recent General Assembly votes, Russia had sent a warning to several nations. In a letter obtained by CBS News, Russia cautioned member states that either a vote in support of the resolution or an abstention would be viewed as an ""unfriendly gesture"" with consequences for bilateral ties. Nations speaking against the U.S.-led effort before the vote included North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Brazil, China, Cuba, Senegal, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Egypt, Mexico and Syria, but not all voted against the resolution. Some instead chose to abstain. China's Ambassador Zhang Jun, who voted against the measure and in support of Russia, called the vote a ""hasty move."" ""It is like adding fuel to the fire, which is not conducive to the de-escalation of conflicts,"" the ambassador said. Ambassador T.S. Tirumirti said that India abstained ""for reasons of both substance and process,"" saying that ""since the inception of the Ukrainian conflict, India has stood for peace, dialogue and diplomacy. We believe that no solution can be arrived at by shedding blood and at the cost of innocent lives."" ""If India has chosen any side, it is the side of peace and it is for an immediate end to violence,"" Tirumirti said. After the vote, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and Biden administration Cabinet member Linda Thomas-Greenfield called it ""An important and historic day."" ""Countries from around the globe have voted to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, we have collectively sent a clear message that Russia will be held accountable,"" she tweeted. ""We ensured a persistent and egregious human rights violator will not be allowed to occupy a position of leadership on human rights at the U.N.,"" Thomas-Greenfield, President Biden's top U.N. envoy, planned to say in the afternoon session of the vote, according to an advance copy of her remarks sent to CBS News. Although the council does not have much power and its actions are not legally binding, it announced last month that it appointed top rights investigators to gather testimony and evidence from survivors that would be turned over to an international court. One of those beginning investigations is the International Criminal Court, which is looking into alleged grave breaches of the Geneva Convention. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who was in Brussels meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at NATO headquarters, said after the vote, ""War criminals have no place at U.N. bodies protecting human rights."" ""It's important to mobilize the entire world that stands for democracy and respect of the rule-based order,"" he said. Russia's U.N. deputy Ambassador Gennady Kuzmin called the allegations ""untruthful"" and Russia's first deputy Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy announced on twitter the country would be withdrawing from the council, where it was in the second year of its three-year term. ""After today's scandalous vote by Western countries and those who for different reasons come to their heel Russia withdrew from HRC before the end of its term,"" he said. Ukraine's U.N. Envoy Sergiy Kyslytsya responded, ""You cannot submit your resignation after you are fired.""",13,3.851755477723702,3.7907148133495094,0.061040664374192755,11
2022-04-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-hostomel-battle-putin-chemical-weapons-donbas/,"Ukrainian soldier on the battle that ""changed the course of the war,"" and what he fears Russia will do next","Kyiv — Ukraine's government has issued urgent warnings to its own people, telling residents of the eastern Donbas regions to get out amid expectations that Russia is preparing to shift the focus of its onslaught to the area. There are fears Russian troops could carry out massacres there like they're alleged to have done in the suburbs of Kyiv. Ukraine's president and other officials have issued increasingly urgent calls for the U.S. and its NATO partners to provide more — and more advanced — weapons to help the country stop Russia's brutal invasion. Even before President Vladmir Putin ordered that invasion on February 24, Ukraine had been fighting Russian-backed separatists in Donbas for eight years, since his last invasion in 2014. Senior Lieutenant ""Starsky"" — a military callsign, not his real name — was among the troops engaged in the simmering conflict in the east. He told CBS News correspondent Debora Patta that his passion was forged during the defiant days of the 2014 ""Maidan"" uprising, against Russian influence in Ukraine. Starsky was injured during the protests, which inspired him to join his country's national guard. He spent the following years on the frontlines in Donbas, fighting Russia's proxy forces. ""We spent eight years of learning to fight specifically against Russians, so they made a big mistake,"" he said of what came next. Starsky put his skills to good use when, on the first day of Putin's new invasion, 35 Russian helicopters started attacking Hostomel airport on the northwest outskirts of Ukraine's capital of Kyiv. He told CBS News that as he and his men opened fire on the incoming attack helicopters with their rifles, ""at first I thought: 'Stupid idea,' because they're armored!"" But Starsky and his unit of Ukrainian defenders mounted a fierce resistance. After a vicious three-day battle that laid waste to the facility's runway, hangar and planes stored there, they scored an improbable victory: The Ukrainians wrested back full control of the airport. ""Later, we realized what we had done had changed the course of the war,"" he told Patta. By holding onto Hostomel airport, even if it meant destroying it, Starsky and his fellow soldiers denied Russia the ability to establish an air bridge from Russia into the Kyiv region. Had they failed, Putin's military would have been able to fly in supplies, equipment and, crucially, more manpower. They may well have gone on to seize Kyiv itself. ""If they managed to land their cargo airplanes at Hostomel, we would have a full Russian brigade stationed just 10 kilometers [about 6 miles] away from Kyiv, and that would be a huge problem,"" Starsky told Patta. ""I think that invasion would look absolutely different."" The defeat at Hostomel slowed the Russians down, but it did not stop them from seizing control of nearby Bucha and other towns, where they stand accused of executing hundreds of civilians. Bucha residents have told CBS News and other news outlets that the Russian occupiers murdered people in cold blood during their time in control of the town, some of them with their hands bound, shot point-blank and then left on the street or thrown into shallow mass graves. But Starsky is worried the war could get even dirtier. He told Patta Ukraine's forces know Russian officers operating in Donbas have received antidotes to protect them against the effects of their own chemical weapons. ""We have information that chemical weapons will be used on the frontlines,"" he told CBS News. U.S. officials have for weeks warned that Russian claims — dismissed as nonsense by Washington — about supposed American work in Ukraine on biological and chemical weapons could be a preamble to Putin's forces using banned substances themselves. President Biden called the Russian claims a ""clear sign"" that Putin was considering use of chemical weapons. The Pentagon and its partners have also warned that Putin's troops, after taking serious casualties and being forced to pull back from the Kyiv area, are regrouping, and preparing to stage a major offensive in Donbas. Russia has made it clear that it will shift the focus of what Putin calls his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine to the eastern part of the country. But Starsky is standing firm. He said that while the biggest plane in the world — nicknamed ""The Dream"" — was destroyed in the battle to defend Hostomel, the Russians will not manage to kill Ukraine's dream to hold onto its freedom.",14,4.897843417008934,2.885001309101809,2.012842107907125,20
2022-04-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-zelenskyy-borodyanka-bucha/,Zelenskyy says situation in Borodyanka is much worse than in Bucha,"Following outrage over horrific images of civilians killed in the city of Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the situation in neighboring Borodyanka is even worse. Investigators say they found 26 bodies amongst the rubble in Borodyanka on Thursday. Vadim Shandrenko is among those looking for the remains of friends and family. His friend, Volodymyr, was at home inside a now collapsed apartment building when it was hit by Russian airstrikes. Shandrenko told CBS News the Russian soldiers wouldn't let him search. Locals told CBS News the Russians also blew up a bridge as they retreated from the city. In the nearby village of Termakhivka, locals told CBS News that Russian soldiers looted everything from clothing and silverware to refrigerators and washing machines. Mykola Oleksienko, the head of the village, said the Russians raided the village's clinic, leaving it wrecked. Termakhivka is about 30 miles from the Chernobyl nuclear site, where Russian troops have also pulled out. Ukraine says the Russians dug trenches in one of the most contaminated parts of the exclusion zone, exposing themselves to significant doses of radiation. A Kremlin spokesman admitted Thursday that Russia has lost a significant number of troops in Ukraine, calling it a ""huge tragedy,"" but did not say how many had been killed.",17,2.8066758428321865,5.842200855837165,-3.0355250130049782,20
2022-04-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/fbi-pittsburgh-helps-break-up-russia-cybercrimes/,FBI Pittsburgh Office Leads Actions To Disrupt Russian Cybercrime Operation,"WASHINGTON (AP/KDKA) — The war in Ukraine has come home in the form of cyberattacks on the U.S. economy. The FBI field office in Pittsburgh is being credited with saving thousands of small business computer systems, identifying and blocking a network of Russian bots before the damage could be done. ""We removed malware from devices used by thousands of mostly small businesses for network security all over the world and then we shut the door the Russians had used to get into them,"" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. The announcement in Washington D.C. is part of a Justice Department crackdown on illegal Russian activity involving the seizure of assets from rich associates of Vladimir Putin known oligarchs. But this cyber attack was initiated by the Russian government itself, the military intelligence unit known as GRU. Two years ago, after an investigation by Pittsburgh FBI, prosecutors indicted six GRU hackers as part of an attack resulting in billions of dollars of losses in the U.S., and U.S. Attorney Cindy Chung says all businesses are at risk. ""It can be used to deploy spyware onto possible victims' computers, it could be used to shutdown victims' access, it could be used to just monitor traffic,"" she said. Special Agent-in-Charge Mike Nordwall is asking all businesses to contact the FBI if they observe irregular or suspicious cyber activity. Nordwall: ""It's certainly part of an ongoing persistent threat that's posed by the Russian government, certainly within cyberspace.""Sheehan: ""To disrupt the U.S. economy?""Nordwall: ""To disrupt US interests and certainly economic security."" The actions, announced amid Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine, underscore what U.S. officials say are their efforts to crack down on Russian criminal activity, to choke off the flow of ""dirty money"" and to disrupt the Kremlin's malicious cyber acts. The case against Konstantin Malofeyev, a Russian media baron, accuses him of trying to evade earlier Treasury Department sanctions resulting from Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Though the sanctions barred U.S. citizens from working for or doing business with him, Malofeyev allegedly used co-conspirators to secretly acquire media organizations across Europe in hopes of spreading pro-Russia propaganda. A former CNBC and Fox News employee was arrested in London last month for his work as a television producer for Malofeyev. The announcements come two days after U.S. officials seized a yacht in Spain belonging to a Russian oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg, with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Justice Department in the last year has taken aim against Russia-based cybercrime, recovering in June most of a multimillion-dollar ransom that Colonial Pipeline paid to hackers after a ransomware attack that halted operations and announcing charges last fall against two suspected ransomware operators.

2022-04-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bucha-massacre-ukraine-russia-atrocities-evidence/,Bucha massacre: CBS News finds evidence of atrocities near Ukraine's capital as Russia is accused of war crimes,"Kyiv — Global shock and anger over the brutality of Russia's war on Ukraine was still building Tuesday when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the United Nations Security Council on the atrocities discovered on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukraine says mass graves and bodies in the streets in the town of Bucha tell a story of indiscriminate murder, and many world leaders — including President Joe Biden — are calling it a war crime. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta and her team visited Bucha to see for themselves the evidence of killings that Russia has dismissed as ""fake."" NOTE: Some of the images in the video above and in the article below are disturbing. Moscow claimed on Monday that the deaths occurred after its forces left the area, and that Russian soldiers never harmed a single civilian, but an analysis of satellite photos, first reported by the New York Times, shows bodies were strewn across Bucha's streets and yards long before Russian forces beat a hasty retreat late last week. Patta said that when she and her team visited the town, they saw evidence of atrocities: Civilians shot in the head with their hands bound; at least one resident apparently cut down by Russian tank fire while riding down the street on a bicycle; mass graves filled with nearly 300 bodies. There is a trail of destruction and death carved through Bucha, and Patta said it is exactly what war crimes look like. Having reported from many conflict zones and bearing witness to some of the most brutal atrocities of this century, Patta said what she found in Bucha was among the worst she had ever seen. ""I personally saw evidence of war crimes,"" Patta reported on Tuesday. ""These stories cannot be staged, and the overwhelming grief I have witnessed cannot be manufactured."" Patta and her team saw a couple react as they spotted one victim in particular in a mass grave. They thought they'd recognized their son's arm, but it was not him. Their grim search continued. In one building, the CBS News team found the body of a man who appeared to have been blindfolded, with his hands tied behind his back. The rudimentary safety helmet he had on was no defense against a bullet to the head. Yuri, a resident, told Patta he'd seen Russian soldiers bring the man at gunpoint into the building where he was killed. Russian troops had set up camp in a courtyard outside Yuri's apartment block. Their presence is still felt in the discarded beer bottles, empty munition boxes and overturned cars they left behind. On the first day of the invasion, Russian paratroopers spilled onto the tarmac at the nearby airport in Hostomel. Not much is left of that airport, where one of the most significant battles of the war was fought. Ukraine's defenders stopped the Russians there as they tried to take over the country. The airport has been reduced to an apocalyptic scene, with the crumpled, melted frame of the world's largest airplane serving as testament to the fierce fight that stopped Russian forces from establishing a supply line there, but could not stop their invasion of nearby Bucha, and the horror that followed. Tanya Nedashkivs'ka found her husband dead among a pile of bodies at the foot of a basement staircase. ""I'm begging you, do something,"" she said through sobs. ""Make peace so no-one ever grieves again… everyone just wants to live.""

2022-04-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-crimes-what-are-they-and-could-putin-be-prosecuted/,"What are war crimes, is Russia committing them in Ukraine, and could Putin be prosecuted?","London — As horrific scenes were revealed in the wake of Russian troops pulling out of the town of Bucha in Ukraine, President Joe Biden on Monday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of war crimes. ""He is a war criminal,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I think it is a war crime. ... He should be held accountable."" The United States had already formally accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine, and a number of national and international organizations have opened investigations, collecting evidence to build cases. But could Putin himself ever face a war crimes trial? There are a number of international treaties — the Geneva Convention and the Geneva Protocol being two of the most important — that establish international legal standards for warfare. Any violation of those standards is a war crime that can be prosecuted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague, and can result in imprisonment for perpetrators. National governments, unilaterally or in partnerships, can also conduct their own war crimes investigations and prosecutions based on their own laws or the principle of universal jurisdiction, which determines some war crimes to be so extraordinary that they shock the conscience of humanity as a whole and therefore can be prosecuted anywhere. Deliberate attacks against civilians are war crimes, as are ""methods of war that are inherently indiscriminate and that simply can't make the distinction between the civilian population and armed forces,"" Jim Goldston, executive director of the Open Society Foundations' Justice Initiative, told CBS News. Goldston said there were many indications that Russia was committing war crimes in Ukraine. ""There is an enormous effort now underway … to kind of hoover up all this information and organize it, that looks at where military forces are located, what are the targets, what are the structures being targeted, and gathering that together with testimonies that are being reported of people who are being victimized in these areas,"" he said. All of the information being gathered could be used as evidence in possible war crimes trials at the ICC or in separate tribunals. ""One of the challenges in these kinds of investigations, though, will be to demonstrate the linkage between what is happening on the ground and those who have military or political responsibility for ordering these attacks,"" Goldston said. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called Russia's actions in Ukraine ""genocide,"" appealing to nations around the world for help. ""The aerial bombing of a children's hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening, Zelenskyy said on March 9. But while recognizing the horror of the atrocities being carried out by Russia in Ukraine, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday that he had not seen evidence they had risen to the level of genocide. Under international law, genocide is defined as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" This can involve killing or causing serious bodily harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting conditions of life designed to destroy the group, forcibly removing children from the group and transferring them to others, or imposing measures intended to prevent births in the group. Whether Russia's actions in Ukraine amount to genocide is still being debated by experts, Professor Alex Hinton, director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University, wrote in The Conversation. Russia has targeted and killed civilians and created ""harsh conditions of life"" in many parts of Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol, where civilians without food or water continue to be denied access to lifesaving aid shipments. It has also reportedly forcibly transported hundreds of Ukrainians, including children, to Russia. In public rhetoric, it has undermined and denied the very existence of Ukrainian identity and outlined a goal eradicating it in some areas. ""There is a significant risk that Russia will commit genocide in Ukraine,"" Hinton wrote. ""It is possible that a genocide has already begun."" ""Traditionally in the international criminal tribunals, it has been very difficult to take [war crimes and crimes against humanity] all the way up to the top,"" Philippe Sands, a law professor and Director of the Center on International Courts and Tribunals at University College London told CBS News' partner network, BBC News. Sands is among a number academics and former world leaders calling for the establishment of a special international tribunal modeled on the Nuremberg Trials, which were held for Nazi leaders after World War II, to hold Russia's leaders to account for the crime of ""aggression"" in Ukraine. ""A crime of aggression is waging an illegal war,"" Sands said. ""It's part of international law, it's part of the law of Ukraine, and it's pretty clearly established in the present case, because there's no justification."" In the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine — barring an extremely unlikely referral from the United Nations Security Council, where Russia holds veto power — the ICC does not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, so a separate tribunal would be necessary for any indictment. But because it is the act of waging an illegal war, it could be easier to attribute it to Putin himself. ""The crime of aggression is virtually, by definition, a leadership crime,"" Goldston said. ""Only leaders have the power to actually invade another state, or a small circle of folks around them who have the political authority to actually make that happen."" If such a case did get off the ground, it's still unclear whether Putin himself could be successfully prosecuted, or what an indictment might mean for him. ""What happens if there were a tribunal that were to indict him? It would face challenges. One, of head of state immunity. The law on the immunity of someone who's head of state is debated, certainly, depending on the jurisdiction that is bringing the charges. And then, just the physical question of how you would get custody over somebody like that is huge,"" Goldston said. ""But there are damaging effects of indictment, short of custody,"" Goldston added. Pointing to the indictments of the former political and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs, he said: ""The indictments themselves, the public nature of the charges, I think it's fair to say, acted to stigmatize them, to isolate them politically, to make it untenable for them to participate in political negotiations and diplomatic negotiations. So indictments alone can have an effect, even short of arrest.""",13,2.9906073245686478,5.07164322471466,-2.0810359001460124,11
2022-04-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-war-conti-revil-hellokitty/,The ransomware wars: Here's how much cash the top gangs reel in,"The same week in late February that Russian troops rolled into Ukraine, one of the world's most potent Kremlin-aligned hacking gangs threatened to attack the U.S. and NATO allies. The so-called Conti group, notorious for its use of ransomware to extort millions from hospitals and emergency services, now threatened to target America's critical infrastructure — vital systems like the power grid and water supply. For three tense days, cyber-defense professionals anxiously anticipated the group's next move. Then, with little warning, the gang blew up. Conti's network was allegedly infiltrated by a Ukrainian security researcher who leaked the group's secrets on Twitter, including its chat records, ransomware code and financial details. The leak revealed that Conti was disorganized and prone to internal squabbles. They were also one of the most profitable hacking crews in the world. ""Ransomware-as-a-service,"" known as RaaS, has exploded in popularity in recent years, with criminal gangs raking in cash extorted from health care providers, retailers, manufacturers, colleges, local governments and many other organizations. Such schemes shot up up 85% last year from 2020, and individual demands increased 144% to $2.2 million. The average payment was up 78%, to roughly $541,000, according to a new report by Unit 42, a threat research team at Palo Alto Networks. ""The vast majority of ransomware actors are financially motivated. RaaS makes carrying out attacks significantly easier by lowering the barrier to entry and expanding the reach of ransomware,"" Unit 42's Ryan Olson told CBS News. ""As organizations continue to pay ransoms, the more these actors invest in their ransomware organizations and are fueled to continue their efforts."" Many hacking groups operate like a business that is run ""for criminals, by criminals, with agreements that set terms, often in exchange for monthly fees or a percentage of ransoms paid,"" Olson said, adding that the groups often are compartmentalized with departments focused on tasks like administration, coding, marketing and security testing. These three organizations accounted for more than a third of ransomware activity last year: Conti's growth was astronomical and unprecedented, Olson said. In the two years prior to the leaks that led to the group's implosion, their activities surged. Conti was responsible for more security incidents than any other ransomware gang. The group stole and publicly released private information from over 600 companies and government organizations. Their average ransom demand rose from just $178,000 in early 2020 to nearly $1.8 million last year. ""They're ruthless,"" Olson said, noting the group's willingness to go after more vulnerable targets like hospitals, health care providers, municipal governments and law enforcement agencies. ""They operate without a code of honor."" On a dark web forum in February, Conti announced its ""full support"" of the Russian government and threatened to use its ""full capacity to deliver retaliatory measures"" if NATO allies targeted Russian infrastructure with cyberattacks. REvil is best known for demanding $70 million in 2021 from software infrastructure provider Kaseya — the biggest ransomware attack on record. The group pioneered ransomware-as-a-service, a business model that allows cybercriminals to sell their hacking expertise and launch attacks using their own particular ransomware software. REvil's software would infect and lock networked office workstations, often shutting down the targeted business until a ransom demand was paid. REvil's demands varied, depending on the size of the company and type of data stolen. If a company failed to pay, REvil would double their ransom demands and publish the stolen data. Unit 42 analysts found that REvil's average demand in 2021 jumped to $2.2 million, more than four times the $500,000 it had asked for previously. Their highest ransom demand last year was $5.4 million. The group was allegedly dismantled recently by Russia's internal security agency at the request of several international law enforcement agencies, including U.S. authorities. The HelloKitty group might be less famous than rival ransomware gangs, but they are pioneers. In early 2020 a Linux-variant of its ransomware targeted VMWare's software used in data centers. HelloKitty is best known for allegedly having stolen and released source code from Polish video game developer CD Projekt Red. The gang, also known as FiveHands, favored corporate targets and used a multipronged attack, often threatening to release stolen data on the dark web and hammering victims with denial of service attacks if ransom demands weren't met. Law enforcement agencies believe that prior to the Russian invasion, the group operated from eastern Ukraine. While not as financially successful as other major ransomware gangs, HelloKitty's tactics and tech were innovative, inspiring more famous ransomware operators. ""Cybercrime is a cat-and-mouse game,"" Olson said ""There are always ways to stop attackers from being successful. However attackers will continue to evolve and innovate their tactics. It's critical to be prepared and educated on the latest threats so you know how to protect your organization.""",3,6.383388983513632,7.632260355320601,-1.2488713718069686,7
2022-04-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-demands-un-act-to-stop-putin-destroying-cities/,"Zelenskyy tells U.N. it must act now to stop Putin as Russia is ""deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities""","United Nations — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that Russian troops invading his country had ""killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" He made it clear that he believed the United Nations had failed to end the brutal attack on his country and needed to change to serve its intended purpose of keeping peace in the world. Zelenskyy addressed the U.N.'s most powerful body — of which Russia is a permanent, veto-wielding member — amid growing outrage around the world over fast-emerging evidence that Russian forces deliberately killed civilians in Ukraine. The Biden administration has backed Zelenskyy's accusation that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, but it has not yet agreed with his assertion that Putin's forces are guilty of the specific crime of genocide. Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting like a brutal colonizer. He made it clear that without changes to stop Russia using its veto power to block Security Council action, the United Nations and the entire system of global security it represents could be rendered obsolete. The Ukrainian leader called on the U.N. to either kick Russia out, or change the Council's rules. ""Ukraine has the moral right to propose a reform of the world security system,"" he said. ""We have proven that we help others... now we need decisions from the Security Council for peace in Ukraine."" ""The U.N. system must be reformed immediately so that the [Security Council] veto is not the right to die,"" said Zelenskyy. Suggesting more atrocities were yet to be revealed, he accused Russia of ""deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities."" ""Now the world can see what they have done in Bucha,"" he told the Security Council. ""But the world has yet to see what Russia has done in other regions."" ""Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and airstrikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from hostilities. They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from airstrikes,"" Zelenskyy said. CBS News has witnessed firsthand clear evidence of atrocities in towns and villages around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Bodies were found littering the streets of Bucha, with scores more dumped into hastily dug mass graves. The gruesome scenes left behind by Vladimir Putin's invading forces have led to calls for tougher sanctions against the Kremlin, including a complete cut-off of gas and oil imports from Russia. Germany and France reacted by expelling dozens of Russian diplomats, suggesting they were spies. U.S. President Joe Biden said Putin should be tried for war crimes. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened Tuesday's Security Council session, blasting Russia for the ""senseless loss of life, massive devastation in urban centers, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure"" in Ukraine. ""I will never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed in Bucha,"" Guterres said. He spoke indirectly about Russia's vetos and threats of vetos that have prevented Security Council action over the Ukraine war thus far. In several instances, the U.S. and the U.K., along with allies, have taken votes to the General Assembly after Russia blocked the Council from even taking measures up for consideration. President Biden's U.N. envoy, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield addressed reform that the U.S. is pursuing. ""The Secretary-General said that confronting this threat is the Security Council's charge. It is. And it is also the responsibility of U.N. leaders and leaders around the world — every single Member State with a voice in the General Assembly,"" she said. ""No one can be a shield for Russia's aggression,"" Thomas-Greenfield said, adding that ""suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council is something we, collectively, have the power to do in the General Assembly. Our votes can make real difference."" Russia's Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has denied the allegations, but was left frustrated on Monday when Britain, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council, blocked his country from calling a Council meeting on what he called the ""fake news"" out of Bucha. ""I deeply regret the divisions that have prevented the Security Council from acting not only on Ukraine, but on other threats to peace and security around the world,"" Guterres said Tuesday. Just back from a visit to Moscow to negotiate a humanitarian cease-fire, Martin Griffiths, Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, told diplomats that ""Ukrainian civilians are paying too high a price for war."" ""Almost 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes, of whom more than 4.2 million are now refugees in generous neighboring countries and beyond,"" Griffiths said. ""In total, more than a quarter of Ukraine's population has fled."" ""The horror deepened this past weekend as shocking images emerged of dead civilians, some with hands bound, lying in the streets of Bucha,"" said Rosemary DiCarlo, the U.N. Under Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding affairs.",13,6.85562513889608,0.6638920168950451,6.191733122001035,11
2022-04-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-un-security-council-address-watch-live-stream-today/,Ukraine's Zelenskyy urges U.N. to take action over atrocities discovered near Kyiv,"Bucha, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke Tuesday to U.N. Security Council diplomats outraged by growing evidence that Russian forces deliberately killed civilians, many of them shot in yards, streets and homes, and their bodies left in the open. ""Now the world can see what they have done in Bucha,"" Zelenskyy told the Security Council in an address delivered via live video. ""But the world has yet to see what Russia has done in other regions."" He accused Russia of ""the most terrible war crimes"" seen since the end of World War II. ""Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and airstrikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from hostilities. They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from airstrikes,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine,"" he said, calling for reforms to make the international system more responsive. The Russian withdrawal from towns around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, revealed scores of corpses left behind, which led to calls for tougher sanctions against the Kremlin, especially a cutoff of gas and oil imports from Russia. Germany and France reacted by expelling dozens of Russian diplomats, suggesting they were spies. U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian leader Vladimir Putin should be tried for war crimes. ""This guy is brutal, and what's happening in Bucha is outrageous,"" Mr. Biden said, referring to the town northwest of the capital that was the scene of some of the horrors. At the Pentagon, a senior defense official said the U.S. can't independently confirm the atrocities in Bucha but has no reason to refute them. The official called the images ""deeply troubling."" The discovery of bodies in Bucha was expected to be ""front and center"" at the Security Council session, said Barbara Woodward, the U.N. ambassador for the United Kingdom, which holds the council presidency. Before Zelenskyy addressed the Security Council, members received briefings from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres; his political chief, Rosemary DiCarlo, and U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths, who is trying to arrange a cease-fire. Griffiths met with Russian officials in Moscow on Monday and is due to visit Ukraine. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta and her team went to Bucha on Monday and saw for themselves the unburied dead sprawled across the town. The slain were not wearing military uniforms. Many were undoubtedly civilians, some executed with their hands bound behind their backs. Some residents were even cut down by tanks as they rode on bicycles. Next to a church, Patta and her team saw a hastily dug mass grave — one of several in Bucha. The government said nearly 300 bodies had been discovered in the small town. The Ukrainian military released video of what it called a basement torture chamber, showing a line of people with their hands tied and gunshot wounds to the head. More evidence of Russian war crimes, said Ukraine. ""The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who among their fellow citizens killed, who gave orders, who turned a blind eye to the murders,"" Zelenskyy said as he visited the town on Monday. He appealed for more weaponry as Russia prepares new offensives. ""If we had already got what we needed — all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons — we could have saved thousands of people,"" he said. On the CBS News broadcast ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Zelenskyy called the Russian actions ""genocide"" and called for the West to apply tougher sanctions against Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the scenes outside Kyiv as a ""stage-managed anti-Russian provocation."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the images contained ""signs of video forgery and various fakes."" Russia has rejected previous allegations of atrocities as fabrications by Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces. The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office described one room discovered in Bucha as a ""torture chamber."" In a statement, it said the bodies of five men with their hands bound were found in the basement of a children's sanatorium where civilians were tortured and killed. The bodies seen by AP journalists in Bucha included at least 13 in and around a building that local people said Russian troops used as a base. Three other bodies were found in a stairwell, and six were burned together. The dead witnessed by the news agency's journalists also included bodies wrapped in black plastic, piled on one end of the mass grave in a Bucha churchyard. Many of those victims had been shot in cars or killed in explosions trying to flee the city. With the morgue full and the cemetery impossible to reach, the churchyard was the only place to keep the dead, Father Andrii Galavin said. Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, insisted Monday at a news conference that during the time that Bucha was under Russian control, ""not a single local person has suffered from any violent action."" However, high-resolution satellite imagery by commercial provider Maxar Technologies showed that many of the bodies had been lying in the open for weeks, during the time when Russian forces were in Bucha. The New York Times first reported on the satellite images showing the dead. Western and Ukrainian leaders have accused Russia of war crimes before. The International Criminal Court's prosecutor has already opened an investigation. But the latest reports ratcheted up the condemnation. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the images from Bucha reveal the ""unbelievable brutality of the Russian leadership and those who follow its propaganda."" French President Emmanuel Macron said there is ""clear evidence of war crimes"" in Bucha that demand new punitive measures. ""I'm in favor of a new round of sanctions and in particular on coal and gasoline. We need to act,"" he said on France-Inter radio. Though united in outrage, the European allies appeared split on how to respond. While Poland urged Europe to quickly wean itself off Russian energy, Germany said it would stick with a gradual approach of phasing out coal and oil imports over the next several months. Russia withdrew many of its forces from the area around Kyiv after being thwarted in its bid to swiftly capture the capital. It has instead poured troops into eastern Ukraine in a stepped-up bid to gain control of the Donbas, the largely Russian-speaking industrial region that includes the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting and worst suffering of the war. About two-thirds of the Russian troops around Kyiv have left and are either in Belarus or on their way there, probably getting more supplies and reinforcements, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence assessment. More than 1,500 civilians were able to escape Mariupol on Monday, using the dwindling number of private vehicles available to leave, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. But amid the fighting, a Red Cross-accompanied convoy of buses that has been thwarted for days in its bid to deliver supplies and evacuate residents was again unable to get inside the city, Vereshchuk said. Elsewhere, Russian shelling killed 11 people in the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said in a video message on social media.

What they've left behind is difficult to comprehend, and even more difficult to see. CBS News warns our readers that both the video report above and the article below contain disturbing material. Independent journalists who went into the town of Bucha, just northwest of the capital, over the weekend found the streets littered with bodies. The dead were wearing civilian clothing, and some had their hands tied behind their backs, apparently executed. Others were buried in a mass grave. More than 300 residents were killed, according to the town's mayor. In the central Ukrainian village of Kalynivka, closer to the southern and eastern Ukrainian cities Russia has hammered with artillery and air strikes for weeks, Irina Kostenko said the Russians killed her only son, Oleksei. She said she brought her son's body back home in a wheelbarrow and then buried him by herself in the garden, wrapped in a rug, in a shallow grave. He was killed at 27, but Kostenko clung to a photo of him as a child as she stood by his grave. ""This is my love, my sweetheart,"" she said. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports that Ukrainian officials shared photos taken on a highway outside the capital over the weekend showing the naked corpses of at least four women. The officials said Russian troops tried to burn the women's bodies. Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented cases of alleged rape by Russian troops during the invasion, which Vladimir Putin launched on February 24. Ukrainian officials are investigating. Speaking Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing genocide in his country. ""We are being destroyed and exterminated"" he said, ""and this is happening in the Europe of the 21st century."" On Monday, Zelenskyy visited Bucha to inspect the damage and speak with residents. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, said the president found ""evidence of mass killings."" According to Geraschchenko, a BBC correspondent asked Zelenskyy if he still believed it would be possible to negotiate for peace with Russia. The president said it would, ""because Ukraine must find peace. We are in 21st century Europe. We will continue our diplomatic, and military efforts."" The southeast port city of Mariupol has been besieged and bombarded by the Russians for almost 40 days, since the war started. Thousands may have been killed there alone, according to the United Nations, but it's impossible to get an accurate picture because Mariupol has been cut off from the outside world. Ilona, 17, and her 10-year-old brother Milan made it out of the city on Friday with their parents. CBS News found them sitting silently at an evacuation center, apparently shell-shocked. ""There were constant bombing raids, constant explosions,"" Ilona told Williams. There were times they thought they would die in their city, but she said tried throughout the ordeal to ""hold ourselves together — we tried not to panic."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said almost two weeks ago that the U.S. had determined that Russian forces had committed ""war crimes"" in Ukraine, accusing them of ""indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians."" On Sunday, he told CNN the images from Bucha were ""a punch to the gut,"" and he said the U.S. was ""working to document"" and provide its own information ""to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together"" to ensure any forces guilty of war crimes would he held accountable. ""We can't normalize this,"" he said. ""This is the reality of what's going on every single day, as long as Russia's brutality against Ukraine continues. That's why it needs to come to an end."" On Monday, Russian officials denied civilians were killed in Bucha. The Russian defense ministry claimed the gruesome scenes in Bucha were faked by Ukrainian forces as a ""provocation."" It has become a common refrain from Moscow, issued after previous alleged atrocities came to light in this war, and during Russia's long involvement in Syria's brutal civil war. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the reports of what he called a ""fake attack"" in Bucha and said Russia was demanding ""an urgent meeting of the Security Council on this particular issue because we see such provocations as a direct threat to international peace and security."" But the United Nations human rights chief was among those voicing horror at the scenes from Bucha on Monday. ""I am horrified by the images of civilians lying dead on the streets and in improvised graves in the town of Bucha in Ukraine,"" the U.N.'s Michelle Bachelet said in a statement. ""Reports emerging from this and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law."" CBS News correspondent Pamela Falk at the U.N. said U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield had discussed with Romania's prime minister on Monday America's intention to try to get Russia's suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council. According to a readout of Thomas-Greenfield's meeting with the Romanian leader, she said Russia's expulsion from the rights body was needed, ""in light of the mounting evidence that members of Russian forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine and following horrific reports about violence against civilians in Bucha."" Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, standing aside his Polish counterpart during a visit to Warsaw, said he was ""deeply shocked by news of the exceptionally cruel acts of violence against civilians near Kyiv."" ""The murder of innocent civilians is a violation of international humanitarian law and is unacceptable and I strongly condemn these acts,"" he added. ""The Russian assault is a blatant violation of international law."" In London, the head of Britain's equivalent of the CIA, MI6 chief Richard Moore, said in a tweet that Russia had planned mass-executions as part of its strategy in Ukraine. He shared an earlier message from the U.K. Foreign Secretary demanding that those responsible for the killings documented in Kyiv's suburbs be held to account. As Williams reported, the Russian soldiers accused of massacring unarmed civilians in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine will likely never be brought to justice. But despite the horrific images and thousands of his own soldiers being killed on the battlefield, a new poll in Russia found that Putin's approval rating had risen to 83% since the invasion began. While thousands have been arrested for protesting against the Ukraine war in Russian cities over the last month, many Russians rely entirely on the country's state-run news organizations for their information. Those outlets present only the Kremlin's version of what Putin calls the ""special military operation,"" and no Russian media outlets are free to report the truth about what's happening in Ukraine.",13,0.7534342817059504,1.8810968926310179,-1.1276626109250674,11

Mayor Olga Sukhenko and her family were shot and thrown into a pit in a forest behind a plot of land with several houses that the Russian forces then took over in the town of Motyzhyn, they said. EDITOR's NOTE: This article includes images of dead bodies which may offend some readers. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Sunday that Sukhenko and her husband, who were reported to have been kidnapped by Russian troops on March 23, were ""killed in captivity."" One resident of the town, which sits in territory recently abandoned by Russia's forces about 31 miles west of Kyiv, told The Associated Press that Russian troops had targeted local officials in a bid to win them over and killed them if they did not collaborate. The fourth body found in the pit had not been identified but was believed to have been a member of Ukraine's security forces. ""The scum killed her, her son and her husband after torturing them,"" Ukrainian Interior Ministry advisor Anton Gerashchenko said in a message posted on the Telegram social media app. AP and Reuters news agency journalists saw the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range and thrown into the pit in Motyzhyn, and residents at the scene confirmed the mayor and her family were among the bound and blindfolded victims. Ukrainian forces showed the grave in Motyzhyn to journalists as international outrage over another alleged Russian atrocity in the Kyiv suburbs grew by the hour. Ukraine's President Volodymy Zelenskyy visited the town of Bucha on Monday, where he saw first-hand evidence of mass-killings allegedly carried out by the Russian invaders.

2022-04-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/biden-putin-war-crimes-trial-ukraine-bucha/,Biden says Putin should face war crimes trial for alleged atrocities in Ukraine,"Washington — President Biden on Monday called for war crimes trial against Russian President Vladimir Putin and said he'd seek more sanctions after reported atrocities in Ukraine. ""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that Putin ""is a war criminal."" Mr. Biden's comments to reporters came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bucha, one of the towns surrounding Kyiv where Ukrainian officials say the bodies of civilians have been found. On ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Zelenskyy called the Russian actions ""genocide"" and called for the West to apply tougher sanctions against Russia. The president, however, stopped short of calling the actions genocide. The bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces, Ukraine's prosecutor-general, Iryna Venediktova, said. Associated Press journalists saw the bodies of at least 21 people in various spots around Bucha, northwest of the capital. ""We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight. And we have to gather all the detail so this can be an actual — have a war crimes trial,"" Mr. Biden said upon returning to Washington from a weekend trip to Delaware. The president lashed out at Putin as ""brutal."" ""What's happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone sees it,"" Mr. Biden added. At the Pentagon, a senior defense official said the U.S. can't independently confirm the atrocities in Bucha but has no reason to refute them. The official called the images ""deeply troubling."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted Monday that the European Union will send investigators to Ukraine to help the local prosecutor general ""document war crimes."" Mr. Biden noted that he faced push back last month when he described Putin as a war criminal for the unfolding onslaught in Ukraine after hospitals and maternity wards were bombed. In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Biden made clear that label still applied. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening to Bucha is outrageous, and everyone's seen it,"" the president said. Investigations into Putin's actions had begun before the new allegations of atrocities outside Kyiv. The U.S. and more than 40 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, after the passage of a resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council to establish a commission of inquiry. There is another probe by the International Criminal Court, an independent body based in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden's chief envoy to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, announced Monday that the U.S. plans to seek a suspension of Russia from its seat on the U.N.'s top human rights body in the wake of more indications Russian forces may have committed war crimes in Ukraine. That would require a decision by the U.N. General Assembly. Russia and the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France and the United States — all currently have seats on the 47-member-state rights council, which is based in Geneva. The U.S. rejoined the council this year.

See some of his work.,"Ukrainian photojournalist and videographer Maksim Levin has been found dead near Kyiv more than two weeks after he was last seen, the Ukrainian government said. The Reuters news agency, where he had long been a contributor, said Levin was killed covering the war for a Ukrainian news site. That news site, LB.ua, said Levin's body was found April 1 and that a colleague who was with him is still missing. Levin, 41, left behind a wife and four children. ""Maks has provided compelling photos and video from Ukraine to Reuters since 2013. His death is a huge loss to the world of journalism.

2022-04-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-focus-mariupol-odesa/,Ukraine sees openings as Russians focus on besieged Mariupol,"Kyiv, Ukraine — Residents of Ukraine's besieged southeastern coast awaited possible evacuation Sunday as the country's president said Russia's obsession with capturing a key port city had left its forces weakened and created opportunities for his military. Two loud explosions were heard in Odesa on the Black Sea, and black smoke was seen rising above the city, which is where Ukraine's navy is headquartered. It is west of Mariupol, a smaller port that has been under attack for almost the entire war and rescuers are desperate to reach. The Odesa city council said in a brief statement that a morning airstrike set off fires in some areas. The Russian military said hours later that it used ships and aircraft-fired missiles to strike an oil processing plant and fuel depots that were supplying Ukrainian troops. The city council said Ukraine's air defense shot down some missiles before they hit the city. Ukrainian military spokesman Vladyslav Nazarov said there were no casualties from the attack. In Mariupol, conditions remained dire and prospects for escape uncertain. The surrounded city, which has been brutalized by some of the war's worst attacks, reported weeks ago that water, food, fuel and medicine were running out. About 100,000 people are believed to still be there, less than a quarter of the city's prewar population of 430,000. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it hoped a team it sent to help evacuate residents would reach Mariupol on Sunday. Ukrainian authorities said Russia agreed days ago to allow safe passage from the city, but similar agreements have broken down repeatedly under continued shelling. Mariupol is in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops for eight years. Its capture would create an unbroken land corridor from Russia to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. With Mariupol squarely in Russia's crosshairs, Ukraine insists it has gained a leg up elsewhere in the country. As his country's troops retook territory north of the capital of Kyiv from departing Russian troops, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on all Ukrainians to do whatever they could ""to foil the enemy's tactics and weaken its capabilities."" ""Peace will not be the result of any decisions the enemy makes somewhere in Moscow. There is no need to entertain empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only have peace by fighting,"" Zelenskyy said late Saturday. Zelenskyy and Ukraine's Western allies believe Russia has shifted its forces from the capital region and the country's north in order to build strength in the east and south. The Ukrainian leader again urged the West to supply his military with warplanes and more anti-missile systems. ""Every Russian missile that hits our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children, only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended — the decision of whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons,"" Zelenskyy said. While the geography of the battlefield morphed, little changed for many Ukrainians more than five weeks into a war that has sent more than 4 million people fleeing the country as refugees and displaced millions more from their homes. The regional governor in Kharkiv said Sunday that Russian artillery and tanks performed over 20 strikes on Ukraine's second-largest city and its outskirts in the country's northeast over the past day. Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said a missile strike on the city of Lozovo wounded four people and that Russian tanks bombarded a hospital in the town of Balakliia. Zelenskyy alleged Saturday that Russian troops have left mines around homes, abandoned equipment and even the bodies of the dead as they withdraw from around Kyiv. Those claims could not be independently verified, but Ukrainian troops were seen heeding the warning. In Bucha, northwest of the capital, Associated Press journalists watched as Ukrainian soldiers, backed by a column of tanks and other armored vehicles, used cables to drag bodies off of a street from a distance for fear they may have been booby-trapped. Locals said the dead — AP counted at least six — were civilians killed without provocation by departing Russian soldiers. In towns and cities surrounding Kyiv, signs of fierce fighting were everywhere in the wake of the Russian redeployment. Destroyed armored vehicles from both armies lay in streets and fields along with scattered military gear. Ukrainian troops were stationed at the entrance to Antonov Airport in the suburb of Hostomel, demonstrating control of the runway that Russia tried to storm in the first days of the war. Inside the compound, the Mriya, one of the biggest planes ever built, lay wrecked underneath a hangar pockmarked with holes from the February attack. The head of Ukraine's delegation in talks with Russia said Moscow's negotiators informally agreed to most of a draft proposal discussed during face-to-face talks in Istanbul this week, but no written confirmation has been provided. The Ukrainian negotiator, Davyd Arakhamia said on Ukrainian TV that he hoped the plan was developed enough so that the two countries' presidents can meet to discuss it. Ukrainian authorities warned that Russia's focus on eastern Ukraine did not mean Kyiv and other cities wouldn't become targets again. In his evening address Saturday, Zelenskyy called for his people to do whatever they can to ensure the country's survival, even by engaging in acts as simple as showing each other kindness. ""When a nation is defending itself in a war of annihilation, when it is a question of life or death of millions, there are no unimportant things. ...

2022-04-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-bucha-atrocities-civilians-russia/,Ukraine documents alleged atrocities by retreating Russians,"Bucha, Ukraine — Ukraine's troops found brutalized bodies with bound hands, gunshot wounds to the head and signs of torture after Russian soldiers withdrew from the outskirts of Kyiv, authorities said Sunday, sparking new calls for a war crimes investigation and sanctions against Russia. Associated Press journalists in Bucha, a small city northwest of the capital, saw the bodies of at least nine people in civilian clothes who appeared to have been killed at close range. At least two had their hands tied behind their backs. The AP also saw two bodies wrapped in plastic, bound with tape and thrown into a ditch. Authorities said they were documenting evidence of alleged atrocities to add to their case for prosecuting Russian officials for war crimes. To convict, International Criminal Court prosecutors will need to show a pattern of indiscriminate deadly assaults on civilians during Russia's invasion. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said scores of residents were found slain on the streets of Bucha and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel in what looked like a ""scene from a horror movie."" Some people were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some bodies showed signs of torture, Arestovych said. There also were reports of rapes, he said. Zelenskyy told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that the Russians were committing ""genocide"" in Ukraine and called for Russia to be held accountable for war crimes. ""When we find people with hands tied behind their back and decapitated, such things I don't understand,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I don't comprehend the kids who were killed and tortured. So it wasn't enough just to kill for those criminals. Maybe they wanted to take gold or washing machines and they were killing, but they were also torturing them as they did this."" The capital city's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said civilians were ""shot with joined hands"" and told German newspaper Bild that ""what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide."" A day earlier, AP journalists witnessed Ukrainian soldiers gingerly removing at least six bodies from a street in Bucha with cables in case the Russians had booby-trapped corpses with explosives before their withdrawal. Local residents said the dead people were civilians killed without provocation, a claim that could not be independently verified. ""What happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide,"" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told German newspaper Bild. Klitschko called on other nations to immediately end Russian gas imports, saying they were funding the killings. ""Not a penny should go to Russia anymore. That's bloody money used to slaughter people. The gas and oil embargo must come immediately,"" the mayor said. Russian troops moved into Ukraine from three sides on February 24, and soldiers who entered from the north in Belarus spent weeks trying to clear a path to Kyiv. Their advance stalled in the face of resolute defiance from Ukraine's defenders, and Moscow said this week it would concentrate the invasion elsewhere going forward. Signs of fierce fighting were everywhere in the wake of Russian troops retreating north to back to Belarus: destroyed armored vehicles from both armies lay in streets and fields along with scattered military gear. The Ukrainian military said its troops continued to comb areas outside of the capital for mines, the dead and for any lingering Russian fighters. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also called for tougher sanctions on Russia, including a complete energy embargo, over the discoveries north of Kyiv. Kuleba tweeted Sunday that the ""Bucha massacre was deliberate,"" alleging the ""Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can."" Charles Michel, president of the European Council, wrote on Twitter that he was shocked by the ""haunting images of atrocities committed by Russian army"" in the capital region. The EU and non-governmental organizations were assisting in the effort to preserve evidence of war crimes, according to Michel, who promised ""further EU sanctions"" against Russia. The foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. separately condemned what was being described and said Russia would be held accountable. ""We will not allow Russia to cover up their involvement in these atrocities through cynical disinformation and will ensure that the reality of Russia's actions are brought to light,″ British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said. As Russia retreated from the capital, other parts of the country were under siege. Russia has said it is directing troops to eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years. Nearly two weeks ago, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. had determined that Russian forces had committed ""war crimes"" in Ukraine, accusing them of ""indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians."" ""Russia's forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded,"" Blinken said. ""Many of the sites Russia's forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians.""",13,4.083277689156145,0.8080520046904647,3.2752256844656804,11

""Indeed, this is genocide — the elimination of the whole nation and the people,"" Zelenskyy told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday in an exclusive interview. The Ukrainian leader said Russia's invasion, now in its sixth week, is about ""the destruction and extermination"" of the more than 100 nationalities in his country. ""We are the citizens of Ukraine and we don't want to be subdued to the policy of the the Russian federation, and this is the reason we are being destroyed and exterminated,"" Zelenskyy said through a translator, pointing out that the alleged atrocities are happening in ""the Europe of the 21st century."" Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said the streets of Bucha and the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel looked like a ""scene from a horror movie"" as the streets were covered with scores of killed civilians. Zelenskyy's office shared images with ""Face the Nation"" showing at least one mass grave and what appeared to be bodies of civilians lining the streets. Russian troops appeared to be regrouping and shifting focus to the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine this weekend as Ukrainian forces retook territory north of Kyiv, the country's capital and largest city. The shift comes amid a growing humanitarian crisis in the hard-hit port city of Mariupol, where Russian forces have blocked evacuation operations despite agreeing days ago to allow safe passage from the city. Zelenskyy called the situation in Mariupol and other Russian-controlled cities a ""humanitarian disaster,"" saying they have ""lots of bodies"" in the streets and no corridor for food, water and supplies. About 100,000 civilians are still believed to be in Mariupol. Asked if he would accept anything less than a full withdrawal of Russian troops, Zelenskyy said Russian President Vladimir Putin should withdraw all troops to the borders that existed before the invasion on February 24. He said a cease-fire should be the starting point for any discussions about a resolution to the war. ""First the cease-fire, then we can have a meeting with the Russian president,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Let's simply sit down together — the two of us — and we will discuss a point in time when the end of the war will come,"" he said while insisting that Ukraine wants to preserve its sovereignty and ""our strong army."" Last week, the Kremlin accused Ukrainians of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot in Russia. Ukraine denied responsibility for the attack, and Zelenskyy told ""Face the Nation"" he's ""not even paying attention to this kind of insinuation"" by Russia. The Ukrainian leader continued to urge the West to provide his country with heavier and faster equipment, such as warplanes and more anti-missile systems. He thanked the U.S. and the Biden administration for their support so far, but he said Ukraine needs security guarantees on paper. ""As a president, I'm not satisfied with just assurances,"" Zelenskyy said. He also urged Americans to continue helping his war-torn nation. ""Don't forget about Ukraine,"" he said. ""We have the same values … and we are fighting for freedom and we're going to win.""",17,1.3729613009008048,1.5848601587373428,-0.21189885783653795,16
2022-04-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ukrainian-president-warns-retreating-russian-forces-leaving-mines-kyiv/,Ukrainian president warns that retreating Russian forces are leaving mines,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned his people early Saturday that retreating Russian forces were creating ""a complete disaster"" outside the capital, Kyiv, as they leave mines across ""the whole territory,"" even around homes and corpses. ""They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. ""There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers."" He urged residents to wait to resume their normal lives until they are assured that the mines have been cleared and the danger of shelling has passed. Zelenskyy issued the warning as the humanitarian crisis in the encircled port city of Mariupol deepened, with Russian forces blocking evacuation operations for the second day in a row, and the Kremlin accused the Ukrainians of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot on Russian soil. Ukraine denied responsibility for the fiery blast, but if Moscow's claim is confirmed, it would be the war's first known attack in which Ukrainian aircraft penetrated Russian airspace. ""Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, five weeks after Moscow began sending upwards of 150,000 of its own troops across Ukraine's border. Russia continued withdrawing some of its ground forces from areas around Kyiv after saying earlier this week it would reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv. The mayor of a town just outside of Kyiv called Bucha told AFP reporters on Saturday that the Ukrainian army retook control of the commuter town from the Russians. Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk said corpses fill the streets of the heavily destroyed town, and the dead are being buried in mass graves. ""In Bucha, we have already buried 280 people in mass graves,"" Fedoruk told AFP by phone. In Kyiv, there is relief that Ukraine has managed to halt Russia's advance on the capital for now – but they are not letting down their guard. Many there are convinced it could be short-lived, CBS News' Debora Patta reports. From soldiers like Sergei defending Kyiv, there's only contempt for Russia's claim it dramatically reduced operations near the capital. Sergei said he doesn't believe Russia and that maybe it's just a retreat in preparation for a stronger attack. Sergei last picked up a gun 25 years ago during his conscription. In a few weeks, his son turns 18 and will join him in the fight — Russian brutality serving only to strengthen their resolve. Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shifting its troops to the country's east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensified assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the country's east, which includes the city of Mariupol. There are still more than 150,000 residents left inside that city — unable or unwilling to leave as Russian tanks continue to pound what's left of it. On Saturday, another Red Cross convoy will attempt to evacuate more residents from the city, which has been under siege for five weeks.",17,0.8913395219251448,1.9149396858392902,-1.0236001639141454,14

In a late-night video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cast doubt on Russia's stated decision to ""drastically reduce"" attacks around Kyiv and the northeast city of Chernihiv. He said Russian forces were building up in his country's eastern Donbas regions in preparation for a major offensive there.

The regional governor said two Ukrainian helicopters attacked the fuel facility in Belgorod, about 20 miles inside Russia, and video showed storage tanks in flames. A U.S. official confirmed to CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin that Ukrainian helicopters did carry out the strike, and anther one a couple days earlier against an ammunition depot in the same area. The official told Martin there was concern in Washington about how Russia might react to the strikes. Ukrainian officials did not claim responsibility for the attack themselves, but as CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports, it was a significant move by Ukraine's forces. Russian forces have continued attacking Ukrainian cities. They were accused of blocking food and medical supplies from getting into the besieged southern port city of Mariupol on Thursday, and of blocking refugees from getting out despite Moscow agreeing to open a humanitarian corridor. Russia has pummeled Mariupol and other southern and eastern Ukrainian cities with artillery and airstrikes for more than a month, but attempts to push deeper into the country with ground forces hit a wall, and in some places, they've been pushed back. Just west of Zaporizhzhia, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams met some of the Ukrainian forces who stood in their way. In the farming village of Mala Shesternia, as in most of Ukraine, the Russian soldiers were unwelcome invaders. The residents have fled, but Colonel Serhii Romashko told CBS News his men recaptured Mala Shesternia five days ago, killing some Russians and capturing others. Their clothes and shoes are still there, even their cooking pots. Romashko said the Russians were used as cannon fodder — sent in with so little food that they looted from the locals. One of the most notable Russian movements this week was confirmed on Thursday by Ukraine's national nuclear plant operator, Energoatom, which said the last of the Russian forces that had occupied the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant had pulled out. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian troops who dug trenches in the still-contaminated forest around Chernobyl had been exposed to radiation, but there was no immediate confirmation of reports that many were sickened. The global nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said Thursday that it was still assessing the situation at Chernobyl but it had ""not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation"" in the exclusion zone around the plant. The Russian troops from Chernobyl were reportedly headed toward Ukraine's border with Belarus. U.S. and British officials said this week that, while the Putin regime said it would ""drastically reduce"" military operations around Kyiv and the northeast city of Chernihiv to facilitate ongoing peace talks, Russia was really expected to regroup its battered forces in Belarus and other places under its control to stage a new offensive in eastern Ukraine's Donbas regions. As Williams reported, the Russians have war machines Ukraine can only dream of, but Ukraine's forces are destroying them, including two armored personnel carriers she saw on a single stretch of road near Mala Shesternia. Colonel Romashko told her three Russians miraculously escaped from one of the destroyed vehicles, and they're now being treated in a Ukrainian hospital. ""We'll defeat them,"" he said. ""I feel victorious."" Ukraine's resistance has also driven back the Russians from the town of Irpin, just north of Ukraine's capital Kyiv. But the cost is clear to see, with a row of body bags lined up along a city street this week — people slaughtered in what Vladimir Putin calls his ""special military operation."" In Mala Shesternia, the Russians also left behind deadly weapons, including a field carpeted with anti-tank mines. An undetonated rocket propelled grenade sat in the front yard of a home. Putin sent his soldiers in to capture a country that wants only to be free — and his war is killing both Ukrainians and Russians.",14,1.4549346965447034,2.3006510433243577,-0.8457163467796542,20
2022-04-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-donbas-fighting-expected-to-intensify/,U.S. expects fighting to intensify in Donbas region of Ukraine,"U.S. officials expect the fighting to become more intense as Russia's main effort shifts to the Donbas region because more forces will be concentrated in a smaller geographic area. The officials consider Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine, as the linchpin. If and when it falls, the Russians will be on the left flank of the Ukrainian armed forces who have been fighting in the Donbas. Control of Mariupol would give Russia access to a major port, and it would create a land bridge extending from the Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, to Crimea, in the south, allowing Russia to open up its resupply lines. The Russian defense ministry earlier this week announced it would reprioritize eastern Ukraine over its efforts in the North, specifically against Chernihiv and Kyiv, the capital. The Pentagon has seen indications that a small number of Russian forces are moving north from Kyiv, likely to refit and resupply the units for use elsewhere in Ukraine, including potentially the Donbas, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said in a briefing this week. Since the beginning of the invasion, the Pentagon assessed the goal of some Russian lines of assault against Kharkiv and Mariupol were an attempt to section off the east and trap the Ukrainian troops fighting in the Donbas, so they would not be able to help defend other areas. So far, the Russians have been unsuccessful. They have failed to take Kharkiv and have surrounded Mariupol for at least the past week without winning control. A senior U.S. defense official said on Thursday that the Ukrainians are fighting very hard inside Mariupol to keep Russia from a complete takeover. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said this week that the Russians have become much more active in the Donbas region. There are about 1,000 mercenaries from the Wagner Group dedicated to the Donbas, and the Russians have prioritized airstrikes in the region. It remains to be seen whether the refitting and repositioning of troops will make a difference. As the battle map shifts, the U.S. continues to ship in military equipment to the Ukrainians. Weapons included in the $800 million security assistance package recently approved by President Biden have started to arrive in the region. A U.S. official says switchblade drones are scheduled to arrive Friday. The drones are equipped with a javelin anti-tank warhead to hit armored tanks. The Ukrainians have been effective at using the Stinger anti-aircraft and Javelin anti-tank weapons against the Russians.",14,1.5028338863128676,2.0204362713878266,-0.5176023850749589,12

As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reported from near the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, next to a burned-out Russian military vehicle, there's evidence even in Ukraine's artillery-battered south of Putin's stalled invasion. Williams and her team traveled Wednesday with a convoy of Ukrainian soldiers — volunteers from all walks of life — as they headed to reinforce the front line near Kherson. Andriy Rogalski was a crane operator until he signed up earlier this month. He had just two weeks of basic training and told CBS News that he was frightened he could be killed, but that he and the others heading into battle had quashed their fears, because they know what they're fighting for. ""It's pure evil what they did,"" he said of Russia's relentless artillery and missile strikes. The attacks have hit hospitals, apartment buildings, schools and civilians just walking down the road. The U.S. says it's seen clear evidence that Putin's forces are committing war crimes. The United Nations has said thousands of civilians may have been killed in the besieged port city of Mariupol alone. There was hope that more of the estimated 160,000 civilians trapped in that city would be evacuated on Thursday, with Russia agreeing to allow a humanitarian corridor and Ukraine sending about 40 buses in to take people out. But previous corridors have collapsed, with both sides blaming the other for violating ceasefires. Russia is taking heavy losses in the face of a much tougher Ukrainian resistance than many expected. A NATO official estimated that between 7,0000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in just over a month, but Moscow dismisses the tally as an attempt to demoralize Russian forces. Russian officials say the country has lost fewer than 1,400 troops in Ukraine. Crane-operator-turned soldier Andriy Rogalski said he believed Putin's war was a tragedy for both Ukrainians and Russians, and that the Russian president was behaving more like a mafia boss than a world leader.

Gov. Tim Walz wants to dedicate $21 million to help protect the state's services and infrastructure. ""It's a hostile environment in the cyber space,"" said Rohit Tandon, Minnesota IT Services assistant commissioner and chief information security officer. Here in Minnesota, it's not just Russia we're defending against. It's organized crime units and other nation states, too. ""There's a continuous defensive posture that we must maintain,"" Tandon said. And there's a lot to look after. Cybersecurity takes millions of dollars and thousands of employees to watch over critical state agencies like the Minnesota Department of Human Services, Department of Transportation and Department of Public Safety. And if you think breaches don't happen in the U.S., think again. ""We've seen some big ones over the last year to name a few, Colonial Pipeline, JBS foods, that was very close to home,"" Tandon said. We asked Tandon about critical infrastructure like the energy grid or our water supply: Who is keeping an eye on that? ""We're always open to having dialogue about the threats, we're seeing and sharing that intelligence with them,"" Tandon said. ""But I think they are an independent entity that is responsible for taking actions to defend and protect that infrastructure that they are responsible for."" Xcel Energy says it's working with state and federal partners to closely monitor threats from Russia. St. Paul Regional water services gets alerts from those same partners if there's a serious concern. It also pays pros to stress test its systems to expose vulnerabilities. Those vulnerabilities evolve with the times -- from email phishing during pandemic lockdowns to targeted attacks during the civil unrest of 2020. ""We had multiple cyber hacktivists, if I may use that term, targeting to trying to disrupt through denial of service attacks,"" Tandon said. ""Resources such as unemployment insurance, health benefits, even how we provide drivers license services.' And as those potential breaches loom, Tandon says, now is the time to double down. ""It is a challenge we continue to deal with,"" Tandon said. Tandon says his department offers daily briefings for all county partners to talk through current threats. There's also federal funding for broader counties, cities and townships that the governor is looking to match if his budget proposal is approved.",3,7.587447063428106,4.969381604436402,2.6180654589917047,19

Despite the ongoing negotiations, the war continues. As of Wednesday, the United Nations said it had driven more than 4 million people to flee Ukraine, upending their lives and making them refugees. At least 6 million more Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes to seek safety elsewhere inside the country. As CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reports from the capital city of Kyiv — one of the areas where Russia said it would scale back its assault — U.S. military officials see President Vladimir Putin's latest move more as a repositioning of forces than a retreat, and in Kyiv and elsewhere, the threat remained high on Wednesday. Boardroom discussions like Tuesday's peace talks in Turkey mean little on the battlefield. Patta says Ukrainians are not letting their guard down, with soldiers continuing to patrol checkpoints around Kyiv, on high alert as they search for Russian saboteurs. With shelling still heard north of the capital on Wednesday morning ,it was clear that the danger still lurks on the ground, and in the sky. ""The enemy is still here,"" President Volodomyr Zelenskyy told his country on Wednesday night, after Russia's announcement. ""Missile and air attacks have not stopped… that's the reality."" Few places have felt that more than the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has all but collapsed. Even if peace is given a chance, all that's left of Mariupol is rubble and ruin. Children from the besieged city, and many others like it in Ukraine's south and east, want their childhoods back. ""I'm so tired,"" said one little girl. ""And my toys have no batteries in them."" Older Ukrainians just want to forget. ""What else can I do,"" asked Genaidy as he gathered what he could from his damaged apartment to flee Mariupol. ""There's nothing left for me here."" He's walking away after nearly 40 years working as a shoemaker in the city. Russian-backed separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine — where the war now raging had simmered quietly since Putin's last invasion in 2014 — are in no mood for peace. Video emerged showing rebels forcing Ukrainians to strip down, claiming they were searching for Nazi tattoos. In nearby Mykolaiv, a Russian rocket ripped through a government building on Tuesday, leaving a gaping hole, and fresh trauma. One woman watched helplessly as her colleague died in her arms — one of 12 people killed in the strike according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. Even if the Russian military does make good on its promise to pull back from Kyiv, in the towns around the capital, where fierce battles have been raging, there's not much left to fight for. While Ukraine claims to have retaken nearby towns like Irpin, those areas have been decimated, and many people did not make it out alive. The U.K. said Wednesday that its latest intelligence did show some Russian troops pulling back from the outskirts of Kyiv into Belarus and Russia, ""to reorganize and resupply"" after suffering heavy losses. The Ukrainian government said it expected Russia to retain some troops near the capital, to keep the pressure on and prevent Ukraine's forces from heading to the eastern front, where the war is still raging. Zelenskyy, along with the U.S. and his other Western partners, have made it clear they'll believe Russia's claim to be easing the assault on Kyiv and the northeastern city of Chernihiv when they see it happen, and not before. Thirty-five days into an invasion that Putin insisted for months he had no intention of launching, the skepticism was unsurprising. On Wednesday morning, the governor of Chernihiv said his region was ""shelled all night"" by Russian artillery: ""Civil infrastructure has been destroyed again, libraries, shopping malls and other facilities have been destroyed, and many houses have been destroyed.""",17,6.603430873585374,4.2542059603421665,2.3492249132432077,20

There appeared to be tangible progress, with Russia declaring that it would ""drastically reduce"" its offensive around Kyiv and another city ""to increase mutual trust"" and enable the talks to continue. Ukrainian officials have been pushing for a ceasefire agreement to enable thousands of civilians to evacuate from besieged towns and cities that are still being bombed by Russian forces. Russia's lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky emerged from Tuesday's talks to say his country had received ""a clearly formulated position from Ukraine,"" and that ""the possibility of making peace will become closer"" as the two sides continue to work quickly to reach compromises. Ukrainian negotiators also indicated some progress as the two sides seek to hammer out mutual ""security guarantees."" David Arahamia, one of the Ukrainian negotiators, declared a ""first victory"" merely by having the venue for the negotiations moved from Belarus, a Russian ally on Ukraine's northern border, to Turkey. ""We see Turkey as one of our guarantor countries for Ukrainian safety."" But the most significant declaration after Tuesday's talks came from Moscow, where the ministry of defense issued a statement saying it would ""reduce military activity"" in order to ""create the necessary conditions for further negotiations."" Ukraine's leaders have made it clear since last week that they're willing to accept a formal neutral status for the country, ruling out NATO membership and accepting some constraints on its military, in exchange for an end to the war. ""Due to the fact that negotiations on the preparation of the treaty on the neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine, as well as on the provision of security guarantees to Ukraine, are moving into practice, taking into account the principles discussed during today's meeting, by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation — in order to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations and achievement of the ultimate goal… a decision was made to radically, at times, reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions,"" Russia's Deputy Minister of Defense Alexander Fomin said.",29,5.615812039755153,7.222420784023346,-1.6066087442681933,18
2022-03-29,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-astronaut-mark-vande-hei-wraps-up-u-s-record-355-day-space-station-stay/,NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei wraps up U.S.-record 355-day space station stay,"NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, launched by Russia to the International Space Station aboard a Soyuz spacecraft last April, returned Wednesday to a world torn by war in Ukraine and escalating superpower tension when he closed out a 355-day stay in orbit, the longest single flight by a U.S. astronaut. Despite Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and a sharp break in East-West space relations — including threatening rhetoric and even a YouTube video, later said to be a ""joke,"" suggesting Vande Hei could be left behind aboard the station — the NASA astronaut and two cosmonaut crewmates returned to Earth on Wednesday exactly as planned. Outgoing Expedition 66 commander Anton Shkaplerov turned the lab over to NASA astronaut Thomas Marshburn on Tuesday in a traditional change-of-command ceremony marked by hugs and handshakes, with no hint of the discord threatening U.S.-Russian relations on Earth. ""I'm very proud I was the commander of this excellent crew,"" Shkaplerov said before handing a symbolic ""key to the space station"" over to Marshburn. ""People have problems on Earth, on orbit we are one crew. I think ISS is (a) symbol of the friendship and cooperation and (the) symbol of future of exploration of space."" Said Marshburn: ""It's an honor and a privilege to accept command of the International Space Station and continuing that international partnership and that legacy in spaceflight. Want to thank you, you've been a wonderful commander, really can't thank you enough."" After bidding their seven station crewmates farewell late Tuesday, Shkaplerov, Vande Hei and flight engineer Pyotr Dubrov strapped into their Soyuz MS-19/65S ferry ship and undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 3:21 a.m. EDT Wednesday. After a pause to give Dubrov time to carry out a photo survey of the station's Russian modules, Soyuz commander Shkaplerov monitored an automated de-orbit rocket firing and a fiery plunge back to Earth, landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 7:28 a.m. Wednesday (5:28 p.m. local time). Vande Hei and first-time flier Dubrov logged 355 days seven hours and 45 minutes off planet, covering 5,680 orbits spanning 150.1 million miles. Including an earlier space station stay in 2017-18, Vande Hei's total time in space across two missions now stands at 523 days, moving him up to third on the list of most-experienced U.S. astronauts. Asked how he kept a positive attitude during such a long flight away from friends and family, Vande Hei said he tried ""to pay attention to just the day that I'm on and not think about how many days are left."" ""And I've been very, very fortunate to have wonderful crewmates,"" he told CBS News in a recent space-to-ground interview. ""Everybody's just getting along fantastically, and it's been a pleasure."" He also made a point of meditating for 20 minutes each day in the multi-window cupola compartment, taking in spectacular views of Earth amid a sea of stars. ""Every morning, before everybody else is awake, with all the lights off, I can sit and look for 20 minutes at the stars,"" he said. And I feel very, very fortunate to have those experiences. ... I wish I could find a good way to describe it to people. It's awe-inspiring every time."" NASA flight surgeons and support personnel flew to Kazakhstan aboard a NASA jet last Friday and were on hand at the Soyuz landing site to welcome Vande Hei home and to carry out initial medical checks as he began readjusting to gravity after nearly a full year in weightlessness. Vande Hei and his support crew will fly back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston shortly after landing while Shkaplerov and Dubrov board a Russian aircraft for a flight to the cosmonaut training center in Star City near Moscow. Facing months of physical rehabilitation to regain his ""land legs,"" Vande Hei told a NASA interviewer last week he was especially looking forward to ""making a cup of coffee for my wife and myself and then sitting in bed and talking to each other while we're either reading or catching up on the news."" ""Just having relaxing Saturday mornings is a wonderful thing,"" he said. ""And then after that, I'd probably say guacamole and chips."" Dubrov and Vande Hei were launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome aboard a different Soyuz on April 9, 2021, joining spacecraft commander Oleg Novitskiy. When they took off, Vande Hei and Dubrov did not know how long their stay in space might last because of uncertainty about the Russian launch sequence. ""I didn't know with certainty that the flight would be this long,"" he told CBS News. ""But I certainly knew that it was a possibility, and I made sure my family was aware of that. And they all agreed that I should still say yes. So no, I didn't have any second thoughts. I felt like it was an opportunity to fill a need that we had, and I was very happy to be able to fill it."" Last October, Russia launched a Soyuz carrying Shkaplerov, a Russian actress and her director to shoot scenes for a movie aboard the space station. The actress and director took the seats that normally would have been available to carry Dubrov and Vande Hei back to Earth after a six-month stay in space. Novitskiy ferried both of them home last October, leaving Shkaplerov behind to bring Dubrov and Vande Hei back to Earth this week after nearly a full year in space. Mission duration for Shkaplerov will stand at 176 days. Several Russian cosmonauts have logged flights lasting more than a year — the world record is 437 days 17 hours — but Vande Hei's 355-day mark sets a new single-flight record for U.S. astronauts, eclipsing Scott Kelly's 340-day mark and Christina Koch's 328-day stay aboard the station, the world record for a female. ""I think it's great,"" Kelly said in a recent telephone interview with CBS News. ""What's the saying, records are made to be broken? And that means we're doing things better than we did it before. So yeah, congratulations to him."" As for his perspective, Vande Hei said ""I don't think it's a record that I would even attribute to me, it's a record for our space program."" ""I have a tremendous amount of respect for Scott and Christina, both,"" he said in a NASA interview. ""And I know they would both be extremely happy, as the explorers that they are, to see that we're furthering exploration, we're getting people into space for longer and longer periods of time."" ""I expect this record to be broken, and that will be a further success for our space program,"" he added. But that record will not be broken by Vande Hei. He told his wife before launch the current mission would be his last. ""This will be the end of a phase of my life,"" he said. ""I promised my wife I will not be flying to space again. So that will be bittersweet. I'm very, very grateful to have had this amazing opportunity to come up to the space station, to be up here with such wonderful people who I will consider friends for the rest of my life, to serve my country and all of humanity."" ""So there'll be gratitude for that, enthusiasm for the future and a little bit of sadness, too, because I'll be shutting the door on that, I won't be able to come back,"" he added. ""And this is a very, very special place.""",3,5.482701425953193,5.883730581465185,-0.40102915551199203,3

It wasn't clear to what extent Russia's military would reduce its artillery barrage against Kyiv's suburbs and the decimated city of Chernihiv, close to the Russian border, but it was the first time Moscow had given any indication that it would reduce the intensity of its ""special military operation"" since it began on February 24. Russia's defense ministry has said it will now focus its efforts on eastern Ukraine to ensure the ""independence"" of two breakaway regions held by Moscow-backed separatist fighters. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the round of Russia-Ukraine talks in his country had brought ""the most meaningful progress"" to date toward ending the war, but his American counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was more cautious. ""I would leave it to our Ukrainian partners to characterize whether there is any genuine progress and whether Russia is engaging meaningfully,"" Blinken told reporters on Tuesday. ""What I can say is this: There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We're focused on the latter. And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people. And that continues as we speak."" While Russia's defense ministry pinned the change in tactics to the peace talks, a former Ukrainian ambassador told BBC News that, in his view, it was down to Russia being forced to accept realities on the ground. ""Maybe they realize that they are not winning this war, and they will never win,"" Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria, Dr. Olexander Scherba told the BBC after Tuesday's negotiations. ""We know what we are fighting for, Russians don't."" CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports that Putin's ground forces have been stalled for weeks in their approach to Kyiv and other towns, and they're taking heavy losses. As many as 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in just over a month of fighting, according to an estimate by a NATO official. Unable to advance due to logistical failures and stiff Ukrainian resistance, Russia has resorted to a war of attrition, pummeling cities from afar with missiles and artillery. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address Monday evening that Russia's ""ruthless war against our nation"" had killed at least 143 children. He lauded Ukraine's defense forces for refusing to let Russian troops take Kyiv, and said they were even pushing Putin's military out of some towns it had seized near the capital. ""Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, returning control over Ukrainian territory,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The occupiers are getting pushed away from Irpin, from Kyiv. However, it is still too early to talk about security in this part of the region. The fighting continues."" Williams and her team saw first-hand this week that advances by Ukraine's troops do not guarantee safety for the people living in towns that are reclaimed from Russia. Williams was with Ukrainian forces as they traveled by road on Monday toward the town of Makariv, about 40 miles west of Kyiv. Ukraine said its troops recaptured Makariv last week, but as they approached, the Ukrainian forces spotted Russian drones flying overhead. It was a tense situation. Twice the convoy left their vehicles by the side of the road and scattered for cover. The booms of shells landing could be heard nearby. Williams said it was clear that Ukraine's fight for freedom could be long and dangerous.",14,6.052134590518028,4.630345626230809,1.4217889642872192,18
2022-03-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-syria-putin-assad/,Was Putin's playbook for Ukraine written in Syria?,"As Russian missiles bombard Ukrainian cities and the U.S. secretary of state has called Russia's actions in Ukraine ""war crimes,"" an eyewitness to crimes against humanity in Syria says he fears for the Ukrainian people because he knows what the Russian president is capable of. He saw it in his own country. ""I see the news coming out of Ukraine, my heart hurts because I know what Russia has done in Ukraine — what it can do — because I know what it's done in Syria,"" said one Syrian eyewitness, who spoke with CBS News' investigative unit in his first U.S. television interview. The eyewitness' account is echoed by Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes. Rapp told CBS News that Russian President Vladimir Putin crafted his Ukraine playbook years ago in Syria, when his longtime ally President Bashar Al-Assad cracked down on the pro-democracy movement. More than 250,000 civilians have died in the more than decadelong, brutal Syrian civil war that followed the Arab Spring movement in 2011. ""When it looked like Assad was going to be overthrown by his own people, the Russians came all in and joined in the bombardment of hospitals and civilian neighborhoods,"" Rapp said. With Russia's support, Assad remains in power amid allegations of widespread crimes against humanity. ""We have to recognize the critical role that Russia played in the crimes committed by the Assad regime and crimes, so horrendous that the UN stopped counting the dead at 400,000 years ago,"" Rapp said. Earlier this month on Capitol Hill, the Syrian eyewitness, known only as ""the Gravedigger"" to protect his identity because of ongoing security threats to him and his family, shared his first-hand account of two mass graves in Syria. ""Twice a week, multiple trailer trucks would come and each truck would have upwards of 100 to 400 or more bodies,"" he said. ""They were tortured to death, you could see clearly the signs of torture on their bodies. … This was a systematic machinery of death."" He pointed CBS News to a site near the Syrian capital called Al Qutayfah, where satellite images show its transformation from a barren field to a series of trenches. ""Everything that was going on, the mass graves, were systematic and were part of what the Assad regime wanted to do,"" he said. In a landmark decision in January, a German court found a former Syrian colonel, Anwar Raslan, guilty of crimes against humanity, based on the Gravedigger's account and other evidence. Syrian refugee Omar Al-Shogre thought he would never make it out of jail alive. Showing a cigarette burn on his fingers, Shogre described the physical and emotional torture he endured during his three years in Syrian detention. He said the regime kept meticulous records of the prisoners who died around him. ""I numbered hundreds of bodies, if not thousands of bodies,"" he told CBS News. ""This human part of you disappears in order for you to survive."" Several Americans have disappeared in Syria, including journalist Austin Tice, humanitarian aid worker Layla Shweikani and psychologist Majd Kamalmaz. Shogre, now a student at Georgetown University, said he still fears for his life. ""We talked to the FBI, we talked to other, you know, war crimes committees in different countries because I expect myself to be killed at any day,"" he said. Seven years after his mother helped him escape from Syria, Shogre is now an advocate for human rights. Last month, he reunited with his sister, showing that it's possible to thread the needle of despair and stitch together hope and purpose. ""I can cry for 100,000 years for what I went through. It won't even be enough, right? But I am going to tell everyone to tell the story of the Syrian people through me,"" Shogre said. ""What is the benefit of your power, if you don't use it for good?"" While the evidence is overwhelming, the Syrian president has repeatedly denied crimes against his own people. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia's attacks on civilians in Ukraine are war crimes. Putin's spokesman has ""categorically rejected"" the war crimes allegation, in a move that also follows the playbook from Syria. ""You could kill your way out of it,"" Rapp, the former ambassador, said. ""And that's the lesson that Russia has taken to heart too as it commits these crimes in Ukraine.""",13,4.918354253669999,5.485769148127508,-0.5674148944575093,19

Turkish officials had said the latest round of direct negotiations, aimed at crafting an agreement for a ceasefire, could begin as soon as Monday, but a spokesman for the Kremlin in Moscow said it would likely be Tuesday. Despite the ongoing negotiations between the two sides, the fighting continues. Over the weekend, Russia seemingly focused its efforts on capturing territory in Ukraine's east, including the devastated city of Mariupol. Vladimir Putin's forces have failed to take the city, and many others, despite weeks of relentless bombing. CBS News correspondent Debora Patta met residents of the besieged port city who managed to escape to a town near the capital, where Ukraine's president offered a message to Russian media. In the unusual interview with Russia's government-controlled news outlets, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to four prominent journalists from the country, detailing the horrors of the war being waged on Ukraine. The Kremlin promptly banned any Russian outlets from reporting what he said or using video of the interview, but it was broadcast outside the country. Patta said that, given what she and her team have seen on the ground, it's no wonder the Putin regime didn't want the Zelenskyy interview aired in Russia. Plumes of black smoke choked the sky over the weekend after a Russian cruise missile slammed into a fuel depot in the western city of Lviv. Firefighters battled for 12 hours to put out the blaze. The fighting and artillery fire intensified around Kyiv, too, leaving battle-scarred landscapes around the capital. But it is the apocalyptic scenes from Mariupol that really show the extent of the human toll of Russia's war in Ukraine. Patta met Valentina, who was born, married and was raising her children in a house in the southern city. Her lifetime of memories was reduced to rubble along with her home. ""What is left for us?"" she asked through sobs. ""There's nowhere to live here now."" Alexander stayed behind, and is just grateful to be alive. ""I survived,"" he told his daughter in a message, breaking down in tears. ""Thank God… your dad is alive."" Victoria Medynska remained in the hell of Mariupol for three weeks before finally making the death-defying car trip out of the city. She escaped to the town of Brovary, on the outskirts of Kyiv. All she has left of her life in Mariupol are precious photos and videos stored on her phone. ""I cried, because – it's hard to speak, I'm sorry,"" she told Patta, unable to recount the terror she left behind. Russian airstrikes and artillery have left the street that Medynska and her family called home a ruin of broken concrete and twisted metal. Her daughter Masha, just seven years old, remembers everything, including the fear. Her school was bombed, and her childhood shattered. One year ago, Masha celebrated her birthday surrounded by laughter. On Sunday, it was a very different celebration as Masha turned seven – no longer a carefree schoolgirl, but one of the 4 million children displaced by this war. ""I had so many friends,"" she told Patta. ""Now I have no friends."" A humanitarian corridor was opened briefly on Sunday, allowing the evacuation of just over 500 more people from Mariupol, but officials say there are still around 160,000 people trapped there, and they're running very low on food and water.",17,4.665734160955531,1.806915629539148,2.858818531416383,20

They said there was a drone overhead and they wanted the crew to disperse so they would be less of a target. After getting back to the vehicle, the CBS News crew turned around and traveled at high speed to leave the area. But Ukrainian troops again ordered the crew out of the vehicle, saying there were four Russian drones overhead. The Ukrainian troops told the crew to take cover in a nearby forest and spread out because there was Russian shelling. The CBS News crew was eventually able to safely leave the area and is no longer near Makariv. Most of Makariv's residents were evacuated earlier this month, but not everyone was able to flee.

""I see the news coming out of Ukraine, my heart hurts because I know what Russia has done in Ukraine — what it can do — because I know what it's done in Syria,"" he said. Russia's support has been critical for years in keeping the government of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad in power. The human cost of the more than decadelong civil war has been staggering: United Nations estimates put the number of Syrians dead at 400,000 in the conflict that followed the peaceful Arab Spring pro-democracy movement. ""As far as Putin and Assad are concerned, they should go to the trash bin of history for what they've done in the world,"" the eyewitness told CBS News.

CBS News has learned that he also briefed officials at the White House and the State Department. He is working with the advocacy group, the Syrian Emergency Task Force.

Their use has not been independently confirmed, but the news caused concern that Russia may be escalating its tactics by unleashing a particularly destructive and disturbing type of weaponry as its ground invasion of the country stalls due to logistical problems and fierce Ukrainian resistance. White phosphorus is a wax-like chemical substance, often yellowish or colorless, that some people say smells like garlic. It ignites instantly when it comes into contact with oxygen, and its primary function in weaponry is to burn, fast and bright. It is used in incendiary munitions by militaries around the world, including the United States, often to illuminate targets as part of tracer munitions at night. White phosphorus is also used to create smokescreens during the day, as it puts off a huge amount of smoke when it burns. It can ignite fast-burning, fast-spreading fires on the ground, and once ignited, white phosphorus is extremely difficult to extinguish. The substance sticks to many surfaces, including skin and clothing. All of those properties make it extremely dangerous to civilians. White phosphorus can cause deep burns, all the way down to and even through bone, and can reignite after initial treatment. ""Incendiary weapons cause devastating burns, and in far worse ways than any of the standard scald or fire burns,"" Dr. Rola Hallam, a physician who treated incendiary weapons victims in Syria, said in a report by Human Rights Watch. ""They can burn through everything. If they can burn through metal, what hope does human flesh have?"" Because of its incendiary effects, the use of phosphorus in war is supposed to be tightly regulated under international law — but it is not banned. Phosphorus is not classed as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention. When used as a weapon, it can cause fire to rain down on targets, inflicting indiscriminate damage. It is illegal, therefore, for phosphorus to be used near civilians, because international law requires that combatants distinguish between civilian and military elements. There have been documented civilian casualties from the use of white phosphorus in war zones around the world, including Syria, Afghanistan, Gaza and elsewhere, according to Human Rights Watch. The organization has called on world leaders to close loopholes in the international agreement governing incendiary weapons, or fully ban them, but claims that ""a small number of countries have blocked progress."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced this week that the U.S. assesses that ""members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine,"" and noted ""credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians"" — but he did not include any mention of allegations involving use of white phosphorus.",13,5.988340424771962,4.6438022261916005,1.344538198580361,5
2022-03-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-struck-resupply-ship/,U.S. confirms Ukraine struck Russian ship; Russian cruise missiles failing at rate of 20-60% in Ukraine,"A senior U.S. defense official briefed reporters on the Pentagon's latest assessments of Russia's war in Ukraine — here are some of the highlights: Russia is experiencing high cruise missile failure rates upon launch, ranging from ""20% to 60%"" a senior defense official said this week, citing U.S. assessments. In many cases, the official noted, the air-launched cruise missiles simply don't release from the rails of the plane that is trying to fire them. Russian planes are currently flying about 300 sorties a day. Further, Russian forces appear to be running lowest on air-launched cruise missiles and may be trying conserve those missiles, the official said. Though they still have about 50% of their stockpile remaining, the declining stocks of precision-guided missiles is a factor in the increasing use of dumb bombs. Russia's assault on Ukraine, now in its 30th day, has fired 1,260 missiles, according to the official. It appears that Russia, for the moment, is not pursuing a ground offense against Kyiv, though the capital continues to be hammered by missile and artillery fire. Russian troops are no longer moving toward Kyiv, and there has been no movement from the north or northwest. They are also being held to positions they had in the east and continuing to dig into defensive positions. U.S. defense officials assess that the Donbass region is now the Kremlin's top priority, but it's still too early to determine whether Russia has begun to limit its objectives, perhaps trying to split off that part of the country. As Russian combat power on the ground suffers declines — now assessed to be about 85 to 90% of what it was a month ago, with reduced numbers of troops, tanks, military vehicles and aircraft — the U.S. is seeing the first indications that Russian troops are moving in from Georgia. The Defense Department confirmed that Ukrainian forces struck the Russian military resupply ship Orsk while it was docked at the port of Berdyansk, in southern Ukraine. Just a couple days earlier, Russian state media had shown video of the military landing ship offloading armored vehicles and tanks at the port, which had been taken over by Russia. From the images available, officials believe that Ukraine destroyed the ship. The heaviest fighting continues to be taking place in Mariupol, Donbass, Mykolaiv and Chernihiv. Defense officials have seen reports Ukrainians are pushing the Russians out of Mykolaiv and Chernihiv, and there has been significant Ukrainian resistance in Kherson, which is no longer as solidly under Russian control as it was. There has been no confirmation of the Ukrainian claim that Russia has used phosphorus or thermobaric weapons.",14,3.8602631016783624,1.5287269867776037,2.331536114900759,12
2022-03-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-airstrike-mariupol-theater-300-killed-latest-news-war/,Ukraine says 300 killed in Russian strike that hit Mariupol theater being used as a bomb shelter,"A Russian strike on a theater in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol earlier this month killed around 300 people, officials said Friday. It was believed that around 1,300 civilians were using the theater as a bomb shelter to escape Russia's brutal, ongoing assault on the besieged city, according to Ukraine's human rights commissioner. The word for ""children"" had been written in huge letters on the ground outside both ends of the theater so that it could be seen from planes overhead. Russia denied striking the theater, repeating widely debunked claims that it has not targeted any civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and accusing Ukrainian ""nationalists"" of blowing the theater up as a provocation, without offering any evidence. The United Nations said Friday that it was receiving mounting evidence of mass graves in Mariupol, including one that appeared to be holding about 200 victims of the war. Ukrainian officials estimate there are still roughly 100,000 civilians trapped in the city, where Russia's siege cut off food, water, gas and electricity supplies weeks ago. Some 10 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes after just one month of war, with at least 3.5 million driven to seek safety in neighboring countries. More than half of them have crossed Ukraine's western border into Poland, where President Joe Biden was paying a visit on Friday in a show of solidarity both with the refugees, and those helping them. ""With every day of our defense, we are getting closer to the peace that we need so much,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Thursday evening address. ""We can't stop even for a minute, for every minute determines our fate, our future, whether we will live."" CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams visited a Ukrainian military base and saw some of those defenses — and a group of new Ukrainian recruits getting ready to join the fight. Lieutenant Miroslav Hai was a filmmaker and military reservist before Russia invaded his country, and said Ukrainians would continue defending their nation and their freedom no matter what, even if Putin uses nuclear weapons. ""Normal person don't want war. But we must,"" he said. ""Because if we don't stop [Russia] now, our children will begin fight with Russia… If we don't stop Putin in Ukraine, he will go more. If we don't stop Putin in Ukraine, he will go to other countries."" Officials told CBS News that recruits at the base receive only about a week of basic training before they are sent to the front lines. In the armory, they told Williams they were receiving weapons from NATO countries, but that they need more, as well as vehicles to move troops around. Hai said he felt hatred when he thought of what Russia was doing to Ukraine. ""I think that we have little bit similar situation with Soviet Union and Afghanistan,"" he told CBS News. ""Afghanistan destroyed Soviet Union, and I hope that Ukraine will destroy Russian empire."" On Friday, Russia's defense ministry said 1,351 of its troops had been killed in Ukraine since the ""special military operation"" began. The ministry said 3,825 more servicemembers had been injured, though NATO believes those numbers to be much higher, estimating that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in the war so far. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 1,300 Ukrainian service members had been killed defending the country from Russia's invasion. Analysts told the Washington Post that the true number of Ukrainian losses could be higher as well. In some key areas around the capital, Ukrainian forces have reportedly managed to push Russian troops back. A Russian supply ship was destroyed on Thursday at a port not far from Mariupol, and Ukrainians were pushing to take back a town near Kyiv that was claimed by the Russian invaders. But while Putin's ground forces have been largely bogged down for weeks, particularly around Kyiv, they have continued to push against Ukraine's defenders in the south and east. On Friday, officials said the northern city of Chernihiv — decimated after weeks of incessant shelling but still under Ukrainian control — had been completely cut off by Russian forces. ""The city has been conditionally, operationally surrounded by the enemy,"" the regional governor said on television, adding that Chernihiv was still under fire from warplanes and artillery.",17,1.802030105849219,6.090047972960173,-4.288017867110954,20
2022-03-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/russia-hacking-threat-energy-sector/,U.S. announces charges against Russians in global hacking campaigns,"The Justice Department revealed Thursday that four Russian nationals working for the Russian government have been previously indicted for two separate incidents of attempted hacking into energy facilities in the U.S. and abroad between 2012 and 2018, targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in some 135 countries. Justice Department officials said in a press release that one of the campaigns, if successful, would have given Russia the ability to disrupt energy sector computer systems ""at a future time of its choosing,"" resulting in ""potentially catastrophic"" damage to critical infrastructure. A Justice Department official told reporters that these charges were unsealed because ""they do a good job of highlighting the kind of thing that we are concerned about in the current environment."" The official added, ""they're very good examples of the dark art of the possible."" The unsealing of the indictments follows President Biden's announcement Monday that ""evolving intelligence"" suggests Russia is exploring options for potential cyberattacks targeting the U.S. homeland. For weeks, the Biden administration has urged U.S. businesses, including energy companies, to monitor for signs of potential cyber attacks should the Kremlin lash out following the severe economic sanctions put in place against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. ""Russian state-sponsored hackers pose a serious and persistent threat to critical infrastructure both in the United States and around the world,"" Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney general, said in a statement Thursday. ""Although the criminal charges unsealed today reflect past activity, they make crystal clear the urgent ongoing need for American businesses to harden their defenses and remain vigilant."" The first incident involved the alleged hacking of a petrochemical refinery in Saudi Arabia in 2017, where an employee of Russia's state research center, Evgeny Gladkikh, allgedly deployed malware in an attempt to overtake the industrial control systems and operational technology, designed by Schneider Electric. Instead, the installed malware, known as ""Triton,"" prompted two automatic emergency shutdowns of operations, according to court documents. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned the Russian government research group for deploying Triton malware against U.S. partners in the Middle East, as well as scanning and probing U.S. facilities. The second operation, according to the Justice Department, allegedly involved a supply chain hack commonly referred to as ""Dragonfly"" or ""Havex and a ""spearphishing"" campaign by three FSB hackers. Pavel Akulov, Mikhail Gavrilov, and Marat Tyukov are accused of spending at least five years attempting to infiltrate organizations in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants and utility and power transmission companies, the government said. If successful, the Justice Department said the mission could have disrupted critical energy services to hospitals, homes and businesses. ""The actor has been involved in repeated attempts to gain access to U.S. and European critical infrastructure across multiple sectors including utilities, manufacturing, airports and others. We are concerned that while there have been significant remediation efforts after each of the intrusion campaigns, the actor may retain some access,"" John Hultquist, VP of Intelligence Analysis at Mandiant told CBS News. Cybersecurity researched have observed this actor burrow into critical infrastructure. ""Our concern with recent events is that this might be the contingency we have been waiting for,"" Hultquist noted. Hackers did succeed in gaining access to computers at Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Plant in Burlington, Kansas, which operates a nuclear power plant. However, the hacked computers were not connected to the industrial control system itself. None of the four defendants is in custody, according to Justice Department officials. ""In these two cases, we've determined that the benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future,"" a Justice Department official told reporters. Russia has repeatedly denied engaging in cyber attacks against the United States and its allies. CBS News has reached out to the Russian Embassy in Washington for comment. Following the announcement, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), FBI and Department of Energy released a technical bulletin detailing the global intrusion campaigns. ""While this advisory documents historical cyber activity, CISA, FBI and DOE assess that state-sponsored Russian cyber operations continue to pose an ongoing threat to U.S. Energy Sector networks,"" the agencies said in a joint statement. ""The U.S. energy sector and critical infrastructure organizations more broadly are urged to apply the recommended mitigations."" The U.S. government has recommended critical infrastructure owners and operators deploy robust network segmentation between information technology and industrial control system networks, enforce multi-factor authentication and limit permissions associated with privileged accounts.",3,7.160719476176906,6.717169401551401,0.443550074625505,1
2022-03-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-russian-landing-ship-destroyed-berdyansk-putin-deaths-nato/,"Ukraine claims to destroy Russian military ship as NATO says Russia may have lost 15,000 troops in just a month of war","Zhytomyr, Ukraine — Ukrainians have suffered immensely in Vladimir Putin's war on their country, but it appears the conflict is not going well for Russia's forces. By some estimates, Russia has already lost as many troops in 28 days as it did during ten years of war in Afghanistan during the 1980s. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams and her team were in Ukraine a month ago when Russia launched its first strikes, but instead of the lightning invasion that Putin may have anticipated, she said his ground forces appear stalled. Ukraine claims it has killed six Russian generals, and on Thursday the country's military said it had destroyed at least one Russian naval ship in an occupied port town on the south coast. Just a couple days after Russian state media showed video of the military landing ship Orsk offloading armored vehicles and tanks at the port of Berdyansk, in southern Ukraine, Kyiv's navy said Wednesday that it had destroyed the ship. Unverified video and photos posted online showed thick black smoke rising from the dockside. Russia said earlier in the week that it had a total of 10 ships ready to dock along Ukraine's southern coast, carrying dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and other equipment to bolster its push to capture other vital port cities in the region. Putin's forces are hammering southern Ukraine with air and artillery strikes, trying to seize a swath of ground across to create a land corridor between the occupied Crimean Peninsula and Russian territory, but cities like the besieged port of Mariupol stand in the way, and Ukraine's forces have refused to give up the fight to hold onto them. Given the significant losses Russia is suffering — even if Putin's regime isn't telling the Russian people about them — there have been many rumors of his senior advisors coming under intense pressure. On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked about the ""disappearance"" of Russia's normally frequently seen Minister of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, who hadn't been seen or heard from publicly in days. ""Well, the Minister of Defense now has a lot of worries, as you understand,"" Peskov told reporters. ""Now is not quite the time for media activity. This is quite understandable."" Soon after, the Russian government released a short video clip showing Putin holding a meeting — via video conference call — with his national security team, and Shoigu was visible on the screen in Putin's office. The defense chief wasn't heard to say anything in the short clip, but the Kremlin said he had ""reported progress in the special military operation and efforts being made by the military to provide humanitarian aid, ensure security, and restore vital infrastructure on the liberated territories."" The human cost of Russia's invasion — not only for Ukraine, but for Putin's own military — has been horrifying. If the Russian leader thought he'd score an easy victory in Ukraine, Williams said he undoubtedly knows better now. In just one month, between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, according to an estimate by a NATO official. Ukraine's forces are still outgunned, but in some places, particularly on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv, they're clawing back territory from the invaders. But as Williams reports, it is Ukrainian civilians paying the highest price for Putin's brutal invasion. The besieged city of Mariupol has been laid to waste, and with more than 100,000 civilians still thought to be trapped inside, Russia continues pummeling them from the air. Masha, 15, made it out of Mariupol, but her right leg had to be amputated after it was torn apart by a Russian strike. Her doctor said she was so traumatized that she couldn't eat for days. In a video message Wednesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of trying to wipe his people off the face of the Earth. ""It breaks my heart, heart of all Ukrainians, and every free person on the planet,"" he said, calling on the U.S. and its NATO partners to provide more weapons to help his country repel the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy warned that if Ukraine isn't given what it needs to stop Putin, the Russian leader could take his fight beyond Ukrainian soil. ""This is only the beginning for Russia on the Ukrainian land,"" he said. ""Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe, of all people in the world."" In an address to NATO leaders gathered in Brussels, including President Joe Biden, Zelenskyy said Russian forces were using weapons banned under international law for the devastation they cause. ""Phosphorus bombs were used. Russian phosphorus bombs,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to banned type of incendiary munitions. ""Adults were killed again, and children were killed again."" In the town of Zhotymyr, west of Kyiv, Williams and her team met Serhei as he sifted through the wreckage of the home he spent 12 years building it for his family. He said Russian airstrikes destroyed it earlier this month, killing four people in his neighborhood. One of those killed was Serhei's daughter Katya, who left behind a one-year-old daughter. ""I wish I died in her place,"" Serhei told CBS News. ""The pain doesn't go away."" ""Of course, I blame Putin,"" he said. ""If I had him in my hands I would butcher him like a goat."" Serhei told Williams that he would raise his granddaughter and, like other Ukrainians, he's determined to rebuild his country.",17,6.7273907228921495,4.1240164362132905,2.603374286678859,20

2022-03-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-summit-history/,A historical look at NATO and its many challenges as Biden heads to summit on Ukraine,"As President Biden travels to Belgium to meet with NATO members about the war in Ukraine, he says the alliance is more united today than ever. The reason: Vladimir Putin. NATO has never faced a test like this — a hot war in Europe that carries the threat of biological, chemical or even nuclear weapons. Though NATO is not defending a member nation, it has grown unified defending everything the alliance was created to preserve. NATO grew out of World War II as a defensive alliance to shield Western Europe from the Soviet Union. America and Europe also wanted to contain Germany, the aggressor nation in both World Wars. ""The unofficial purpose, as it was quietly rumored at the time, was to keep the Soviets out, to keep the Americans in and to keep the Germans down,"" historian Mary Sarotte said. In the late 1940s, the Soviets controlled East Germany, marking the beginning of the Cold War. The key to NATO is Article 5, the provision that states an attack on one member nation is an attack on the alliance and that all member nations must respond in common defense. That helped keep the peace for decades. In 1979, when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, NATO deployed nuclear missiles as a deterrent. After the 9/11 attacks, NATO came to America's defense, invoking Article 5 for the first time, and NATO forces joined the U.S. in Afghanistan for the next 20 years. In 2004, NATO added seven former Soviet client states as members, and has gradually expanded to its current size of 30 member nations. This expansion alarmed and infuriated Putin, who saw NATO as a military and political rival. ""If we hadn't gone out and brought those former Soviet satellite countries in with us, I think they would be the ones who would be invaded right now,"" Kay Bailey Hutchison, former U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Trump administration, said. While it expanded, the alliance drifted and member nations declined to meet defense spending requirements. It was an issue pressed by the Obama administration and amplified by the Trump administration. ""They didn't like the tone President Trump used, of course. But they never ever said one time that they didn't know they had to do more,"" Hutchison said. Trump says he helped revive the alliance, though critics said his threat to pull out of NATO did the opposite. NATO has talked off and on of adding Ukraine, but never did — which is why NATO did not intervene when Putin took Crimea in 2014 and isn't fighting Russia now. The war now is about Russia taking control of all of Ukraine if it can. Ukraine is fighting for its future, and if it prevails, it may not need or want common defense protection, or it may want it more than ever.",29,4.260396632080338,3.888803108242335,0.3715935238380035,13

2022-03-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-cyberattacks-us-energy-fbi-warning/,"Russia exploring options for potential cyberattacks on U.S. energy sector, FBI warns","The FBI has warned the U.S. energy sector about ""network scanning activity"" stemming from multiple Russia-based IP addresses. The activity is believed to be associated with cyber actors ""who previously conducted destructive cyber activity against foreign critical infrastructure."" The FBI bulletin, issued March 18 and obtained by CBS News, was released just days before President Biden announced Monday that ""evolving intelligence"" suggests Russia is exploring options for potential cyberattacks targeting the U.S. homeland. Federal law enforcement revealed that activity of Russian IP addresses ""likely indicates early stages of reconnaissance, scanning networks for vulnerabilities for use in potential future intrusions."" The FBI has identified 140 overlapping IP addresses linked to ""abnormal scanning"" activity of at least five U.S. energy companies, as well as at least 18 other U.S. companies spanning the defense industrial base, financial services, and information technology. However, the focus appears to be on entities within the energy sector, according to the FBI assessment. ""US Energy Sector entities are advised to examine current network traffic for these IP addresses and conduct follow-on investigations if observed,"" the alert reads. According to the FBI, IP addresses identified by law enforcement began scanning U.S. critical infrastructure as early as March 2021. ""This scanning activity has increased since the start of the Russia/Ukraine conflict, leading to a greater possibility of future intrusions,"" the bulletin notes. ""While the FBI recognizes that scanning activity is common on a network, these reported IPs have been previously identified as conducting activity in conjunction with active exploitation of a foreign victim, which resulted in destruction of the victim's systems."" The bureau says that while these IPs cannot be directly correlated to successful exploitation, the FBI is providing indicators of compromise ""out of an abundance of caution."" FBI Director Christopher Wray said Tuesday that concern about malicious cyber activity is the product of ""specific investigative work and surveillance work that we've been doing all together."" He added, ""Most cyberattacks don't just happen in an instant. There's activity that leads up to it. There's scanning and researching, researching of victims. Scanning for vulnerabilities in systems. There's developing access to those systems. There's a whole range of preparatory work, which is what we've been seeing."" According to the FBI, the number of ransomware incidents reported to the U.S. government increased by 82% from 2019 to 2021. Since the bureau opened its investigation into Russia-based REvil hackers in August 2018, cybercriminals have attacked more than 40,000 U.S.-based victims and received over $150 million in ransoms through virtual currency systems. But some U.S. cybersecurity firms have alleged discrepancies in the FBI memo, noting that many of the IP addresses listed do not exhibit targeted behavior, while others are not geo-located in Russia. ""Some have scanned internet hosts which have no connection to critical infrastructure,"" Sergio Caltagirone, a former NSA cyber-defense expert and director of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Dragos, told CBS News. ""Therefore, the targeted premise which supposedly underpins this list is questionable."" Caltagirone added that cybersecurity firms have ""precious few network defense resources"" to draw upon to protect industrial infrastructure. ""Tasking them with tracking 140 scanning IP addresses with no additional context will take them away from doing more valuable network defense activities,"" he said. Anne Neuberger, Mr. Biden's deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters Monday that U.S. officials have observed ""preparatory work"" linked to nation-state actors. Such activity could indicate increased levels of scanning websites and hunting for vulnerabilities among U.S. companies. Since February 15, the Ukrainian government said it has suffered over 3,000 DDoS or ""distributed denial of service attacks,"" that have barraged government websites with traffic, rendering them unusable. But cyber attacks launched by Russia since the start of the Ukrainian invasion have created relatively minimal damage compared with the shelling of cities and civilian casualties brought about by kinetic warfare. Last week, engineers linked Ukraine to an electricity grid connected to much of continental Europe, allowing the country to remove its power system from its Russian adversary, officials announced. A pair of Russian-linked cyber attacks in 2015 and 2016 knocked power out in parts of Ukraine. U.S. lawmakers and cybersecurity experts have long warned of the Kremlin using its Ukrainian neighbor as a ""testing ground"" for powerful cyber weapons. The urgent memo to private sector owners and operators comes just days before the president is set to travel to Brussels Thursday for a NATO summit before heading to Poland. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential,"" Mr. Biden said Monday, addressing the Business Roundtable, an association of some of the nation's largest corporations. ""And it's coming."" The FBI does not comment on specific intelligence products as standard practice, a spokesperson noted. ""The FBI routinely shares information with law enforcement and industry partners in order to protect the communities they serve and work with. The FBI always encourages members of the public and private industry to be vigilant and report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement,"" the spokesperson added. The Department of Energy told CBS News in a statement that it ""remains fully engaged with our industry and government partners."" ""We continue to hold regular threat briefings, share intelligence and actionable information with our energy sector partners, and encourage them to strengthen their cybersecurity posture and remain vigilant,"" the Department of Energy Spokesperson said.

But the premise for Putin's war, and his repeated insistence that Russia's military is carefully avoiding civilians with its artillery barrage, are belied by the reality on the ground in cities like Mariupol. The southern port has been under siege by Russian forces for weeks, with officials and aid groups saying food, water, and electricity have all been cut to thousands of people still trapped there. Ukrainian authorities say at least 2,300 civilians have been killed in Mariupol alone, with some buried in mass graves amid the relentless shelling. Still, Moscow sticks to its line: ""Kyiv instructed the Nazi battalions in Mariupol to leave the city under the guise of civilians, including through humanitarian corridors,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Monday. ""More than 130,000 people are still held by the nationalist battalions [in Mariupol]. People are being held hostage, they are simply not allowed out of the areas controlled by the Nazi battalions, threatened with executions and physical liquidation,"" Denis Pushilin, head of the Russian-backed separatist regime in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, said a few hours later on Russian state TV. References to ""Nazi battalions"" appear in virtually all Russian news reports about the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has doubled down on the narrative that Russia is ""liberating"" Ukraine from Nazis, and that narrative has maintained a consistent focus on one extremist militia in particular - the Azov Battalion. Russian state TV anchors have worked around the clock to portray Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — who is Jewish — as a leader of a neo-Nazi-leaning government infiltrated by the Azov group. To Russian viewers with little or no access to alternative sources of information, it may indeed appear that Russia's soldiers are fighting hordes of Nazis who are using Ukrainians as ""human shields"" and committing atrocities against Ukraine's many Russian speakers. So how widespread are far-right sentiments in Ukraine, and how much influence does the Azov Battalion really have? ""There are no Nazi battalions in Ukraine,"" said Ruslan Leviev, an analyst with the Conflict Intelligence Team, which tracks the Russian military in Ukraine. ""There is [the Azov] regiment... There are [estimated] several thousand people who are in this regiment. It is indeed a group where many members adhere to nationalist and far-right views,"" Leviev said. ""But a lot of people also join it because it is one of the most prepared and fit-for-war units."" The Azov Battalion rose to prominence in 2014, at the start of the separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. The country's armed forces, which at the time were woefully unprepared for battle, were taken by surprise when Russian-backed separatists started seizing swaths of territory in the Donbas area, along Russia's border. The Azov Battalion stepped in. It was better-equipped and prepared to do much of the frontline fighting against the separatists. The unit has its roots in aggressive fan clubs that support regional soccer teams, known as ""ultras,"" but as the fighting ramped up, they attracted various far-right activists, who often made no secret of their neo-Nazi sympathies. The militia was founded by Andriy Biletsky, an ultra-nationalist political figure who previously led groups including the openly neo-Nazi Social-National Assembly (SNA), which preached an ideology of racial purity for Ukraine. In 2014, the battalion was backed by Ukraine's controversial then-Minister of Interior Affairs Arsen Avakov and was financed by several Ukrainian oligarchs. The new benefactors included some wealthy Ukrainians of Jewish descent, who appeared to be prioritizing the group's efficacy in the battle for Ukrainian sovereignty in Donbas over its ideology. In late 2014, Azov was expanded from a battalion into a regiment, and was officially embedded into the Ukrainian National Guard — an official law enforcement agency, but not part of Ukraine's national armed forces. On the wave of Azov's battlefield successes in Donbas, Biletsky won a seat in the Ukrainian parliament as an independent candidate in September 2014. That gave Moscow more ammunition to tar Ukraine's central government as sympathetic to Nazis. Biletsky was not re-elected when his term ended five years later. Over the course of the grinding eight-year war in Donbas, the United Nations human rights commissioner's office documented a litany of human rights violations by both sides in the fight, including allegations of the ""extensive use of civilian buildings and locations… and looting of civilian property, leading to displacement"" by Azov Battalion forces. Off the battlefield, Azov became known for its presence on social media, where it regularly posted slickly produced videos of marches and other events. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has pivoted to posting high-quality videos, often shot by drones and professional cameras, capturing both the devastation of Russia's aerial bombardment, and successful counterattacks on the invading Russian forces. The Kremlin has seized on the Azov origins of the content to push its narrative that Ukrainian forces are all neo-Nazi sympathizers. ""Azov has achieved levels of mainstream media exposure far in excess of the group's minimal electoral support,"" Oleksiy Kuzmenko, a Washington D.C.-based investigative reporter who has tracked the battalion for years, wrote in a commentary for the Atlantic Council. ""The far-right in general, and their apparent impunity, have significantly damaged Ukraine's international reputation and left the country vulnerable to hostile narratives exaggerating the role of extremist groups in Ukraine,"" he concluded. The Azov group's media presence, in particular, made it something of a magnet for far-right minded people abroad, Kuzmenko said, with foreign men seeking to join the militia to gain combat experience. In a report for the investigative group Bellingcat, Kuzmenko and Ukrainian organizations found links between the Azov Battalion and white supremacist groups in the U.S. Leviev said the militia's influence had declined in recent years, however, after its main backer Avakov was essentially forced to retire. ""Overall, the influence of various officials, including Avakov, outside of Azov, is very limited,"" Leviev said. ""There were no Nazi battalions roaming around the streets and trying to embed into [the government] system, as the Kremlin is trying to portray."" ""So if not for this war, this stage of the war, the far-right movement would have eventually vanished,"" he said.",14,5.19353620163729,5.634436135613788,-0.44089993397649785,14
2022-03-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-cyber-attack-threat-biden-warning/,"President Biden warns of ""evolving"" Russian cyber threat to U.S.: ""It's coming""","President Biden warned Monday that ""evolving intelligence"" suggests Russia is exploring options for potential cyberattacks targeting U.S. critical infrastructure. ""The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential,"" Mr. Biden said, addressing the Business Roundtable, an association of some of the nation's largest corporations. ""And it's coming."" While there's no evidence of any specific cyberattack threat, Anne Neuberger, Mr. Biden's deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters Monday afternoon that U.S. officials have observed ""preparatory work"" linked to nation-state actors. Such activity could indicate increased levels of scanning websites and hunting for vulnerabilities among U.S. companies. Further details on U.S. intelligence remain unclear, but as Moscow could look for ways to retaliate against economic sanctions imposed following their invasion of Ukraine, potential targets include the U.S. financial sector, electric grid, water treatment plants and hospitals. ""Russia is probably looking to aggressively respond in a manner that won't lead to war with the U.S., and cyber attacks are a means for them to exact costs without crossing a major red line,"" John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis for cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told CBS News. ""Cyber attacks are often reversible and nonlethal, but their economic and psychological costs could be significant."" Neuberger called it ""deeply troubling"" that companies worldwide continue to see breaches as a result of known vulnerabilities they've failed to patch. The White House push comes just days before the president is set to embark on a trip to Brussels for a NATO summit on Thursday before heading to Poland and amid the U.S. government's efforts to declassify intelligence about Russia's plans in Ukraine. The U.S. has previously disclosed its findings to deter the Kremlin and other adversaries from following through on plans and undermine attempts at plausible deniability. White House officials delivered classified briefings to more than 100 companies last week, urging at-risk private sector partners to bolster cybersecurity defenses against potential intrusions by Russia-linked actors. ""Most of America's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and critical infrastructure owners and operators must accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors,"" Monday's White House statement said. ""The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has been actively working with organizations across critical infrastructure to rapidly share information and mitigation guidance to help protect their systems and networks."" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday encouraged organizations ""of every size and across every sector"" to report cyber incidents to CISA or their local FBI field office. ""DHS will continue to share timely and actionable information and intelligence to ensure our partners and the public have the tools they need to keep our communities safe and secure, and increase nationwide cybersecurity preparedness,"" Mayorkas added. For months, the Biden administration has prodded companies to prevent cyber intrusions through a slew of tactics: multi-factor authentication, patching known vulnerabilities, running through drills and emergency plans, as well as encrypting and backing up data. CISA Director Jen Easterly told CBS News Friday that U.S. officials have not let their guard down. ""What we are focused on right now very urgently, is working very closely with our private sector partners with our state and local partners with our federal partners to ensure that there is a robust understanding of the cyber threat environment and the potential consequences of Russian malicious cyber activity."" ""It is increasingly difficult to prevent bad things from happening,"" Easterly added. ""And so we have to work together and assume that bad things will happen, assume there will be cyber attacks, assume there will be disruptive activity."" Easterly, the director of the nation's cyber defense agency, said she is increasingly worried about ""vigilance fatigue"" among U.S. companies sprinting to secure their networks. ""It is hard to maintain a very high tempo of extreme preparedness, but we are not even a month into this unjust, illegal, unprovoked invasion of a democracy and we need to continue to keep our shields up. We are putting out more and more information so that folks understand the nature of the threat environment."" Since November, the Department of Homeland Security has overseen more than 80 briefings, table exercises and informational sessions with the private sector designed to bolster U.S. cyber defenses in the event of Russian malicious cyber activity. Lawmakers have voiced their concerns directly to the DHS secretary. Last week, 22 U.S. senators, led by Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, signed a bipartisan letter demanding more information about the U.S. response to Russian cyber threats and disinformation. CISA vowed in a response letter on Monday to brief lawmakers in the coming days. CISA and the FBI released several joint cyber bulletins last week, including an advisory detailing the threat to satellite communication networks just days after reports of a hack by unidentified actors directed at telecommunications firm Viasat. Reuters first reported on the disruption of broadband satellite internet access at the start of the Russian invasion. Since February 15, the Ukrainian government said it has suffered over 3,000 DDoS or ""distributed denial of service attacks,"" that have barraged government websites with traffic until they grind to a halt. But a cyberattack on a NATO member state could prompt Article 5, its collective defense clause, according to previous statements by Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General. The hypothetical trigger has intensified concerns that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could spill over to the United States and other territories. ""An attack on critical infrastructure that can be tied to the Russian government would absolutely be grounds for escalation, depending on the impact of that incident,"" Alex Iftimie, a former national security official at the Department of Justice, told CBS News. ""It could have significant consequences down the road in terms of potential direct involvement of the United States in this conflict."" ""I think the president was very clear,"" Neuberger told reporters before departing from the briefing room. ""We're not looking for a conflict with Russia. But if Russia initiates a cyber attack against the United States, we will respond.""

2022-03-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-mariupol-biden-putin-chemical-biological-weapons/,"Biden says ""clear sign"" Putin considering use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine","Lviv — Russia continued flattening Ukraine's besieged port city of Mariupol on Tuesday amid escalating warnings from Washington that a cornered President Vladimir Putin, frustrated by his military's slow progress 26 days into the invasion of Ukraine, could resort to unleashing chemical or biological weapons on his neighbors. President Joe Biden said Monday that Putin's ""back is against the wall,"" with his assault on Ukraine not going to plan. Mr. Biden called the Russian leader's allegations that the U.S. has labs in Ukraine to develop chemical and biological weapons a ""clear sign he's considering using both"" himself. As U.S.-Russian relations plummet to new lows, the U.S. leader also warned businesses that a Russian cyberattack could soon target companies or infrastructure on American soil. Moscow has shown no sign of backing down in the standoff. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov issued a demand on Russian television Monday evening for ""an end to the demonization of Russia."" ""We insist that the responsibility for the possible consequences of what is happening lies entirely with Washington,"" Ryabkov warned. But while the Putin regime insists it's only targeting ""neo-Nazis"" and criminals in Ukraine, and that it never takes aim at civilian infrastructure, those claims are belied by the utter devastation of entire cities like Mariupol, which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says is being methodically ""reduced to ashes"" for refusing to accept Russian rule. Until just a month ago, it was a thriving port city home to about half a million people. It has been under constant Russian siege for weeks. Thousands of civilians are still trapped there, cowering in basements from the constant artillery barrage. Putin's forces have cut off everything from food and medicine to heat and electricity to the city. But some civilians have made it out. CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab met one family that escaped the devastation to reach the western city of Lviv. They told CBS News all that's left of Mariupol is ""hell on Earth."" Video shows black smoke rising from the remains of apartment buildings across the city, revealing the hell-scape left behind by Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. The relentless shelling of Mariupol has triggered a mass exodus, and many, like the Vodizanska family, have escaped with little more than their lives. Bloodied and bruised, the once typical middle-class family fled their home in Mariupol and made it to the safety of a church in Lviv. Svetlana and Roman spent five days on the road with their children to escape Russia's relentless bombing of their city. ""Hell is when you don't know if you will be able to take the next breath, if you will [find] anything to feed your children with, because they are hungry,"" Svetlana told Tyab. ""Hell is when you know that if your child gets sick, he will die. ""That is hell,"" the mother told CBS News. ""That is hell here in the 21st century."" Nearly 90% of Mariupol's buildings, including civilian homes, have been damaged or destroyed. Workday traffic has given way to tank battles in the streets and armed soldiers patrolling what's left of neighborhoods. Svetlana injured her head in a car accident as she and her family rushed to escape the Russian strikes that have completely destroyed their home. Asked how she explains the war to her young children, Svetlana told CBS News that ""they will know the truth. The truth the way it is… they will be told the Russians wanted to kill us, but we persevered because we are strong."" ""We are Ukrainians,"" she said. ""It's in our blood."" Svetlana and her family remain defiant. They told CBS News they would like to get to the U.S., to try to rebuild their lives, but that Mariupol will always be home, and they'll return there one day to help rebuild their city, too.",17,6.259535503711141,2.591620070372134,3.6679154333390067,20

""I want to cry, because we had a connection between Ukraine and Russia,"" doctor Anatoli Pavlov said. ""Russian cruelty is so brutal."" The U.S. has evidence that Russia is deliberately and intentionally targeting civilians, including hospitals and places of shelter, a senior Defense Department official told CBS News. The U.S. said it has seen clear evidence the Russians are committing war crimes as civilians are killed in their homes and on the street. Yet Russia's ground forces have made surprisingly slow progress. Ukraine's military said it recaptured the strategically important town of Makariv just outside the capital Kyiv on Monday. They're now fighting to wrest back control of the cities of Izyum and Kherson, according to a senior U.S. Defense official. The Ukrainians are massively outgunned, but with anti-tank missiles supplied by the U.S. and its allies, they've destroyed hundreds of Russian armored vehicles and killed up to 9,000 Russian soldiers, a U.S. official said. Across Ukraine, ordinary people have mobilized to defend their towns and villages. A video filmed by a shopkeeper shows him helping to ambush Russian tanks. At a checkpoint, CBS News met Anatoli, a pig farmer who was armed with his own hunting rifle. He said the biggest thing he ever shot before was a goat. Now he and other volunteers from his village are taking shifts keeping watch over the main road into town, with a collection of Molotov cocktails and a homemade spike strip. President Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""back is against the wall"" and Ukraine's resistance and Russia's slow progress are raising concerns that he may use chemical or biological weapons to regain the upper hand in war. Russia has continued to crackdown on dissent at home, reportedly detaining around 15,000 people for protesting the invasion since the war started.",14,3.1042826513027313,3.8364945767511553,-0.7322119254484241,20

The photo shows Olga, head wrapped in a bandage, breast feeding her baby in a bed at Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital. She still has blood splattered on her face. The 27-year-old woman, who did not share her last name, shielded her baby, Victoria, from shrapnel after a missile strike in Kyiv on Friday, according to Reuters. ""I was wounded in the head, and blood started flowing. And it all flowed on the baby,"" Olga told the news agency. ""I couldn't understand, I thought it was her blood."" The missile strike shattered glass across the room. The baby's father, Dmytro, woke up to the sound. He took Victoria as Olga began screaming her baby had been cut. ""Olga, it's your blood, it's not hers,"" Dmytro told her. Olga was feeding her 6-week-old when the strike happened, and fortunately the baby was covered in a blanket, which helped keep her safe. ""And that's what kept the baby alive. I just got her covered in time. And then Dmytro jumped up and covered us, too,"" Olga said. The baby was unharmed aside from a scratch and bruises, and Olga is being treated for multiple cuts on her head and body, according to Reuters. ""There's nothing left for us to do but to stay positive, just to believe that it was the worst, the most horrible thing that could have happened in our lives,"" Dmytro said. Last week, a maternity hospital in Mariupol was the target of a Russian missile strike. A pregnant woman who was waiting to give birth was photographed after the attack, being rushed into an ambulance. That woman and her baby recently died, according to the Associated Press. On Sunday, Russia's military bombed an art school sheltering some 400 people in the embattled port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said. A theater in the city was also bombed with 1,300 people believed to be inside, local officials said. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said an unrelenting Russian siege would be remembered for centuries to come. On Monday, Russia demanded that Ukrainians put down their arms and raise white flags in exchange for safe passage out of town. Ukraine angrily rejected the offer. In Lviv, which was hit by Russian forces for the first time last week, 100 empty strollers were placed in rows in a central square on Friday, symbolizing the children killed in the country since Putin's war began. At least 115 children have been killed and 148 injured so far, the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office says. The U.N. has confirmed 902 civilian deaths in the war but concedes the actual toll is likely much higher, according to the AP. It says nearly 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine. Estimates of Russian deaths vary, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands.",17,3.1656969519669045,0.4273843051272369,2.7383126468396677,23
2022-03-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/ukraine-mariupol-russia-surrender-reject/,Ukraine rejects Russian demand to surrender Mariupol in exchange for safe passage,"As it continued its barrage of the besieged city of Mariupol, Russia demanded that Ukrainians put down their arms and raise white flags on Monday in exchange for safe passage out of town. Ukraine angrily rejected the offer, which came hours after officials said Russian forces had bombed an art school in the port city that was sheltering some 400 people. While the fight for control of the strategically important city remained intense, Western governments and analysts see the broader conflict shifting definitively to a war of attrition. Russian Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said his forces would allow two corridors out of Mariupol, heading either east toward Russia or west to other parts of Ukraine. Mariupol residents were given until 5 a.m. Monday to respond to the offer. Russia didn't say what action it would take if it was rejected. ""There can be no talk of any surrender, laying down of arms,"" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk told the news outlet Ukrainian Pravda, rejecting the ultimatum from Russia. ""We have already informed the Russian side about this."" Mariupol Mayor Piotr Andryushchenko also rejected the offer, saying in a Facebook post that he didn't need to wait until morning to respond and cursing at the Russians, according to the news agency Interfax Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense said authorities in Mariupol could face a military tribunal if they sided with what it described as ""bandits,"" Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Previous bids to allow residents to evacuate Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities have failed or have been only partially successful, with bombardments continuing as civilians sought to flee. Speaking in a video address early Monday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said about 400 civilians were taking shelter at the art school when it was struck by a Russian bomb. ""They are under the rubble, and we don't know how many of them have survived,"" he said. ""But we know that we will certainly shoot down the pilot who dropped that bomb, like about 100 other such mass murderers whom we already have downed."" Tearful evacuees from the devastated Azov Sea port city have described how ""battles took place over every street."" The fall of Mariupol would allow Russian forces in southern and eastern Ukraine to link up. But Western military analysts say that even if the surrounded city is taken, the troops battling a block at a time for control there may be too depleted to help secure Russian breakthroughs on other fronts. Roman and Svetlana Vodizanska, once a typical middle class family, were bloodied and bruised after traveling with their children for five days to Lviv to escape Mariupol, which Svetlana called hell on Earth. ""Hell is when you don't know if you will be able to take your next breath,"" she told CBS News Imtiaz Tyab. ""Hell is when everything is burning. Not just the buildings, but when the ground is burning."" Svetlana injured her head in a car accident while fleeing Russian strikes, which have completely destroyed their home. She called on the U.S. and President Biden to give Ukraine weapons. ""Please give us weapons. Give our country even just a small chance to survive,"" she said. ""Please help us."" Three weeks into the invasion, Western governments and analysts see the conflict shifting to a war of attrition, with bogged down Russian forces launching long-range missiles at cities and military bases as Ukrainian forces carry out hit-and-run attacks and seek to sever their supply lines. Moscow cannot hope to rule the country, Zelenskyy said Monday, given Ukrainians' enmity toward the Russian forces. The strike on the art school was the second time in less than a week that officials reported an attack on a public building where Mariupol residents had taken shelter. On Wednesday, a bomb hit a theater where more than 1,000 people were believed to be sheltering. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theater since Friday, when they said at least 130 people had been rescued and another 1,300 were trapped by rubble. City officials and aid groups say food, water and electricity have run low in Mariupol and fighting has kept out humanitarian convoys. Communications are severed. The city has been under bombardment for over three weeks and has seen some of the worst horrors of the war. City officials said at least 2,300 people have died, with some buried in mass graves. Unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance has dashed Russian President Vladimir Putin's hopes for a quick victory after he ordered the Feb. 24 invasion of his neighbor. In recent days, Russian forces have entered Mariupol. But taking the city could prove costly. ""The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative, and combat power,"" the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in a briefing. In a blunt assessment, the think tank concluded Russia failed in its initial campaign to take the capital of Kyiv and other major cities quickly. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Ukrainian resistance means Putin's ""forces on the ground are essentially stalled."" ""It's had the effect of him moving his forces into a woodchipper,"" Austin told CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. In Ukraine's major cities, hundreds of men, women and children have been killed in Russian attacks. Six more people were killed Sunday by shelling in the densely populated Podil district, not far from the center of capital Kyiv , according to AP journalists at the scene. The attack there devastated a shopping center, leaving a flattened ruin still smoldering Monday morning in the midst of high-rise towers. The force of the explosion shattered every window in the high-rise next door and twisted their metal frames. In the distance, the sound of artillery rang out as firefighters picked their way through the destruction. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Russian shelling hit several houses in Podil. Russian troops have been shelling Kyiv for a fourth week now and are trying to surround the capital, which had nearly 3 million people before the war. The U.N. has confirmed 902 civilian deaths in the war but concedes the actual toll is likely much higher. It says nearly 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine. Estimates of Russian deaths vary, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands. The Ukrainian prosecutor general's office says at least 115 children have been killed and 148 injured so far. Estimates of Russian deaths vary, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands. Some Russians also have fled their country amid a widespread crackdown on dissent.

2022-03-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/myanmar-rohingya-genocide-blinken/,Blinken declares Myanmar's repression of Muslim Rohingya a genocide,"Violent repression of the largely Muslim Rohingya population in Myanmar amounts to genocide, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday, a declaration intended to both generate international pressure and lay the groundwork for potential legal action. Authorities made the determination based on confirmed accounts of mass atrocities on civilians by Myanmar's military in a widespread and systematic campaign against the ethnic minority, Blinken announced in a speech at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., Monday. Blinken said evidence showed the ""attack against Rohingya was widespread and systematic, which is crucial for reaching a determination of crimes against humanity."" ""The day will come when those responsible for these appalling acts will have to answer for them,"" Blinken said. The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, is already under multiple layers of U.S. sanctions since a military coup ousted the democratically elected government in February 2021. Thousands of civilians throughout the country have been killed and imprisoned as part of the ongoing repression of anyone opposed to the ruling junta. More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, when the military launched an operation aimed at clearing them from the country following attacks by a rebel group. It is the eighth time since the Holocaust that the U.S. has concluded a genocide has occurred. ""It's a decision that I reached based on reviewing a factual assessment and legal analysis prepared by the State Department, which included detailed documentation by a range of independent, impartial sources, including human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as our own rigorous fact-finding,"" Blinken said. The secretary of state announced the U.S. would provide $1 million in new funding for the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, which continues to examine reports of atrocities. Following Blinken's announcement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the designation ""emphasizes, especially to victims and survivors, that the United States recognizes the gravity of these crimes."" ""Our view is that shining a light on the crimes of Burma's military will increase international pressure, make it harder for them to commit further abuses,"" she said. Blinken noted the importance of calling attention to inhumanity even as horrific attacks occur elsewhere in the world, including Ukraine, and made the crisis in Ukraine a central part of his speech. ""As we meet, the Russian government continues to wage its unprovoked, brutal war on Ukraine,"" Blinken said. ""Each day brings more harrowing attacks, more innocent men, women, and children killed. That includes the five people who were killed in a strike on March 1, on a TV tower and the surrounding area on the outskirts of Kyiv, the same site where, just over 80 years ago, 33,771 Jews were killed by the Nazis in just two days."" Blinken also pointed to atrocities elsewhere, including in Xinjiang where the Chinese government continues to commit genocide against Muslims and ethnic minorities. –CBS News' Camilla Shick contributed to this report",13,5.361094271370606,4.148845849232818,1.2122484221377876,11

During World War II, Romanchenko survived the concentration camps at Buchenwald, Dora-Mittelbau, Peenemünde and Bergen-Belson, the memorials for the Buchenwald and Dora-Mittelbau camps said Monday. Romanechenko's granddaughter told the memorials that he was killed when the high-rise building he lived in was hit by Russian shelling. ""We are deeply saddened,"" the foundation said, while the Ukrainian Defense Ministry lamented that ""Putin managed to 'accomplish' what even Hitler couldn't."" Romanchenko was born on January 20, 1926 in Bondari, Ukraine, the memorial said in a statement. He was deported to Dortmund, Germany, in 1942 and was forced to do labor underground, the statement said. In 1943, after attempting to escape, Romanechenko was sent to Buchenwald, where over 50,000 people are estimated to have been killed. Those incarcerated at Buchenwald were often forced to perform slave labor for the German military. Romanchenko was one of those sent to Peenemünde, where he was forced to work on the development of the V-2 rocket. Buchenwald, which according to the foundation had grown to become Germany's largest concentration camp by the end of the war, was liberated by Ally forces in 1945. According to the memorials, Romanchenko had served as the vice president of the Buchenwald-Dora International Committee, and was devoted to documenting and preserving the Nazi crimes that he and millions of others endured. In 2015, Romanchenko participated in an event commemorating the 70th anniversary of liberation of Buchenwald, the camp's memorial foundation said, during which he read ""The Oath Of Buchenwald."" The oath, which was first read on April 19, 1945 at a memorial service dedicated to those who had been killed at the camp, ends with the promise to destroy ""Nazism, down to its roots"" and ""build a new world of peace and freedom."" Kharkiv, where Romanechenko was killed, is Ukraine's second largest city. Like many other civilian population centers, it has been under fire from Russian artillery throughout the invasion. In a recent conference call with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said ""The strikes from the sky are everyday and every hour. Bombings (of) peaceful residential buildings. Victims everywhere."" The mayor of Merefa, a city just to the southeast of Kharkiv, said that at least 21 people were killed Thursday when Russian strikes destroyed a school and community center in the city.",17,6.058366952418177,2.1939556052042777,3.864411347213899,27
2022-03-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ukraine-russia-bombed-art-school-mariupol/,Ukraine says Russians bombed art school sheltering 400 in besieged city of Mariupol,"Lviv, Ukraine — Ukrainian authorities said Sunday that Russia's military bombed an art school sheltering some 400 people in the embattled port city of Mariupol, where Ukraine's president said an unrelenting Russian siege would be remembered for centuries to come. It was the second time in less than a week that city officials reported a public building where residents had taken shelter coming under attack. A bomb hit a Mariupol theater with more than 1,300 believed to be inside on Wednesday, local officials said. There was no immediate word on casualties from the reported strike on the art school, which could not immediately be independently verified. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theater since Friday, when they said at least 130 had been rescued. Mariupol, a strategic port on the Azov Sea, has been under bombardment for at least three weeks and has seen some of the worst horrors of the war in Ukraine. At least 2,300 people have died, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves, and food, water and electricity have run low. ""To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. ""The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it."" In recent days, Russian forces have battled their way into the city, cutting it off from the Azov Sea and devastating a massive steel plant. The fall of Mariupol would be an important but costly victory for the Russians, whose advance is largely stalled outside other major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since World War II. In major cities across Ukraine, hundreds of men, women and children have been killed in Russian bombardments, while millions of civilians have raced to underground shelters or fled the country. In the capital, Kyiv, at least 20 babies carried by Ukrainian surrogate mothers are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up. The infants — some just days old — are being cared for by nurses who cannot leave the shelter because of constant shelling by Russian troops who are trying to encircle the city. In the hard-hit northeastern city of Sumy, authorities evacuated 71 orphaned babies through a humanitarian corridor, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said Sunday. He said the orphans, most of whom need constant medical attention, would be taken to an unspecified foreign country. Russian shelling killed at least five civilians, including a 9-year-old boy, in Kharkiv, an eastern city that is Ukraine's second-largest. The British Defense Ministry said Russia's failure to gain control of the skies over Ukraine ""has significantly blunted their operational progress,"" forcing them to rely on stand-off weapons launched from the relative safety of Russian airspace. The Russian Defense Ministry said a Kinzhal hypersonic missile hit a Ukrainian fuel depot in Kostiantynivka, a city near Mykolaiv. The Russian military said Saturday that it used a Kinzhal for the first time in combat to destroy an ammunition depot in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine. Russia has said the Kinzhal, carried by MiG-31 fighter jets, has a range of up to about 1,250 miles and flies at 10 times the speed of sound. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Saturday that the U.S. couldn't confirm the use of a hypersonic missile in Ukraine. Konashenkov said Kalibr cruise missiles launched by Russian warships from the Caspian Sea were also involved in the strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka and were used to destroy an armor repair plant in northern Ukraine. Unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance has dashed Russian President Vladimir Putin's hopes for a fast victory after he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine on February 24. While the Kremlin has said Russia is conducting a ""special military operation"" aimed at legitimate targets, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday that ""brutal, savage techniques"" targeting civilians had allowed Moscow's troops to advance. U.N. bodies have confirmed more than 847 civilian deaths since the war began, though they concede the actual toll is likely much higher. The U.N. says nearly 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine as refugees. Estimates of Russian deaths vary widely, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals — out of an estimated 20 deployed in Ukraine — suggest an impaired command of the fighting, said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia's security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. Russia would need 800,000 troops — almost equal to its entire active-duty military — to control Ukraine in the face of prolonged armed opposition, according to Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank. ""Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal — they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation — there will be just constant guerrilla war,"" Clarke said. Ukraine and Russia have held several rounds of negotiations aimed at ending the conflict, but the neighboring countries remain divided over several issues. Zelenskyy has said he is willing to drop Ukraine's bid to join NATO but wants certain security guarantees from Russia. Moscow is pressing for Ukraine's complete demilitarization. Evacuations from Mariupol and other besieged cities proceeded along eight of 10 humanitarian corridors that Ukraine and Russia agreed to on Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, and officials said a total of 6,623 people left Kyiv and other cities. Vereshchuk said planned humanitarian aid for the southern city of Kherson, which Russia seized early in the war, could not be delivered because the trucks were stopped along the way by Russian troops. Mariupol authorities said Sunday that nearly 40,000 people had left the city in the last week, the vast majority in their own vehicles, despite ongoing air and artillery strikes. Some Russians also have fled their country amid a widespread crackdown on dissent. Since the invasion of Ukraine started, police have arrested thousands of antiwar protesters, while government agencies have silenced independent media and cut off access to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. In Ukraine, Zelenskyy on Sunday ordered the activities of 11 political parties with links to Russia to be suspended during the period of martial law. The largest of those parties has 44 out of 450 seats in the country's parliament. ""Activities by politicians aimed at discord and collaboration will not succeed,"" he said in the address.",17,3.125765720239271,1.531468970188844,1.5942967500504268,17

As Russian forces target the outskirts of the western city of Lviv, Zelenskyy is accusing Russia of creating a humanitarian catastrophe by blocking critical supplies to his country's largest cities. The United Nations estimates 6.5 million people have been displaced by the war, coupled with more than 3 million who have fled Ukraine. Overnight, the Ukrainian president appealed directly to Moscow, Chris Livesay reports for ""CBS Saturday Morning."" ""Time to talk,"" Zelenskyy said. ""It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover."" Across Ukraine, the Pentagon estimates more than 7,000 Russian troops have been killed so far. But Putin is not projecting an image of compromise, vowing at a packed rally that Russia will prevail. Many attendees told reporters they were under pressure to come out in support of him. Putin reiterated his claim that Ukrainian civilians had welcomed Russia's troops. But the heartache tells the truth. In Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, a son cried over the body of his mother, who was killed by falling debris. And Mariupol — the scene of Russia's most vicious onslaught — is encircled in siege warfare, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped without food, water, heat and electricity. Russia says it's now ""tightening the noose"" on the strategic Black Sea city, even deploying Islamist troops from its Chechnya region. A video purportedly released by Chechnya's pro-Putin leader shows them engaging with Ukrainian fighters positioned in the upper floors of a building. Meanwhile, in the eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces have been holding firm in the face of ferocious Russian shelling. For more than three weeks, Russia has tried, and failed, to break through the city. The battle for Ukraine is extending offshore. Ukraine's defense minister says Russian troops are blocking access to the Azov sea, which connects to the Black Sea. It renews concerns that a widening war could be imminent.",17,3.5725470143242957,1.019932632370385,2.5526143819539104,20

The fall of Mariupol, the scene of some of the war's worst suffering, would mark a major battlefield advance for the Russians, who are largely bogged down outside major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since World War II. ""Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it is wiped off the face of the earth,"" Mariupol police officer Michail Vershnin said from a rubble-strewn street in a video addressed to Western leaders that was authenticated by The Associated Press. Russian forces have already cut the city off from the Sea of Azov, and its fall would link Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, to territories controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in the east. It would mark a rare advance in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance that has dashed Russia's hopes for a quick victory and galvanized the West. Ukrainian and Russian forces battled over the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said Saturday. ""One of the largest metallurgical plants in Europe is actually being destroyed,"" Denysenko said in televised remarks. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said the nearest forces that could assist Mariupol's defenders were already struggling against ""the overwhelming force of the enemy"" or at least 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. ""There is currently no military solution to Mariupol,"" he said late Friday. ""That is not only my opinion, that is the opinion of the military."" Ukrainian President Volodomir Zelenskyy has remained defiant, appearing in a video early Saturday shot on the streets of the capital, Kyiv, to denounce a huge Friday rally in Moscow that Russian President Vladimir Putin attended.

As the capital Kyiv reeled from more shelling, black smoke rose over the previously untouched city of Lviv for the first time on Friday morning. A Russian strike hit what was said to be a facility for the repair of military aircraft. Lviv is the largest city in western Ukraine. It sits only about 40 miles from the NATO territory across the border in Poland. Lviv's mayor said at least one person was wounded in the strike that hit just a few miles from the center of his city. In the heart of Lviv, meanwhile, there was a silent protest against the toll Russia's brutality has taken on Ukraine's most vulnerable. More than 100 empty strollers were placed in rows in a central square on Friday, symbolizing the children killed in the country since Putin's war began. ""The lives of our Ukrainian children. Today, 109 empty baby strollers were put up on Rynok Square in Lviv to show the whole world what a terrible price we pay,"" said Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, in a post on the Telegram social media app. He shared a photo of the protest, adding: ""Ukraine is fighting for security around the world, losing their children!"" The United Nations has confirmed at least 816 civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia launched its war, with most of the deaths blamed on shelling and airstrikes. That figure includes 59 children, and the U.N.'s human rights agency acknowledges the ""actual toll is much higher."" CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the indiscriminate shelling of Kyiv continued spreading terror in the capital on Friday. Missiles and artillery slam into the once-thriving metropolis on a daily basis — sometimes several times a day — as Russian forces intensify their attacks across the country. Another residential building on the outskirts of Kyiv was in ruins on Friday, and as D'Agata reported, there's no telling when or where the next rocket, or rockets, will strike. To the east, close to the Russian border, Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv has been engulfed in flames. It has come under constant bombardment for weeks, since Vladimir Putin ordered his assault on Ukraine 23 days ago, on February 24. In the besieged city of Chernihiv, northwest of Kharkiv but still perilously close to Russian ground, an American teacher was among the civilians killed by Putin's assault on Thursday. James Hill, 68, had stayed in the city to look after his partner, Irina, who was being treated at a local hospital for MS. In Pittsburgh, Katya Hill recalled the last time she spoke with her brother. ""I could hear bombs in the background,"" she told CBS News. ""He was going out on a daily basis, searching for food. The hospital lost electricity. The hospital lost gas. There was no heat… my brother was a peacemaker and he was a giver, and he just felt everybody in the world should love each other."" ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell traveled to the Ukraine-Poland border as Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered the fastest refugee displacement crisis in Europe since World War II. O'Donnell shares firsthand accounts from Ukrainian refugees and looks at how NATO is preparing while Russia pushes the war in Ukraine close to Poland's border in the 30-minute documentary ""Norah O'Donnell Reports: Crisis in Ukraine,"" premiering Friday, March 18, at 7:30 p.m. ET on the CBS News app. In Kyiv, meanwhile, a man wept over the body of his dead mother. She was killed when fragments of a Russian missile, shot down by Ukrainian forces, rained down on their neighborhood. Even when a missile misses its target, it can wreak havoc. D'Agata and his team watched as residents of Kyiv's shell-shocked suburbs picked up the pieces of their lives and patiently lined up for plastic sheeting — some protection against the bitter cold, if not the searing shrapnel. The incredible destruction inflicted on residential buildings by the Russian missile that was stopped in its path made it clear why people in Ukraine's capital are so terrified of what's to come. But even with her neighborhood directly in the firing line, as she plucked jagged shards of glass from the window that no longer keeps out the bitter cold, Kyiv resident Gayla told CBS News that she was not going anywhere. ""It's ok, we won't freeze,"" she said. ""Love warms us up."" Asked if she had a message for those watching her country's destruction from afar, Galya said: ""Peace in Ukraine. No more war, and that Putin comes to his senses and gets a brain."" D'Agata said there was one small piece of good news on Friday: Ukrainian officials said 130 people had been rescued from the debris of a theater in the battered southern port city of Mariupol that was bombed this week. It remained unclear how many people might still be trapped, or how many had died in the theater, where more than 1,000 were said to have been taking shelter.",17,3.4368529971326276,6.1861103480424795,-2.749257350909852,23
2022-03-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cosmonauts-launch-to-international-space-station-nasa-chief-touts-us-russia-cooperation/,Three cosmonauts launched to space station as NASA chief touts cooperation with Russia,"Three cosmonauts blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan Friday, caught up with the International Space Station after a two-orbit rendezvous and moved in for docking at a newly arrived Russian module. The cosmonauts are replacing three crew members — two Russians and an American — who are heading home at the end of the month to close out a record-setting flight. The launch comes amid high tension and strained relations in the wake of Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, its cancellation of cooperative commercial ventures in response to sanctions and a steady stream of fiercely critical comments from the director of the Russian space agency, raising concern about the station's future. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Friday morning he's hopeful the U.S. and Russia will continue their decades-long cooperation in space that extends back to the Cold War. But he said the agency is working on contingency plans just in case. ""We have our problems with President Putin on Earth,"" Nelson said in an interview with CBS News. ""Thank goodness we've seen Europe come together and a strengthening of NATO as we've never seen before. ""The interesting thing is, even back in 1975 during the Soviet Union, the Cold War, we were able to have cooperation in civilian space with the Russians, in (the) Apollo-Soyuz (project). And that has continued. This very day, three cosmonauts (are launching) from Kazakhstan to the International Space Station. ""They will join four Americans, two Russians and a German astronaut,"" Nelson continued. ""That's saying this cooperation, this professional relationship between our astronauts and cosmonauts, it's consistent, and it's going to stay."" Judging by the smiles, hugs and handshakes the station crew gave the arriving cosmonauts, they agreed with Nelson's sentiments. Soyuz MS-21/67S commander Oleg Artemyev, a space veteran, and two rookies, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov, took off from Baikonur at 11:55 a.m. EDT (8:55 p.m. local time) atop a Soyuz 2.1a rocket. Eight minutes and 45 seconds later, the Soyuz was in space and on course for a two-orbit rendezvous with the space station. Taking over manual control on final approach, Artemyev guided the ship to a smooth docking at the new multi-port Prichal module at 3:12 p.m. After extensive leak checks, hatches were opened at 5:48 p.m. Standing by to welcome them aboard were Expedition 66 commander Anton Shkaplerov and his two Soyuz crewmates, Pyotr Dubrov and Mark Vande Hei, along with Crew Dragon NASA astronauts Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn, Kayla Barron and German astronaut Matthias Maurer. Despite severely strained relations, space station operations have continued without interruption, and NASA television provided live coverage of the Soyuz launching, as usual, along with commentary from mission control at the Johnson Space Center. Wearing bright yellow jumpsuits with blue trim, Artemyev and his crewmates floated into Prichal to an enthusiastic welcome, with no signs of the tension marking relations between Russia, NASA and the European Space Agency on Earth. All 10 astronauts and cosmonauts, who know each other well from pre-flight training, seemed genuinely happy to see each other. After a 12-day ""handover,"" Artemyev, Matveev and Korsakov will replace Shkaplerov, Dubrov and Vande Hei, who plan to return to Earth aboard a different Soyuz on March 30. The day before, Shkaplerov will turn over command of the station to Marshburn. Vande Hei and Dubrov were launched from Baikonur aboard a Soyuz last April 9 and are wrapping up a 355-day mission, the longest single flight by an American astronaut. Vande Hei surpassed the previous 340-day record, set by astronaut Scott Kelly, on March 15. Oleg Novitskiy, who joined Dubrov and Vande Hei for launch, returned to Earth aboard the same Soyuz last October, leaving his two crewmates aboard the station as planned and bringing a Russian actress and her director home in their places. Vande Hei and Dubrov plan to return to Earth aboard the Soyuz MS-19/65S spacecraft on March 30, along with Shkaplerov, who ferried actress Yulia Peresild and Klim Shipenko up to the lab last fall. In a January interview with CBS News, Vande Hei said he and Shkaplerov had talked about the then-increasing tensions, but ""we didn't really get into any feelings about how we felt about it."" ""I will cherish the friendships I have with Anton, Pyotr and my previous (Russian crewmates),"" Vande Hei said. ""They are wonderful human beings, so I really hope things do go well. ""I definitely think that the space station, and our cooperation with the Russians on the space station in particular, are a great sign of how successful we can be when we get to know each other and things that are cooperative, rather than find points of conflict."" But in the wake of the invasion and subsequent U.S. and European sanctions, the Russians canceled sales and services of widely-used rocket engines to U.S. and European companies and halted commercial Soyuz operations at the European Space Agency's Kourou, French Guiana, launch site. The Russian space agency Roscosmos also called off a planned launch of 36 internet satellites atop a Soyuz rocket that had already been paid for by OneWeb, an international consortium partly funded by the United Kingdom. But space station operations have not yet been affected in any noticeable way. NASA managers have kept a deliberately low profile, avoiding any comments that might exacerbate an already tense relationship. The station's design requires joint operation, with Russia providing the propellant and thrusters needed to keep the outpost in orbit, while NASA provides electrical power, satellite communications and the massive gyroscopes that maintain the station's orientation. If either side pulled out of the project, it would be extraordinarily difficult to keep the station operating. NASA wants to keep the lab going through 2030, but it's not yet clear if Russia will go along. Nelson is optimistic Putin will not pull out of the space station project, saying it's to Russia's advantage to continue. ""He's not going to pull the plug,"" Nelson told CBS News. ""But if you're saying (what) if they abandon the space station? We'd manage, we'd figure it out. ... We know we can continue it for the short term. We'd have to do other things, and those contingency plans are already there. But we don't anticipate that."" The cooperative relationship has ""survived all these years since 1975,"" Nelson said. ""it's not going to stop now.""",3,5.657429769840869,4.571404216556672,1.0860255532841965,3

After the war broke out, Minnesota native James Hill remained in the besieged northeastern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, very near Russia's border, to look after his partner Irina, who was being treated at a local hospital for multiple sclerosis. An adviser to Ukraine's interior minister identified Hill as one of the victims of a Russian attack on Thursday morning that targeted people lining up for food in Chernihiv. There were conflicting reports as to whether the civilians were hit by gun or artillery fire. The city is among the major population centers in eastern and southern Ukraine that have been decimated by Russian shelling for days as Vladimir Putin's ground forces remain bogged down by logistical problems and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Hill's sister Katya, in Pennsylvania, told CBS Pittsburgh that her brother had been living in the capital city of Kyiv, but traveled to Chernihiv for his partner's MS treatment. ""When I was warning him about the dangers, he did not feel that the world would let this happen, because my parents raised us to see the good in peoples' hearts, and that's how he lived,"" Katya told CBS Pittsburgh. Speaking overnight to CBS News, she said the last time she spoke with her brother, she could hear explosions in the background. ""He was going out on a daily basis searching for food. The hospital lost electricity. The hospital lost gas. There was no heat,"" she said. ""My brother was a peacemaker, and he was a giver, and he just felt everybody in the world should love each other."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed earlier Thursday that another American had died in Ukraine, though he provide no further detail. A State Department spokesperson confirmed the death had occurred on March 17 and offered ""our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss."" Hill, who leaves behind two children, was the second U.S. citizen to die in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. Filmmaker Brent Renaud, 50, was killed when Russian troops opened fire on him and colleagues in the town of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, as they were traveling to film refugees on March 13. One of his associates was injured in the attack. Veteran Fox News video journalist Pierre Zakrzewski and his local producer Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova were killed just two days later, on March 15, when their vehicle ""was struck by incoming fire"" near Kyiv. Zakrzewski was a European national based in London for Fox, while Kuvshynova was one of the many native Ukrainians who have joined foreign news crews to help report on the war in their country. Katya Hill told CBS Pittsburgh that her brother had been sharing updates with her every day since Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine on February 24. She hadn't spoken to him for a few days, however. She said the family learned of Hill's death from the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. ""After he said that he had no way to charge his phone, then I knew it was a matter of, are we going to hear he's in Poland safe or are we going to get the news that we didn't want to hear?"" Katya Hill said. ""A good person gone too soon,"" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a tweet, offering her ""deepest sympathies"" to Hill's family. ""Putin's senseless war is resulting in so much needless tragedy,"" the lawmaker added. The United Nations has confirmed at least 816 civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia launched its war, with most of the deaths blamed on shelling and airstrikes.

Earlier Thursday, Russian online news site ""Pravda"" reported three Tennessee National Guard members were killed in Marinka, Ukraine, and labeled them ""mercenaries."" However, the National Guard refuted the allegations in a statement the same day. ""They are accounted for, safe and not, as the article headline erroneously states, US mercenaries killed in Donetsk People's Republic,"" the office of the Tennessee Adjutant General said. The soldiers identified in the Russian report are either current or former members of the Tennessee National Guard, the statement added. They were allegedly targeted after members of the Tennessee National Guard's 278th Armored Calvary Regiment took part in a 2018 multinational training mission in Ukraine, and the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service published articles on the mission. More than 200 soldiers assisted the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the development of a combat training center during the 2018 mission. All Tennessee National Guard members returned safely in 2019, the statement said. While a war wages on in Ukraine, concerns about Russian's disinformation and misinformation efforts continue to grow. Russia banned Instagram, closed down its independent news outlets and passed a new law this month threatening journalists with lengthy prison sentences if they publish so-called fake information about the country's armed forces. Nika Aleksejeva, the lead digital forensic researcher in the Baltic States at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, told CBS News on Thursday that the information space is the ""battlefield"" and Russia is trying to taking control of it ""as much as it can,"" as it works to ""demoralize"" Ukrainian soldiers and control the message domestically.

2022-03-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-voznesensk-battle-mykolaiv-defend-nuclear-plant-odesa-port/,Inside a Ukrainian town's bloody battle to keep Russian invaders away from a nuclear plant and the vital port of Odesa,"Odesa — The U.S. military says at least 7,000 Russian troops have been killed since Vladimir Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine more than three weeks ago. Putin's government, however, tells the Russian people that only a few hundred of the country's soldiers have died. CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay visited the key southern town of Voznesensk, where Ukraine's defenders recently managed to repel an attack by a much better-equipped Russian force. It's another example of Ukrainian forces mounting a remarkable resistance — and it left grim evidence of a very different story to the one Russia's president is telling his people. In Putin's disinformation war, his own soldiers are among the victims. The Ukrainian army keeps 12 of their bodies in a refrigerated railcar in Voznesensk. The town is offering to return the bodies to their mothers. Most were too young to have wives. But the Russian military won't even acknowledge they exist, a Ukrainian military scout, codenamed ""Ghost,"" told CBS News. ""Russia is treating their own soldiers like meat, leaving them to rot,"" he told Livesay. Ukrainian troops in Voznesensk came up against a Russian invasion force that was armed to the teeth. They had heavy artillery and helicopters. In a heroic act of self-sacrifice, they blew up the main bridge into the town to keep Russian tanks from crossing. If the Russian forces get past the bridge, there would be nothing to stop them attacking and seizing another of Ukraine's nuclear power facilities — and beyond that, the real prize for Putin: the major port city of Odesa. If Russia captures Odesa, it will gain a strategic foothold across a swathe of southeastern Ukraine linking its own territory with the Crimean Peninsula, which Putin seized control of with his last invasion in 2014. In their march to gain that foothold, Russian troops apparently thought they'd hit a little resistance when they got to the other side of the bridge into Voznesensk. But they underestimated, or were misinformed about their opponents. ""They were advancing with tanks, mortars, lots of armor, and artillery, firing chaotically into the city center, striking a kindergarten and near an orphanage,"" Voznesensk's Mayor Yevheni Velichko told Livesay. ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell traveled to the Ukraine-Poland border as Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered the fastest refugee displacement crisis in Europe since World War II. O'Donnell shares firsthand accounts from Ukrainian refugees and looks at how NATO is preparing while Russia pushes the war in Ukraine close to Poland's border in the 30-minute documentary ""Norah O'Donnell Reports: Crisis in Ukraine,"" premiering Friday, March 18, at 7:30 p.m. ET on the CBS News app. The mayor guided CBS News through the rubble and around the anti-tank mines still littering his town. ""This is where we stopped them,"" said Velichko. His sleepy country town, without heavy weapons of its own, routed a Russian battalion. Even locals like 66-year-old Sushenko Nikolay Semenovich, a retired minesweeper in the Soviet army, pitched in to repel the Russian force. ""I jumped out and shot with my own rifle,"" he told CBS News. ""Our commander told me, 'get back in the basement, grandpa!' But my heart simply couldn't handle just sitting in the basement. These Russians don't give up. We will kill them all."" That tenacity kept the invading force from advancing to Odesa on the ground, but it has not kept them away from the vital port by sea. U.S. officials say there are no signs of an imminent amphibious attack, but Russian warships off the coast have been firing missiles into nearby towns. Volunteers in Odesa are bracing for a fight of their own, filling sandbags as Russian warships are spotted on the horizon.",14,2.9475038220264547,2.07097632636116,0.8765274956652949,20

Merefa Mayor Veniamin Sitov said the attack occurred just before dawn on Thursday. The Kharkiv region, like most other major population centers in eastern Ukraine, has seen heavy bombardment as stalled Russian forces try to advance in the area. Earlier this week, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot spoke with the mayor of Kharkiv — Ukraine's second largest city — in an effort to help people in her constituency understand what's going on in Ukraine, and to tell her counterpart that more supplies and aid were on their way. ""The strikes from the sky are everyday and every hour,"" Mayor Ihor Terekhov told Lightfoot in the video call, part of which was aired by CBS Chicago. ""Bombings (of) peaceful residential buildings. Victims everywhere."" ""We will continue to send all the aid that we can,"" Lightfoot told him. Chernihiv, northwest of Kharkiv but just as close to the Russian border, has also been pummeled by Russian missile and artillery strikes for weeks. Ukraine's emergency service said a hostel there was shelled, killing a mother, father and three of their children, including 3-year-old twins.

As CBS News correspondent Imitaz Tyab reports, in Russia's war of attrition, it appears that nothing is off limits. Not even a theater in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol that was said to be sheltering more than 1,000 people. It was clearly marked with the word ""children"" scrawled in huge Russian writing. But it was reduced to ruins on Wednesday. Ukrainian officials called it the latest atrocity by Russian forces, but there was hope on Thursday morning that many of those who had turned to the theater as a safe haven might have survived. ""The bomb shelter held,"" Petro Andrushchenko, an advisor to Mariupol's mayor, told the Reuters news agency on the phone. ""Now the rubble is being cleared. There are survivors. We don't know about the victims yet."" ""We don't know yet whether we have wounded people, or killed people. But it looks like most of them have survived and are okay,"" Dmytro Gurin, a Ukrainian lawmaker whose parents are trapped in Mariupol, told the BBC. Russia denies bombing the building, accusing the Ukrainian Azov Battalion, a militia with neo-Nazi sympathies, of blowing it up. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova repeated the Kremlin's frequent refrain on Thursday in Moscow, telling reporters that ""Russia's armed forces don't bomb towns and cities."" Russia has offered no proof, however, to back up its claim that the Azov group rigged the theater with explosives to stage a provocation. At a nearby hospital, scenes of utter carnage were painfully clear. Medics did what they could to help in the wake of the latest destruction in Mariupol, but officials say more than 2,000 civilians have been killed by Russia's artillery and missile fire in the city so far. The youngest of the victims was just 22 days old. ""These are all the people we could not save,"" lamented one brave doctor. The city has collapsed into chaos as Russian soldiers encircle it. Each airstrike and shelling — one every minute at times — slowly squeezes the life out of the once thriving seaport. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, another inferno. Tyab said Russian shelling hit a market there, killing at least three people. ""I think there were several rockets or Grad missiles,"" recalled one witness. ""Boom, boom, boom, and then the fire broke out."" It's a hell that has sent more than 3 million Ukrainians fleeing to other countries, and displaced millions more within their own. Among them, a group of orphans who were rescued less than a week ago from brutal violence in the country's war-torn east. ""They have both physical and mental disabilities,"" explains Natali, a social worker in the western city of Lviv who is helping the children. As he spoke to Tyab, another air raid siren went off. Natali shouted at the older kids to run inside and take cover while carers carefully gathered up the younger ones, guiding them down a flight of stairs into a basement classroom. The carers played games with the kids to try to smooth their fears. ""The children don't hear the sirens from here. They are hidden,"" Nadeeya, one of the teachers, told CBS News. ""We are safe here."" The orphans may be among Ukraine's most vulnerable, but they are deeply cared for, and even with such uncertain futures, they still manage to smile and make new friends as they hide from Russian bombs.

In the war's third week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested there was still some reason to be optimistic that negotiations with the Russian government might yet yield an agreement. Previewing his speech to the U.S. Congress, Zelenskyy thanked President Joe Biden and ""all the friends of Ukraine"" for $13.6 billion in new support. He appealed for more weapons and more sanctions to punish Russia and repeated his call to ""close the skies over Ukraine to Russian missiles and planes."" Zelenskyy said Russia's demands were becoming ""more realistic"" after their delegations met Tuesday via video. The sides were expected to speak again later Wednesday. ""Efforts are still needed, patience is needed,"" he said in his video address to the nation. ""Any war ends with an agreement."" He said Russian forces had been unable to move deeper into Ukrainian territory but had continued their heavy shelling of cities. Developments on the diplomatic front and on the ground occurred as the number of people fleeing Ukraine amid Europe's heaviest fighting since World War II eclipsed 3 million. Zelenskyy said 28,893 civilians were able to flee through nine humanitarian corridors in the past day although the Russians refused to allow aid into Mariupol. The U.N. said close to 700 civilians in Ukraine have been confirmed killed, with the true figure probably much higher. Ukraine's prosecutor said Wednesday that 103 children have been killed there since Russia invaded, according to the Reuters news service. Fighting has intensified on Kyiv's outskirts, and the mayor imposed a curfew through Thursday morning. Shrapnel from an artillery shell slammed into a 12-story apartment building in central Kyiv on Wednesday, obliterating the top floor and igniting a fire that sent plumes of smoke over the area, according to a statement and images released by the Kyiv emergencies agency. The neighboring building was also damaged. Agence France-Press cited the emergencies agency as saying two people were wounded and 35 evacuated. Also, a powerful explosion thundered overnight in Kharkiv and was heard across the eastern city. In addition to airstrikes and shelling by ground forces, Russian naval ships fired overnight on a town south of Mariupol on the Azov Sea and another near Odesa on the Black Sea, according to local officials. AFP said at least four people were killed and 40 injured on Tuesday when a Russian strike set an apartment building ablaze in Kyiv's Sviatoshynsky district. Several other buildings were also struck. Russian forces have intensified fighting in the Kyiv suburbs, notably around the town of Bucha in the northwest and the highway leading west toward Zhytomyr, the head of the Kyiv region Oleksiy Kuleba said. He said Russian troops are trying to cut off the capital from transport arteries and destroy logistical capabilities even as they plan a wide-ranging attack to seize Kyiv. Twelve towns around Kyiv are without water and six without heat. Russia has occupied the city of Ivankiv, 50 miles north of Kyiv, and controls the surrounding region on the border with Belarus, Kuleba said. Across the Kyiv region, he said, ""Kindergartens, museums, churches, residential blocks and engineering infrastructure are suffering from the endless firing."" A senior U.S. defense official, speaking to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon's assessment, said Tuesday the Russians were using long-range fire to hit civilian targets inside Kyiv with increasing frequency but that their ground forces were making little to no progress around the country. The official said Russian troops were still about 9 miles from the center of the capital. Before Tuesday's talks with Ukrainian officials, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would press its demands that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO, adopt a neutral status and ""demilitarize."" In a statement that seemed to signal potential grounds for agreement with Moscow, Zelenskyy told European leaders gathered in London that he realizes NATO has no intention of accepting Ukraine. ""We have heard for many years about the open doors, but we also heard that we can't enter those doors,"" he said. ""This is the truth, and we have simply to accept it as it is."" NATO doesn't admit nations with unsettled territorial conflicts. Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he realizes NATO isn't going to offer membership to Ukraine and that he could consider a neutral status for his country but needs strong security guarantees from both the West and Russia. On a day when thousands managed to leave Mariupol, Russian troops seized the city's largest hospital, regional leader Pavlo Kyrylenko said. He said the troops forced about 400 people from nearby homes into the Regional Intensive Care Hospital and were using them and roughly 100 patients and staff as human shields by not allowing them to leave. Kyrylenko said shelling had already heavily damaged the hospital's main building, but medical staffers have been treating patients in makeshift wards in the basement. Doctors from other Mariupol hospitals made a video to tell the world about the horrors they've been seeing. ""We don't want to be heroes and martyrs posthumously,"" one woman said. She also said it's insufficient to simply refer to people as the wounded: ""It's torn off arms and legs, gouged out eyes, bodies torn into fragments, insides falling out."" The employee of Russian state television who was arrested after interrupting a live news program by protesting the war in Ukraine was fined about about $270 but still could face a prison sentence. ""These were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn't allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn't provide any legal support,"" Marina Ovsyannikova said after she was released. Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked into the studio during Monday's evening news show with a poster saying ""stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here."" In English, it said ""no war"" at the top of the poster and ""Russians against the war"" at the bottom. Two journalists working for Fox News were killed in a vehicle hit by fire Monday on the outskirts of Kyiv. Fox identified them as video journalist Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova, who was helping Fox crews navigate the area. Another journalist was killed Sunday in Ukraine. On Tuesday, the leaders of three European Union countries - Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia - visited Kyiv in a bold show of support amid the danger.",17,3.0040579268113805,1.818407511795073,1.1856504150163074,23

There was no immediate word on deaths or injuries. ""The building is now fully ruined,"" tweeted Minister Dmytro Kuleba, along with a purported photograph of the destroyed theater. ""Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter."" The Mariupol city council said on Telegram that Russia ""purposefully destroyed the Drama Theatre, where hundreds of people are hiding."" The council said a plane dropped a bomb on the building, destroying the ""central part"" of the theater and the ""entrance to the bomb shelter in the building."" ""It is still impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act,"" the city council said on Telegram. Other images and video purportedly showing the aftermath of the strike were posted on social media. Russia has denied targeting civilians. The Russian defense ministry said its forces had not struck the building and blamed the attack on the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, RIA news agency reported. Mariupol, a southern seaport of 430,000 residents, has become a symbol of Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive to crush democratic Ukraine - but also of a fierce resistance on the ground. In the nearly three weeks since Russia's war began, two Associated Press journalists have been the only international media present in Mariupol, chronicling its fall into chaos and despair. The city is now encircled by Russian soldiers, who are slowly squeezing the life out of it, one blast at a time. Several appeals for humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians went unheeded, until Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that about 30,000 people had fled in convoys of cars. Airstrikes and shells have hit the maternity hospital, the fire department, homes, a church, a field outside a school. For the estimated hundreds of thousands who remain, there is quite simply nowhere to go. The surrounding roads are mined and the port blocked. Food is running out, and the Russians have stopped humanitarian attempts to bring it in. Electricity is mostly gone and water is sparse, with residents melting snow to drink. Some parents have even left their newborns at the hospital, perhaps hoping to give them a chance at life in the one place with decent electricity and water. People burn scraps of furniture in makeshift grills to warm their hands in the freezing cold and cook what little food there still is. The grills themselves are built with the one thing in plentiful supply: bricks and shards of metal scattered in the streets from destroyed buildings. Death is everywhere. Local officials have tallied more than 2,500 deaths in the siege, but many bodies can't be counted because of the endless shelling. They have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because it's too dangerous to hold funerals. Many of the deaths documented by the AP were of children and mothers, despite Russia's claims that civilians haven't been attacked. Doctors say they are treating 10 civilians for every injured Ukrainian soldier. ""They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on March 10.",17,1.803893730992021,6.348679885584123,-4.544786154592102,14

The embassy did not cite what evidence it had of the attack in a statement posted on its official Twitter account. ""Such horrific attacks must stop,"" the Embassy said in the tweet, adding that the U.S. government was ""considering all available options to ensure accountability for any atrocity crimes in Ukraine."" With each day, the cost in human lives and suffering of Russia's war on Ukraine rises. The United Nations human rights office has registered about 600 civilian deaths, but the U.N. acknowledges the real toll is certain to be far higher. Ukrainian officials say thousands have been killed — more than 2,000 in the besieged southern city of Mariupol alone. There was little information on the alleged attack on civilians lining up for food in Chernihiv, but video posted to social media showed the purported aftermath, with a number of bodies on the ground. One of those to post the video was Oleksandr Merezhko, deputy head of the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, and chair of its Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Russians have killed more than ten people who were standing in line to buy some bread,"" he said in his tweet. The alleged attack came a day after Ukraine's general prosecutor's office said a Russian artillery strike had hit a university and open-air market in Chernihiv on Monday, killing 10. It was one of many strikes to hit the city over the last three weeks. The governor of the region said Wednesday that electricity had been cut to Chernihiv city and some surrounding towns and villages, but the Reuters news agency quoted Governor Viacheslav Chaus as saying Ukraine's armed forces were dealing ""powerful blows on the Russian enemy every hour.""

Mykolaiv was hit again by shelling early Tuesday morning. As CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reports, it's a city that stands at a crossroads between Odesa, Ukraine's biggest port that Russia desperately wants, and Mariupol, a city Russia has already encircled. In both Mariupol and Mykolaiv, Livesay says people are doing everything they can just to survive what Ukrainian officials call a war of annihilation by Russia's leader. Aerial video surfaced on Monday showing the horrific destruction of besieged Mariupol. Smoke rises from the charred carcasses of apartment buildings. The once thriving port city has been left in ruins. Officials say more than 2,000 civilians have been killed there alone. ""An elementary school was here,"" said resident Dima, pointing to a space devoid of anything but rubble. ""There were no military at this school."" Video released by Ukraine's National Guard shows its armored vehicles going toe to toe with Russia's, zigzagging through residential streets that have become a concrete battlefield. The brutal urban warfare has left hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in the freezing cold without heat, water, food or electricity. And while the bombing is chillingly indiscriminate, it is also by design: One by one, Putin's forces are terrorizing Ukraine's major ports as they grind slowly toward their goal of capturing Odesa. To get there, however, they first must get through, or around, Mykolaiv. Not if the local governor, Vitaly Kim, has anything to say about it. He's taken to social media to show off captured Russian military hardware, and his regular, charismatic videos have gone viral in Ukraine. Asked what he's learned about Russia as a military foe over the last week, Kim laughed and said he had to learn everything from scratch, because just two weeks ago, he knew ""nothing about war."" Now he knows it all too well. Mykolaiv has been shelled relentlessly for days. Over the weekend at least four people were killed while hiding in a bomb shelter beneath a school. Governor Kim has asked citizens to donate old tires, to pile up and set on fire in a bid to disorient the enemy in case of a full-on invasion. His residents responded, and there are mounds of tires and other barricades all around the city now. Kim even has a few Ukrainian tanks of his own, which he proudly shows off in his videos. The charisma of Ukraine's leaders has been wielded as a powerful weapon, and Russia knows it. Ukraine says it's why Russia has abducted at least two of its cities' mayors already, with the goal of being to replace them with pro-Russian puppets.",17,2.199061635816218,1.842499550592756,0.3565620852234619,20

Shortly before dawn, large explosions thundered across the city as a series of Russian strikes hit a residential neighborhood, sparking a huge fire and a frantic rescue effort in a 15-story apartment building. At least four people were killed and others were trapped, the Reuters news agency quoted Mayor Vitali Klitschko as saying. Emergency services earlier said saying 27 people had been rescued. Shockwaves from an explosion also damaged the entry to a downtown subway station that has been used as a bomb shelter. City authorities tweeted an image of the blown-out facade, saying trains would no longer stop at the station. Mayor Vitali Klitschiko announced a curfew for Kyiv, saying everyone would need to remain indoors for 35 hours, between Tuesday evening and Thursday morning, according to the Reuters news agency. There was a rare glimmer of hope in the encircled port city of Mariupol after a convoy of 160 civilian cars left along a designated humanitarian route, the city council reported. Over the past 10 days or so, the lethal siege has pulverized homes and other buildings and left people desperate for food, water, heat and medicine. Ukraine hopes to open nine ""humanitarian corridors"" Tuesday to evacuate civilians from numerous cities and intends to attempt to bring humanitarian supplies to Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. The latest negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, held by video Monday, were the fourth round involving higher-level officials from the two countries and the first in a week. The talks ended without a breakthrough after several hours, with an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the negotiators took ""a technical pause"" and planned to meet again Tuesday. The two sides had expressed some optimism in the past few days. Mykhailo Podolyak, the aide to Zelensky, tweeted that the negotiators would discuss ""peace, cease-fire, immediate withdrawal of troops & security guarantees."" Previous discussions, held in person in Belarus, produced no lasting humanitarian routes or agreements to end the fighting. Zelensky is seeking to extend martial law until April 24 and to require men ages 18 to 60 to stay in the country to fight. Zelensky submitted the extension in a bill to parliament, which is expected to vote on it this week. Zelensky is slated to address the U.S. Congress Wednesday. In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that while the Biden administration supports Ukraine's participation in the talks with Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to show signs of de-escalating in order to demonstrate good faith. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned China against helping Russia during a long meeting in Rome with a senior Chinese diplomat Monday. Two U.S. officials told CBS News the Kremlin has asked China for support in its war against Ukraine. The request included military aid and equipment, and a U.S. official told CBS News Monday that the request mainly concerns financial assistance, but Russia also inquired about drones. The Russians don't seem to have anticipated that they or Ukraine would deploy drones in this conflict, which is one reason they're asking China about them, according to the U.S. official. The Ukrainians have been using drones, especially Turkish-made TB2 drones, quite effectively, a senior defense official noted in a background briefing Monday. The drones are used for reconnaissance as well as strikes and have been especially effective against Russian ground movements. The Kremlin has denied asking China for military equipment to use in Ukraine and China dismissed it as ""misinformation."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was able to continue the operation itself and insisted that it was ""unfolding in accordance with the plan and will be completed on time and in full."" In Kyiv, the early morning explosions were artillery strikes, the Ukrainian military said. They hit the Svyatoshynskyi district of western Kyiv, adjacent to the suburb of Irpin that has seen some of the worst battles of the war. Flames shot out of the apartment building as firefighters climbed ladders to rescue people. Smoke choked the air. Damage from unspecified ammunition prompted a fire in a 10-story apartment block in the Podilsky district of Kyiv, north of the government quarter. One person was hospitalized, the state emergency agency reported. Russian forces also stepped up strikes overnight on the northwest suburbs of Irpin, Hostomel and Bucha, said the head of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba. ""Many streets (in those areas) have been turned into a mush of steel and concrete. People have been hiding for weeks in basements, and are afraid to go out even for evacuations,"" Kuleba said on Ukrainian television. But overall, Russia has fallen far short of the progress Russian leaders anticipated, defense and intelligence officials tell CBS News. Russia's advance on Kyiv from three separate directions has made slow progress, with days when the troops remain stalled and sitting targets for Ukrainians. The slow advance may have prompted the Russian request for China's help. A senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that Russian troops were still about 9 miles from the center of Kyiv. The official said Russian forces have launched more than 900 missiles but that Ukraine's airspace is still contested, with Russia not having achieved total air superiority. The Ukrainian general prosecutor's office on Tuesday released details of two deadly Russian attacks the day before. The office said an artillery strike had hit a university and open-air market, killing 10, and that a 65-year-old woman had been shot in a bus that was evacuating civilians from a Kyiv suburb. Russian artillery fire also hit a nine-story apartment building in the northern Obolonskyi district of the city, killing two more people, authorities said. A town councilor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, was killed in fighting there, officials said. And a Russian airstrike near a Ukrainian checkpoint caused extensive damage to a downtown Kyiv neighborhood, killing one person, Ukraine's emergency agency said. In an area outside Kyiv, Fox News reporter Benjamin Hall was injured while reporting and was hospitalized, the network said. In Russia, the live main evening news program on state television was briefly interrupted by a woman who walked into the studio holding a poster against the war. The OVD-Info website that monitors political arrests said she was a Channel 1 employee who was taken into police custody. Airstrikes were reported across the country, including the southern city of Mykolaiv and the northern city of Chernihiv, where heat was knocked out to most of the town. Explosions also reverberated overnight around the Russian-occupied Black Sea port of Kherson. Russian news agencies reported Tuesday that the Kremlin was claiming Russian troops had taken full control of the entire Kherson region, according to Reuters. Nineteen people were killed in a rocket attack on a TV tower in the western village of Antopol, according to local officials speaking with Agence France-Presse. In Mariupol, where the war has produced some of the greatest suffering, the city council didn't say how many people were in the convoy of cars headed westward for the city of Zaporizhzhia. But it said a cease-fire along the route appeared to be holding. Previous attempts to evacuate civilians and deliver humanitarian aid to the southern city of 430,000 were thwarted by fighting. Ukraine's military said it repelled an attempt Monday to take control of Mariupol by Russian forces, who were forced to retreat. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies showed fires burning across the city, with many high-rise apartment buildings heavily damaged or destroyed. The Kremlin-backed leader of the Russian region of Chechnya said on a messaging app that Chechen fighters were spearheading the offensive on Mariupol. The Russian military said Monday that 20 civilians in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine were killed by a ballistic missile launched by Ukrainian forces. The claim could not be independently verified. The U.N. has recorded at least 596 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, though it believes the true toll is much higher. Millions more have fled their homes, with more than 2.8 million crossing into Poland and other neighboring countries in what the U.N. has called Europe's biggest refugee crisis since World War II. Russia's military is bigger and better equipped than Ukraine's, but its troops have faced stiffer-than-expected resistance, bolstered by arms supplied by the West.",17,2.0517779210554297,2.1024358410164607,-0.050657919961031084,23
2022-03-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-kyiv-forces-dig-in-as-putin-shells-capital-and-kharkiv/,"Ukraine's forces dig in as Russia pummels Kyiv and other cities: ""We are ready for them""","Kyiv — CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata and his team have grown accustomed to the sounds of explosions and air raid sirens after weeks in Ukraine's capital. But on Tuesday, they were rattled awake around 5 a.m. as the ground shook. The Russian military machine again turned its guns on Kyiv overnight, raining artillery down on residential neighborhoods. Pre-dawn explosions thundered in and around the city, with one strike on an apartment building killing at least four people, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko. It was one of the heaviest bombardments since the invasion began. Klitschko declared a curfew from Tuesday night until Thursday morning. He's estimated that more than half of Kyiv's 3 million inhabitants have already fled to safer regions or left the country altogether. The United Nations said Tuesday that 3 million people have left Ukraine seeking shelter in neigboring nations — Europe's biggest refugee crisis since the second World War. Others have taken up semi-permanent residence deep inside Kyiv's subway system, some even sleeping in trains. In the wooded outskirts of the city, Ukrainian soldiers have dug in. Ukraine's Defense Ministry released video showing off their presence, with anti-tank weapons and mortars. The video was reassurance for fellow Ukrainians, and a clear warning for Russians. D'Agata and his team have seen for themselves, however, that the defense buildup in and around Kyiv is not merely for show. Every single road is barricaded and manned by troops, reserves or volunteers. Among them, 32-year-old Volodymyr, an economist who just a few years ago was living and working in Washington D.C. ""We are ready for them,"" he told CBS News. ""You know, in Ukraine, we tell who comes to us, will die here."" He said the blood of invaders would be good for Ukraine's soil. At a local auto repair shop, D'Agata said it was like ""MacGyver"" meets ""Mad Max"" as he met Oleg, who was busy modifying weapons ripped off ruined Russian armored vehicles for use by Ukrainian fighters. Oleg said the work made him happy, as every weapon that comes in for him to work on is one more barrel pointing at Russian forces, rather than at Ukraine's people. In an overnight address, President Volodymyr Zelensky made an appeal directly to Russian soldiers: ""On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance, a chance to survive"" he said. ""If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated — as people, decently."" Despite days spent flattening suburbs like Irpin and Bucha with missiles and artillery — shelling that resumed overnight — Russia's ground forces have yet to advance to the capital. American officials believe they're within about 10 miles, but analysts say the approach has been slowed by logistical shortcomings and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Many in Kyiv fear the capital is now just awaiting the same fate as other Ukrainian cities closer to Russian territory, like Mariupol. The key port town has suffered from the full fury of Russian firepower for days. There was a glimmer of hope Monday as city officials confirmed some of the first civilian evacuations under a cease-fire agreed with Russia. But only around 160 vehicles were said to have left, and there are an estimated 400,000 people trapped in Mariupol, where food, water, heating and electricity supplies were cut days ago. Russian forces unleashed new artillery strikes in Kharkiv, meanwhile, in the northeast, in their ongoing effort to capture Ukraine's second largest city. The tactic is clear, and it is familiar from Russia's brutal campaign alongside dictator Bashar Assad in Syria: Where Russian forces encounter resistance and can't, or won't, quickly move in and seize a city, they surround it, and destroy it from afar. Across the country, Ukraine's tenacious forces refuse to give up ground. But its cities are increasingly under siege, and its civilians are paying a heavy price.",17,1.4324483290246426,6.994012654741709,-5.561564325717066,20
2022-03-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-confident-russia-will-bring-us-astronaut-home-from-station-as-planned/,NASA confident Russia will bring U.S. astronaut home from International Space Station as planned,"Despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine and worsening international relations, joint operation of the International Space Station continues normally. Plans remain in place to bring NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei back to Earth as planned aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft at the end of the month, a senior NASA manager said Monday. Joel Montalbano, space station program manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said the Russians have assured NASA that Vande Hei and his two cosmonaut crewmates will land in Kazakhstan on March 30, as had been planned before the invasion began, to wrap up a record-setting mission. At touchdown, Vande Hei and cosmonaut Pyotr Dubrov, both of whom launched aboard another Soyuz last April 9, will have logged 355 days in space, setting a new single-flight record for a U.S. astronaut. On Tuesday, Vande Hei will pass the current 340-day U.S. record set by astronaut Scott Kelly in 2015-16. Vande Hei and Dubrov will return to Earth with Soyuz MS-19/65S commander Anton Shkaplerov, who launched last October and will be closing out a 176-day stay in space. ""Nothing has changed in the last three weeks, the control centers operate successfully, flawlessly, seamlessly, we're not seeing any impacts to what's going on around us,"" Montalbano said. ""We're able to do our jobs. We're aware of what's going on, but we are able to do our jobs, continue operations."" The invasion of Ukraine, the imposition of sanctions by the U.S., U.K. and European Union and fiery rhetoric from Dmitry Rogozin, director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, have prompted questions in some quarters about Russia's commitment to continuing joint operations aboard the ISS. As designed, the space station requires cooperation between the U.S. and Russia to operate normally, with the Russians providing the propulsion needed to keep the lab in orbit and NASA providing orientation control, excess electrical power and satellite communications. While a steady stream of vitriolic tweets have raised concern about a possible break in U.S.-Russian space relations, even Rogozin dismissed what he called ""hysterical"" rumors that Vande Hei might be left behind on the station. Because Vande Hei launched aboard a Soyuz, his pressure suit, worn during launch, re-entry and landing, is Russian. The suit is not compatible with the life support systems on the SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships. ""I can tell you for sure Mark is coming home on that Soyuz,"" Montalbano told reporters Monday. ""We are in communication with our Russian colleagues, there's no fuzz on that. The three crew members are coming home."" As usual when an astronaut comes back to Earth aboard a Soyuz, a NASA contingent of about 20 flight surgeons and other support personnel will fly to Kazakhstan aboard a NASA jet to carry out initial medical tests and to bring Vande Hei back to Houston for debriefing and physical therapy to help him readjust to gravity after nearly a year in space. NASA is gearing up for an especially busy spring and fall aboard the space station, with multiple U.S. and Russian crews flying to and from the outpost. It's not yet known how worsening international relations might affect those plans, but NASA is pressing ahead on the assumption that both sides will continue normal operations. Vande Hei will return to Earth 12 days after another Soyuz carries his crew's replacements — Soyuz MS-21/67S commander Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov — to the space station on Friday. The same day Vande Hei and his crewmates land, a SpaceX Crew Dragon is scheduled for launch from the Kennedy Space Center to carry four commercial fliers to the space station for a 10-day stay managed by Axiom Space in Houston. The flight is the first NASA-sanctioned commercial visit to the outpost. One week after the Axiom 1 crew lands on April 9, NASA and SpaceX plan to launch another Crew Dragon around April 15. Kjell Lindgren, Robert Hines, Jessica Watkins and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti will replace Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn, Kayla Barron and ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer, who were launched to the lab last October and plan to return to Earth on April 22. The next crew rotation after that comes around September 1 when a Crew Dragon is scheduled for launch carrying two NASA astronauts and a Japanese flier. Before the Russian invasion, NASA was negotiating with Roscosmos to fill the fourth seat with a cosmonaut and to put an astronaut aboard a Soyuz set for launch later in September. The idea is to make sure astronauts and cosmonauts are always aboard the station, even if a medical emergency or some other issue forces a Crew Dragon or Soyuz to make a sudden departure. Without such mixed crews, an unplanned departure could leave the station without a Russian or American crew member to operate critical systems. The Russians have not made any official comment on the status of the negotiations, but Montalbano said NASA is pressing ahead. ""At this time, we still plan the work the crew swap,"" he said. ""And so we still have scheduled training for cosmonauts to come to Houston and (SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California), and our team to go over to Star City (near Moscow) and train for the Soyuz.""",3,7.5413501251887505,6.181533870112365,1.3598162550763853,3

The group said Monday that no fighters had left Syria so far. Among those being targeted for recruitment, SOHR said that a notice had been sent out to members of the Al-Qatarji militia — a group that has been sanctioned by the United States for serving as an intermediary between the Assad regime and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — letting them know that they could sign up to be ""mercenaries"" for Russia in Ukraine. Payment for the work was rumored to be between $1,500 and $2,500, SOHR said, though no figure had been confirmed. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Russia's security council that foreign volunteers who wanted to fight with Russia in Ukraine should be allowed to. ""If you see that there are these people who want of their own accord, not for money, to come to help the people living in Donbas, then we need to give them what they want and help them get to the conflict zone,"" Putin said. Ukraine's President Volodymir Zelensky called the Syrian recruits ""thugs"" who would travel to kill people ""in a foreign land."" Ukraine, whose armed forces are much smaller than Russia's, has also put out a call to foreign fighters, with some — reportedly from places including the United Kingdom and Canada — already having arrived in the country. ""I think that they [the Russians] are running out of time, ammunition and manpower,"" General Ben Hodges, who formerly commanded the U.S. Army in Europe, told CBS News.

Russia insists it doesn't target civilians, but its forces have intensified their attacks on urban areas since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Another round of direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials took place on Monday.

After the talks on Monday, which were held virtually for the first time, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said there would be a ""technical pause"" in the bilateral dialogue until Tuesday, adding: ""Negotiations continue."" The previous rounds have enabled limited ""humanitarian corridors"" for civilians to evacuate some of the hardest-hit cities. While many of those efforts have failed quickly, with both sides blaming the other for cease-fire violations, evacuations appeared to be ramping up on Monday. Ukrainian officials said about 160 vehicles had finally managed to get people out of the besieged southern coastal city of Mariupol on Monday, and Russian news agency Interfax quoted the Defense Ministry in Moscow as saying Mariupol had been ""unblocked."" Even in the frontline towns near Kyiv, regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba said Monday that evacuations were going ahead for a fifth consecutive day. ""The ceasefire in our region is holding, albeit it is very conditional,"" Kuleba said on television, adding that explosions could still be heard in the distance. But despite the glimmers of hope, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the war seemed to be escalating by the hour. As the apartment building in Kyiv was hit Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted again that Russian artillery was only taking aim at military targets. Peskov repeated a claim issued earlier Monday by a mayor in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, which is held by Russian-backed separatists, that Ukrainian forces had fired a rocket at the city of Donetsk, ""which killed and wounded civilians."" Donetsk's pro-Russian mayor Aleksey Kulemzin said earlier that a Ukrainian missile had been shot down near Donetsk's city hall, creating a shower of debris that he said killed 17 people left 28 more injured. ""Of course, this is an attack on the civilian population,"" Peskov said. Russia has been accused of carrying out missile and airstrikes on residential buildings, hospitals and even schools for weeks, with the United Nations confirming about 600 civilians and acknowledging the true toll is likely much higher. Kyiv came under fire Monday on the heels of a massive round of Russian airstrikes that hit a Ukrainian military base right on Poland's doorstep, drawing the U.S. and its NATO allies closer than ever to the violence of this war. At least 35 people were killed in the Sunday strikes on the base, which has been used by American and NATO forces to train Ukrainian troops. The message from Moscow could not have been clearer. The strikes on the base — just 12 miles from the border with Poland, where the U.S. has deployed troops to bolster NATO's defenses — came a day after Russia warned that weapons and ""mercenaries"" flowing into Ukraine from Western nations would be considered ""legitimate targets."" Ukrainian officials said Russian warplanes fired about 30 missiles, 22 of which were intercepted by Ukraine's air defenses. The smile on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's face as he visited wounded troops in a hospital on Sunday, trying to boost spirits, was gone by the time he delivered a stark new warning overnight: ""I repeat again: If you do not close our skies, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory, on the territory of NATO and on the homes of citizens of NATO countries,"" Zelensky said. The Ukrainian leader has warned for months that Putin's intentions may go well beyond Ukraine's borders. The Red Cross said time was running out for hundreds of thousands of residents in Mariupol. Regional officials have reported at least 2,500 people killed in that city alone since in came under attack. Food, water and electricity supplies were all running out. Over the weekend, soldiers carried away the dead and wounded in the town of Irpin, just northwest of Kyiv, where residential neighborhoods have come under heavy bombardment for days. Many of those who've managed to escape the shelling and sniper fire in Irpin and nearby Bucha come to the neighboring village of Bilohorodka — some of them hitching rides in the back of cargo trucks as they don't have vehicles of their own. Upon arrival, they're handed warm drinks, water and something to eat. They're safe, for now, and looked after by neighbors who've chosen to stay behind to help, knowing full well they're right in the path of Russia's merciless advance toward the capital. ""I'm begging to be heard,"" said Eliana, a local helping those who have fled to her village. ""Close our skies so our kids can sleep calmly — so the whole country can live."" Alyona, another woman who was volunteering to help the evacuees, told D'Agata that while adults can at least understand what's happening to their country and try to help, children are scared. ""We try to explain that we have the greatest army, and they will protect us and defend us,"" she told CBS News. ""And they believe us."" ""We are frightened, very much,"" she admitted. But leaving, for her, was never an option, ""because we are Ukrainians. We can't do anything else. We can't go when, like, our people are dying here. We can't go away, we need to help them, it's our responsibility."" ""I'm a real Ukraine and I love so much my homeland and my people,"" agreed Natalia, another volunteer. ""We didn't flee away. We are Kyivites... We are staying here, to the last person!"" As they helped prepare food for the evacuees from Irpin, Oxana, another villager, repeated the plea made by her neighbor Eliana — one that is also made often by Ukrainian government officials: ""I'm asking your help. Stop this madhouse, give us no-fly zone, close the sky so we can handle the rest,"" she told D'Agata, adding that regardless of any foreign assistance, she and her neighbors would stand firm. ""We are so powerful. Not one of us will lower his head for Russians, nor in front of anyone. We don't surrender. On our land, staying until last minute."" D'Agata asked the volunteers if they would stay in their town, no matter what. They all replied ""yes,"" without hesitation. The United Nations says 2.7 million people have now fled Ukraine into neighboring nations, but that doesn't include the millions of people who have left their homes behind to seek refuge in other parts of their own country.

2022-03-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/russia-ukraine-war-airstrike-polish-border-lviv/,"Russian airstrike hits base in western Ukraine near Polish border, killing 35","Lviv, Ukraine — Waves of Russian missiles pounded a military training base close to Ukraine's western border with NATO member Poland, killing 35 people. The strike followed Russian threats to target foreign weapon shipments that are helping Ukrainian fighters defend their country against Russia's grinding invasion. More than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the sprawling training facility that is less than 15 miles from the closest border point with Poland, according to the governor of Ukraine's western Lviv region. Poland is a key location for routing Western military aid to Ukraine. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Lviv had largely been spared the scale of destruction unfolding further east and become a destination for residents escaping bombarded cities and for many of the nearly 2.6 million refugees who have fled the country. The training center in Yavoriv appears to be the most westward target struck so far in the 18-day invasion. The facility, also known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, has long been used to train Ukrainian military personnel, often with instructors from the United States and other NATO countries. It has also hosted international NATO drills. As such, the site symbolizes what has long been a Russian complaint: That the NATO alliance of 30 member countries is moving ever closer to Russia's borders. Russian has demanded that Ukraine drop its ambitions to join NATO. Lviv governor Maksym Kozytskyi said most of the missiles fired Sunday ""were shot down because the air defense system worked."" The ones that got through through killed at least 35 people and wounded 134, he said. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the strike was a ""new terrorist attack on peace&security near the EU-NATO border,"" and urged Western leaders to ""close the sky!"" U.S. and NATO allies have said they will not impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, since doing so would require shooting down Russian planes and risk sparking a wider war in Europe. Russian fighters also fired at the airport in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, 155 miles from Ukraine's border with Slovakia and Hungary, an attack the city's mayor said was intended ""to sow panic and fear."" The airport, which includes a military airfield as well as a runway for civilian flights, also was targeted Friday. Fighting also raged in multiple areas of the country overnight. Ukrainian authorities said Russian airstrikes on a monastery and a children's resort in the eastern Donetsk region hit spots where monks and refugees were sheltering, wounding 32 people. Another airstrike hit a westward-bound train evacuating people from the east, killing one person and injuring another, Donetsk's chief regional administrator said. To the north, in the city of Chernihiv, one person was killed and another injured in a Russian airstrike that destroyed a residential block, emergency services said. Around the capital, Kyiv, a major political and strategic target for the invasion, fighting also intensified, with overnight shelling in the northwestern suburbs and a missile strike Sunday that destroyed a warehouse to the east. Chief regional administrator Oleksiy Kuleba said Russian forces appeared to be trying to blockade and paralyze the capital with day and night shelling of the suburbs. Kuleba said Russian agents were operating in the capital and its suburbs, marking out possible future targets. He vowed that any all-out assault would meet stiff resistance, saying: ""We're getting ready to defend Kyiv, and we're prepared to fight for ourselves."" Talks aimed at reaching a cease-fire again failed Saturday, and the U.S. announced plans to provide another $200 million to Ukraine for weapons. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned other nations that sending equipment to bolster Ukraine's military was ""an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of trying to break his country apart, as well as starting ""a new stage of terror"" with the alleged detention of a mayor from a city west of Mariupol. ""Ukraine will stand this test. We need time and strength to break the war machine that has come to our land,"" Zelensky said during his nightly address to the nation Saturday. Russian soldiers pillaged a humanitarian convoy that was trying to reach the battered and encircled port city of Mariupol, where more than 1,500 people have died, a Ukrainian official said. Ukraine's military said Russian forces captured Mariupol's eastern outskirts, tightening their siege of the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. An Associated Press journalist in Mariupol witnessed tanks firing on a nine-story apartment building and was with a group of hospital workers who came under sniper fire on Friday. A worker shot in the hip survived, but conditions in the hospital were deteriorating: Electricity was reserved for operating tables, and people with nowhere else to go lined the hallways. Among them was Anastasiya Erashova, who wept and trembled as she held a sleeping child. Shelling had just killed her other child as well as her brother's child, Erashova said, her scalp crusted with blood. ""No one was able to save them,"" she said. In Irpin, a suburb about 12 miles northwest of central Kyiv, bodies lay out in the open Saturday on streets and in a park. ""When I woke up in the morning, everything was covered in smoke, everything was dark. We don't know who is shooting and where,"" resident Serhy Protsenko said as he walked through his neighborhood. Explosions sounded in the distance. ""We don't have any radio or information."" Zelensky encouraged his people to keep up their resistance. ""We do not have the right to let up our defense, no matter how difficult it may be,"" he said. Later Saturday, Zelensky reported that 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers had died since the Russian invasion began Feb. 24. Zelensky again deplored NATO's refusal to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine and said Ukraine has sought ways to procure air defense assets, though he didn't elaborate. President Biden announced another $200 million in aid to Ukraine, with an additional $13 billion included in a bill that has passed the House and should pass the Senate within days. NATO has said that imposing a no-fly zone could lead to a wider war with Russia. The Ukrainian president also accused Russia of detaining the mayor of Melitopol, a city 119 miles west of Mariupol. The Ukrainian leader called on Russian forces to heed calls from demonstrators in the occupied city for the mayor's release. Moscow has said it would establish humanitarian corridors out of conflict zones, but Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of disrupting those paths and firing on civilians. Russian forces have hit at least two dozen hospitals and medical facilities, according to the World Health Organization. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said just nine of 14 agreed-upon corridors were open on Saturday, and that about 13,000 people had used them to evacuate around the country. French and German leaders spoke Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a failed attempt to reach a cease-fire. According to the Kremlin, Putin laid out terms for ending the war. For ending hostilities, Moscow has demanded that Ukraine drop its bid to join NATO and adopt a neutral status; acknowledge the Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014; recognize the independence of separatist regions in the country's east; and agree to demilitarize. The Russian invaders appear to have struggled far more than expected against determined Ukrainian fighters. Still, Russia's stronger military threatens to grind down Ukrainian forces. Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed along with many civilians, including at least 79 Ukrainian children, its government says. At least 2.5 million people have fled the country, according to the United Nations refugee agency.",17,1.03901094840492,2.0157830550015325,-0.9767721065966126,17

Ground forces have moved to within 15 miles of Kyiv's center, according to Britain's Defense Ministry. Around the city, artillery barrages have sent residents heading for shelter. In Mariupol, which has faced some of the worst suffering since Russia began its Ukraine invasion, Russian forces shelled a mosque housing more than 80 people, including children, the Ukrainian government said on Saturday. The number of casualties wasn't immediately clear. Ukraine's president suggested the war has reached a ""strategic turning point"" as the shelling of neighboring cities intensifies. The U.S. is deploying additional troops to Eastern Europe to support NATO forces. It's also sending more weapons and billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. Mr. Biden on Friday reiterated his position that no American soldiers will go into battle. On Saturday, two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that the U.S. has had limited contact with Russia since the war began. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has spoken to Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov, but the conversations were not productive. President Biden has not spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken has not spoken to his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov are not answering their phones, the officials said. Additionally, none of the outreach from French, German or Israeli officials appear to be going anywhere. Amid the developments, the civilian death toll is surging in the third week of the offensive. In the Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv, the night offers no rest. In an effort to break Ukraine off from vital access to the sea, Russian shelling has broken infrastructure, homes and families. Two weeks ago, some children – who are now forced to live in a basement beneath a derelict market – were playing hide and seek. Now they're hiding from banned cluster bombs, according to the local government. Their cold and dark bunker will only get fuller in the days ahead, says the mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych. CBS News' Chris Livesay asked him if Russia is attacking civilians on purpose. ""I think the main idea is to kill Ukrainians as much as they can,"" he said. ""It's a complete lie when they say they want to protect us. They want to kill as much Ukrainians as they can."" It's not only shelling civilians have to fear. In the occupied city of Melitopol, Russian soldiers captured the mayor, put a bag over his head and took him to an undisclosed location, in broad daylight. Across Ukraine, those brave enough to step outside find their cities mutilated. The contested eastern city of Volnovakha is now in the teeth of Russian separatists, brandishing a trademark Z to show loyalty to Putin. The international community has assessed with low confidence that between 2,000 and 4,000 Russian soldiers have died in action, while U.S. defense officials estimate, also with low confidence, the number to be somewhere closer to 5,000 or 6,000. Russia has not made its official death toll public. Margaret Brennan and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",17,2.5835630623687713,2.1409726983210717,0.4425903640476996,14

2022-03-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-war-crimes/,"Putin may be committing war crimes, but do the allegations have any teeth?","The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into the war in Ukraine as pressure mounts to prosecute Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal. The case against Putin could come together quickly as the list of alleged violations grows: the bombing of a maternity hospital, the shelling of civilian targets and an attack on a nuclear power plant that raised the specter of a nuclear disaster in the heart of Europe. But a conviction could prove elusive. The International Criminal Court, which the U.S. is not part of, has a track record of 10 convictions over two decades. ""The first way that they can build it — and it may be sufficient in this case — they can look at the pattern of the attack,"" Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes, told CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge. Rapp, who has built cases against dictators and sought accountability for genocide, said Putin would be seen as ""an international pariah"" if there is a war crimes designation against him. ""It also means that he can't travel anywhere, no more summits, because he'd be putting himself in danger,"" Rapp said. Securing justice in the court does not happen quickly. The court had to pull the arrest warrant for Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi after he was executed by his own people. Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad remains in power nearly a decade after he allegedly used chemical weapons against Syrians. Even though the U.S. is not part of the International Criminal Court, a National Security Council spokesperson told CBS News that the U.S. is already collecting evidence of alleged war crimes and human rights abuses that could be used in a criminal prosecution. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv called the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant a ""war crime."" But hours later, the White House dialed back the language. ""We have not made conclusions, it's a legal review and a process that goes through at the administration,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. Rapp said the bar is ""very high"" to prove that war crimes have been committed, but ""given the intensity of this campaign and the civilian destruction, I think that can be developed in a matter of weeks."" Matthew Kroenig, who worked the Russia and nuclear portfolios for the intelligence community under the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, told CBS News there's a rising threat from Russia's stockpile of lower-yield weapons known as tactical nukes. ""These are weapons that would be used not for, say, attacking Washington or New York, but for winning a battle on the field in Ukraine,"" Kroenig said. Use of tactical nuclear weapons against civilians would be ""a war crime of the highest order,"" he said. This week, intelligence officials warned of a Russian policy called ""escalate to deescalate,"" which means the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield to intimidate an adversary. ""I think before he lost the war, he would try to use nuclear weapons to try to pull victory from the jaws of defeat,"" Kroenig said of Putin. ""I think the risk of nuclear war is still low. But I think the risk is higher now than any time we've seen in recent years.""",13,3.605666079468929,6.34864527987389,-2.7429792004049607,19

""Bodies are being buried in the yards of the apartment blocks. We can't live like this!"" The Kremlin is targeting Ukraine's coastal strongholds.

The government hoped to at least get some humanitarian aid into the worst affected areas, as Russia looked poised to make a new push to take major cities, including Kyiv. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports residents are running for their lives from Ukraine's capital. Just a month ago, Kyiv was a thriving European metropolis home to almost 3 million people. Now, hunkering down, hiding out and hoping the worst won't happen is no longer an option. ""The snipers have taken over my house,"" said Valentina, a school teacher. ""They're shooting in the direction of my son's house, my only son."" Not everyone gets away. Terrifying scenes have been unfolding in the neighborhoods of Irpin and Bucha, just a few miles from central Kyiv. Ukrainian officials say about 2,500 civilians have been killed since Russia launched its invasion 16 days ago. New satellite images of the huge Russian military convoy north of the capital suggest it might finally be on the move again after being stalled for days by logistical issues and fierce Ukrainian resistance. The troops appear to be repositioning in preparation for a possible assault on, or siege of the capital. As D'Agata reports, that's exactly what the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, has been subjected to for days. But Russia has paid a heavy price. The bodies of Russian soldiers litter the ground around Kharkiv, and after two weeks of ferocious battle and relentless artillery fire, Russia still hasn't taken control. A regional official said Friday that Russian forces had shelled residential areas of Kharkiv 89 times in just 24 hours, with some of the strikes hitting an institute containing a nuclear laboratory that Russia claimed several days ago was being prepared by Ukrainian forces for a staged ""provocation."" Kharkiv Governor Oleh Synegubov said there were ""no threats to the civilian population yet"" from the strikes that hit the nuclear facility specifically, but as D'Agata reports, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been no match for Russia's artillery and aerial bombardment. Civilians in Kharkiv and other battered cities report seemingly indiscriminate killing, with targets, including hospitals and residential neighborhoods. After a strike on a maternity and children's hospital Wednesday in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol drew international condemnation of Russia — and a denial from Moscow — Governor Synegubov said Friday that a health facility in his region had been struck. He said a psychiatric hospital near the town of Izyum, about 50 miles southeast of the city of Kharkiv, was hit by Russian fire in a ""brutal attack on civilians."" The Reuters news agency quoted him as saying that about 70 people had been evacuated from the facility, which housed 330. He said emergency services were working to assess casualties. The onslaught of artillery fire and airstrikes is President Vladimir Putin taking advantage of the West's refusal to risk a direct confrontation with Russia by imposing a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine. He's used the tactic before, most recently in Syria, where his forces surrounded and then destroyed entire cities to beat rebel fighters into submission. But D'Agata says when it comes to Russia's ground assault in Ukraine, the Ukrainian forces have two advantages: They're fighting on their own turf, and they're determined to defend every inch of it. One Ukrainian soldier holding a line on the edge of Kharkiv said the Russian forces he was up against — who were only about half a mile from his position — were using outdated tactics. ""They're fighting like the soldiers of 1941,"" he said. ""They attack in, just like, in front, they don't do any modern maneuvers. Yeah, they have a lot of people, a lot of vehicles and tanks, but we fight in our land and we protect our families. So, it doesn't matter how they fight, we fight like lions and they won't win!"" With multiple cities now under siege, D'Agata says the top priority for Ukrainian authorities is again to attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in catastrophic conditions without food, water or electricity, and in brutal sub-freezing temperatures.",17,0.9636113741185537,1.9998805789137784,-1.0362692047952247,20

The findings come as Russian forces continued their airstrikes on the port city of Mariupol on Thursday, the AP said. The images, taken by Maxar Technologies, ""showed that 40-mile (64-kilometer) convoy of vehicles, tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed, with armored units seen in towns near the Antonov Airport north of the city,"" the AP reports. The artillery pieces have been moved into firing positions, the AP said. The convoy had been outside of Kyiv since early last week, the AP reports. But Ukrainian forces, as well as reported food and fuel shortages, slowed the convoy's advance. Meanwhile, Britain on Thursday accused Russia of a ""war crime"" for an attack the previous day on a children's and maternity hospital in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Ukrainian officials have said that at least three people, including a young girl, were killed in the strike, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky labelled an ""atrocity"" soon after it happened.

""We stand with the people of Ukraine,"" Harris said after reaffirming America's ""ironclad"" commitment to defend NATO nations. Asked later if she believed Russia's actions should be investigated as possible war crimes, Harris said ""when it comes to crimes and violations of international norms"" the U.S. was ""clear that any intentional attack on innocent victims is a violation."" She said the United Nations had an established process to determine whether war crimes had been committed, and ""absolutely there should be an investigation. The eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done."" Speaking after talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Thursday in Turkey, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the claims of a Russian attack on a functioning hospital as lies and propaganda. ""It is not the first time we have seen pathetic outcries concerning the so-called atrocities"" by Russia, Lavrov said, claiming the hospital was being used as a base by an ""ultra-radical"" Ukrainian battalion. He said Russia had submitted data to the United Nations ""days ago"" to prove its claim, and accused foreign media of manipulating information on the strike. Lavrov claimed no patients or staff had been at the facility, which he insisted had ""long ago become a base for extremists."" CBS News' Pamela Falk reported from United Nations headquarters that Russia's U.N. ambassador Vassily Nebenzia did tell Security Council members on March 7 that ""locals"" in Mariupol had reported ""that Ukraine's Armed Forces kicked out personnel of natal hospital #1 of the city of Mariupol and set up a firing site within the facility."" Nebenzia offered no evidence to support the claim, and Russia has been accused for weeks by the West of making false statements to create a pretext for attacks in Ukraine. Later on Thursday, Russia's Defense Ministry denied having attacked the hospital at all, accusing Ukrainian forces of a ""staged provocation"" at the facility. ""We lost three people, including a child, a girl. The number of wounded is 17. These are children, women, medical workers,"" Ukraine's Zelensky said in a video address on Thursday. ""This topic was mentioned on Russian TV,"" said Zelensky. ""But not a word of truth was said. The Russians were lied to that there had been no patients in the hospital and no women or children in the maternity hospital. The Russians were lied to that 'nationalists' had allegedly taken up positions there. They lie confidently, as always."" CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the massive airstrike on the hospital in Mariupol shattered a fragile cease-fire in the southern port city of Mariupol late Wednesday afternoon amid efforts to evacuate civilians from the besieged city. Emergency teams and soldiers scrambled to evacuate the wounded, including pregnant women, from the hospital. The blast destroyed the complex inside and out, and the size and depth of the crater and the surrounding debris were clear evidence of its ferocity, D'Agata said. Albania's Ambassador to the United Nations Ferit Hoxha, speaking Thursday to the Security Council, dismissed Russian allegations that the hospital was being used by any armed forces. ""What we saw were women in labor among rubble. We condemn this in the strongest terms. This is a crime which should not remain unpunished and no one should get away with crime,"" Hoxha said according to Falk. Mariupol has come under heavy Russian bombardment for days, cutting off power and water to more than 400,000 people trapped in the city. Ukrainian officials say at least 1,200 civilians have been killed there since the war began, and images have shown city workers placing bodies into a mass grave. Ukrainian officials said at least seven more civilians were killed in further Russian artillery attacks overnight, and the city council said on Thursday that the rocket fire continued, hitting more civilian infrastructure. ""Bombs are hitting houses,"" the council said in a social media post.

The announcement came as the worst refugee crisis Europe has seen since World War II deepened, with more than 2 million people fleeing Ukraine in recent days into neighboring countries, according to the United Nations. Russian forces are now surrounding key cities and inching — apparently more slowly than they'd hoped — toward the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Ukraine's defense forces are mounting a fierce resistance, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports. Reports from battered Ukrainian cities suggested that Moscow is at least partially upholding its latest promise to allow civilians to flee from its seemingly indiscriminate artillery barrage. But while a truce in the northeast Ukrainian city of Sumy appeared to be holding, some people never got the chance to flee. At least 20 people were killed in one strike on the city alone Monday evening, local officials said.

""Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sound of freedom!"" the SpaceX launch director told her flight controllers as the countdown neared zero. ""LD is go for launch."" She was referring to comments last week from Russian space chief Dmitry Rogozin, who halted sales and service of Russian rocket engines to U.S. companies in the wake of sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He tweeted ""let them fly on something else, their broomsticks, I don't know what."" Falcon 9 rockets, including the engines, are built at SpaceX's plant in Hawthorne, California, as are the Cargo and Crew Dragon spacecraft that carry supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station. SpaceX founder Elon Musk immediately responded to Rogozin by calling his all-American rockets ""American broomsticks."" Russia has severed commercial ties with western commercial space operations, although both NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian space agency Rogozin heads, continue, for now, joint operations aboard the International Space Station. Starlink satellites are designed to eventually provide internet access to any point on the planet using thousands of small laser-linked satellites to relay data to and from relatively small antennas and transceivers on the ground. In response to pleas from Ukrainian leaders, Musk activated Starlink internet service and shipped antennas and receivers to the embattled country, along with warnings about avoiding Russian jamming or worse. ""They tweeted at Elon and so we turned it on,"" SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said during a March 7 talk at the California Institute of Technology. ""That was our permission,"" she said according to Space News. ""It was a tweet."" She said activating service ""was the right thing to do,"" providing a source of unfiltered news in the midst of Russia's ongoing invasion. ""I think the best way to uphold democracies is to make sure we all understand what the truth us."" With Wednesday's flight, the total number of Starlinks launched to date climbed to 2,282, although not all are still operational. Jonathon McDowell, an astrophysicist who maintains an extensive space flight database, said 2,014 were still in orbit going into Wednesday's flight, including 1,989 that were functional. But the active constellation is already providing relatively high-speed internet in selected locations, including Ukraine. The Falcon 9 carrying the latest batch of Starlinks blasted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 8:45 a.m. EST, streaking away on a southeasterly trajectory toward an orbit tilted 52 degrees to the equator. All 48 satellites were released an hour and five minutes after liftoff. It was the 144th Falcon 9 launch since the rocket's debut in 2010, the 10th so far this year and the 40th dedicated to the Starlink program. The rocket's first stage, making its fourth flight, landed successfully on a SpaceX droneship to chalk up the company's 111th successful booster recovery and its 84th at sea.",3,6.96567458930291,6.588828767948901,0.3768458213540091,6

In the two weeks since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion, WHO has confirmed 18 attacks on health providers. The 18 attacks thus far have resulted in at least 10 deaths and 16 injuries, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""These attacks deprive all communities of health care,"" he said, adding that the ""only real solution to the situation is peace."" The WHO leader's comments came as a Mariupol children's hospital and maternity facility suffered ""colossal"" damage from what Ukrainian officials said was a Russian strike. Video taken after the alleged attack shows the outside of the facility nearly eradicated, with vehicles completely destroyed, trees covered in soot, and debris flying everywhere. Additional video posted by Ukrainian President Volydmyr Zelensky shows the extent of the damage inside the facility. The walkthrough of the facility shows walls falling, shattered windows, and rooms in complete disarray. The city's council said that the damage was ""colossal,"" and Zelensky said that that are ""people, children under the wreckage."" ""Atrocity!"" the president said on Twitter, reiterating his request for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. ""You have the power but you seem to be losing humanity,"" he said. Mike Ryan, the head of WHO's emergencies program, said Wednesday that the violence in the country is driving a health crisis that ""will only get worse"" unless there is a ceasefire. With more than 2 million people fleeing the country, an untallied number staying in bomb shelters, and multiple attacks on health facilities, the conditions in Ukraine ""are the worst possible ingredients"" for the spread of infection, Ryan said, calling infectious diseases ""one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse."" ""It doesn't matter if it's COVID, doesn't matter if it's polio, doesn't matter if it's measles,"" he said.

""The Russian military I think is guilty of war crimes. You've seen indiscriminate shelling by artillery and even some unguided missiles going into residential areas,"" said former US Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer. The plan with this ceasefire is to allow those Ukrainians trapped in cities encircled by Russian troops to escape and for desperately needed supplies to come in. ""The first three days of attempts haven't worked out. I hope it does work out. It remains to be seen if the Russians deliver as promised,"" Pifer told KPIX5. The World Health Organization says at least 10 hospitals have also been targeted by Russian shelling. While outnumbered, the Ukrainian military and citizens are knocking out Russian planes and tanks. Pifer says nothing about this invasion has likely gone the way Russian President Vladimir Putin has planned. ""My guess is in the Kremlin that they've been surprised maybe even stunned by the impact of the sanctions, the scale of the sanctions and they probably surprised too how NATO has come together, both in terms of re-inforcing the Eastern flank near Russia as well as the defense assistance and the arms that you see flowing from about 20 countries into Ukraine."" Putin has more than 4,500 nuclear warheads in the Russian arsenal. Dr. Gloria Duffy worked on nuclear disarmament during the Clinton Administration - including getting more than 1700 warheads out of Ukraine and converted to fuel for power plants. ""I am glad that there are fewer nuclear weapons in that region than there were when we started,"" said Dr. Duffy. She worries about what lengths Putin will reach to rebuild the Russian empire.

Hodges said he foresaw ""lots more destruction and fighting"" in and around Kyiv, but he predicted the capital ""will not fall"" and the ""Russians will not be able to take it."" Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""initial strategy"" when he invaded Ukraine — to quickly storm major cities, oust pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky and replace him with a Russian-friendly alternative — ""has failed,"" said Hodges. He noted that Russia's military had resorted to ""an attrition strategy to bring about the same aim,"" and acknowledged that the steady barrage of rocket fire on Ukraine's cities had ""helped make up for their poor planning, terrible logistics, inability to conduct effective joint operations at the operational level, and their poor estimation of Ukrainian fighting power."" ""But I don't think they can sustain this 'overwhelming' firepower as their logistical challenge worsens and the logistics for Ukraine get better,"" said Hodges. ""I don't think they have the manpower, logistics, or time to conduct this approach effectively."" A senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Monday that nearly 100% of the Russian combat power that had amassed at the Ukrainian border in the weeks leading up to the invasion has now been committed inside the country. The Russians have launched more than 625 missiles in the 11 days of fighting, the official said, and appear to be increasing their use of long-range strikes to supplement or make up for the lack of ground movement and lack of air superiority. Some allied military leaders are likewise indicating that Ukrainian forces and civilians might be able to withstand the Russians' advances. ""I think we've seen a Russian invasion that is not going well. I think we're also seeing a remarkable resistance by Ukraine, both its armed forces and its people,"" Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the chief of the defense staff in the U.K., told BBC News on Sunday. ""We do know that some of the lead elements of Russian forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian response."" Hodges, the retired U.S. commander, said that Putin's adopted tactics could start to increase pressure on the Russian leader not only from other countries, but from within his own. ""The great unknown for me is if the Russian population will continue to support this once they understand what's really going on,"" Hodges said. ""And I'm sure they'll begin to understand it soon, despite Putin's blackout on news/social media.""

2022-03-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-scott-kelly-dmitry-rogozin/,Veteran astronaut Scott Kelly criticizes Russian space chief as war of words erupts,"Retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent a U.S.-record 340 days aboard the International Space Station, has taken to Twitter to pass along ""real"" news to his 5 million followers, many of them in Russia, about the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. In the process, a war of words has broken out between the astronaut and Dmitry Rogozin, director of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, who is providing a steady stream of vitriolic threats and insults aimed at NASA and its European partners in the International Space Station program. Kelly has taken time to personally needle Rogozin, becoming one of the most visible members of the international space community to criticize Russia's attack on Ukraine and the director of the country's space program. He clearly hit a nerve. ""You are being defiant and destructive,"" Rogozin tweeted in remarks translated by Google. ""Perhaps the dementia and aggression that you have developed is a consequence of the overload and stress of four flights into space. I invite you to undergo an examination at the Brain Institute of our Federal Medical and Biological Agency."" In an apparently deleted tweet Monday, Rogozin reportedly said ""Get off, you moron! Otherwise, the death of the #ISS will be on your conscience."" In a phone interview with CBS News on Sunday, Kelly said Rogozin has ""always been a clown"" and that his recent remarks about the space station prove it. ""It's just a lot of people didn't realize it, because they never gave him much attention. But you know, this highlights how big of a clown he really is."" Rogozin's comments in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have fueled speculation in the West that Russia could pull out of the International Space Station project, which currently requires Russian spacecraft, propellant and thrusters to stay in orbit. But Kelly is confident NASA, working with commercial companies like SpaceX, could develop a way to keep the station going even in the absence of Russia. ""I think (NASA is) looking at plans, contingency plans, what they would do if we had the partnership with the Russian fall apart,"" Kelly told CBS News. ""If the Russians decide that they're going to walk away from it or do whatever, it would be hard for NASA to go it alone,"" he said. ""But you know, what? That's what NASA does, they do hard things. So I think they'd figure out how we could do attitude control (or) how we could boost the space station. ... It's not impossible to go without the Russians. It'd be hard but, you know, that's what NASA does. Hard stuff."" Asked if it would be worth it to NASA to spend the money required to provide sole operational support of the station if it came to that, Kelly said the lab ""has a good eight years left in her."" ""I think it would send a good message to the Russians that if they want to get out of this partnership, then we can do it ourselves,"" he said. ""We don't really need them. We did a few years ago, but not anymore, right? We can get people to the space station"" aboard SpaceX Crew Dragon capsules and, eventually, Boeing's Starliner. Kelly said he hopes it won't come to that because the station is important to both countries. ""Without the space station program, the Russian space agency doesn't have much reason, at least the human spaceflight part, doesn't really have much of a purpose to exist,"" said Kelly. ""All those people, some of which are friends of mine, would lose their jobs. Including, probably, Regozin would lose his job, too."" He said he has been tweeting in Russian to friends and colleagues to put out ""real information to the Russian people about what's going on."" ""I have a lot of Russian friends. And you know, some of them are completely in line with our thinking on this, and some of them aren't. And the ones that aren't, it's not because they are stupid or have bad intentions. It's just because they've been fed misinformation for years and now are continuing to get propaganda and have limited access now to other sources of valid information on what's going on."" With more than 5 million followers on Twitter — nearly seven times as many as Rogozin — ""I just kind of figured I had a platform to get some messaging out that is the truth versus what the Russian population is being fed."" Last week, Rogozin, acting through Roscosmos, ordered non-Russian flags on a commercially purchased Soyuz rocket to be covered up. A day or so later, the flight was canceled when OneWeb, the consortium that paid Roscosmos to launch 36 internet satellites, refused Russian demands dictating how the satellites could be used. ""Without those flags and the foreign exchange they bring in, your space program won't be worth a damn,"" Kelly tweeted in Russian. ""Maybe you can find a job at McDonald's if McDonald's still exists in Russia."" Rogozin replied ""I am publishing this so that everyone understands the degree of American 'gratitude' for what Russia has done for the United States, carrying their astronauts ... for 9 years to the ISS after American emergency and extremely unreliable ships (killed) two of their crews and were eventually decommissioned. We then extended a helping hand to NASA, but now the aggressive Scott has bitten her."" He made no mention of the price NASA paid for that helping hand — some $4 billion for astronaut seats on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. But the criticism is not new. Amid U.S. threats of sanctions after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 he famously suggested NASA use trampolines to deliver astronauts to the space station. The comments stand in stark contrast to the cooperation the two countries have maintained for the past 30 years, jointly designing, building and operating the International Space Station. Rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts have continuously staffed the lab complex for the past 21 years. Both nations are required to operate the station in its current form. Russia provides the propellant and thrusters needed to keep the station in orbit while NASA provides most of the electrical power and the massive gyros needed to control its orientation without using rocket fuel. Neither side can operate the other's systems. NASA has kept a low profile in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, not posting any comments other than assuring reporters the crew's safety remains the agency's top priority. Rogozin, on the other hand, has kept up a steady stream of angry tweets threatening the station's survival. ""@Rogozin has always been a fool,"" retired NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman, a space station veteran, said in a Russian-language tweet. ""Only now he actually mortally wounds Roskosmos and ends one of the few remaining sources of currency for Russia. Keep this in mind when your ATM is empty. It will need a trampoline soon.""",3,4.579961896399678,6.519573452786684,-1.939611556387006,6
2022-03-07,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-opening-several-civilian-evacuation-corridors/,Russia announces limited ceasefire and opening of several civilian evacuation corridors,"Lviv, Ukraine — Russia announced yet another ceasefire and a handful of humanitarian corridors to enable civilians to flee Ukraine starting Monday, but previous such measures have fallen apart and Moscow's armed forces continued to pummel some Ukrainian cities with rockets even after the announcement. A day earlier, hundreds of thousands of civilians attempting to flee to safety were forced to shelter from what Ukrainian officials said was Russian shelling in cities in the center, north and south. Ahead of a third round of talks planned for Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry said a ceasefire would start in the morning, and safe passages would open for civilians from the capital of Kyiv, the southern port city of Mariupol, and the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. Some of the evacuation routes, however, would funnel civilians toward Russia or its ally Belarus - unlikely destinations for many Ukrainians who would prefer to head toward countries on the western and southern borders. A senior Ukrainian official rejected those proposals. It wasn't immediately clear if fighting would stop beyond the areas mentioned or when the cease-fire would end. Hopes were dim that the latest round of talks would yield any breakthroughs. A Russian task force had said the ceasefire would start Monday morning, the 12th day of the war. Monday's ceasefire announcement follows two failed attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, from which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimated 200,000 people were trying to flee. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for the failure. The Russian task force said Monday's ceasefire and the opening of the corridors was announced at the request of French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday. Russia's defense ministry claimed on Monday that Ukraine was planning to blow up an experimental nuclear reactor at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology and blame it on Russian missiles. The ministry said Ukraine would then accuse the Kremlin of ""creating an ecological catastrophe."" There was no initial reaction form Kyiv to Moscow's assertion. Russia controls two nuclear power plants in Ukraine, including Europe's largest, the Zaporizhzhya plant in Enerhoda, which Ukrainian staffers continue to operate. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Sunday that Russia has shut down some external communication to the plant. It was taken over Friday by Russian forces after shelling led to a fire at one of the training buildings. Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, told ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that the international community should step in and help Ukraine regain control of the nuclear sites from Russia. Markarova noted that the first nuclear plant the Russians seized was the infamous one at Chernobyl, which is ""not operational"" but still poses a risk because ""there is a lot of waste there and everything else."" Monday's ceasefire announcement follows two failed attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, from which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimated 200,000 people were trying to flee. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for the failure. The Russian task force said Monday's ceasefire and the opening of the corridors was announced at the request of French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday. Evacuation routes published by Russia's RIA Novosti news agency, citing the Defense Ministry, show that civilians will be able to leave to Russia and Belarus. Russian forces will be observing the ceasefire with drones, the task force said. The earlier breakdown of evacuations came as Ukraine officials said that Russian shelling intensified across the country. ""Instead of humanitarian corridors, they can only make bloody ones,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday. ""Today a family was killed in Irpin. Man, woman and two children. Right on the road. As in a shooting gallery."" Putin said Moscow's attacks could be halted ""only if Kyiv ceases hostilities."" As he has often done, Putin blamed Ukraine for the war, telling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday that Kyiv needed to stop all hostilities and fulfill ""the well-known demands of Russia."" Putin launched his invasion with a string of false accusations against Kyiv, including that it is led by neo-Nazis intent on undermining Russia with the development of nuclear weapons. As Russian attacks worsened, a brief reprieve from fighting in Mariupol collapsed. Heavy artillery hit residential areas in other large cities, local officials reported. ""There can be no 'green corridors' because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom,"" Ukraine Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram. On what is known as Forgiveness Sunday in Orthodox Christianity, Zelensky said Ukraine will never forgive the shelling of its homes, the killing of unarmed people and the destruction of its infrastructure. ""And God will not forgive, either today or tomorrow - never. And instead of a day of forgiveness, there will be a judgment day. Of this I am sure,"" he said in a video address. The death toll remains unclear. The U.N. says it has confirmed just a few hundred civilian deaths but also warned that the number is a vast undercount. Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich described a ""catastrophic"" situation in the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, where efforts to evacuate residents on Sunday failed. About eight civilians, including a family, were killed by Russian shelling in Irpin, according to Mayor Oleksander Markyshin. Video footage showed a shell slamming into a city street, not far from a bridge used by people fleeing the fighting. A group of fighters could be seen trying to help the family. Arestovich said the government was doing all it could to resume evacuations. ""This is likely to represent an effort to break Ukrainian morale,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said of Russian tactics. Fighting has caused 1.5 million people to flee the country, which the head of the U.N. refugee agency called ""the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II."" British military officials compared Russia's tactics to those Moscow used in Chechnya and Syria, where surrounded cities were pulverized by airstrikes and artillery. Food, water, medicine and almost all other supplies were in desperately short supply in Mariupol, where Russian and Ukrainian forces had agreed to an 11-hour cease-fire that would allow civilians and the wounded to be evacuated. But Russian attacks quickly closed the humanitarian corridor, Ukrainian officials said. The handful of residents who managed to flee the city before the humanitarian corridor closed said the city of 430,000 had been devastated. ""We saw everything: houses burning, all the people sitting in basements,"" said Yelena Zamay, who fled to one of the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists. ""No communication, no water, no gas, no light, no water. There was nothing."" Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Azov. Capturing Mariupol could enable Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that most other countries considered illegal. But much of the Russian advance has become stalled, including an immense military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv. A senior U.S. defense official said Sunday that the U.S. assesses that about 95% of the Russian forces that had been arrayed around Ukraine are now inside the country. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said Russian forces continue to advance in an attempt to isolate Kyiv, Kharkhiv and Chernihiv, but are being met with strong Ukrainian resistance. Ukraine's professional and volunteer fighters have fought with great tenacity, though they are greatly outmatched by the Russian army. Volunteers lined up Saturday in Kyiv to join the military. Ukraine is also planning to fill an international legion with 20,000 volunteers from dozens of countries, though it was not clear how many were in Ukraine. ""The whole world today is on Ukraine's side, not only in words but in deeds,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Ukrainian television Sunday night. The West has broadly backed Ukraine, offering aid and weapon shipments and slapping Russia with vast sanctions. But no NATO troops have been sent to Ukraine. Zelensky has also heaped criticism on Western leaders for not responding with more force to Russia. He reiterated a request for foreign protectors to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which NATO so far has ruled out because of concerns such an action would lead to a far wider war. Zelensky also asked the United States and NATO countries to send more warplanes to Ukraine. But that idea is complicated by questions about how to provide aircraft to Ukrainian pilots. He later urged the West to tighten its sanctions on Russia, saying that ""the audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal"" that existing sanctions are not enough. Russia has become increasingly isolated in the days since the invasion began, closing itself off to outside sources of information as sanctions bite deeply into its economy. The ruble has plunged in value, and dozens of multinational companies ended or dramatically scaled back their work in the country. On Sunday, American Express announced it would suspend operations in Russia, as well as in Russian-allied Belarus. Also, two of the so-called Big Four accounting firms, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, said Sunday they would end their relationships with their Russia-based member firms. TikTok announced Sunday Russian users would not be able to post new videos or see videos shared from elsewhere in the world. The company blamed Moscow's new ""fake news"" law, which makes it illegal, among other things, to describe the fighting as an invasion. Netflix also cut its service to Russia but provided no details. Facebook and Twitter have already been blocked in Russia, along with access to the websites of a number of major international media outlets. TikTok is part of the Chinese tech company ByteDance. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress is exploring how to further isolate Russia from the global economy, including banning the import of its oil and energy products into the United States. Pelosi said in a letter to Democrats released late Sunday that the legislation under consideration would also repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus and begin the process of denying Russia access to the World Trade Organization.",17,5.1690134814106505,0.3278075194042837,4.8412059620063665,17

""There can be no 'green corridors' because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom,"" Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram. The news dashed hopes that more people could escape the fighting in Ukraine, where Russia's plan to quickly overrun the country has been stymied by fierce resistance. Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine and along the coast, but many of its efforts have become stalled, including an immense military convoy that has been almost motionless for days north of Kyiv. The war, now in its 11th day, has caused 1.5 million people to flee the country. The head of the U.N. refugee agency called the exodus ""the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II."" As he has often done, Russian President Vladimir Putin turned blame for the fighting back on Ukraine, telling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday that the invasion could be halted only ""only if Kyiv ceases hostilities,"" according to a Kremlin statement on the phone call. He said Ukraine had to fulfill ""the well-known demands of Russia,"" which include what he calls the ""demilitarization"" and ""denazification"" of Ukraine. The presidents of Turkey and France, as well as Pope Francis, appealed to Putin to negotiate. In a highly unusual move, the pope said he had dispatched two cardinals to Ukraine, saying the Vatican would do everything it could to end the conflict. ""In Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing,"" the pontiff said in his traditional Sunday blessing. ""This is not just a military operation, but a war that sows death, destruction and misery."" After the cease-fire in Mariupol failed to hold Saturday, Russian forces intensified their shelling of the city and dropped massive bombs on residential areas of Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said. British military officials compared Russia's tactics to those Moscow used in Chechnya and Syria, where surrounded cities were pulverized by airstrikes and artillery. ""This is likely to represent an effort to break Ukrainian morale,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated a request for foreign protectors to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Putin warned Saturday that Moscow would consider a third-party declaration to close Ukrainian airspace to be a hostile act, and the West so far has rebuffed Zelensky's pleas, fearing a confrontation with Russia. ""The world is strong enough to close our skies,"" Zelensky said in a video address on Sunday. Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelensky, said Ukrainian officials and international humanitarian organizations were working with Russia through intermediaries to establish humanitarian corridors from Bucha and Hostomel, which are Kyiv suburbs where there has been heavy fighting. As Russian forces surrounded several Ukrainian cities, Zelensky appeared on television Saturday night and rallied his people to stay defiant. ""Ukrainians in all of our cities that the enemy has entered — go on the offensive!"" said Zelensky, who was wearing his habitual military green T-shirt. ""You should take to the streets! You should fight! … It is necessary to go out and drive this evil out of our cities, from our land."" The strength of Ukrainian resistance continues to surprise Russian forces, and they have responded by targeting populated areas, including the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in its daily intelligence briefing. The death toll is difficult to measure. The U.N. human rights office said at least 351 civilians have been confirmed killed, but the true number is probably much higher. Ukraine's military is vastly outmatched by Russia's, but its professional and volunteer forces have fought back with fierce tenacity. In Kyiv, volunteers lined up Saturday to join the military. Even in cities that have fallen, there were signs of the resistance Zelensky requested. Onlookers in Chernihiv cheered as they watched a Russian military plane fall from the sky and crash, according to video released by the Ukrainian government. In Kherson, hundreds of protesters waved blue and yellow Ukrainian flags and shouted, ""Go home."" But the struggle to enforce temporary ceasefires in Mariupol and Volnovakha on Saturday showed the fragility of efforts to stop the fighting across Ukraine. A third round of talks between Russia and Ukraine will take place Monday, according to Davyd Arakhamia, a member of the Ukrainian delegation. He gave no additional details, including where they would take place. Previous meetings were held in Belarus. Those talks led to the cease-fire agreement that failed Saturday and was revived Sunday. Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Avrov. Capturing Mariupol could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that most other countries considered illegal. Meanwhile, the head of the Chernihiv region said Russia has dropped powerful bombs on residential areas of the city of the same name, which has a population of 290,000. Vyacheslav Chaus posted a photo online of what he said was an undetonated FAB-500, a 1,100-pound bomb. ""Usually this weapon is used against military-industrial facilities and fortified structures,"" Chaus said. Zelensky sought to rally support from U.S. lawmakers on Saturday, speaking to more than 300 members of Congress via a video link. He pleaded for additional help, specifically fighter planes to help secure the skies over Ukraine, even as he insisted Russia was being defeated. Russian troops were advancing on a third nuclear power plant, Zelensky said. They have already taken control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in Ukraine, as well as Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. President Biden called Zelensky early Sunday, Kyiv time, to discuss Russia sanctions and speeding U.S. assistance to Ukraine. The White House said the conversation also covered talks between Russia and Ukraine but did not give details. Blinken on Sunday was in Moldova, where he pledged support for the western-leaning former Soviet republic that is coping with an influx of refugees and warily watching Russia's moves in Ukraine.",17,0.4625270579896302,0.16753669735981133,0.29499036062981887,4

Food, water, medicine and almost all other supplies were in desperately short supply in the port city of Mariupol, where Russian and Ukrainian forces had agreed to an 11-hour cease-fire that would allow civilians and the wounded to be evacuated.

Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy rallied his people to remain defiant, especially those in cities occupied by Russians. ""You should take to the streets! You should fight!"" he said Saturday on Ukrainian television. ""It is necessary to go out and drive this evil out of our cities, from our land."" Zelenskyy also asked the United States and NATO countries to send more warplanes to Ukraine, though that idea is complicated by questions about which countries would provide the aircraft and how those countries would replace the planes. He later urged the West to tighten its sanctions on Russia, saying that ""the audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal"" that existing sanctions are not enough. The war, now in its 11th day, has caused 1.5 million people to flee the country. The head of the U.N. refugee agency called the exodus ""the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II."" As he has often done, Putin blamed Ukraine for the war, telling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday that Kyiv needed to stop all hostilities and fulfill ""the well-known demands of Russia."" Putin launched his invasion with a string of false accusations against Kyiv, including that it is led by neo-Nazis intent on undermining Russia with the development of nuclear weapons. The Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday announced that its forces intend to strike Ukraine's military-industrial complex with what it said were precision weapons. A ministry spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, claimed in a statement carried by the state news agency Tass that Ukrainian personnel were being forced to repair damaged military equipment so that it could be sent back into action. Zelenskyy criticized Western leaders for not responding to Russia's latest threat. ""I didn't hear even a single world leader react to this,"" Zelenskyy said Sunday evening. ""The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the West that the sanctions imposed on Russia are not sufficient."" Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke about the nuclear situation in Ukraine, which has 15 nuclear reactors at four power plants and was the scene of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The men agreed in principle to a ""dialogue"" involving Russia, Ukraine and the U.N.'s atomic watchdog, according to a French official who spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with the presidency's practices. Potential talks on the issue are to be organized in the coming days, he said. Putin also blamed the fire last week at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which Ukrainian officials said was caused by Russian attackers, on a ""provocation organized by Ukrainian radicals."" ""Attempts to shift responsibility for this incident onto the Russian military are part of a cynical propaganda campaign,"" he said, according to the French official. International leaders, as well as Pope Francis, appealed to Putin to negotiate. In a highly unusual move, the pope said he had dispatched two cardinals to Ukraine to try to end the conflict. ""In Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing,"" the pontiff said in his traditional Sunday blessing. After the cease-fire in Mariupol failed to hold Saturday, Russian forces intensified their shelling of the city and dropped massive bombs on residential areas of Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said. About eight civilians were killed by Russian shelling in the town of Irpin, on the northwest outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mayor Oleksander Markyshin. The dead included a family. Video footage showed a shell slamming into a city street, not far from a bridge used by people fleeing the fighting. A group of fighters could be seen trying to help the family. The handful of residents who managed to flee Mariupol before the humanitarian corridor closed said the city of 430,000 had been devastated. ""We saw everything: houses burning, all the people sitting in basements,"" said Yelena Zamay, who fled to one of the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists. ""No communication, no water, no gas, no light, no water. There was nothing."" British military officials compared Russia's tactics to those Moscow used in Chechnya and Syria, where surrounded cities were pulverized by airstrikes and artillery. ""This is likely to represent an effort to break Ukrainian morale,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said. Zelenskyy reiterated a request for foreign protectors to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which NATO so far has ruled out because of concerns such an action would lead to a far wider war. ""The world is strong enough to close our skies,"" Zelenskyy said Sunday in a video address. The day before, Zelenskyy pleaded with American lawmakers in a video call to help get more warplanes to Ukraine. U.S. officials say Washington is discussing ways to get the planes to Ukraine in a complex scenario that would include sending American-made F-16s to former Soviet bloc nations, particularly Poland, that are now members of NATO. Those countries would then send Ukraine their own Soviet-era MiGs, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly. But because of production backlogs on the U.S. warplanes, the Eastern European nations would essentially have to give their MiGs to the Ukrainians and accept U.S. promises that they would get F-16s as soon as that was possible. Adding to the difficulties is the fact that the next shipment of F-16s is destined for Taiwan, and the U.S. Congress would be reluctant to delay those deliveries. The Russian military has warned Ukraine's neighbors against hosting its warplanes, saying that Moscow may consider those counties part of the conflict if Ukrainian aircraft fly combat missions from their territory. The death toll remains lost in the fog of war. The U.N. says it has confirmed just a few hundred civilian deaths but also warned that the number is a vast undercount. Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said Ukrainian officials and international humanitarian organizations were working with Russia through intermediaries to establish humanitarian corridors from Bucha and Hostomel, which are Kyiv suburbs where there has been heavy fighting. Ukraine's military is greatly outmatched by Russia's, but its professional and volunteer forces have fought back with fierce tenacity. In Kyiv, volunteers lined up Saturday to join the military. Even in cities that have fallen, there were signs of resistance. Onlookers in Chernihiv cheered as they watched a Russian military plane fall from the sky and crash, according to video released by the Ukrainian government. In Kherson, hundreds of protesters waved blue and yellow Ukrainian flags and shouted, ""Go home."" Russia has made significant advances in southern Ukraine as it seeks to block access to the Sea of Azov. Capturing Mariupol could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that most other countries considered illegal. The West has broadly backed Ukraine, offering aid and weapon shipments and slapping Russia with vast sanctions. But no NATO troops have been sent to Ukraine, leaving Ukrainians to fight Russian troops alone. Russia has become increasingly isolated in the days since the invasion began, closing itself off to outside sources of information as sanctions bite deeply into its economy. The ruble has plunged in value, and dozens of multinational companies ended or dramatically scaled back their work in the country. On Sunday, American Express announced it would suspend operations in Russia, as well as in Russian-allied Belarus. A few hours later, TikTok said Russian users would not be able to post new videos or see videos shared from elsewhere in the world. The company blamed Moscow's new ""fake news"" law, which makes it illegal, among other things, to describe the fighting as an invasion. Netflix also cut its service to Russia but provided no details. Facebook and Twitter have already been blocked in Russia, along with access to the websites of a number of major international media outlets. TikTok is part of the Chinese tech company ByteDance.

Meanwhile, Russian media outlet RIA Novosti carried a claim from Russia's defense ministry that the firing was against Russian positions. Later on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Ukrainian statehood is in jeopardy. And he likened the West imposing sanctions against Russia to ""declaring war.""

He also said if any third-party issued a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a measure Zelensky has asked for, Moscow would consider it ""participation in the armed conflict."" NATO had decided against a no-fly zone on Friday, lest it risk a direct altercation with Russia. In a Zoom call with U.S. lawmakers Saturday, Zelensky made an impassioned plea for help, calling for military planes and support, and an embargo on Russian oil.

2022-03-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-bearing-down-on-second-week/,Russian Invasion Of Ukraine Bearing Down On Second Week,"LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - The Russian Invasion of Ukraine is bearing down on its second week as fighting rages across the country, destroying cities, neighborhoods and claiming lives in the process. Chilling new video has emerged from inside the control room of Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine while it was under attack from the Russian military. Over the public address system, workers frantically called out, ""Stop shooting immediately. You threaten the security of the whole world."" Outside, a fire raged, and video of the aftermath showed the damage, including what looked like shell casings. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack ""terror on an unprecedented level,"" and added that Russian tanks knew what they were firing at and directly aimed at the station. U.S. officials said that the world only narrowly avoided a nuclear catastrophe. Late Friday night, a massive explosion came in Chernihiv, which is north of the capital city of Kyiv. Many residential areas have been also been leveled after days of Russian shelling. In the southern port city of Mariupol, paramedics scrambled to save the lives of civilian victims caught up in the days of heavy fighting. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, accused Russian military of using banned weapons. ""We have seen the use of cluster bombs, which would be in violation of international law,"" Stoltenberg said. Aid groups from Southern California are also on the ground in Ukraine trying to help. Margaret Traub is with International Medical Corps, which is based in LA. ""The situation inside Ukraine is incredibly dire,"" she said. Traub's organization has a team of medical professionals, like doctors, nurses and psychiatrists, doing what they can to help in the war torn country. ""I think the random, indiscriminate bombings that people are seeing, where our own staff in Ukraine -- we had about 30 staff in Ukraine before the hostilities broke out -- and so these are people who are Ukrainian. These are people who are doing this work, but also have their own families to worry about and they are on the move and it's hard for us to be in touch with them. Communications are down, and so it's really frightening for them,"" she said of the situation. In Russia, Vladimir Putin is trying to hide the atrocities committed by the Russian military. The free media inside Russia has been mostly shut down. Facebook, Twitter and networks like CBS, CNN and the BBC have all stopped broadcasting. Putin's government is threatening to jail journalists who report on what Putin calls ""fake"" news about the invasion. In other words, journalists will be punished for telling the truth. Burbank Congressman and Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff weighed on Putin's effort to spread misinformation. ""Putin is pushing out this lie that there's a genocide against Ukrainians by Ukrainians. It's absurd, and I think it shows why Putin is trying to shut down independent journalism in Russia. He doesn't want his people to learn the truth, but I think they are learning truth and they're certainly going to feel the economic impacts of Putin's folly."" The Russian military is even targeting journalists in Ukraine. A Sky News crew was ambushed outside of Kyiv, with dozen of bullets tearing through their vehicle and hitting the network's correspondent, though he survived.",17,3.283785988449049,3.050989913539314,0.23279607490973486,17

On Saturday, the rally was held at Bayfront Park. The demonstrators were holding signs, carrying Ukrainian flags as they chanted against the war. Local elected officials were also at the rally, including Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and Miami Commissioner Joe Carollo. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Russian forces had intensified their shelling in the port city of Mariupol. ""The city is in a very, very difficult state of siege,"" Vadym Boychenko, mayor of the city of Mariupol in Donetsk, told Ukrainian TV. ""Relentless shelling of residential blocks is ongoing, airplanes have been dropping bombs on residential areas."" Boychenko said that thousands of children, women and the elderly came under fire as they arrived in the morning for a possible evacuation through a safe passage corridor. Russia promised to stop the shelling of Mariupol, a port city of 430,000, and Volnovakha, a city in the east, but violated the cease-fire. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyyhas made a ""desperate"" plea to American lawmakers for the US to help get more warplanes to his military and cut off Russian oil imports as Kyiv tries to stave off the Russian invasion. Zelenskyy spoke with some 300 members of Congress and their staffs in an hour-long private video call on Saturday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said afterward that Zelenskyy wants the U.S. to facilitate the transfer of planes from Eastern European allies so Ukraine's military can protect its skies from Russian attack. Since the start of the invasion, 1.45 million people have fled the battered country, according to the U.N.-affiliated Organization for Migration in Geneva. The United Nations has predicted that the total number of refugees could swell to 4 million, to become the biggest such crisis this century. The U.N. Security Council will hold a meeting Monday afternoon on the escalating humanitarian needs that have arisen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. (© Copyright 2022 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Please follow the latest Russia-Ukraine developments here. he war in Ukraine entered a new phase Friday when Russian troops seized Europe's largest nuclear power plant after a fire in a nearby training building was extinguished. Both sides agreed Russian forces control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine, but both blamed the other for the fire. Ukrainian authorities said Russian shelling sparked the blaze. At first they said Russian forces were keeping firefighters from reaching the flames but later said the Russians had relented. According to the Reuters news service, the Kremlin blamed Ukrainian saboteurs and called the fire a ""monstrous provocation."" No increases in radiation levels were detected and plant personnel were monitoring its operations, Ukrainian officials said. Russia's defense ministry said the plant was operating normally. In a video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of using ""nuclear terror."" ""No country has ever shot at nuclear blocks except for Russia,"" Zelensky said. ""First time ever. For the first time ever in our history, in the history of human kind, the terrorist country has reverted to nuclear terror."" During earlier televised comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin said operations in Ukraine were going according to plan despite international criticism over the targeting of highly populated residential areas. A senior U.S. defense official said more than 90% of the combat power Russia built up along Ukraine's borders ahead of its invasion is now committed inside Ukraine. Also on Thursday, Russia claimed it had taken its first major city, Kherson, and that the country's forces also surrounded the vital port city of Mariupol, as heavy strikes continued to target Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv as well as an area just outside the capital, Kyiv. In the northern city of Chernihiv, missiles slammed into residential neighborhoods, killing at least 33 people, according to emergency services. ""The use of weapons with wide-area effects in populated urban areas risks being inherently indiscriminate,"" U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said.

2022-03-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cyber-reporting-bill-cisa-white-house-support/,White House backs bill requiring mandatory cyber reporting to CISA amid Ukraine crisis,"The White House has come out in full support of a bill requiring hospitals, power plants, water utilities, airports and other critical infrastructure to report cyber attacks to the Department of Homeland Security within 72 hours. The move comes amid the escalating war in Ukraine and concerns of possible Russian cyber threats to the U.S. In a statement confirming the White House's support, a spokesperson said the legislation is ""a part of the Administration's comprehensive effort to modernizing America's cyber defenses and complements the President's efforts to improve cybersecurity."" The White House underscored that the bill will ""ensure the Federal government rapidly receives information about cyber incidents affecting critical infrastructure which provide the essential services on which Americans rely,"" enabling the government to ""better investigate, mitigate, and further prevent cyber-attacks."" Yet in their statement, the White House left the door open to future changes, indicating it ""remains committed to working with the House, and exploring all options, to ensure that the legislation enables all relevant Federal agencies to receive and process these incident reports as quickly as possible to carry out their cybersecurity missions."" The statement came after top Justice Department officials claimed that failing to include the FBI in a bill requiring infrastructure companies to tell the government when they are hacked makes the country less safe, clashing with decisions made by Democrat-led committees. That criticism has taken lawmakers and congressional staffers by surprise, after the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee worked alongside the FBI and Department of Justice in crafting cyber incident reporting legislation for months, according to Senate committee aides. The bill passed with rare unanimous support in the Senate on Tuesday, just 24 hours after the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas urged lawmakers to act fast amid an escalating Ukraine-Russia crisis, as cyber threats loom over the U.S. homeland. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the bill ""as drafted leaves one of our best tools, the FBI, on the sidelines and makes us less safe at a time when we face unprecedented threats,"" and added the bill could be a ""game changer"" with the right changes. ""I applaud the momentum we're seeing toward mandatory breach reporting, but the current, well-intentioned bill has some serious flaws,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. ""In its current form, it would make the public less safe from cyber threats – slowing aid to victims, hampering identification of other companies the same attackers are targeting, and undercutting disruption operations against cyber threats."" Politico was the first to report on the Department of Justice and FBI's criticism of the bill. Congress has been working on the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act for the better part of a year. Senate aides made more than a dozen changes to address the concerns of the FBI and DOJ in recent weeks. After FBI officials first objected to an earlier iteration of the bill in November, lawmakers added language that requires the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to share incident reports with other agencies ""as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours"" after receiving them. Legislators also added a subsection to the bill granting the president – or a designee, such as the National Cyber Director – the power to set a deadline shorter than 24 hours. According to a Senate aide, that loophole could allow the FBI to receive contemporaneous access to all reports received by CISA, if greenlit by the White House. In response to a request by the FBI and DOJ, committee members also mandated consultation with the agencies during the rulemaking process. Despite the concessions, the committee received a second round of DOJ and FBI requested changes on Wednesday, following passage of the bill on Tuesday. ""This is the direction Congress wants to go,"" a Senate committee aide told CBS News. ""These guys are undermining national security over a bureaucratic turf war,"" the aide added, in reference to the FBI and DOJ. The FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department all see the legislation as critical in fighting back against cyber attacks. The DOJ and FBI want changes to ensure both DHS and the FBI are notified, not just DHS. The agencies also want to give businesses protection from their records being discovered through the Freedom of Information Act, which allows members of the public to request records. U.S. officials advocating for the changes proposed by the DOJ and FBI, tell CBS News they view them as relatively minor. But at public hearings and behind closed doors, critical infrastructure operators and lawmakers alike have expressed confusion over where incidents should be reported in the case of a major cyber breach. Notably, in May 2021, acting Director of CISA, Brandon Wales, told Senator Rob Portman of Ohio during a public hearing that CISA was notified of the Colonial Pipeline breach only after the FBI brought them into the investigation. Tuesday's passage of the cyber incident reporting bill by the Senate marks a long awaited victory following several setbacks and is championed by Homeland Security Committee Chair Gary Peters of Michigan and Portman. On Monday night, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appeared before lawmakers at the classified all-Senators briefing on the ongoing Ukraine-Russia crisis. Pressed about what Congress could do to support the federal government's ongoing efforts to safeguard the homeland, Mayorkas urged senators to pass the cyber incident reporting bill, as businesses and organizations ready themselves for the possibility of Russian cyber aggression or retaliation. The Department of Justice and FBI's statements came as a shock to lawmakers and congressional aides following months of deliberations and amid a heightened cyber threat environment. ""The suggestion that passing the first requirement to report cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure would make us less safe is completely false,"" said Jay Bhargava, a spokesperson for Chairman Peters in a statement to reporters. ""The requirement created in this bill will – for the first time ever – ensure that the federal government is getting timely information about substantial cyber-attacks so that they can take swift action to mitigate the damage and prevent ripple effects that threaten our national and economic security. ""The FBI and DOJ were consulted for months, changes were made to the bill to address their concerns – and 100 Senators came together and passed this bill unanimously to move forward with the most significant update to American cybersecurity defenses in our nation's history,"" Bhargava added. Kylie Nolan, a spokesperson for Portman, told CBS News the bill ""reflects changes from DOJ and FBI as well as many others to obtain the broad support it currently enjoys across government and the private sector."" Nolan called protests issued by the Justice Department and FBI ""shameful,"" noting they ""are out of sync with the rest of the country including, it seems, the Biden administration that they work for."" The FBI and Justice Department had expressed their discontent with the cyber reporting mandate to CISA before the Oversight Committee. In November, Bryan Vorndran, head of the FBI's Cyber Division said the agency was ""troubled"" that cyber incident reporting legislation ""does not explicitly account for the essential role that federal law enforcement, and notably the Department of Justice and the FBI, plays in receiving cyber incident reporting and actioning the information to assist victims and impose risk and consequences on cybercriminals."" Despite the ongoing debate, the bill is likely to be greenlit by the House and pass into law. A spokesperson for House Homeland Security Committee chair Bennie Thompson told CBS News in a statement, ""We take issue with how the DOJ and FBI are characterizing the bipartisan, bicameral agreement on cyber incident reporting."" ""The legislation would ensure that the federal government has timely access to information regarding cyber incidents to help identify malicious cyber campaigns early and enhance situational awareness within the government and private sector in a way that protects privacy, civil rights, or civil liberties,"" the spokesperson added. Congressman Andrew Garbarino, ranking member of the House homeland cybersecurity, infrastructure protection and innovation subcommittee, said that pending legislation to address cyber incident reporting ""has been in the works for close to a year with many opportunities to field concerns from public and private sector stakeholders."" ""As the lead federal civilian cybersecurity agency, CISA is best equipped to collect incident reporting data and share with the appropriate federal partners in a manner that will prevent cascading impacts across all 16 U.S. critical infrastructure sectors,"" he added. ""I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill across the finish line as soon as possible. We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines as the cyber threat landscape grows increasingly complex with threats from Russia and other foreign adversaries."" DHS' under secretary for policy Rob Silvers has repeatedly called cyber incident reporting the Biden administration's ""top legislative priority in cybersecurity for 2022.""",3,6.0859557940529205,5.154572777026586,0.9313830170263344,1

2022-03-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-mother-flees-russia-invasion-2nd-time/,Mother who fled Donbas in 2014 travels over 600 miles to shelter kids from a 2nd Russian invasion,"More than 1 million Ukrainians have fled their homes to seek shelter in other countries from Russia's punishing airstrikes and ground invasion. Tens of thousands more have been displaced but remain inside Ukraine, including one mother and her three children who finally reached safety in the city of Lviv — more than 600 miles west of their home. Kateryna Stoyanova traveled to Lviv from Zaporizhzhia, where she said the Russian army was fast approaching. When they got ""really close,"" she said, they got on a train and left. ""The air raid sirens were permanently on and people were told to go to shelters,"" she told Reuters. ""For a few days me and my kids kept on going down to the shelters — I do not know how many times."" But making the decision to leave wasn't easy as many in Zaporizhzhia had decided to stay behind. ""Some people stay, wait for this to end,"" Stoyanova said. But she felt she couldn't risk it with her children. ""It has been going for eight years and I have no idea how long it will last,"" she said of the war that simmered in Ukraine's Donbas region after Putin's last invasion in 2014, before it erupted into a full-scale conflict with his latest assault a week ago. ""One would like it to end, but there is simply no end to it."" Women and children from all over the country have gathered in makeshift shelters in Lviv. Yana Balytska traveled there from Vyshneve, near the capital Kyiv. Russian forces are poised between 20 and 40 miles north of Kyiv, and the U.S. has warned they could move to surround it within a week, but like many of the country's major cities, it has already suffered major damage from shelling. ""We left because of the shooting. They were not shooting in our town, but Kyiv was under fire and areas nearby,"" Balytska told Reuters. ""Yesterday we were standing on a platform waiting for the commuter train and literally over my head, flew the missile that hit the TV tower."" The United Nations human rights office says at least 227 civilians have been killed since Putin launched the attack last on February 24. Ukrainian officials put the toll at more than 2,000, including 21 children. For Stoyanova, having to evacuate her home was familiar. Prior to living in Zaporizhzhia, they lived in Donbas. When Russian troops invaded the eastern Ukraine area in 2014 and war broke out, they had to leave. ""I have been through this before, but experiencing it for the second time, it was an equally huge shock,"" she said. ""You start living in peace and then the same happens again.""",17,2.4092713323110364,7.203488512385271,-4.794217180074234,20
2022-03-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-severs-ties-with-u-s-european-space-projects-iss-operating-normally-for-now/,Russia severs ties with U.S. and European space projects; ISS operating normally for now,"SpaceX put another 47 Starlink internet satellites into orbit Thursday while competitor OneWeb, which relies on Russian Soyuz rockets for the ride to space, announced it is suspending launches in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The move comes amid escalating tension between the Russian space program and the West as the nation that put the first satellite and the first human in orbit severs commercial ties, threatening the cooperation that makes the International Space Station and other commercial ventures possible. While the space station continues to operate in near-normal fashion for now, the Russians have terminated commercial Soyuz launch operations at the European Space Agency's launch site in Kourou, French Guiana, and cut-off sales and support for Russian rocket engines used in U.S. rockets. ""In a situation like this we can't supply the United States with our world's best rocket engines,"" Reuters quoted Dmitri Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, as saying. ""Let them fly on something else, their broomsticks, I don't know what."" SpaceX founder Elon Musk posted that quote on Twitter under the title ""American Broomstick,"" reminding Rogozin that SpaceX has the capability to launch equipment and astronauts to the station from U.S. soil aboard American rockets. Against that backdrop, OneWeb, an international consortium partially owned by the British government, had planned to launch another batch of its internet satellites Friday atop a Russian Soyuz 2.1a booster that was hauled to the pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan earlier this week. But Rogozin threatened to cancel the launch, OneWeb's 14th atop a Soyuz, if the company did not guarantee its system would not be used for any military purposes and if the U.K. did not sell its stake in the project. ""The British authorities must withdraw from the shareholders of OneWeb to launch satellites,"" Rogozin tweeted. ""Otherwise, there will be no launches."" On Thursday, OneWeb said in a one-sentence statement: ""The Board of OneWeb has voted to suspend all launches from Baikonur."" Company personnel have been told to leave Baikonur and to return to their homes. It's not yet clear what will happen to the 36 OneWeb satellites still aboard the Soyuz rocket or what boosters might be used for future launches if the conflict isn't resolved. But the cancellation of Soyuz flights, if it remains in force, would mark a major setback for a company that reorganized in the wake of bankruptcy, attracting major investments from the United Kingdom. Along with threatening OneWeb, Rogozin and Roscosmos have ended commercial Soyuz launch operations at the ESA-Arianespace launch site in Kourou a week after suggesting the Europeans consider launching piloted Soyuz missions from there. ""After the cancellation of Soyuz launches, the European Space Agency can launch European satellites on its rockets... when they have them,"" Rogozin tweeted. The Russians also have announced they will no longer service the RD-180 engines powering United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rockets and will not sell any more RD-181 engines for use in Northrop Grumman's Antares space station cargo rocket. The Antares first stage is built in Ukraine while the engines are built in Russia. Company officials said the hardware for the final two flights in Northrop Grumman's current contract with NASA are already in the United States and those flights are expected to proceed as planned. Beyond that, Northrop Grumman may be forced to find another launch provider. The company has not yet commented. United Launch Alliance has already taken delivery of the two dozen RD-180s needed to carry out all remaining Atlas 5 flights as the company transitions to a new, all-U.S. rocket called the Vulcan. While Russian technical support would have been appreciated, ULA CEO Tory Bruno says, it's not required. But the Atlas 5 eventually will be used to launch NASA astronauts aboard Boeing Starliner capsules ""without the supervision of our specialists,"" Rogozin tweeted. ""Well, let's pray for our American friends!"" Despite Rogozin's rhetoric, joint U.S.-Russian operations continue aboard the International Space Station. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and the agency's senior managers have kept a deliberately low profile and have not publicly responded to the Russian director-general. They've said only that both sides are working to maintain safe operations in space. But relations are clearly at risk. On Wednesday, Rogozin said Roscosmos will ""closely monitor the actions of our American partners and, if they continue to be hostile, we will return to the question of the existence of the International Space Station."" Former shuttle flight director and program manager Wayne Hale told the NASA Advisory Council on Tuesday the U.S. agency should consider ""assembling a tiger team to prepare contingency plans"" for ISS operations given the escalating tensions. ""It just seems prudent,"" he said. ""Hopefully, it doesn't come to pass, but we've always prepared for contingencies if they were serious enough."" If they chose not to maintain the status quo, the Russians could, in theory, detach their modules from the station and chart their own course, leaving NASA to come up with the propulsion needed to keep its section of the outpost in orbit and to safely bring it down at the end of its life. Less drastic, the Russians could attempt independent operations while still attached to the U.S. segment. Or they could simply abandon the outpost, forcing NASA to either follow suit or quickly develop supplemental propulsion. In the near term, three Russian cosmonauts are scheduled for launch to the station aboard the Soyuz MS-21/67S ferry ship on March 18, docking at the newly attached Prichal multi-port module. On March 30, another Soyuz, MS-19/65S, is expected to return to Earth, bringing two cosmonauts and NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei back to Earth. Vande Hei and crewmate Pyotr Dubrov, launched on April 9, 2021, aboard a different Soyuz, will wrap up a 355-day stay in space, a new single-flight record for a NASA astronaut. The same day Vande Hei's crew comes down, a SpaceX Crew Dragon is scheduled for launch to carry four private citizens to the space station for a 10-day commercial visit, coming home on April 9. Another Crew Dragon is set for launch six days after that, on April 15, to carry four fresh long-duration crew members to the lab. The crew they will replace plans to return to Earth on April 26. How that sequence of flights might be affected by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine is not yet known. Regardless of the rhetoric, the space station requires both space super powers to operate. The International Space Station was first proposed by President Ronald Reagan in his 1984 State of the Union address. In the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, Russia joined the station project under the Clinton administration, helping design and build the largest structure ever assembled in space. One former NASA manager, speaking after the Ukraine invasion began, called it ""a deal made with the devil, with the best intentions,"" but there is little argument the venture has been remarkably successful to this point with astronauts and cosmonauts living aboard the complex continuously since November 2000. One hundred and seven piloted station missions have been launched to date, including 66 Russian Soyuz crew rotation flights, 37 space shuttle assembly missions, four SpaceX Crew Dragon astronaut ferry flights, 80 unpiloted Russian Progress cargo flights and 55 U.S., European and Japanese supply ships. The station features 16 pressurized modules, including seven provided by NASA, one by ESA and two from the Japanese space agency. The Russian segment is made up of the Zarya and Zvezda modules, two docking compartments, a newly arrived lab module and the Prichal docking port. NASA astronauts, cosmonauts and partner astronauts have carried out 246 spacewalks to date to build and maintain the outpost, logging 65 days working in the vacuum of space. The lab now stretches 167 feet from the forward Harmony module to Russia's aft Zvezda module and 357 feet across its NASA-supplied solar power truss. With a mass of nearly a million pounds, the station provides the pressurized volume of a 747 jumbo jet. It is the largest structure ever assembled in space. Russia provides the propellant and thrusters needed to keep the station in orbit and to eventually guide the huge lab back into the atmosphere for a safe, targeted re-entry and breakup at the end of its life. The United States provides the powerful gyro devices used to maintain the lab's orientation and supplies the lion's share of the station's electrical power. A Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship launched February 19 is the first U.S. craft since the now-retired shuttle that is capable of raising the station's altitude. SpaceX Dragon capsules presumably could provide reboost capability as well, although additional launches of both spacecraft, at additional cost, would be required to make that happen. And it's not known how long it might take to implement any such plans. In the meantime, Russian cosmonauts are not trained to operate U.S. systems and NASA astronauts cannot operate Russia's. The space station is, in the end, a truly international project that requires both superpowers, working together, to function in its current form. ""It would be very difficult for us to be operating on our own,"" said NASA space operations chief Kathy Lueders. ""The ISS is an international partnership ... with joint dependencies."" Before the Ukraine crisis erupted, NASA, ESA Canada and Japan were aiming to extend station operations through 2030. Russia had not yet formally signed on, however, and as of now, all bets are off.",3,7.830064787962973,5.060123580637472,2.769941207325501,6
2022-03-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/cyberattacks-spark-cybersecurity-concerns-among-maryland-lawmakers/,Cyberattacks Prompt Maryland Lawmakers To Craft Security Bills,"BALTIMORE (WJZ) -- Maryland's House Speaker launched a push for a package of cybersecurity bills she says are critical. ""Vulnerabilities in our information technology systems will continue to cost our taxpayers, and that cost is high,"" Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Baltimore County Democrat, said. Recent cyberattacks have cost millions—an estimated more than $8 million dollars after Baltimore County Schools were hacked in 2020. Baltimore City paid out $6 million after hackers took over the city's systems that controlled everything from water bills to real estate fees in 2019. Last December, hackers demanded a ransom from the Maryland Department of Health. The attack stopped reporting of crucial COVID data as the Omicron variant was rapidly spreading. And in February, the Twitter account of Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby was hacked. ""As we rely more heavily on technology, it means more cyberattacks, particularly those targeting state and local governments,"" Jones said. The bills making their way through Maryland's General Assembly would improve cybersecurity training, statewide coordination, regular assessments of threats and hire an independent contractor to scour systems for security risks. You can read more about them here:   ""We are past day zero. We have already been attacked at the state level, at the local level,"" said Delegate Pat Young, who is sponsoring the legislation, of the urgency. The head of information technology in Montgomery County revealed there are attacks on their systems a staggering 15 million times each day. The cybersecurity push comes amid warnings Russia could target businesses and government agencies in the United States as retaliation over sanctions for its war with Ukraine.

Recalling their experiences in Ukraine's capital during the Second World War, they demand that Russian President Vladimir Putin remove his forces from Ukraine and stop his artillery barrage on the country, repeating in unison ""We want peace!"" CBS News cannot independently verify the video, which had been seen almost 1 million times after being tweeted by retired U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, former director for European affairs of the U.S. National Security Council. ""Holocaust survivors in a bomb-shelter in Ukraine, cursing Putin and asking for peace,"" Vindman labeled the clip. One of the elderly women in the video identifies herself as Lukash Tamara Oleksiivna. She says she was born in 1939 and lived in Kyiv before World War II started. She describes the current bombardment of the city as ""a horror."" ""Putin, I wish for you to die. Leave us, you b*****d,"" she says to the person recording the video, before everyone in the shelter chants, ""We want peace!"" All three of the speakers in the video say their relatives were killed in the 1941 Babyn Yar massacre, when Nazi forces murdered 34,000 Jews on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish, called a Russian missile strike that hit the Babyn Yar memorial this week ""beyond humanity."" Putin has invoked the horrors of the Holocaust to justify his invasion of Ukraine, claiming his goal is to ""demilitarize"" and ""denazify"" the country. On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Zelensky of allowing ""a society where neo-Nazism is flourishing,"" suggesting fascists were ""marching openly"" in Ukraine. While Russian-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops in the country's east since Putin last invaded in 2014, there have been no credible reports to back up Russia's claims that Ukraine has committed atrocities against ethnic Russians in the region.",17,5.610821538885304,5.323752550011984,0.2870689888733198,20
2022-03-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/what-would-a-cyberattack-on-the-u-s-look-like/,What Would A Cyberattack On The U.S. Look Like?,"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) - As war rages on in Ukraine, concerns that the U.S. could come under attack are rising. The battlefield however would be online. Chaos continues on the ground in Ukraine this week after a missile strike targeted a TV tower. Explosive weaponry isn't the only way Russia is fighting its neighbor, though. The Kremlin has targeted banks and energy sectors digitally. ""I'm not surprised that a portion of this war is being fought in a cyber-battlefield,"" said Mark Lanterman, chief technology officer for Computer Forensic Services. What would a cyberattack on the U.S. look like? ""What we need to be concerned about is cyberattacks against our power grid, against our water processing plants, against our hospitals, our banks, news media,"" Lanterman said. All of that critical infrastructure is connected to networks and could be vulnerable. It happened in 2021 when Russians hacked the Colonial Pipeline, creating a brief gas shortage in the southeast that had drivers scrambling to fill up while also grounding flights. ""What that taught us is that there is no such thing as perfect security, and we can't be so arrogant as to think it won't happen to us,"" Lanterman said. Xcel Energy tells WCCO it is closely monitoring potential threats to its grid connected to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and that protecting its system from cyber and physical attacks is a top priority. How can the average person prepare for a cyberattack? ""We have to take responsibility for our own security,"" Lanterman said. Here's a few tips he shared to better secure your private information online: - Have a unique username or password for all websites that require one. - Disable location services and Bluetooth on your phone or laptop when not needed. - Regularly update your phone and computer. - Think before your click. ""All it takes is a hacker to trick a business owner into clicking on a link in an email, downloading ransomware, encrypting all of that business' data,"" Lanterman said. ""It's gonna spread throughout the network."" Another idea is to avoid using public Wi-Fi. Lanterman said cyberattacks have occurred on public Wi-Fi networks at coffee shops and libraries. He suggests using your mobile hotspot on your phone in those locations. Late last month, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned businesses and organizations to prepare for potential cyberattacks. CISA at the time said there was no specific, credible threat, however it wants them to be prepared. It advised them to enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching users, update software, and to have antivirus/antimalware software conduct regular scans.",3,5.125667206758326,4.3793293211468365,0.7463378856114895,1
2022-03-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joint-us-russian-operation-of-space-station-continues-normally-for-now/,Joint U.S.-Russian operation of space station continues normally — for now,"Joint U.S.-Russian operation of the International Space Station is continuing normally for now, a senior NASA official said Monday, amid severely strained relations in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, subsequent economic sanctions and increasingly harsh rhetoric. During a teleconference to discuss Axiom Space's upcoming commercial crew visit to the lab complex, NASA space operations chief Kathy Lueders said joint space station operations have not been interrupted or otherwise disrupted to date. ""We're continuing to monitor the situation, but our control centers are operating nominally together,"" she said. ""We are not getting any indications at a working level that our counterparts are not committed to ongoing operation of the International Space Station."" ""We as a team are operating just like we were operating three weeks ago — our flight controllers are still talking together, our teams are still talking together, we're still doing training together, we're still working together,"" she added. The International Space Station is a hugely complex spacecraft, the largest structure ever assembled in space, and it requires both NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos to operate. Russia provides the propellant and thrusters needed to keep the football field-size station in orbit and to eventually guide the huge lab back into the atmosphere or a safe, targeted re-entry and breakup at the end of its life. The United States provides the powerful gyro devices used to maintain the lab's orientation and supplies the lion's share of the station's electrical power. A Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship launched last week is the first U.S. craft since the now-retired shuttle that is capable of raising the station's altitude, but it cannot take the place of Russian propulsion systems. And in any case, Russian cosmonauts are not trained to operate U.S. systems and NASA astronauts cannot operate Russia's. The space station is, in the end, a truly international project that requires both superpowers, working together, to function. ""Currently, there is no plan, it would be very difficult for us to be operating on our own,"" Lueders said. ""The ISS is an international partnership ... with joint dependencies. It's a place where we live and operate in space in a peaceful manner. That's really a model for us to be operating in the future."" ""It would be a sad day for international operations if we can't continue to peacefully operate in space,"" she added. ""And as a team, we are doing that."" Lueders is one of the highest level NASA managers yet to comment on space station operations amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, providing a stark contrast to a barrage of sarcastic tweets from Dmitri Rogozin, director of Russia's space program. On Monday, he noted that the United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket that will be used to send Boeing's Starliner commercial crew capsule to the space station is powered by Russia's RD-180 first stage engine. He implied the rocket's perfect successful record was the result of Russian specialists who may not be supporting upcoming flights. ""Well, let's pray for our American friends,"" he tweeted. ULA is transitioning to a new rocket, the all-American Vulcan, and the company already has stockpiled all the RD-180s it needs to complete the Atlas program. Responding to questions via Twitter, ULA CEO Tory Bruno said the company can safely launch and operate the engines on its own. ""We like to be able to consult with them in the event that the engine might do something unexpected,"" Bruno said. ""But, we have been flying them for years and have developed considerable experience and expertise."" Earlier, Rogozin responded to President Biden's announcement of sanctions by suggesting that without the Russians, the space station could fall back to Earth showering debris over the United States, Europe and even China. ""If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the United States or Europe,"" he tweeted. ""There is also the option of dropping a 500-ton structure to India and China. Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect?""

Contributing: William Harwood / CBS News, Frank Jordans / Associated Press CHICAGO (CBS Chicago/CBS News/AP) -- Cooperation between the U.S. and Russia in space was celebrated as the way forward following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. But tensions between astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station have been growing for years now – and a University of Chicago expert said Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the response from the West has put a ""crescendo"" on those tensions. U of C space historian and expert Jordan Bimm explained Monday that the International Space Station should not be thought of as a utopian real-life equivalent of the Starship Enterprise. Its launch in 1998 and occupation two years later was an artifact of the optimism at the end of the Cold War and of prioritizing international cooperation rather than a space race. While cooperation in space and the ISS were thought of as ""the model of the future"" in the wake of the end of the Cold War, Bimm said the ISS has now become ""this artifact of the one place where America and Russia still cooperate."" Bimm traced the history of relations between the U.S. and Russia in space – from tension to cooperation, and now back to tension again. On Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik as the earth's first artificial orbiting satellite – leading to panic that the U.S. had fallen behind in technology, not only in space, but also in nuclear arms. ""People at the time saw that that meant if (the USSR) can put a satellite in orbit, they can send a nuclear bomb,"" Bimm said. On the American side, the Sputnik scare spurred the creation of NASA in 1958, as well as a huge investment in science, technology, and engineering. Going back as far as the Kennedy administration – there was talk of cooperating with the Soviets in space instead of fighting or competing against them, Bimm said. But it took until after the U.S. declared victory in the space race in putting a man on the moon with Apollo 11 in 1969 for anything like that to happen. In 1975, the U.S. and USSR launched their first crewed joint space mission – in which an American Apollo module and a Soviet Soyuz module were launched into space and docked together for five joint experiments between American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts. ""This was sort of seen as a symbol of détente; of the lessening of tensions back on earth,"" Bimm explained. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was a one-off event at the time, but a pivot toward cooperation became clear in particular after the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1994, an 11-mission program began in which Russian cosmonauts flew in U.S. Space Shuttles, and an American flew in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, for missions at the Russian space station Mir. This in turn paved the way for the International Space Station to be occupied by American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts working together. But Bimm pointed out that such cooperation is an ""archaic artifact"" of the past now – and tensions between astronauts and cosmonauts have been growing for years as it is. In 2011, when NASA retired its fleet of space shuttles, astronauts were left with no way to send humans to the ISS except to buy seats on the Russian Soyuz rocket and capsule system. In recent years, the SpaceX commercial crew program provided an alternative to being dependent on the Soyuz system – which Russia was not pleased with, Bimm said. There has also been tension on the Space Station in that NASA is focused on keeping its mission there limited to scientific research, while the Russian space program has looked to the ISS for money-making opportunities. The first wave of space tourists – including American engineer and astronaut Dennis Tito – paid Russia for the privilege, and just this past year, a Russian film crew went to the ISS with an actor and a director to shoot a movie. And in 2018, a minuscule drill hole was discovered in part of the ISS – and it became a subject of a blame game between astronauts and cosmonauts, Bimm said. It reached the point where the Russian space agency Roscosmos blamed an American astronaut, Serena Auñón-Chancellor, for drilling the hole despite no evidence of her having done so. Four years later, Bimm said, tensions are poised to be inflamed even further with Russia having launched an invasion of Ukraine and the U.S. and its allies issuing sanctions. ""Space is not like a utopian separate realm,"" Bimm said, emphasizing that earthly politics can be an issue in space just as much as on the ground on earth. This past Thursday, President Joe Biden announced that economic sanctions against Russia in response to the Ukraine invasion would ""degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program."" A White House fact sheet providing details about the sanctions did not specifically mention space, but said the United States will impose ""Russia-wide restrictions on sensitive U.S. technologies produced in foreign countries using U.S.-origin software, technology, or equipment."" ""This includes Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies. These severe and sustained controls will cut off Russia's access to cutting edge technology."" NASA said in a statement late Thursday that the agency is continuing to work ""with all our international partners, including the State Space Corporation Roscosmos, for the ongoing safe operations of the International Space Station."" ""The new export control measures will continue to allow U.S.-Russia civil space cooperation,"" the statement said. ""No changes are planned to the agency's support for ongoing in orbit and ground station operations."" Earlier, Roscomos Director Dmitry Rogozin fired off a string of tweets directing sarcasm and anger at Biden and the West. He pointed out that Russian thrusters provide the power to boost the station's altitude to counteract atmospheric drag and to move the lab out of the way when threatened by space debris. ""Do you want to ban all countries from launching their spacecraft on the most reliable Russian rockets in the world? This is how you already do it by limiting exchanges between our cosmonaut and astronaut training centers,"" a translation of his tweet said. ""Or do you want to manage the ISS yourself?"" Rogozin even got in a dig against SpaceX founder Elon Musk for launching thousands of Starlink internet satellites that he said have ""polluted"" low-Earth orbit. ""Maybe President Biden is off topic, so explain to him that the correction of the station's orbit, its avoidance of dangerous rendezvous with space garbage, with which your talented businessmen have polluted the near-Earth orbit, is produced exclusively by the engines of the Russian Progress MS cargo ships,"" a translation of his tweet said. He made no mention of a recent Russian anti-satellite weapons test that created a cloud of potentially dangerous space debris. In any case, Russian engines also will provide the thrust needed to safely drive the space station back into the atmosphere at the end of its life, targeting re-entry over an unpopulated stretch of ocean to ensure no debris falls on populated areas. ""If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the United States or Europe?"" he tweeted in Russian, according to Google Translate. ""There is also the option of dropping a 500-ton structure to India and China. Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? ""The ISS does not fly over Russia, so all the risks are yours. Are you ready for them? Gentlemen, when planning sanctions, check those who generate them for illness Alzheimer's just in case. To prevent your sanctions from falling on your head. And not only in a figurative sense."" The current crew on the ISS is composed of four Americans, two Russians, and one German representing the European Space Agency. The commander of the mission is a former Russian Air Force pilot. Bimm emphasized that the crews on the ISS are selected to be consummate professionals and are trained on inter-crew dynamics – but human beings are still human beings, and tension on earth is not absent in space. ""Out of an abundance of caution, these space agencies should be providing extra support,"" Bimm said. He said NASA and Roscosmos should acknowledge the Russian invasion of Ukraine and all that has happened in its wake as a major moment of challenge – and make sure people aren't ""bottling up stuff that could come out at a bad moment."" As to the long-term future of the ISS, Bimm noted that the ISS was only supposed to be in service for a limited period of time, which it is now already beyond. Just this past year, the ISS' time in service was extended again – with plans for it to remain in service until 2031. Will a spirit of cooperation between the U.S. and Russia make it for another nine years? Bimm isn't sure. ""Whether they cooperate in this Space Station for the full planned nine more years I think now is more of an open question than it's ever been in the entire legacy of the Space Station,"" he said. Bimm noted that the Russian space program has not innovated recently – relying on upgrades to the same Soyuz design that has been in use since the 1960s. With another force needed to advance that innovation, Bimm expects the future of the space program in Russia to involve collaboration with China – with Russia providing the history and deep knowledge, and China providing the technology and infrastructure. Meanwhile, SpaceX is likely to take the lead as a private enterprise on the U.S. side, Bimm said. Bimm said NASA likes to pretend things are perfect – but particularly given relations with the U.S. and Russia amid the war in Ukraine, tensions in space go on escalating. ""The way things are going at this moment, I'm not sure this collaboration can last – you know, unless there's significant political change on the ground,"" he said. Meanwhile, another space mission that was already delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic is also now poised to be delayed again by the war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions against Russia. The European Space Agency said Monday that a joint Europe-Russian mission to Mars this year is now ""very unlikely."" The agency said after a meeting of officials from its 22 member states that it was assessing the consequences of sanctions for its cooperation with Russia's Roscosmos space agency. ""The sanctions and the wider context make a launch in 2022 very unlikely,"" for the Europe-Russia ExoMars rover mission, the agency said in a statement. Bimm explained that chances for a launch to Mars only come around every 26 months – a schedule based upon when Mars is closest to earth. If the mission does not go ahead in 2022, it is likely that there won't be a chance again until 2025 – which Bimm said is sure to be a disappointment for people who care about Mars, research on the solar system, and astrobiology. The bottom line, Bimm said, is that ""science, technology, and politics are all intertwined."" Politics might not interfere with getting machines to work, but when it comes to carrying out international missions, putting politics aside is not possible, he said. And Bimm said that is an especially important factor to consider with the war in Ukraine in progress. For now. joint U.S.-Russian operation of the ISS is continuing normally, a senior NASA official said Monday. During a teleconference to discuss Axiom Space's upcoming commercial crew visit to the lab complex, NASA space operations chief Kathy Lueders said joint space station operations have not been interrupted or otherwise disrupted to date. ""We're continuing to monitor the situation, but our control centers are operating nominally together,"" she said. ""We are not getting any indications at a working level that our counterparts are not committed to ongoing operation of the International Space Station."" ""We as a team are operating just like we were operating three weeks ago — our flight controllers are still talking together, our teams are still talking together, we're still doing training together, we're still working together,"" she added.

CBS 2's Marissa Perlman has more on the latest developments as the civilian death toll from the war in Ukraine is above 100 now, including several children killed. Russian troops are now widely scattered across Ukraine north, south, east and west. There is heavy presence throughout. This comes as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met for their first talks since the invasion began. As of this evening, there is no immediate agreement. Meanwhile, sanctions against Russia led the Central Bank there to sharply raise key interest rates from 9.5% way up to 20%. Even sports organizations are applying pressure. Russian teams have been suspended from international soccer. As the world is bombarded with images of destruction in Ukraine, it's important to not forget about images like a newborn baby crying in a hospital located in a Russian controlled area of Ukraine. In a separate maternity hospital, a mom can be seen kissing her newborn in the basement. Real people impacted by the war. A wider shot shows the conditions of this medical ward turned bomb shelter. In a Ukrainian gym turned shelter, volunteers tape up mirrors for safety to keep the glass from shattering, where people crammed in there, including the very young. And older folks as well, some, comforted by the presence of their pets. When the lights are out, the scene is even more surreal. Another night in Kyiv, another round of sirens that has many fleeing to bordering countries for safety. At last count, more than 500,000 million, including some headed to Poland. Many gave up on the extremely long lines and literally walked the last few miles across the border. Late Monday afternoon, President Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron he'll stop strikes against civilian targets.

Prosecutor Karim Khan said in a statement that the investigation will look at alleged crimes committed before the Russian invasion, but added that ""given the expansion of the conflict in recent days, it is my intention that this investigation will also encompass any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of my office that are committed by any party to the conflict on any part of the territory of Ukraine."" The court already has conducted a preliminary probe into crimes linked to the violent suppression of pro-European protests in Kyiv in 2013-2014 by a pro-Russian Ukrainian administration and allegations of crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where Russia has backed rebels since 2014. In December 2020, then-ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said the probe uncovered indications that ""a broad range of conduct constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of the Court have been committed"" in Ukraine. However, the court's prosecutors had not yet sought permission from judges to open a full-scale investigation. Khan says he now wants to open the investigation envisaged by his predecessor and broaden it to include crimes committed in fighting since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week. Khan said he would continue to monitor developments in Ukraine, where there have been reports of civilian casualties, and he called for ""restraint and strict adherence to the applicable rules of international humanitarian law."" U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet says her office has confirmed that 102 civilians, including seven children, have been killed in the Russian invasion and 304 others wounded in Ukraine since Thursday. She cautioned that the tally was likely a vast undercount. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is among the court's 123 member states, but Ukraine has accepted the court's jurisdiction, which empowers Khan to investigate. Khan has told his team to explore how to preserve evidence of crimes and said that the next step is to seek authorization from the court's judges to open an investigation. However, he added that the process would be speeded up if a member nation of the court were to ask for an investigation in what is known as a referral. That ""would allow us to actively and immediately proceed with the (prosecution) Office's independent and objective investigations,"" Khan said. He said he also would seek support from the court's member states and the international community to fund the investigation.

2022-02-27,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/russia-nuclear-forces-ukraine-fighting/,Putin puts Russia's nuclear forces on alert as fighting in Ukraine continues,"Kyiv — In a dramatic escalation of East-West tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear deterrent forces put on alert Sunday in response to what he called ""aggressive statements"" by leading NATO powers. The move means Putin has ordered Russia's nuclear weapons prepared for increased readiness to launch, raising the threat that the tensions could boil over into a nuclear war. In giving it, the Russian leader also cited hard-hitting financial sanctions imposed by the West against Russia, including Putin himself. Amid the worrying development, the office of Ukraine's president said a delegation would meet with Russian officials as Moscow's troops drew closer to Kyiv. Putin, in giving the nuclear alert directive, cited not only the alleged statements by NATO members but the hard-hitting financial sanctions imposed by the West against Russia, including the Russian leader himself. Speaking at a meeting with his top officials, Putin told his defense minister and the chief of the military's General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a ""special regime of combat duty."" ""Western countries aren't only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,"" Putin said in televised comments. Putin threatened in the days before Russia's invasion to retaliate harshly against any nations that intervened directly in the conflict in Ukraine, and he specifically raised the specter of his country's status as a nuclear power. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield denounced the move as a ""totally unacceptable"" escalation, telling ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday morning that the U.S. will ""continue here at the United Nations and around the world to use every possible lever we have at our disposal to expose his actions."" ""President Putin is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable, and we have to continue to condemn his actions in the strongest possible way,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. The practical meaning of Putin's order was not immediately clear. Russia and the United States typically have the land- and submarine-based segments of their strategic nuclear forces on alert and prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not. If Putin is arming or otherwise raising the nuclear combat readiness of his bombers, or if he is ordering more ballistic missile submarines to sea, then the United States might feel compelled to respond in kind, according to Hans Kristensen, a nuclear analyst at the Federation of American Scientists. That would mark a worrisome escalation and a potential crisis, he said. The alarming step came as street fighting broke out in Ukraine's second-largest city and Russian troops squeezed strategic ports in the country's south, advances that appeared to mark a new phase of Russia's invasion following a wave of attacks on airfields and fuel facilities elsewhere in the country. The capital, Kyiv, was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault. ""The past night was tough – more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. ""There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn't consider as admissible targets."" Following its gains to the east in the city of Kharkiv and multiple ports, Russia sent a delegation to Belarus for peace talks with Ukraine, according to the Kremlin. Zelensky suggested other locations, saying his country was unwilling to meet in Belarus because it served as a staging ground for the invasion. Until Sunday, Russia's troops had remained on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million about 20 kilometers 12.4 miles south of the border with Russia, while other forces rolled past to press the offensive deeper into Ukraine. Videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. One showed Ukrainian troops firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby. The images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine's bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces. Huge explosions lit up the sky early Sunday near Kyiv, where terrified residents hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault. Putin hasn't disclosed his ultimate plans, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine's government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow's Cold War-era influence. The pressure on strategic ports in the south of Ukraine appeared aimed at seizing control of the country's coastline stretching from the border with Romania in the west to the border with Russia in the east. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said Russian forces had blocked the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea. He said the Russian forces also took control of an airbase near Kherson and the Azov Sea city of Henichesk. Ukrainian authorities also have reported fighting near Odessa, Mykolaiv and other areas. Cutting Ukraine's access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country's economy. It also could allow Moscow to build a land corridor to Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014 and until now was connected to Russia by a 19-kilometer 12-mile bridge, the longest bridge in Europe which opened in 2018. Flames billowed from an oil depot near an airbase in Vasylkiv, a city 23 miles south of Kyiv where there has been intense fighting, according to the mayor. Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, prompting the government to warn people to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze as protection from smoke, the president's office said. Ukrainian military deputy commander Lt.-Gen. Yevhen Moisiuk sounded a defiant note in a message aimed at Russian troops. ""Unload your weapons, raise your hands so that our servicemen and civilians can understand that you have heard us. This is your ticket home,"" Moisiuk said in a Facebook video. The U.S. pledged an additional $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, body armor and small arms. Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the besieged country and that it would close its airspace to Russian planes. The U.S., European Union and United Kingdom agreed to block ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system, which moves money around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions worldwide, part of a new round of sanctions aiming to impose a severe cost on Moscow for the invasion. They also agreed to impose ""restrictive measures"" on Russia's central bank. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said Sunday that his country is committing 100 billion euros, or $112.7 billion, to a special fund for its armed forces, raising its defense spending above 2% of gross domestic product. Scholz told a special session of the Bundestag the investment was needed ""to protect our freedom and our democracy.""",17,2.2829414335527543,2.214086446891622,0.06885498666113232,17

In an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv. ""We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,"" he finally said. ""Right now we are encircled."" The AP was not able to immediately verify the mayor's report that Kyiv was encircled by Russian forces or how wide an area that would encompass due to a strict curfew Sunday on movement in the city. Klitschko himself later backed away from that assessment, saying on his Telegram channel that ""In the evening, Russian Internet publications spread information with reference to me that Kyiv is allegedly surrounded and evacuation of people is impossible. ... Do not believe lies! Trust information only from official sources."" When Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the capital city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters. The mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child. A Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside during this time could be considered a saboteur. ""We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,"" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian saboteurs were killed Saturday night. Russian troops' advance on the city has been slower than many military experts had expected but the overall Russian military advantage is well-known to all. ""Ï just talked to the president (Volodymyr Zelenskyy). Everybody is not feeling so well,"" Klitschko said, adding that city government employees were in shock but not depressed. ""We show our character, our knowledge, our values."" In the last few days, long queues of people — both men and women — were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the Ukrainian capital after authorities decided to distribute arms freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists. ""To be honest, we don't have 100% control,"" said Klitschko. ""We built this territorial defense (system) in a short amount of time — but these are patriotic people."" ""Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,"" he added. Responding to a question about the city's capacity to replenish dwindling stocks of food and medicine, Klitscho's view darkened, however. ""We are at the border of a humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said. ""Right now, we have electricity, right now we have water and heating in our houses. But the infrastructure is destroyed to deliver the food and medication."" Then, in the same breath, he rallied like the world heavyweight boxing champion he once was. ""That's why the message for everyone is support Ukraine together ... we are strong,"" he said. ""Every Ukrainian is proud to be independent, proud to be Ukrainian, and we are proud to have our own country."" (© Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The Russian forces have advanced toward three cities, including Kyiv, but have not yet captured a city since invading. ""The Ukrainians are putting up a very stiff and brave and heroic resistance, but we are only in Day Four, and I would be reluctant to provide an estimate of how many more days there are and what those days are going to look like,"" the senior defense official said. The U.S. Defense Department estimates about two-thirds of the combat power Russia had arrayed around Ukraine's borders have now been committed inside Ukraine. That leaves about one-third that have yet to enter the country, which is a significant amount of power still at the ready. The Russian advances on both Kharkiv and Kyiv have been slowed by fuel and logistical shortages and by the stiff and ""creative"" resistance by the Ukrainians, according to the official. The Russian advance forces are still about 30 kilometers outside of Kyiv. There are indications that some reconnaissance elements are inside Kyiv's city center putting up a fight but the main forces are still 30 kilometers away, which is about where the forces were on Saturday too. One change that concerns U.S. officials is the first indications the Russians are adopting siege tactics in Chernihiv, on the way to Kyiv, for a full out effort to capture it. The Russians have started firing rockets, which are imprecise weapons, inside the city that risk hitting civilian infrastructure. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert in response to statements by Western countries and NATO. The senior defense official said the move was ""unnecessary and escalatory"" since Russia is not under threat by NATO or Ukraine. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin learned of Putin's decision from his announcement, the defense official said. Putin's announcement came just before Austin hosted an operations and policy synchronization meeting attended by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, combatant commanders, as well as senior policy leaders. The leaders discussed Putin's announcement during the meeting. The Russian invasion into Ukraine advances along three lines of assault. One, north to south, from Belarus towards Kyiv. Another, northeast to south, towards Kharkiv. And a third from the South towards central Ukraine. The southern advance has forked, with some Russian forces headed northwest towards Kherson and others splitting off northeast towards Mariupol. On Saturday, the Russians used an estimated four landing ships to conduct an amphibious assault about 70 kilometers from Mariupol with several thousand naval infantry troops. They have advanced about 20 kilometers since then, and are about 50 kilometers out from Mariupol. The U.S. government on Sunday advised Americans in Russia to ""leave immediately,"" according to an advisory posted by the State Department.

A whirlwind of diplomatic efforts to stave off a Russian invasion in recent weeks failed to defuse tensions that had mounted over months. Russia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country's doorstep. The escalation in the years-long conflict between Russia and Ukraine has triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia's attacks on several parts of Ukraine raise the specter of a dangerous showdown between Western powers and Moscow. So how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here's a breakdown of what we know. Several areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a ""special military operation"" and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms. The move came after months of speculation about what Moscow's intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. More than 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials. Some of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv. The coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation. The territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia's intended creep into Ukraine. Russia repeatedly denied it was planning an assault, but an escalation in shelling in eastern Ukraine heightened fears that it could be stoking the violence to justify a wider conflict. As the situation on Ukraine's border has intensified, NATO has raised the readiness of its rapid response force, while member countries put troops on standby and deployed battalions, planes and ships to the region. US President Joe Biden said Thursday the US would deploy additional troops to Germany and redeploy some forces already in Europe to NATO eastern flank allies. In recent weeks, the US has sent several thousand soldiers into NATO countries in Eastern Europe. The US says it has no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. On Thursday, NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a ""grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security."" Also on Thursday, the US unveiled new sanctions that will cut off certain strategic imports to Russia, adding to a ""first tranche"" of measures targeting two large financial institutions, the country's sovereign debt, and Russian elites and their family members. Biden has vowed the world will ""hold Russia accountable"" for the invasion, and is expected to spell out a set of additional sanctions, which were once meant to deter such an assault. Biden and European leaders have previously warned that Russia would suffer serious consequences should Putin move ahead with a wider invasion. But that has not stopped Russia from continuing to bolster its military positions. In late 2021 and early 2022, satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow's closest international ally. Despite receiving funding, training and equipment from the US and other NATO member countries, experts say Ukraine would be significantly outmatched by Russia's military, which has been modernized under Putin's leadership. If an all-out war broke out between the two countries, tens of thousands of civilians could die and up to 5 million could be made refugees, according to some estimates. Ukraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future -- crossing a red line for Russia. Putin sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a ""hostile act"" -- a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine's aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia. In interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine's east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe. In early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. In the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create ""a pretext for an invasion."" In a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as ""one people,"" and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia's orbit through a ""forced change of identity."" That type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin's emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation on Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine's own sovereignty. But Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West's ""puppet."" In fact, Putin's efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia's sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance. In December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe -- proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters. Putin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. ""It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,"" he said at his annual news conference late last year. ""Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep."" High-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe's leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine's east -- known as the Normandy Format talks -- could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis. In a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a ""genocide"" against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress -- echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea. But less than a week later, after Russia's upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements ""no longer exist,"" adding: ""What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?"" The agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 -- which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine -- have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved. Moscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and -- although unclear in what sequence -- would also restore the Ukrainian government's control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics. Putin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. ""Like it or don't like it, it's your duty, my beauty,"" Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin's stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: ""We are not his."" President Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country. ""Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we've been building, everything we are living for,"" Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page. In Kyiv, where Ukrainians had continued to go about their daily business while Russian troops sat at their borders, the streets were empty on Thursday. Across the country, residents have been preparing for the worst -- packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists. Ukraine's government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. ""Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN. Tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline -- connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany -- as a threat to its own security. Nord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea -- in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe. After requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin's decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 is just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky's government. The former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, has had a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019. His government's popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy. Many Ukrainians are unhappy that the government has not delivered on the promises that brought it into power, including cracking down on corruption in the country's judicial system. But the more pressing concern is Zelensky's failure so far to bring peace to the country. (The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

(CBS4)- Thousands of miles away in Colorado, it's easy to think the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a European problem, but just like the internet can give you a front-row seat to the fighting, it can also expose you to cyberattacks. ""Russia may well look to retaliate to the U.S. and Western allies as a response to economic sanctions,"" said Dr. Iain Boyd, the Director for The Center for National Security Initiatives at The University of Colorado Boulder. He says Russia may think annoying, inconveniencing and attacking the American public will ease the burden placed on the by the West. ""They would like to put pressure on the U.S. government to relax those or remove those sanctions,"" he says. It's not just hard targets like financial institutions, defense companies, large-scale infrastructure, utilities, or large companies that should be concerned. Dr. Boyd says cyber attackers will go after soft targets like schools, media companies and even individuals to sew as much chaos as possible. Luckily you are your own best line of defense. Boyd says make sure you have up to date malware and antivirus software on your computer, enable two factor authentications for your accounts, back up your files, change your passwords often and be careful what links you click on even if it seems legit. Cyber terrorists have gotten good at mimicking real companies. ""I know that probably sounds like a lot of extra work for people but I think the more of these steps that people can take the safer we all will be,"" Boyd says.",3,2.76864142615557,3.244860989931503,-0.476219563775933,28

On Wednesday, there were several more of those so-called nuisance cyberattacks, targeting multiple Ukrainian government websites and even banks.

2022-02-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-sanctions-space-station-operations/,"Ukraine invasion, U.S.-led sanctions on Russia raise new questions about space station operations","Severe U.S. and allied economic sanctions announced Thursday in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine will ""degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program,"" President Biden said during a White House news conference. The comments raised fresh questions about the ongoing operation of the International Space Station. Continuously staffed since 2000 by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts, the space station is a hugely expensive, complex and extraordinarily successful example of superpower cooperation that dates back to the end of the Cold War, an extension of the 1970s-era détente that culminated in the historic Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. The relationship has been rocky at times, but both sides have helped the other throughout and neither can operate the space station on its own. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine, threatening rhetoric from Russian President Vladimir Putin and severe sanctions announced by President Biden are the most significant challenges to the project yet. Biden said Thursday ""we estimate that we'll cut off more than half of Russia's high tech imports. And we'll strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military."" ""It will degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program,"" he went on. ""It will hurt their ability to build ships reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin's long term strategic ambitions."" A White House fact sheet providing details about the sanctions did not specifically mention space, but said the United States will impose ""Russia-wide restrictions on sensitive U.S. technologies produced in foreign countries using U.S.-origin software, technology, or equipment."" ""This includes Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies. These severe and sustained controls will cut off Russia's access to cutting edge technology."" NASA said in a statement late Thursday that the agency is continuing to work ""with all our international partners, including the State Space Corporation Roscosmos, for the ongoing safe operations of the International Space Station."" ""The new export control measures will continue to allow U.S.-Russia civil space cooperation,"" the statement said. ""No changes are planned to the agency's support for ongoing in orbit and ground station operations."" Earlier, Roscomos Director Dmitry Rogozin fired off a string of tweets directing sarcasm and anger at Biden and the West. He pointed out that Russian thrusters provide the power to boost the station's altitude to counteract atmospheric drag and to move the lab out of the way when threatened by space debris. He even got in a dig against SpaceX founder Elon Musk for launching thousands of Starlink internet satellites that he said have ""polluted"" low-Earth orbit. ""Maybe President Biden is off topic, so explain to him that the correction of the station's orbit, its avoidance of dangerous rendezvous with space garbage, with which your talented businessmen have polluted the near-Earth orbit, is produced exclusively by the engines of the Russian Progress MS cargo ships,"" a translation of his tweet said. He made no mention of a recent Russian anti-satellite weapons test that created a cloud of potentially dangerous space debris. In any case, Russian engines also will provide the thrust needed to safely drive the space station back into the atmosphere at the end of its life, targeting re-entry over an unpopulated stretch of ocean to ensure no debris falls on populated areas. ""If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an uncontrolled deorbit and fall into the United States or Europe?"" he tweeted in Russian, according to Google Translate. ""There is also the option of dropping a 500-ton structure to India and China. Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? ""The ISS does not fly over Russia, so all the risks are yours. Are you ready for them? Gentlemen, when planning sanctions, check those who generate them for illness Alzheimer's just in case. To prevent your sanctions from falling on your head. And not only in a figurative sense."" U.S.-Russian cooperation was critical to the space station's construction and ongoing operation. Russia stepped in and launched a steady stream of astronauts to the lab when the space shuttle was grounded after the 2003 Columbia disaster and then provided transportation for American and partner-agency astronauts after the shuttle program ended in 2011. The ferry service has been beneficial — and lucrative — to Roscosmos, which charged up to $90 million per seat, taking in $4 billion since 2006. As Rogozin said, Russia provides the propellant and thrusters needed to periodically reboost the station, a critical capability NASA cannot currently replace. Maneuvering is provided by thrusters built into the Russian Zarya and Zvezda modules and aboard visiting Progress supply ships. A Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship that arrived earlier this week is the first U.S. vehicle after the space shuttle to be capable of reboost, but it cannot on its own replace the Russian capability. For its part, NASA provides the lion's share of the space station's solar power and uses four massive gyroscopes to re-orient the lab as required without the need for thrusters. NASA also provides wireless communications, computer services and spacewalk equipment routinely used by cosmonauts. But NASA astronauts are not trained to operate Russian systems and vice versa for the cosmonauts. Neither side can safely operate the lab on its own. Thanks to SpaceX Dragon capsules and soon-to-fly Boeing Starliners, NASA is no longer solely reliant on Russia's Soyuz for crew transportation to and from the ISS. Crew Dragons have carried four NASA-sponsored crews to the station to date with a commercial visit planned for early April and another NASA crew launching April 15. The current station crew is ""mixed,"" with 2 Russians and an American — Anton Shkaplerov, Pyotr Dubrov and Mark Vande Hei — carried up on a Soyuz, 3 Americans and a German launched aboard a Crew Dragon: Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn, Kayla Barron and European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer. Both sides currently are negotiating plans to continue launching astronauts aboard Soyuz and cosmonauts aboard Crew Dragons to ensure both agencies have personnel aboard to operate critical systems even if a contingency forced one ferry ship — and its crew — to unexpectedly depart. Two NASA astronauts recently completed Soyuz training in Star City near Moscow and one is expected to launch aboard an upcoming Soyuz. Likewise, a cosmonaut is training for an initial flight aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon. Both missions are scheduled for launches in September. But a detailed agreement has not been finalized and how the negotiations might fare given the current crisis is not yet known. In the meantime, hatches between the US and Russian segments of the ISS remain open, a symbolic reminder of the cooperation it took to assemble and operate the most complex spacecraft ever built. ""I really hope things do go well,"" Vande Hei said of U.S.-Russian relations during a January interview with CBS News. ""I definitely think that the space station and our cooperation with the Russians on the space station in particular, are a great sign of how successful we can be when we get to know each other and to do things that are cooperative, rather than find points of conflict.""

Kathy Hochul: New York City on ""heightened alert"" for attacks by Russian hackers","NEW YORK -- The Big Apple could very well be Vladimir Putin's next target, and he wouldn't even have to fire a single bullet. The battlefield could end up being cyberspace. As CBS2's Marcia Kramer reported Thursday, officials here are on high alert for a possible attack as a tit-for-tat response to the imposition of tough sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine. It's just under 5,000 miles from Red Square to Times Square, but the faint tentacles of cyberhackers could reach here in minutes, causing untold havoc in a target-rich city like New York. Already, Gov. Kathy Hochul is marshalling state cyberwarriors to repel the Russians. ""We are on heightened alert with respect to cybersecurity and our own defenses,"" Hochul said. The governor says she is working with the feds and local governments to detect and prevent cyberattacks related to the Russian military advances in Ukraine. Just days ago she and Mayor Eric Adams opened a joint cybersecurity command center in downtown Brooklyn. ""First time in our nation there's been this level or coordination,"" Hochul said. The Russian threat is serious, especially after reports that some Ukrainian computers were hit by data-wiping software as the invasion was launched. ""The bottom line is we have to be strong and vigilant in every area. Who knows what the heck Putin will do?"" Sen. Chuck Schumer said. Security expert Manny Gomez says vigilance now is imperative. ""New York is the number one target with all its financial centers -- the Dow Jones, the stock exchange, the AMEX, the NASDAQ. If he takes out New York, it's going to be sure chaos. Plus, the repercussions of that because it's New York City, it is the capital of the world internationally, it's going to have a huge impact,"" Gomez said. And its not just Wall Street. The city has a subway system that moves millions of people a day, major corporate headquarters, and some of the world's top teaching hospitals. ""As a security expert, what's your biggest worry for New York State and New York City?"" Kramer asked Gomez. ""My biggest worry are the energy grids because you take one or more of those out, you don't have to take out a single entity like the MTA or a hospital of the stock market. You take them all out,"" he said. Officials have said that hackers make hundreds of attempts to get into our systems every day. Last year, the city Law Department was breached. A hacking group believed to have links to the Chinese government penetrated the MTA last April. A spokesman for Mayor Adams told CBS2 that the former cop is getting regular briefings. ""We're remaining vigilant,"" the spokesman said, ""but we haven't seen any new credible threats at this time.""",3,4.136354316701166,3.3875281014374288,0.7488262152637368,28
2022-02-23,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-children-kharkiv-lessons-on-military-invasion-survival/,Ukrainian school children get lessons on how to survive an invasion as Russian threat looms large,"Fear of a full-scale Russian military invasion is looming large in the city of Kharkiv, just 25 miles from Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. Children are still going to school as residents try to get on with their daily lives, but as the Reuters news agency reports, some kids are now learning how to survive a military attack, along with math and spelling. Reuters visited a school in Kharkiv where students were getting lessons on how to identify various explosives and the importance of bulletproof vests and helmets. They were also practicing evacuation drills and learning first aid. Civilian defense specialist Oleksandr Shevchuk told Reuters the lessons have been popular in the region. In January, students in the capital of Kyiv received a similar lesson after a series of hoax bomb alerts across the country. ""But now we have started giving those drills for children more often, to prevent situations such as children getting injured, or God forbid, death,"" Shevchuk said. Shevchuck said the people who give the lessons want to avoid fueling panic among students and teachers, so they try to keep it as light as possible. ""We try to show them all this, tell them, let them try on our uniforms, bulletproof vests and helmets,"" he said. ""Show them what explosive items can be, so that they can become aware of situations that may happen to them."" Arina Cherkasova, 15, smiled as a bulletproof vest was lowered over her head and the instructors helped her put on a bright orange helmet. ""It was a bit heavy,"" she told Reuters, ""and quite funny doing this in front of friends."" But while the mood was light in the classroom, Ukrainians have become increasingly nervous over the prospect of a full Russian invasion. While Kharkiv is under government control, it is very close to the two regions of Ukraine's Donbas area that are held by pro-Russian rebels, and which Vladimir Putin's regime unilaterally recognized as independent this week. Putin has ordered Russian forces to enter the rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk regions for ""peacekeeping,"" but Ukraine, and the U.S. and its allies, have dismissed the notion of Russian forces entering Ukraine for anything other than a military invasion as ""nonsense."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Kharkiv — which lies just north of the rebel's territory and is home to tank, aircraft and tractor factories — could be targeted if Russia does launch a full invasion. Russia has consistently denied any plans to invade the neighboring country, but President Biden said Tuesday that the invasion had already begun. Nazar, another student, said the lesson he and his classmates got was a reflection of what was already going through their minds. ""We discuss when this incursion might happen... whether it will happen at all, and what to do in general when it happens... if it happens,"" he told Reuters. He said the lesson was ""quite relevant, given the situation that is generally developing between Ukraine and Russia."" ""Scary,"" he added. ""Very scary.""",17,3.279896200502953,5.154106234057506,-1.8742100335545535,20

Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams have opened a first-of-its-kind command center in Brooklyn to oversee cybersecurity across the state. As CBS2's Marcia Kramer reported Tuesday, it's especially important after both the MTA and the city Law Department were hacked last year. We have a subway system that moves millions of people a day, Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange, a sensitive electric grid, the headquarters of many major corporations. The city is a target-rich environment that, given the rising tensions in Eastern Europe, could prove hard to resist for Russian cyberhackers intent on payback. ""The threat of cyberattacks is very real, particularly now. That is the warning we are receiving out of Washington, particularly for a place like New York,"" Hochul said. ""If we don't get a handle on cybersecurity, what COVID did to our bodies, cybersecurity is going to disrupt the anatomy of our city and our state,"" Adams added. Shortly after President Joe Biden announced heavy sanctions against Russia, Hochul, Adams and mayors from across the state announced the opening of a joint security operations center in Brooklyn to combat cyberthreats. Hochul said she has been in constant contact with Washington to discuss the real concern that Russian hackers will try to disrupt things here. ""Sometimes, for every action there's a reaction. Shame on us if we're not anticipating and watching what's happening across the globe,"" Hochul said. The governor made the comparison to the terror attacks on 9/11, equating the efforts we made to ward of physical terror attacks to the need to protect our businesses and critical infrastructure. ""We're on notice what they can do to dismantle our communications systems, our 911 system, our transportation network. They all run on technology. You disrupt that technology, that connectivity, there is an opportunity for rather cataclysmic consequences,"" Hochul said. The joint command center will have 117 desks for state, local and federal officials to assess and monitor potential threats in real time. They will also be able to streamline threat intelligence and responses in the event of a significant cyberattack. Officials say hackers make hundreds and hundreds of attempts to get into our systems every day. Last year, the city Law Department was breached. A hacking group believed to have links to the Chinese government penetrated the MTA last April. ""Another danger, China and Russia may actually work together. They seem to have a very cozy relationship at the moment,"" said Annemarie McAvoy of Clovis Quantum Solutions. McAvoy, a cybersecurity expert, said officials should also be on the lookout for attacks on soft targets. ""Potentially, the hospitals.

2022-02-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-putin-summit-russia-ukraine-invasion/,"Possible Biden-Putin summit on the table as U.S. warns Russia preparing ""full-scale assault"" on Ukraine","Kyiv, Ukraine — U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in principle on Sunday to meet, either in person or via video link, as diplomatic efforts to ease the crisis on Ukraine's borders took on new urgency with U.S. officials telling CBS News that Putin had ordered his troops to proceed with plans to invade. A U.S. official told CBS News that intelligence indicated Russian commanders had received orders to proceed with an invasion of Ukraine and were making specific plans for how to maneuver on the battlefield. The White House made it clear on Sunday that a Biden-Putin summit would not happen if Russia did invade Ukraine. The Kremlin said Monday that it was ""premature"" to discuss any concrete plans for a summit, but confirmed that Putin was ready to meet Mr. Biden if the two countries' top diplomats are able to lay the groundwork. ""The meeting is possible if the heads of state consider it appropriate. Now there is a clear, concrete understanding of the need to continue the dialogue at the level of the ministers,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov are scheduled to meet Thursday — if Russia doesn't launch an invasion before then. ""We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement late Sunday. ""Currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon,"" she added. The announcement of a possible summit between the U.S. and Russian leaders was made by the office of French President Emmanuel Macron, who spent Sunday on the phone with both presidents brokering the tentative agreement. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Monday requested an urgent meeting of U.N. Security Council nations — not necessarily a meeting at the Council — to discuss ways to de-escalate the crisis in the region, as well as the security of his country, reports CBS News' Pamela Falk. CBS News' Pamela Falk at U.N. headquarters said as Russia currently holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council, Moscow gets to decide whether to convene the meeting — unless a Security Council member nation - which Ukraine is not - joins Ukraine's call for it to happen. If that happens, diplomats told Falk that Russia is likely to try to block the meeting. Shelling has intensified, meanwhile, in eastern Ukraine along the line of contact between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists. The conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has simmered for almost eight years, claiming about 14,000 lives, according to Ukrainian officials. But the crossfire increased significantly about a week ago amid warnings from U.S. officials that Russia could stage ""false-flag"" operations — incidents blamed on Ukrainian forces that Moscow could use as a pretext to invade. The Russian-backed rebels claimed on Monday that four civilians had been killed in their territory in Donbas over the last 24 hours, according to The Associated Press. Russian security officials were quoted by the country's media, meanwhile, as saying a shell from Ukraine had struck a guard post just across the border, inside Russia's Rostov region. There were no casualties reported in that alleged strike, but then there was a more serious accusation. Russia's military claimed that two vehicles carrying Ukrainian ""saboteurs"" into Russia had been destroyed, and that ""as a result of clashes, five people who violated the Russian border"" were killed. It was the first claim by Russia that Ukrainians had breached the country's border — a claim that was quickly labeled ""fake news"" by Ukraine's government, which said there were no Ukrainian forces operating in Russia's Rostov border region. Thousands of ethnic Russian civilians from Ukraine's rebel-occupied Donbas region have poured across the border into Rostov in recent days after being urged to do so by the separatist administrations there. The rebels said the evacuation of women and children was necessary due to purported Ukrainian shelling and plans to attack the region. Ukraine has denied attacking rebel-held territory, or firing any shells into Russian territory, saying instead that the separatists have been ""cynically firing from residential areas using civilians as shields."" The Ukrainian military's policy for years has been not to return fire along the front line unless there's deemed to be an imminent threat to life.",29,6.253803680089278,1.8097906625895155,4.4440130174997625,18
2022-02-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-shelling-donbas-nerves-fraying-in-kyiv/,"As fighting escalates with Russian-backed rebels, rising concern is testing Ukrainians' sense of calm","Kyiv, Ukraine — For millions of Ukrainians, there is no evacuation plan if Russia does invade their country. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, people across Ukraine have been on edge for weeks, hoping for any sign of a peaceful resolution to the crisis on the country's borders. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the possibility of a summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, saying he hoped it might lead to Russia pulling back the estimated 170,000-190,000 troops massed around his country's northern, eastern and southern borders. But the glimmer of hope for diplomacy came at the end of a weekend full of dramatic developments. As D'Agata reports, Russia made its most elaborate and choreographed show of force to date, holding nuclear military drills by land, sea and air. And while President Putin was on hand to observe the war games personally, his government knew full well it wasn't just Putin watching. Far more worrying, however, was the announcement that tens of thousands of Russian troops in Belarus — poised to strike from just across Ukraine's northwest border — will remain in the country indefinitely despite previous pledges from Moscow to bring them home after exercises there concluded on Sunday. Meanwhile, there has been a dramatic escalation in shelling by Russian-backed separatists on the front lines in eastern Ukraine. All this while the rebel leaders ramped up the propaganda war, warning of an alleged impending assault by Ukrainian forces. The rebels say tens of thousands of civilians have been evacuated from their territory into Russia, for their own safety. That has raised fears that Putin might use the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians to justify an invasion of Ukraine. Despite the ominous developments over the weekend, however, it was still business as usual in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv on Monday. But D'Agata says the prevailing calm in the city is being tested more every day by a rising sense of concern. ""Of course I am worried about my safety, of my family and my children, of course,"" Kyiv resident Maria told CBS News. But Alexei, who also lives in the capital, said he had no plans to leave the city yet, ""because I think many, many, many information in internet, in social media, is just fake."" He said he wished people would ""keep calm and believe in Ukraine."" Natalia, who also spoke to CBS News on the streets of Kyiv, admitted to being afraid, however. ""This is our motherland, our people, our children, and that's why I'm afraid,"" she told D'Agata. Hundreds of women took part in survival and self-defense courses over the weekend in Kyiv, but they, like all Ukrainians, know their country's forces are no match for the military might of Russia. Nobody in Ukraine wants to believe a full-scale invasion is either imminent or inevitable. The sharp escalation in fighting in the east is the most pressing concern in Kyiv right now. Over the weekend, D'Agata and his team went to the front line of the conflict that has simmered already for eight years, visiting a location not far from a recent artillery attack. Ukrainian commanders there told CBS News the escalation was like nothing they'd seen in years.",29,1.7314460459342265,2.0352315010527993,-0.3037854551185728,20
2022-02-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-troop-drills-belarus-violence-spikes/,Russia extends troop drills near Ukraine as violence spikes,"Kyiv, Ukraine — Russia extended military drills near Ukraine's northern borders Sunday amid increased fears that two days of sustained shelling along the contact line between soldiers and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine could spark an invasion. The exercises, originally set to end Sunday, brought a sizable contingent of Russian forces to neighboring Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north. The presence of the Russian troops raised concern that they could be used to sweep down on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The announcement came from the defense minister of Belarus, who said the two countries would ""continue testing the response forces."" Western leaders warned that Russia was poised to attack its neighbor, which is surrounded on three sides by about 150,000 Russian soldiers, warplanes and equipment. Russia held nuclear drills Saturday as well as the conventional exercises in Belarus, and has ongoing naval drills off the coast in the Black Sea. The United States and many European countries have alleged for months that Russia is trying to create pretexts to invade. They have threatened massive, immediate sanctions if it does. A top European Union official, Charles Michel, said Sunday that ""the big question remains: does the Kremlin want dialogue?"" ""We cannot forever offer an olive branch while Russia conducts missile tests and continues to amass troops,"" Michel, the president of the European Council, said at the Munich Security Conference. He said, ""One thing is certain: if there is further military aggression, we will react with massive sanctions."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to choose a place where the two leaders could meet to try to resolve the crisis. Russia has denied plans to invade. ""Ukraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement,"" Zelensky said Saturday at an international security conference in Munich, Germany. There was no immediate response from the Kremlin. Separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine on Saturday ordered a full military mobilization and sent more civilians to Russia, which has issued about 700,000 passports to residents of the rebel-held territories. Claims that Russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action. Officials in the separatist territories claimed Ukrainian forces launched several artillery attacks over the past day and that two civilians were killed in an unsuccessful assault on a village near the Russian border. Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday emphasized the significance of the moment that Europe faces. ""We're talking about the potential for war in Europe,"" Harris said at the Munich Security Conference. ""It's been over 70 years, and through those 70 years ... there has been peace and security."" Ukraine's leader criticized the U.S. and other Western nations for holding back on new sanctions for Russia. Zelensky, in comments before the conference, also questioned the West's refusal to allow Ukraine to join NATO immediately. Putin has demanded that NATO not take Ukraine as a member. Harris stood by the U.S. decision to hold off on sanctions but said she wouldn't second guess Zelensky's ""desires for his country."" In new signs of fears that a war could start within days, Germany and Austria told their citizens to leave Ukraine. German air carrier Lufthansa canceled flights to the capital, Kyiv, and to Odessa, a Black Sea port that could be a key target in an invasion. NATO's liaison office in Kyiv said it was relocating staff to Brussels and to the western Ukraine city of Lviv. President Biden said late Friday that based on the latest American intelligence, he was now ""convinced"" that Putin has decided to invade Ukraine in coming days and assault the capital. Lines of communication between Moscow and the West remain open: the American and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Putin on Sunday for nearly two hours before a call with the Ukrainian president. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week. Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. Ukraine and the separatist leaders traded accusations of escalation. Russia on Saturday said at least two shells fired from a government-held part of eastern Ukraine landed across the border, but Ukraine's foreign minister dismissed that claim as ""a fake statement."" Top Ukrainian military officials came under a shelling attack during a tour of the front of the nearly eight-year separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. The officials fled to a bomb shelter before hustling from the area, according to an Associated Press journalist who was on the tour. The military on Sunday closed a key checkpoint leading to the separatist region after it came under repeated shelling. Elsewhere on the front lines, Ukrainian soldiers said they were under orders not to return fire. Zahar Leshushun, peering into the distance with a periscope, had followed the news all day from a trench where he is posted near the town of Zolote. ""Right now, we don't respond to their fire because ..."" the soldier started to explain before being interrupted by the sound of an incoming shell. ""Oh! They are shooting at us now. They are aiming at the command post."" Sporadic violence has broken out for years along the line separating Ukrainian forces from the Russia-backed separatists, but the spike seen in recent days is orders of magnitude higher than anything recently recorded by international monitors: nearly 1,500 explosions recorded in 24 hours. Denis Pushilin, the head of the pro-Russia separatist government in Ukraine's Donetsk region, cited an ""immediate threat of aggression"" from Ukrainian forces in his announcement of a call to arms. Ukrainian officials vehemently denied having plans to take rebel-controlled areas by force. ""I appeal to all the men in the republic who can hold weapons to defend their families, their children, wives, mothers,"" Pushilin said. ""Together we will achieve the coveted victory that we all need."" A similar statement followed from his counterpart in the Luhansk region. On Friday, the rebels began evacuating civilians to Russia with an announcement that appeared to be part of their and Moscow's efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor. Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation of civilians to Russia show that the files were created two days ago, the AP confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin's effort to come up with an invasion pretext could include staged, prerecorded videos. Ukraine's military said two of its soldiers died in firing from the separatist side on Saturday. Authorities in Russia's Rostov region, which borders eastern Ukraine, declared a state of emergency because of the influx of evacuees. Media reports on Saturday described chaos at some of the camps assigned to accommodate them. Putin ordered the Russian government to offer 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, an amount equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in eastern Ukraine. The separatist regions of Ukraine, like much of the country's east, are majority Russian speaking. Putin on Tuesday repeated allegations of a ""genocide"" there in explaining the need to protect them. One of the evacuees, a Donetsk resident who identified himself only as Vyacheslav, blamed Ukraine's government for his plight. ""Let them calm down,"" he said. ""It's our fault we don't want to speak Ukrainian, is that it?""",29,1.7530186694328003,6.741054104624739,-4.988035435191939,18
2022-02-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/northrop-grumman-launches-international-space-station-supply-mission/,Northrop Grumman launches space station supply mission,"A Northrop Grumman Antares rocket streaked away from Virginia's Eastern Shore Saturday, boosting a Cygnus cargo ship into orbit with more than four tons of supplies and equipment bound for the International Space Station. The rocket's two Russian-built RD-181 first stage engines roared to life at 12:40 p.m. EST, throttled up to full thrust and smoothly pushed the vehicle away from pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) at NASA's Wallops Island, Virginia, flight test facility. Arcing away to the southeast, the first stage, designed and built in Ukraine, quickly powered out of the dense lower atmosphere and fell away, handing off to a Northrop Grumman-built solid-fuel second stage motor for the remainder of the climb to orbit. Five-and-a-half minutes later, the Cygnus cargo ship separated from the spent second stage and the freighter set off after the International Space Station, on track to complete an automated two-day rendezvous at 4:35 a.m. Monday. At that point, astronauts Raja Chari and Kayla Barron, operating the station's robot arm, will latch onto a grapple fixture so ground controllers in Houston can remotely pull the spacecraft in for berthing at the lab's Earth-facing Unity module. On board for Northrop Grumman's 17th space station resupply run: more than 8,300 pounds of equipment and supplies, including nearly a ton of science gear. ""Over the course of a year, there are hundreds of experiments on the ISS, and during the average six-month increment, we can have roughly 300 investigations ongoing,"" said Jennifer Buchli, deputy chief scientist. ""This flight brings up roughly 40 science investigations for NASA, the U.S. National Lab and our international partners."" Also on board: more than two tons of station supplies, spare parts, computer gear, solar array mounting hardware, crew clothing and fresh food, including avocados, tomatoes, grapefruit, pears, blueberries and ice cream. In a first for the Cygnus program, the spacecraft has been modified to enable its main engine to raise the station's altitude, a service normally provided by engines in Russian modules and Progress supply ships. ""We've optimized the Cygnus configuration to remove some secondary structural elements to maximize the cargo load and also allow for full fuel load that enables a new operational capability, a reboost,"" said Steve Krein, Northrop Grumman vice president of civil and commercial space. While the space station typically flies at an altitude of about 260 miles, enough atoms and molecules are present in the extreme upper atmosphere to slow the football-field-size spacecraft ever so slightly, causing it to lose altitude as it races along at nearly five miles per second. Periodic rocket firings are required to maintain the desired orbit. Krein said the Northrop Grumman spacecraft is now equipped with a ""gimbaled delta velocity engine, or DVE, that will allow Cygnus to provide reboost, or orbit-raising capability, for station during berthed operations."" The first such maneuver is expected in April. Unlike SpaceX's all-American Dragon cargo ship and Falcon 9 rocket, the Cygnus and its Antares 230+ booster include major components built in other countries. The RD-181 engines are built by NPO Energomash in Russia and other major elements of the first stage are provided by KB Yuzhnoye/Yuzhmash in Ukraine. Asked about the company's contingency plans given the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kurt Eberly, Northrop Grumman director of space launch, said ""we're obviously monitoring the situation, and hopefully it can be resolved."" In the meantime, ""we have all of the hardware we need for all the missions we have on contract with NASA,"" he said. ""So that includes NG-17, 18 and 19. All that hardware is here at Wallops. And so, hopefully, that will tide us over until these tensions can subside and we can be back to normal operating procedure.""",3,8.046346402418742,6.6054998669217735,1.4408465354969682,6
2022-02-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-cyber-attacks-white-house/,White House believes Russia responsible for cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks and defense sites,"The White House believes Russia is responsible for recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine's major banks and Ministry of Defense, a top administration official said Friday. Deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger made the attribution at the White House, as tensions escalated between Russia and Ukraine. ""We believe that the Russian government is responsible for widespread cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks this week,"" Neuberger said. ""We have technical information that links the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU. GRU infrastructure was seen transmitting high volumes of communication to Ukraine based IP addresses and domains."" Neuberger noted that the denial of service or ""DDoS"" and spam attack had ""limited impact"" within Ukraine, but said the most recent incident of malicious digital activity could precede ""more disruptive cyberattacks accompanying a potential further invasion of Ukraine's sovereign territory."" The U.S. has shared underlying intelligence with Ukraine and with European partners, Neuberger added. Top cyber officials said the U.S. had worked quickly to connect the dots on the GRU-linked attack in order to ""call out the behavior quickly."" The U.S.' public attribution of the attacks to Russia coincided with a similar announcement by U.K. officials Friday. ""The decision to publicly attribute this incident underlines the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity,"" Britain's Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said in a statement. ""This activity is yet another example of Russia's aggressive acts against Ukraine,"" the statement added. Ukrainian officials called this week's DDoS attacks the worst of their kind in the country's history, despite the unsophisticated tactics behind the cyber harassment. According to data collected by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, internet traffic hitting Ukrainian websites during the DDoS attack was ""three orders of magnitude more than regularly observed traffic,"" according to Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike. John Hultquist, vice president of Intelligence Analysis at cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said it's important not to misjudge the purpose of these attacks. ""The disruption they cause is designed to intimidate and undermine and is not an end unto itself,"" Hultquist said in a statement to CBS News. ""Ultimately, we should not judge these incidents by their technical complexity. Though they turned off the lights in Ukraine, the GRU's most important cyber operation may have been when they hacked and leaked information during the 2016 elections,"" he added. Earlier this week, Under Secretary for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told ""CBS Mornings"" that the Russians were likely behind the attack, citing their past actions. ""Who is best at this, who uses this weapon all around the world? Obviously, the Kremlin,"" Nuland said. ""I think what's most important is that these cyberattacks were not very successful,"" she noted, commending Ukrainian officials for responding quickly and helping the websites recover. Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team or ""CERT"" released a technical analysis of Wednesday's campaign on Ukrainian government agencies and banks on Friday. Ukrainian officials confirmed that the Mirai botnet, malware commonly used in botnets during large-scale network attacks, was employed in these cyberattacks. Neuberger told reporters Friday that there is currently no intelligence suggesting specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S. homeland. Over the past few months and weeks, U.S. cyber officials have redoubled outreach within the private sector, urging the nation's critical infrastructure owners and operators to bolster cyber defenses. ""Given the rising tensions and the potential invasion of Ukraine by Russia, we've actually been leaning forward to inform our industry partners of potential threats,"" Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly said Friday during an Aspen Institute panel. ""It really is part of a paradigm shift that I've been talking about for awhile now — of moving from the government being reactive to being much more proactive."" Easterly noted that outreach included ""classified and unclassified briefings to our private sector and state and local partners regarding evolving cybersecurity risks."" The Treasury Department convened an in-person briefing with CEOs of major U.S. banks, Thursday, alongside officials from the FBI, CISA and White House. Participants included J.P. Morgan and Citibank. On Friday, CISA released an advisory warning critical infrastructure owners and operators of an uptick in sophisticated foreign influence operations employing misinformation, disinformation and mal-information (MDM). Easterly pushed organizations to ""lower their threshold"" for reporting anomalous cyber activity to the U.S. government Friday. ""Just get that information to the government,"" she urged.",3,7.6948524042524555,4.97563109000078,2.7192213142516755,1
2022-02-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-shelling-donbas-buildup-latest-us-invasion-pretext-blinken-lavrov/,Shelling intensifies in eastern Ukraine amid concern Russia's creating a pretext for an invasion,"Kyiv — Ukrainian forces and the pro-Russian separatists they're fighting in the country's east reported a second day of increased shelling on Friday, as the leaders of the rebels' self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics accused the Ukrainian government of planning an imminent attack. The rebel administrations in the two breakaway regions announced plans to evacuate thousands of civilians into neighboring Russia. Western leaders say an escalation in the fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region — which has simmered for almost eight years — could be part of Russian efforts to create a ""false-flag"" pretext to invade. ""Ukraine is not your enemy, but those who want to defend you against Ukraine are. Do not heed rumours about some offensive operation,"" Ukraine's defense minister said in a speech Friday. ""We have no intentions to conduct any force actions towards the ORDLO (Donbas) or the Crimea. At all. We will move by the political and diplomatic way. Because there are our citizens and we will not put them in danger."" The Ukrainian government's reassurance didn't appear to be calming nerves in the rebel-held region, however, with social media photos purporting to show people lining up to take money out of banks. Russian officials seemed to know little about the evacuation plans. Asked if Russia was ready to accept thousands of refugees from Donbas, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday: ""I don't know with whom there were contacts, I don't have information."" The reports came as America's defense chief said the United States had still seen no drawdown of the Russian forces massed around Ukraine's borders. The U.S. envoy to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was meeting in Germany on Friday, said the Russian deployment around Ukraine's borders had actually swelled to between 169,000 and 190,000 troops — the biggest military buildup in Europe since World War II. ""Although Russia has announced it is moving its forces back to garrison, we have yet to see that. In fact, we see more forces moving into that region, that border region,"" U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said during a press conference alongside his Polish counterpart on Friday. ""We also see them going through, continuing to prepare, by doing things you'd expect elements — military elements — to do as they were preparing to launch an attack."" But Russia continued issuing new claims that some of its soldiers and weapons were returning to their bases after planned military exercises, even as the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin would personally oversee massive naval drills on Saturday involving the country's nuclear forces. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a stark assessment of the situation to the U.N. Security Council, saying Washington believed Russia was planning a full-scale attack on Ukraine. He echoed President Joe Biden's warning that the U.S. believes Russia is trying to manufacture an excuse for war. ""We have reason to believe they are engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in,"" Mr. Biden said. The president is scheduled to host a call on Friday with the leaders of NATO, the European Union, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania. Blinken, meanwhile, was in Munich with Vice President Kamala Harris, but his spokesman announced overnight that he is now scheduled to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""late next week,"" unless Russia invades. CBS News correspondent Christina Ruffini, at the OSCE meeting, said Harris was slated to meet during the conference with Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky about the Russian buildup along his country's borders. Ruffini said it was a risky move for Zelensky to leave his country with more than half of Russia's armed forces moving into battle positions around its borders, but he was keen to ensure that other world leaders weren't making decisions that directly affect him in Munich without him in the room. Harris was not meeting with any Russian officials over the several days of the OSCE conference, Ruffini noted, because the Russian delegation opted not to come — knowing they would have been at the center of the wrong kind of attention. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made an urgent plea for deescalation to the gathered leaders at the Munich security conference, CBS News' Pamela Falk reported. ""During much of the Cold War, there were mechanisms that enabled the protagonists to calculate risks and use back-channels to prevent crises,"" Guterres said. Now, ""miscommunication or miscalculation can make a minor incident between powers escalate out of control, causing incalculable harm.""",29,3.0383225629315005,1.4189558538813694,1.6193667090501311,18

Lukashenko is due to hold talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday. ""If necessary, if such stupid and mindless steps are taken by our rivals and opponents, we will deploy not only nuclear weapons, but super-nuclear and up-and-coming ones to protect our territory,"" Lukashenko said, according to the state-run Belta news agency. ""But if there are no threats to Belarus from unfriendly countries, then nuclear weapons are not needed here for a hundred years,"" he added. Ex-Soviet Belarus, which is not a nuclear power, will later this month hold a vote on constitutional reforms which could make it legal for Belarus to host nuclear weapons. Lukashenko, an autocrat who has been in power since 1994, promised the referendum in the wake of historic protests against his disputed reelection. The constitutional reforms would also allow Lukashenko to remain in office until 2035. Moscow and Minsk are currently holding joint military exercises in Belarus, exacerbating concerns that Russia is planning to escalate the conflict in Ukraine. Belarus and Russia had said that all Russian soldiers and military equipment would leave after the drills conclude on February 20, but on Thursday, Lukashenko suggested that withdrawal date could change, depending on his meeting with Putin on Friday. ""If we make a decision, we will withdraw in a day. If we make a decision for a month, they will stay for a month. The Armed Forces [of the Russian Federation] will be here for as long as necessary,"" Lukashenko said. ""This is our land, our territory."" The Kremlin issued no response to the Belarusian leader's remarks on Thursday, but earlier Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated that his country's troops and weapons would leave Belarus when the joint military exercises conclude on February 20.",29,1.5228129351683075,2.431948592517264,-0.9091356573489564,21

""The situation could worsen very quickly, and we're very worried about that and are urging all Americans to leave the country now,"" Chargé d'Affaires Kristina Kvien, the most senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, told D'Agata. Her call was made more urgent by satellite images appearing to show even more Russian forces, and a new pontoon bridge just a few miles from the border with Ukraine. On Thursday, an American official told CBS News that not only were Russian troops moving out of assembly areas, closer to the Ukrainian border and into attack positions, but the Russian units remaining behind had begun fortifying their positions. On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv shut down and relocated a core team to an undisclosed location in the western city of Lviv, close to the border with Poland. ""We're going to do everything we can to help American citizens,"" Kvien told D'Agata. She said the U.S. diplomats were working closely with humanitarian organizations ""that might help with flows of not just Americans, frankly, but Ukrainians as well."" Families have already begun to flee eastern Ukraine. Natalia and Olexsii brought their young children to Lviv, about 300 miles from their home in Kharkiv, a city only about 30 miles from the Russian border. Asked what made them decide it was time to get out, Natalia told D'Agata it was uncomfortable to sit at their home with two children and just wait for ""something unusual"" to happen. It was ""a worrying thing,"" she said. Nobody in Lviv wants to see a war, but the city's mayor told CBS News they're ready. Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said if there is a full-scale Russian invasion, Lviv is ready to take in anybody who needs help. ""It is my duty,"" he said, and the ""responsibility of my city… I open my door, I open my... home."" The entire city is opening its home — but praying it doesn't come to that. CBS News was told that city workers in Lviv had been encouraged to undergo training in firearms and medical treatment, and the city has stockpiled three months' worth of medical supplies.",17,4.658375866025064,1.9496581338233874,2.708717732201676,20

As the reported shelling raised tensions — and despite Russia's claims to be pulling forces back from Ukraine's borders — the Biden administration said ""evidence on the ground"" showed Russia was ""moving toward an imminent invasion"" of its neighbor. ""We have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in,"" President Biden told reporters on Thursday. ""Every indication we have is they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine."" The United States and its NATO partners have dismissed Moscow's assertions of an initial force drawdown along Ukraine's northern, eastern and southern borders, saying that President Vladimir Putin's military appears instead to be bolstering troop numbers. America and its allies have also warned for weeks that Russia could try to stage a ""false-flag"" incident — including a faked attack by Ukrainian forces on the rebels in Donbas — to use as a pretext to invade Ukraine. On Thursday, amid the claims of shelling from both sides, NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was ""concerned"" that Russia was trying to do just that. With U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken making an unscheduled stop in New York to address a Security Council meeting requested by Ukraine, a senior State Department official echoed Stoltenberg's concerns about possible Russian preparations to fabricate a pretext for an invasion. The official said it wasn't immediately clear whether the shelling was actually the false-flag incident the U.S. has worried about, but called it ""perhaps the most perilous moment for peace and security since the end of the Cold War."" ""We've said for some time the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict,"" U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, in Brussels for a NATO meeting, said on Thursday, adding that the allies would ""be watching this very closely."" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas Greenfield told reporters that she had personally asked Blinken to address the Security Council on Thursday ""to convey the gravity of the situation,"" reported CBS News' Pamela Falk. ""The evidence on the ground is that Russia is moving toward an imminent invasion. This is a crucial moment,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""This morning's Council meeting should not distract us from that fact — it should focus on what is happening right now in Ukraine."" The Russian-backed separatists who control two breakaway districts within the Donbas region, Luhansk and Donetsk, claimed on Thursday that Ukrainian forces had opened fire on a number of villages inside their territory, but that they were still checking for casualties. Officials from the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk ""People's Republics"" said Ukrainian security forces ""continue to flagrantly violate the ceasefire regime using heavy weapons."" Ukraine's military said it was the separatists who had violated the ceasefire by shelling government-held villages, including a mortar that hit a kindergarten but caused no casualties. It has long been the policy of the Ukraine's armed forces in Donbas not to respond to provocations from the rebels unless their lives are in immediate danger. On Thursday, Ukraine's military said in a statement that its forces ""took measures"" to respond to the incoming rebel fire, but provided no details. There have been regular skirmishes between the two sides in Donbas since 2014, when Russia last sent in troops to support the rebels, and they have routinely accused each other of violating a ceasefire. Russia's 2014 invasion led to Putin's unilateral annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Ceasefire agreements signed in 2014 and 2015, known as the Minsk Accords, halted large-scale combat but the war has simmered for almost eight years, leaving 14,000 people dead, according to Ukraine's government. Russia's recent buildup of around 150,000 troops just over the border from the Donbas region in the east, in Belarus to the north and Crimea to the south, which began in the autumn, has sent tensions soaring. Russia claims the surge of forces has always been for military exercises and that it poses no threat to Ukraine or any other nation, but has refused to offer any real explanation for the biggest buildup of military might in Europe since the Cold War. Defense officials in Moscow have said since Tuesday that troops and military hardware are pulling back, having completed some of the drills. Western intelligence officials say, on the contrary, that Russia has moved roughly 7,000 more troops close to the borders in recent days. On Thursday an American official told CBS News that not only were Russian troops moving out of assembly areas, closer to the Ukrainian border and into attack positions, but the Russian units remaining behind had begun fortifying their positions. Satellite imagery shows a recently constructed pontoon bridge over a river in Belarus very near the border, and British officials have said Russia is also building field hospitals on Russian soil near the Ukrainian frontier. President Joe Biden said this week that Putin's forces remain in position to launch an invasion at any time, at short notice, if the Russian leader decides to order one. Mr. Biden, his European counterparts and the G7 have all warned Putin for months that any new invasion of Ukraine would be met with ""swift and severe"" sanctions. Ukraine has aspirations to join NATO but is not a member of the Western military alliance now, and the U.S. and other NATO states have ruled out sending troops in to back up Ukraine's forces directly. The transatlantic partners have made it very clear, however, that if any Russian aggression were to threaten a NATO member — and there are many in the region — they would ""stand united to defend each other."" The U.S. and its allies continue to send more troops and weaponry into Eastern and Northern European NATO states to bolster the alliance's defenses. But American officials told CBS News on Wednesday that the window for a potential Russian attack against Ukraine had been extended by four to five days, suggesting hopes for a diplomatic solution to the crisis had not completely evaporated. More than a week of intense talks have yielded no signs of significant progress, however, and as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said bluntly on Thursday, ""the situation near the borders of Russia can ignite at any moment."" After waiting for weeks for Moscow to respond fully to a number of proposals sent from Washington to the Kremlin in a bid to find anything the two sides can agree on to ease the tension, the Biden administration confirmed on Thursday that it had a formal reply. A State Department official said it was handed to U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan in Moscow. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier that his country would publish its response within hours of delivering it to Washington.

But CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports there was a definite change in the tone on Tuesday morning. Russia is talking more about diplomacy, and making a big deal of pulling back what may be just a few tanks and troops from Ukraine's borders. In the city to which the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine has moved all its staff and operations, the conflicting information painted a confusing picture. The State Department said the move from capital Kyiv to the western city of Lviv was a temporary relocation prompted by the ongoing buildup of Russian forces at the border. The move came as a U.S. official told CBS News that Russia had moved rocket launchers and long-range artillery into firing positions near Ukraine's border. New satellite images show ground troops moving from staging areas toward combat positions, and newly deployed Russian bombers. Yet the Russian Ministry of Defense released video on Tuesday claiming to show the pullback of some tanks. It said troops were being withdrawn after the conclusion of some military exercises in the border region. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said there was cause for ""cautious optimism"" on Tuesday, but that the alliance had not yet seen any signs of deescalation on the ground. He stressed that in NATO's view, Russia remained poised for a potential attack on Ukraine. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also accused Russia of sending ""mixed signals,"" welcoming what he said were ""signs of a diplomatic opening,"" but warning the latest intelligence was ""still not encouraging."" Johnson said Russian forces were building field hospitals near Ukraine's borders, and more battalions were moving closer to the borders, which he said, ""can only be construed as preparation for an invasion."" Diplomatic efforts continued, meanwhile. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday as Russia insists it wants to keep negotiating. Amid the uncertainty, American IT executive Heath Morrison decided to move his family from Kyiv to Lviv. ""I don't feel a huge amount of anxiety right now,"" he told D'Agata, adding that while he wasn't worried about his personal safety, he did ""worry a lot for Ukraine."" Morrison said his family, and especially his six-year-old son, were a serious consideration, as he was ""certainly worried about his exposure to chaos or anything like that."" ""We've been paying a lot of attention to all of the news and the circumstances in the last several months,"" he told CBS News, explaining that they had decided to move if and when they saw major international organizations starting to pull people out of the Ukrainian capital, ""not to leave, but to get a little further from Kyiv, where we had more options."" If there is a mass exodus of people from Ukraine, including Americans, it's likely they'll head to Lviv. The vibrant city in the country's west is thought — or at least hoped — to be safer than other parts of Ukraine. Crucially, Lviv is also only about an hour's drive from the Polish border. The U.S. has troops based in Poland, which, unlike Ukraine, is a NATO member. D'Agata and his team visited that border and found a typical line of tractor-trailers and a scattering of cars crossing the frontier. In other words, still all quiet on the western front.",29,1.0266075789477438,7.453308729922524,-6.426701150974781,21
2022-02-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/ransomware-gang-says-it-has-hacked-san-francisco-49ers/,Ransomware Gang Says It Has Hacked San Francisco 49ers,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers have been hit by a ransomware attack, with cyber criminals claiming they stole some of the football team's financial data. The ransomware gang BlackByte recently posted some of the purportedly stolen team documents on a dark web site in a file marked ""2020 Invoices."" The gang did not make any of its ransom demands public or specify how much data it had stolen or encrypted. The team, which is among the most valuable and storied franchises in the NFL and lost a close playoff game two week ago, said in a statement Sunday that it recently became aware of a ""network security incident"" that had disrupted some of its corporate IT network systems. The 49ers said they'd notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firms to assist. ""To date, we have no indication that this incident involves systems outside of our corporate network, such as those connected to Levi's Stadium operations or ticket holders,"" the team said in a statement, referencing its home stadium. News of the attack comes two days after the FBI and U.S. Secret Service issued an alert on BlackByte ransomware, saying it had ""compromised multiple US and foreign businesses, including entities in at least three US critical infrastructure sectors"" since November. Ransomware gangs, which hack targets and hold their data hostage through encryption, have caused widespread havoc in the last year with high-profile attacks on the world's largest meat-packing company, the biggest U.S. fuel pipeline and other targets. Western governments have pledged to crack down on the cyber criminals, who operate largely in and around Russia, but have little to show for their efforts. In the past month, ransomware victims have included operators of maritime fuel depots in Belgium and Germany and media outlets in Portugal. A cyberattack on the wireless provider Vodafone in Portugal this past week had all the hallmarks of ransomware, though the company's CEO for Portugal said it received no ransomware demand. BlackByte is a ransomware-as-a-service group. That means it's decentralized, with independent operators developing the malware, hacking into organizations or filling other roles. It's part of a trend of ransomware groups becoming increasing professionalized. A recent report by the FBI, NSA and others said that ransomware operators are even setting up an arbitration system to resolve payment disputes among themselves. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm Emisoft, said BlackByte's malware, like many ransomware variants, is hardcoded to not encrypt systems that use Russian or languages used by certain Russian allies.

2022-02-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/russia-ukraine-news-moscow-says-troops-pulling-back-from-border/,Russia says some troops pulling back from Ukraine border,"Russia's Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that some of the forces the country had massed close to its border with Ukraine over the last four months were being pulled back to their bases, but the U.S. and its allies were in no rush to accept the remarks as an indication that Russia is, in fact, deescalating. The buildup of well over 100,000 troops and a significant portion of Russia's military hardware along Ukraine's borders has drawn increasingly dire warnings from the United States of a possible imminent invasion. The Russian government has always maintained the buildup poses no threat to Ukraine and that its troops would return to their bases after carrying out what Moscow insists are just military exercises. But the biggest buildup of ground forces and war machines in Europe since the Cold War has set off alarm bells for months in the West. Not even 20 hours prior to Moscow's announcement on Tuesday, a U.S. official told CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin that some of the Russian hardware taking part in the drills had started to move into ""attack positions"" close to the Ukrainian border. U.S. officials have not confirmed any Russian redeployments away from Ukraine's border, but Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told reporters on Tuesday that some units that have been operating for weeks along the country's southwest border with Ukraine, ""having completed their tasks, have already begun loading onto rail and road transport and today they will begin moving to their military garrisons. Individual units will march on their own as part of military columns."" The ministry provided no numbers, and it was unclear exactly where along Russia's long border with Ukraine the movements might be occurring. Russian news agency Interfax cited the country's Southern district command, however, as saying that some forces were being moved from Crimea, the southern peninsula of Ukraine that Russia annexed in 2014, back to bases in southern Russia's Dagestan and North Ossetia regions. If confirmed, the movements could be taken as the first step by Russia to deescalate a crisis that has brought the world closer to a major conflict in Europe than it has been in decades. President Joe Biden has warned that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine could leave 100,000 civilians dead and fundamentally change the world. The U.S. and its NATO allies have heaped pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin's government to take a step back from the brink of war, threatening a ""swift and severe"" response to any invasion of Ukraine, in the form of international sanctions. After the Russian defense ministry's announcement on Tuesday, Ukraine's foreign minister said his country's diplomatic efforts with the U.S. and European allies had managed to ward off a Russian invasion. ""We and our allies have managed to prevent Russia from any further escalation. It is already the middle of February, and you see that diplomacy is continuing to work,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. He stressed that Russia's claims of a pullback from the borders would have to be verified, however: ""If we see a withdrawal, we will believe in a deescalation,"" he was quoted as saying by the Interfax Ukraine news agency. It was not clear how significant Russia's initial step back from the border — if confirmed at all — would be considered by Washington or NATO. About 30,000 Russian forces are still in Belarus on Ukraine's northwest border for joint drills with Belarusian troops, and they have been operating within 30 miles of the frontier. In total, Russia is believed to have at least 130,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders, according to two sources who spoke to CBS News on Monday, citing information available to them at the time. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said while there was cause for ""cautious optimism"" with diplomacy continuing, the alliance had not yet seen any signs of deescalation on the ground, and he stressed that in NATO's view, Russia remained poised for a potential attack on Ukraine. ""The movement of Russian capabilities doesn't represent real deescalation,"" Stoltenberg said, noting previous shuffling of military assets around on Russian soil. ""What we need to see is significant and enduring withdrawal of forces, troops and the heavy equipment."" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith, speaking to reporters on Tuesday from Brussels, said America and its partners would ""have to verify that and take a look."" ""You may remember in late December, there were some similar claims that came out of Moscow that they were deescalating and in fact, facts on the ground did not support that claim,"" Smith said. ""So we want to make sure we understand what they're talking about when they say deescalation and we want to verify that that is in fact what's happening."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also accused Russia of sending ""mixed signals,"" welcoming what he said were ""signs of a diplomatic opening,"" but warning the latest intelligence was ""still not encouraging."" Johnson said Russian forces were building field hospitals near Ukraine's borders, and more battalions were moving closer to the borders, which he said could ""only be construed as preparation for an invasion."" American officials have warned for weeks that Russia could launch an attack on Ukraine in a variety of ways, including a ground assault from Belarus or Russian soil, a major cyberattack, or a so-called ""false-flag"" attack staged to look like an assault by Ukrainian forces against pro-Russian fighters that Moscow might use as a pretext to launch an invasion. Russia backs separatists in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, where the rebels have fought a simmering war with Ukrainian troops since Putin last sent his forces into Ukraine in 2014, unilaterally annexing the Crimean Peninsula in the process. Earlier on Tuesday, a Russian envoy to the European Union was quoted as saying that Russia would ""respond"" if any Russian ""citizens"" were killed anywhere, including in Donbas. The Kremlin blasted the escalating warnings from Washington about a possible imminent Russian attack on Ukraine as ""dangerous ""hysteria"" on Tuesday, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov mocking the U.S. for suggesting it had knowledge of Moscow's intentions. Peskov asked reporters if the ""exact time of the start of the war"" had been published. Russia was keeping the pressure on, meanwhile. Its parliament passed legislation on Tuesday that calls on the country to formally recognize two regions in Donbas held by pro-Russian rebels as independent from Ukraine. It would be a hugely provocative move and likely lead to an escalation of the nearly-eight-year-old conflict in Donbas, but Peskov said Putin had made no final decisions on whether to back the initiative. Smith, America's NATO ambassador, said Tuesday that if Russia did recognize the breakaway regions, ""I think it's a clear violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity and its sovereignty... so that would obviously be a new shift in in the escalation, and I think we would monitor that very closely."" But the West's diplomatic blitz continued. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, a day after he met in Kyiv with Ukraine's president. Peskov told reporters the negotiations between Putin and Scholz were expected to be lengthy as they discuss ""security guarantees"" and the ""unprecedented tension"" in Europe. Clearly there was hope in Ukraine's capital on Tuesday that the global standoff between the east and west — with the Ukrainian people caught in the middle — had turned a corner. It remained unclear, however, whether Washington would accept Russia's announcement as a step back from the brink of a potentially catastrophic war.

2022-02-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-standoff-what-you-need-to-know-now/,Russia-Ukraine standoff: What you need to know now,"Russia has massed well over 100,000 troops near its own border with Ukraine and in neighboring Belarus, leaving the country surrounded on three sides. The buildup and position of those forces has drawn warnings from the White House that Russian President Vladimir Putin could order an attack ""any time,"" and may well do so before the end of this week. The U.S. has poured military hardware into Ukraine and contributed to a buildup of NATO forces in Eastern Europe in response. Russia and NATO are both carrying out military exercises in the region and demanding that the other party step back first from the brink of war. Along with European partners and the G7, the U.S. has warned that any Russian invasion of Ukraine would bring ""swift and severe costs"" for Moscow, in the form of sanctions. U.S. and European leaders have also warned that a full Russian invasion of Ukraine could result in 100,000 civilian deaths and change the world in fundamental ways. But neither side has abandoned diplomacy yet. Here's what you need to know about the standoff on the border between Russia and the democracies of Europe. The Russian forces have gathered along Ukraine's northern, eastern and southern borders. U.S. officials tell CBS News that Russia now has at least 80% of the forces in place that it would need to launch a full-scale invasion, and that Russia is expected to launch some form of attack against Ukraine by the end of this week. Russia insists it has no intention of invading Ukraine and has dismissed the U.S. warnings as ""hysteria."" The West points to huge Russian military exercises just across Ukraine's borders as evidence of its aggression. NATO and Ukraine have responded by carrying out their own war games close to Russian territory. Russia has said that a massive joint drill it's holding with ally Belarus, on Ukraine's northern border, will end on February 20 and that the 30,000 Russian forces taking part will come home when it's over. But on February 14, a U.S. official told CBS News national security correspondent David Martin that Russian troops near Ukraine's border had begun moving into ""attack positions."" The Russian defense minister said earlier the same day that some of Russia's military exercises in the region had already concluded and that others would wrap up in the coming days. It was a vague statement, and U.S. officials reported no movements of Russian forces away from Ukraine's borders. Secretary Antony Blinken announced Monday the U.S. is temporarily moving embassy operations in Ukraine from Kyiv to Lviv, near the country's western border, due to the ""dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces."" The fear of Russian aggression is based on precedent: Russian forces invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014. Putin claimed the assault was merely a defense of ethnic Russians who live in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, who've never supported the country's relatively new, pro-Western government. But Putin used the invasion to very literally claim part of Ukraine for Russia, unilaterally annexing the Crimean Peninsula. The annexation is not recognized by the international community, but Russia has indisputably controlled the territory since 2014. Since the annexation, a proxy war has simmered in Donbas between Russian-backed forces and the Ukrainian government. A 2015 peace deal largely ended the major battles, but the fighting has continued, and left more than 14,000 people dead in the process, according to the Ukrainian government. Russia's strongman leader speaks often of the ethnic ties between Russia and Ukraine and warns against NATO expanding further eastward toward his borders. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union before declaring its independence in 1991. As CBS News' David Martin reported in January, Putin's objective is to keep Ukraine — the second-largest country on the continent — from making common cause with the democracies of Europe. ""What motivates Putin,"" former NATO Ambassador Ivo Daalder told CBS News, ""is a concern about the independence of Ukraine — a worry that a functioning, successful, prosperous democracy in Ukraine poses a direct threat to his rule, because it will give people in Russia the idea that they, too, could enjoy what Ukraine enjoys, and rise up against his autocratic rule."" To end the current standoff, Putin has demanded that NATO rule out admitting any new members from among the former Soviet states — most importantly, Ukraine — and that NATO forces pull back from positions in other countries near Russia. The U.S. and NATO have rejected the demand to preclude any new members as a non-starter, but they have voiced willingness to negotiate over military deployments and openness with exercises in the region, along with other trust-building measures. The U.S. government is waiting for a formal response from the Kremlin to proposals handed from Washington to Russia weeks ago. Many analysts believe Putin's objective is to erode confidence in Ukraine's government so it can be replaced with a new pro-Russian regime, and that he's using the external threat of military action, along with plausibly deniable actions like cyberattacks, to achieve that. Ukraine has made the quest for NATO membership a cornerstone of its national security policy, and it has refused to back down from that ambition, though even before the current Russian military buildup there was no discussion of Ukraine being admitted to the alliance anytime soon. While many Ukrainians, especially in the country's east, are pro-Russian, Ukrainians ousted their last pro-Russia president in 2014 and have consistently elected pro-Western politicians since. The country has responded to the current standoff by readying its forces to confront any Russian invasion, including with huge shipments of U.S. weapons, civilian defense units and ongoing military exercises near its border with Russian ally Belarus. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged his nation to remain calm, and most Ukrainians — tempered by almost eight years of conflict in the country's east with the Russian-backed separatists — have done so. Despite the White House warnings of a possible imminent invasion, there has been no panic or hysteria, not even stockpiling, in the capital, Kyiv. As Ukraine is not a NATO member, the U.S. and most of its European allies have ruled out sending troops into the country to help defend its territory. Instead, they have provided military hardware, cash, and diplomatic support. President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have held multiple calls with Russian officials, including a phone call between Mr. Biden and Putin on February 13. So far, the direct conversations have yielded no breakthroughs. The U.S. interest in rebuffing Russia's aggression is difficult to explain in terms of goods or American lives: Ukraine is not a significant trading partner, and a threat to its territory or sovereignty poses no direct threat to that of the United States. But the world's most powerful democracies have struggled for years to keep Putin's myriad nefarious actions in check — from claiming Crimea, to poisoning dissidents on British soil and blocking U.N. sanctions against the Assad regime in Syria. As Putin seeks now to deepen Russia's ties with China, another powerful nation eager to portray the Western model of democracy as past its prime, the U.S. has a clear interest in turning back his latest and boldest effort to drive a wedge between NATO members. –Eleanor Watson, Olivia Gazis, David Martin, Ed O'Keefe, Sara Cook, Margaret Brennan and Christina Ruffini contributed reporting.",29,0.6828704579491534,7.930242997040437,-7.247372539091283,21
2022-02-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/ransomware-cyber-criminals-say-theyve-hacked-san-francisco-49ers/,Ransomware Cyber Criminals Say They've Hacked San Francisco 49ers,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers have been hit by a ransomware attack, with cyber criminals claiming they stole some of the football team's financial data. The ransomware gang BlackByte recently posted some of the purportedly stolen team documents on a dark web site in a file marked ""2020 Invoices."" The gang did not make any of its ransom demands public or specify how much data it had stolen or encrypted. The team, which is among the most valuable and storied franchises in the NFL and lost a close playoff game two week ago, said in a statement Sunday that it recently became aware of a ""network security incident"" that had disrupted some of its corporate IT network systems. The 49ers said they'd notified law enforcement and hired cybersecurity firms to assist. ""To date, we have no indication that this incident involves systems outside of our corporate network, such as those connected to Levi's Stadium operations or ticket holders,"" the team said in a statement, referencing its home stadium. News of the attack comes two days after the FBI and U.S. Secret Service issued an alert on BlackByte ransomware, saying it had ""compromised multiple US and foreign businesses, including entities in at least three US critical infrastructure sectors"" since November. Ransomware gangs, which hack targets and hold their data hostage through encryption, have caused widespread havoc in the last year with high-profile attacks on the world's largest meat-packing company, the biggest U.S. fuel pipeline and other targets. Western governments have pledged to crack down on the cyber criminals, who operate largely in and around Russia, but have little to show for their efforts. In the past month, ransomware victims have included operators of maritime fuel depots in Belgium and Germany and media outlets in Portugal. A cyberattack on the wireless provider Vodafone in Portugal this past week had all the hallmarks of ransomware, though the company's CEO for Portugal said it received no ransomware demand. BlackByte is a ransomware-as-a-service group. That means it's decentralized, with independent operators developing the malware, hacking into organizations or filling other roles. It's part of a trend of ransomware groups becoming increasing professionalized. A recent report by the FBI, NSA and others said that ransomware operators are even setting up an arbitration system to resolve payment disputes among themselves. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm Emisoft, said BlackByte's malware, like many ransomware variants, is hardcoded to not encrypt systems that use Russian or languages used by certain Russian allies. But Callow said that doesn't mean whoever is behind the 49ers attack is in Russia or one of its neighbors.

2022-02-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-us-nato-mount-pressure-on-putin-amid-invasion-fear/,Pressure mounts on Putin as Ukraine crisis reaches a fever pitch,"Kyiv — With more Russian forces gathering along Ukraine's borders and the White House warning that President Vladimir Putin could order an invasion ""any time,"" President Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart agreed over the weekend to continue pursuing diplomacy, but also deterrence. The U.S. is pulling out the few troops it's had in the country, helping train Ukraine's own forces, and all U.S. diplomatic personnel are expected to leave the capital by Tuesday. The personnel movements and the continuing influx of U.S. and other NATO forces to countries near Russia's western borders were a clear sign of the concern in Washington and European capitals that Putin will make a decision to either invade Ukraine, or try to frame Ukraine's forces for an incident that he can use as a pretext for an attack. Mr. Biden and his NATO allies have warned that any Russian invasion of Ukraine would be bring ""swift and severe costs"" for Russia through sanctions. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that the U.S. and its allies were ""watching very carefully for the possibility that there is a pretext or a false flag operation to kick off the Russian action, in which Russian intelligence services conduct some kind of attack on Russian proxy forces in eastern Ukraine or on Russian citizens, and then blame it on the Ukrainians."" In a phone call on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited Mr. Biden to come to Kyiv, saying it would be a ""powerful signal"" and contribute to efforts to deescalate the crisis. Their call came on the heels of a conversation between Presidents Biden and Putin, which failed to yield any breakthrough. While the White House has stressed that a diplomatic path remains open to Moscow, sources told CBS News on Sunday that the Biden administration was preparing to withdraw all U.S. government personnel from Kyiv by Tuesday. America's NATO allies in Europe continue working to hammer out a diplomatic solution with Moscow. Germany's leader was in Kyiv on Monday to talk with Zelenskyy, before heading to Moscow on Tuesday. Before his meetings, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Putin's government needed to show ""immediate signs"" of deescalation to convince the West that Moscow's repeated denials of any plan to attack Ukraine were unfounded. While refusing to explain its months-long buildup of more than 100,000 troops around Ukraine's borders, however, Putin's government has dismissed the U.S. warnings of an imminent attack as ""hysteria."" The Kremlin has demanded guarantees from NATO that it will not admit new members along his country's western borders — most importantly that Ukraine won't join the Western military alliance. U.S. and NATO leaders have ruled out any such promise, but the Ukrainian ambassador in London sparked a flurry of speculation on Monday by suggesting that his country could agree to at least put its NATO ambitions on hold. Ambassador Vadym Prystaiko's remarks were quickly walked back by both the diplomat himself and his bosses in Kyiv, who stressed the pursuit of NATO membership as a cornerstone of Ukraine's foreign policy. ""NATO membership isn't negotiable,"" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told CBS News' Pamela Falk on Monday. Even Russia said it didn't see the envoy's initial remarks as a sign of any shift in Ukraine's stance — but the Kremlin spokesman said if Ukraine were to rule out NATO membership, it would go a long way toward easing Russia's own security concerns. Pressure continued to mount on Putin Monday, with the value of Russian stocks and its currency falling as the world's seven most developed economies issued a new admonition to Moscow. ""Our immediate priority is to support efforts to deescalate the situation,"" G7 finance ministers said in a joint statement, warning that if Moscow were to opt for increased military action against Ukraine, they were ""prepared to collectively impose economic and financial sanctions which will have massive and immediate consequences on the Russian economy."" The outcome of the diplomatic blitz could mean life or death for many Ukrainians, but Kyiv remained calm on Tuesday. There was no panic, and little sense that the war against Russian-backed separatists — simmering in the east since Putin's troops last invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014 — was about to erupt into a wider conflict. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports, Ukraine's military is carrying out exercises of its own as Russian troops hold war games around their borders. But Ukraine's forces know they would be vastly outnumbered if Russia were to invade. The Ukrainian government has consistently urged people to remain calm, and life has continued pretty much as normal. But Williams said there was no doubt that being caught in the middle of a standoff between the world's great powers has Ukrainians worried. She visited a farmers' market on Kyiv's John McCain Street — the late American senator is beloved in the country because he pushed the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine to help it battle the Russian-backed separatists in the east. U.S. officials have said a full Russian invasion could cause 100,000 civilian casualties, and shoppers in Kyiv know they would be in the firing line. But Alina Kumbachsia told CBS News that she and other Kyiv residents, ""just live in the moment."" The fitness instructor said nearly eight years of Russian aggression have already made Ukrainians immune to panic. ""We don't know what will be, because this is not our decisions,"" she told Williams. ""We don't want war, we want normal, happy life."" With tens of thousands of forces deployed to Belarus — for joint exercises that Moscow has said will end on February 20 — Ukraine is now close to being encircled by Russian troops. Many of the country's ports are already effectively blockaded, and there's fear that the intimidating Russian military drills just over the borders could be an overture to the Russians moving in. It's thought an invasion could start with cyberattacks, and airstrikes. Kyiv's subway system also serves as the Ukrainian capital's biggest bomb shelter. The capital city's government says it has an evacuation plan, as well as preparations to maintain electricity, heating and communications in case of an attack. Back on John McCain Street, Konstantin Bilotserkivskyi told Williams that he has an emergency bag packed, just in case he has to run from a Russian attack. ""The worst thing, you feel helpless, you know? You cannot impact it anyhow — it's just matter of will it happen or not, and the only thing you can do is wait,"" he told CBS News. The Ukrainian government has demanded an urgent, high-level meeting with Russia by Tuesday, but says Moscow continues to ignore requests to explain why there are more than 100,000 Russian forces massed around Ukraine's borders.",29,7.72959008990139,4.401515059648745,3.328075030252645,18

2022-02-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-war-games-belarus-nato-warns-putin-against-invasion/,Russia kicks off huge war games just over Ukraine's border in Belarus,"Zhytomyr Oblast, northern Ukraine — Russia kicked off huge joint military exercises on Thursday in Belarus, an ally and neighbor that also shares a border with Ukraine. The war games — which Moscow has said will last for 10 days, after which the Russian forces will leave Belarus and return to Russia — have prompted the U.S. and NATO to bolster their forces in the region and carry out their own military drills. The tens of thousands of troops and weapons that Russia has sent into Belarus for the exercises are just one element of Russia's months-long military buildup around Ukraine's borders. The U.S. government says President Vladimir Putin now has more than 100,000 troops positioned around Ukraine's southern, eastern and northern borders, and that he could decide to order a new invasion of the neighboring country any time. Russia insists it has no plans to attack Ukraine, but an intensive diplomacy effort by the U.S. and its NATO partners with Moscow this week has failed to yield any signs of deescalation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on Thursday that it was ""a dangerous moment for European security,"" saying that as the ""number of Russian forces is going up, the warning time for a possible attack is going down."" Stoltenberg spoke on Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and the State Department said they had ""discussed diplomatic efforts to urge Russia to de-escalate and engage in meaningful and reciprocal dialogue, as well as United States and Allies' force posture adjustments to fortify the Alliance's Eastern Flank."" CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab was on the Ukrainian side of a border crossing with Belarus on Thursday, just a few dozen miles from where the Russian forces and their allies are holding the military drills — the largest in the country since the Cold War. Despite the Russian insistence earlier this week that its troop presence in Belarus was to last just 10 days, the fear is that Putin's deployment of roughly 30,000 troops to the country could be the first step to an invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has consistently denied any plans to invade, however, and Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine's top security official, says his country is not panicked, but it is ready for anything. ""The Russians may use Belarus as a ground for provocation,"" he told Tyab. ""It could happen at any moment."" Ukraine announced this week that its own forces would carry out exercises in response to the Russian-Belorusian drills, during exactly the same time frame. The specter of war has set alarm bells ringing across the world. CBS News has confirmed that the U.S. government has plans in place to evacuate the thousands of Americans living in Ukraine — if it needs to do so — to neighboring Poland, a NATO ally to which the U.S. has recently deployed additional troops. In what he called a reaction to the U.S. and NATO's actions Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters on Thursday that Moscow might evacuate its non-essential diplomatic staff from Kyiv. The U.S. has urged American nationals in Ukraine to leave for more than a week, citing the possibility of a Russian invasion, and in January the State Department ordered the families of U.S embassy employees in Kyiv to leave the country. Lavrov suggested it was the West's actions — which include NATO's military buildup in response to the Russian troops around Ukraine, ongoing NATO military exercises close to Russia's borders, urging Western citizens to leave Ukraine and the repeated warnings of a possible imminent Russian invasion — that represent the real threat, to Russia. ""Maybe it is the Anglo-Saxons who are preparing something, if they are evacuating their employees?"" the veteran Russian diplomat told reporters after a seemingly fruitless meeting with his British counterpart Liz Truss on Thursday. ""We looked at their actions and, probably, we will also advise non-essential personnel of our diplomatic institutions to go home for a while. I don't know what our Anglo-Saxon colleagues are plotting."" ""We do not want to threaten anyone,"" Lavrov said. ""Take a look at the public statements: no threats have ever been made. It's we who are being threatened."" U.S. and European officials continue to say they're unsure whether Putin has decided to launch an invasion, or any other level of attack, against Ukraine. But Russia did invade its neighbor eight years ago, annexing Crimea and sparking a simmering conflict in the east of Ukraine between the country's forces and Russian-backed separatists that continues today, and that Kyiv says has left more than 14,000 people dead. After her meeting with Lavrov, Britain's top diplomat Truss said the Russian had repeated his insistence that Moscow has no plans to invade Ukraine, but she said, ""We need to see those words followed up by actions, and we need to see the troops and the equipment that is stationed on the Ukraine border moved elsewhere, because at present it is in a very threatening posture."" Lavrov dismissed his meeting with the British diplomat as pointless, likening it to ""a conversation between the mute and the deaf — when [a person] seems to be listening, but they do not hear."" Despite the apparent failure of politicians to find ant common ground to ease the tension, not all Americans in the country are ready to leave yet, however. Brian Best has lived in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv for more than two decades. It's where he met his wife and is raising his two children. He told CBS News that Ukraine had become ""part of who I am. It's part of my identity,"" and unless bullets start flying in Kyiv, that's where he'll stay. ""We're staying, and certainly our Ukrainian community, they're feeling quite nationalistic right now, you know, calm, calculated… But all of them seem quite confident that this will pass,"" he said. He suspects Putin is playing for concessions from the West, not a war with it. ""I also believe that the U.S. was quick to heighten the rhetoric, and I think that that was probably a good thing because we needed to shine the spotlight on what Russia is doing,"" said West. ""It's not the Ukrainian military that's on the border of Russia, it's the Russian military that's on the border of Ukraine. So, if anyone is the aggressor, it's Russia."" ""This is a peaceful country,"" West told CBS News of his adopted homeland. ""They want sovereignty."" That sentiment is shared by so many Ukrainians, who've told CBS News that if Russia does invade, not only will they stay put, they'll fight back.",29,7.406717876005202,0.6535775623235414,6.75314031368166,18

French President Emmanuel Macron met Ukraine's president on Tuesday after flying to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin. Macron said the standoff with Russia could go on for ""weeks and months."" Amid the flurry of diplomacy, NATO has bolstered its presence in countries around Ukraine, and the Western military alliance is holding war games hoping to deter a Russian attack. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata watched on Tuesday as British and Estonian tanks squared off against each other in a simulated battle on a snowy wasteland in northern Estonia, not far from the Russian border. The military exercise is a direct response to Russia's massive military buildup on three sides of Ukraine, which has sent jitters through the entire region. As Russia prepares to kick off huge combat exercises of its own at land and at sea, the NATO war games have never felt more real, or more urgent. If a wider conflict were to break out on the far eastern edge of Europe's democracies, the conditions at the NATO training ground in Läsna, Estonia are exactly what troops would encounter: Deep snow and difficult terrain, with limited visibility. They would also face an enemy that far outnumbers NATO's forces, in both troops and weaponry. Estonia and the other Baltic states, Latvia and Lithuania, sit right along the borders of Russia and its ally Belarus. Each of the three nations is home to a multinational NATO battlegroup. American reinforcements have been deployed to Lithuania, Poland and Romania, while Moscow has sent tens of thousands of forces to Belarus to carry out drills as part of Russia's own military buildup. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said at a news conference on Wednesday that his country would ""be talking to the U.S. to make sure that the rotational U.S. forces would be in Lithuania permanently."" ""That would be the best boost to security and deterrence that NATO could provide, not only to Lithuania, but to the whole region,"" he said. There is still hope for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine. Moscow on Wednesday indicated that Putin's government was still determining how to respond to U.S. proposals to ease the tension, but deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov said the Kremlin had at least ""taken seriously"" the ideas presented. But while the negotiations continue, so do the war games, because military preparations are never based on a best-case scenario.",29,0.8138673326183682,1.2269219084100016,-0.4130545757916334,18

2022-02-08,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-invasion-threat-putin-belarus-war-games-us-nato-diplomacy/,Russia says troops won't stay in Belarus as U.S. and allies engage in diplomatic blitz to avert all-out war in Ukraine,"Washington and Kyiv — High-stakes diplomacy is underway in Washington and Europe this week as President Biden and other leaders race to find an agreement with Russia to prevent the military standoff on Ukraine's borders from escalating into all-out war. With more than 100,000 Russian forces positioned around Ukraine's borders and the U.S. warning that President Vladimir Putin could order an invasion any time, Mr. Biden and his German counterpart tried to show a united front on Monday amid concerns that Europe's biggest economy isn't confronting Moscow as forcefully as it could. Mr. Biden hosted German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House, while Putin met for five hours behind closed doors in Moscow with French President Emmanuel Macron. With additional U.S. troops and weaponry deploying to Eastern Europe, close to Russia's border, President Biden warned Americans in Ukraine to get out, saying he would ""hate to see them get caught in the crossfire."" As CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reports, Mr. Biden made the remark alongside Scholz, as the leaders insisted their countries were in agreement about the consequences Putin should face if he orders an invasion of Ukraine. ""He would pay a heavy price,"" Mr. Biden said. Germany has been less aggressive than other NATO allies in warning Russia against an invasion — which the Russian leader has consistently denied any plans of launching. A major sticking point for Germany is Nord Stream 2, a more than 750-mile natural gas pipeline being built between Germany and Russia. Europe relies on Russia for a third of its natural gas supply, and if and when the pipeline is opened up, it's estimated that tens of billions of dollars in gas revenue will flow back into Russia. On Monday, Mr. Biden said unequivocally that if there's a Russian invasion of Ukraine, ""there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2… we will bring an end to it."" Scholz didn't go as far, saying only that NATO would be united in its response to any Russian invasion, but Mr. Biden insisted the U.S. and its allies were ""not taking different steps, we will do the same steps."" So far, the warnings from the West and the influx of NATO forces to countries in what Putin considers his backyard have failed to persuade the Russian leader to pull back his troops. Instead, Putin's government announced on Monday that it will hold 10-day joint military exercises in Belarus, a Russian ally that sits on Ukraine's northern border. Satellite imagery released over the weekend shows Russian and Belarusian troops and weapons, including attack aircraft, positioned within 30 miles of Ukrainian soil. Six Russian warships were on their way to the Black Sea, Russian officials said on Tuesday, to take part in sweeping naval exercises that Moscow announced in January. The drills are to involve every Russian naval fleet, from the Atlantic to the Pacific virtually everywhere in-between. The Pentagon believes Putin now has in place at least 70% of the forces he would need to launch a full-scale land invasion of Ukraine. Putin's military deployment around Ukraine is ""well north of 100,000, and it continues to grow,"" Defense Department spokesman John Kirby said on Monday. Ukraine, reacting to the Russian exercises in Belarus, said on Tuesday that it would carry out its own military drills during the exact same timeframe. More U.S. troops and machinery arrived in Poland, meanwhile, as part of American efforts to bolster the defenses of NATO allies around Ukraine. Ukraine, an American partner, is not a member of the transatlantic military alliance, and the White House has said no American forces will be deployed there. The specter of simultaneous war games on either side of Ukraine's borders, as both Russia and NATO continue bolstering their forces in the region, highlights the urgency of efforts to find a diplomatic solution. After his long meeting on Monday with the French leader, Putin indicated that he was prepared to continue negotiations to prevent the crisis from spiraling into a full-on war with Ukraine. He said President Macron had presented proposals to deescalate the crisis that could at least create ""a foundation for our further steps."" The Russian leader again denied any intention of invading Ukraine, and he agreed to have a call with Macron on Tuesday after the French leader visits Kyiv. Macron said on Tuesday that he believed his meeting with Putin would help to prevent a further escalation of the crisis, but the Kremlin quickly shot down reports that the Russian leader had agreed to refrain from further military exercises in the region. Putin's spokesman, however, did appear on Tuesday to try to ease any concerns that the thousands of Russian forces deployed to Belarus in recent weeks for the military exercises might remain there. ""No one ever said that Russian troops would remain on the territory of Belarus, there was no talk of this,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""We are talking about allied exercises, and it is understood that after these exercises are completed, the troops will return to their permanent locations."" As U.S. and European leaders and military commanders try to read the clues from Moscow about Putin's next step, Russian military analyst Alexander Baunov told CBS News foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tyab that in some ways, Putin is using the mere threat of military action to get what he wants: World powers negotiating amongst themselves over his security demands to prevent war. ""The fear of the war is a working political instrument,"" Baunov told CBS News, to ""make Russian demands and Russian concerns to be listened to."" The inherent risk in this coercive form of diplomacy, Tyab noted, is if Russia doesn't gain something, and soon, Putin may decide he has to use force to avoid looking weak.",29,1.5892706648520367,0.7237200901644744,0.8655505746875624,21

Russia and its own ally Belarus, which sits just north of Ukraine, have announced 10-day joint military exercises to kick off on February 10, aimed, they say, at training forces to repel any attack on Belarus' southern border. Satellite images released over the weekend by Maxar Technologies show Russian and Belarusian forces now positioned only about 30 miles from Ukrainian soil. The images show troops deployed at three locations, armed with missiles, multiple rocket launchers and attack aircraft. As CBS News foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tyab reports, the U.S. and its European allies have issued increasingly dire warnings that the imagery and other intelligence indicates Russia could invade Ukraine any day. Moscow insists it has no plans to do so and accuses the West of stoking the tension on the far eastern border of Europe. Russian officials point to NATO's own buildup of forces in the region and accuse the U.S. of ignoring the Kremlin's demands for ""security guarantees"" from the transatlantic military alliance. Over the last 24 hours, dozens of elite American airborne troops arrived in Poland — part of efforts to bolster NATO's defenses. It was just the latest influx of U.S. troops and military hardware to the region. As NATO and Russia trade blame and gather their respective forces, Ukraine is caught in the middle. Tyab met a group of civilians training near Ukraine's capital of Kyiv to use automatic weapons. They're not soldiers, but they're using real guns and real bullets to prepare for a possible war with a very real adversary. Whether Russia will actually invade is still anyone's guess, but those who came to get trained up were preparing for the worst, and they were being taught by people who already have experience in the fight. Military veterans who've spent years fighting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine have been instructing the urban fighters-in-the-making. Tyab asked a Ukrainian sergeant leading one of the training sessions if it was terrifying to have so many Russian forces and so much Russian weaponry right on his country's doorstep. ""It's not too terrifying for us, because we fight already for eight years, you know? War every day, from 2014,"" he replied, referring to the last time Putin sent troops over Ukraine's border, unilaterally annexing the Crimean Peninsula in the process. U.S. intelligence officials have warned that a Russian invasion could result in up to 100,000 civilian deaths. But many Ukrainians remain unconvinced that Putin will attack. On newscasts across Ukraine, there's barely a mention of the tension along the country's borders. Instead, the top stories over the last day or so have been about a supermarket scandal, and Ukraine's fashion week. ""I don't believe in big invasion right now. It's actually not in the interest of Putin,"" former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told CBS News. ""What Putin needs now is to raise the stakes, to ratchet up pressure."" That, he has done, and the pressure has brought a flurry of international diplomacy as world leaders seek an end to the conflict that doesn't involve bloodshed. French President Emmanuel Macron was meeting Putin in Moscow on Monday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov played down hopes of any major breakthrough ahead of the sit-down, calling the standoff ""too complicated to expect any decisive changes in the course of one meeting."" But noting that France currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, Peskov called it a ""very important meeting,"" and urged the world to wait and see how both Macron and Putin assessed it. In Washington, meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was to sit down with President Joe Biden at the White House, before heading straight back to Berlin to confer with Macron and Poland's leader on Tuesday.",29,1.2539104493598092,2.9390612058597916,-1.6851507564999824,18
2022-02-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-disinformation-video-ukraine-invasion-united-states/,"Russia plotted to use fake video as pretense for Ukraine invasion, U.S. reveals","The U.S. has revealed new intelligence of a Russian plot to use a phony video as a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. Senior administration officials said Thursday that the U.S. believes Russia has already recruited players to stage a propaganda video depicting ""graphic scenes of a staged false explosion with corpses, actors depicting mourners, and images of destroyed locations and military equipment."" The White House publicized the Kremlin's alleged plans to fabricate an attack Thursday, in the hopes it would dissuade Moscow from going through with its latest disinformation effort. ""We have made a decision — a strategic decision — to call out disinformation when we see it,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing with reporters, last week. ""We are much more cognizant of the Russian disinformation machine than we were in 2014,"" Psaki added. ""Russia has a boundless capacity to misrepresent truth and what it's doing."" The Biden administration has been redoubling its counterattacks against Russia's disinformation machine, reacting quickly to the storylines Moscow is churning out to undermine trust in Western democracy. U.S. officials registered a record-breaking number of efforts by Russian state media and proxies to push out anti-American and anti-Ukrainian content online, even as the Kremlin continues to threaten Ukraine by massing troops and equipment along the border. In another example of Russia's online malign influence campaign, self-declared ""Russian federal news agency"" Avia.pro published an article on January 23, claiming, ""the United States has begun moving its heavy tanks and light armored vehicles to the border with Ukraine, apparently preparing to use these vehicles to attack Russia."" While Avia.pro is geolocated in the Netherlands, open-source data indicates the domain is registered to a private address of an apartment building in Moscow, Russia, according to fact-checking website StopFake.org. Researchers at the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis have sorted through an avalanche of disinformation produced by Russian state media groups —including state media RT and Sputnik — that claim Russia has no intent to invade Ukraine and that the West fabricated the invasion story as an excuse for its own military buildup. DHS warned state and law enforcement partners this week that ""from September 2021 to January 2022, Russian state media and proxy websites published a greater number of anti-Ukrainian and anti-American narratives on a month-by-month basis than during any preceding period,"" going back to World War II. ""Ukraine-focused article production by Russian media outlets"" surpassed 800 in January 2022, according to the DHS bulletin published Monday and obtained by CBS News. Researchers noted reactionary jumps in derogatory stories about the United States, NATO and its allies on December 7, following the video conference between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, then again on January 10 at the start of negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. Recently, Moscow's online armies have spun out wild tales of disinformation accusing the U.S. of hiring mercenaries to carry out a chemical attack plot and revisiting false narratives aligning Ukrainians with Nazism. ""Disinformation is a significant threat,"" deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Wednesday, during her diplomatic mission to Brussels. ""The disinformation narrative is that Ukraine is the source of the crisis. That is not the case — Russia is the source of the crisis,"" Neuberger stressed. Russia is also perpetuating the lie that there are ""significant NATO forces in Ukraine, significant threats in Ukraine to Russia, Neuberger added. ""That is not the case."" She reiterated that Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border. Propaganda is flooding Telegram channels, according to the Ukrainian Crisis Media Center, a non-governmental organization backed by supporters of Ukraine's sovereignty. The group took note of one recently hatched claim that Ukraine and NATO are plotting an undercover operation code named ""Crushing Sword."" That story, initially posted on the telegram account of Yan Leshchenko, self-proclaimed military leader of the so-called Luhansk People's Republic, and circulated by Russian state media, uses bogus footage of Ukrainian aggression as a pretext for Russian military deployment. While many messages are posted anonymously, others on Telegram connect to pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians such as Yevheniy Muraiev, the owner of ""NASH"" TV channel and one of Moscow's chosen candidates for pro-Russian leadership, according to recent British intelligence reports concluding Putin plans to install a puppet government in Kyiv. The White House dispatched its top cybersecurity official to NATO, Tuesday, to organize its mission to detect and deflect Russian cyberattacks – both against Ukraine, as well as possible retaliatory cyberattacks against Europe and the U.S. Neuberger equated Russia's use of cyber with ""a kind of kinetic operations"" intended to destabilize a target population and government. ""The goal of Russian disinformation is to… shake confidence in a country's government or to make it difficult to assess a situation."" Cyber criminals attempted to ""shake confidence"" in Ukraine last month, targeting more than 90 websites linked to 22 Ukrainian government organizations on January 14 in a three-pronged operation intent on driving Russia's state-sponsored story, according to top Ukrainian cyber official Victor Zhora. Approximately 50 websites were defaced with a ""much smaller number of organizations and IT infrastructures"" suffering damage. ""Some external IT infrastructures were destroyed,"" the deputy chairman of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine told CBS News. Hackers successfully employed specially designed ""wiper malware"" on two of Ukraine's government agencies, but there is no indication that personal information has been compromised. And while the Ukrainian government has yet to formally attribute the attacks to Moscow, the investigation points to familiar Russian tactics. ""It's a part of hybrid warfare against Ukraine. Cyberspace is just one of its areas of warfare,"" said Zhora, who believes that the investigation would benefit from international experts. ""We consider this to be a psychological operation against Ukraine,"" Zhora said. ""It's about seeding chaos and instability,"" he added. Ukrainian government websites, including the homepage for the Foreign Ministry, temporarily displayed a message warning Ukraine's people to ""be afraid and expect the worst."" But in some ways, officials had expected far worse. ""Fifty websites defaced and some data loss isn't a big deal."" Zhora said, pausing. ""It's serious. It's a good lesson for all of us. It's one more hit in a series of cyber attacks, but we showed that our security cyber security system is working."" The State Department issued a fact sheet last month, highlighting five themes Russia has been trying to refine and peddle in its disinformation campaign to rationalize its own actions in Ukraine. For one, there's ""Russophobia"" — falsely portraying Russia as an 'innocent victim' of U.S. aggression, downplaying the Soviet's alliance with Hitler during WWII and portraying the collapse of Western societies as ""imminent."" ""Disinformation has been part of Russian military doctrine for more than a decade,"" said James Lewis, a researcher and tech expert at CSIS. ""The one thing Russians have learned is if you tell a falsehood often enough, there'll be people who believe it."" Lewis says that lesson learned was reinforced back in 2016, when Kremlin-backed trolls revamped their 'classic playbook' with an online disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about the presidential election. The result culminated in a massive network of fake social media accounts or 'bots' programmed to spread divisive political content across the internet that would further exacerbate existing rifts in American society. But Russian meddling in U.S. elections — surfacing again for a bite in 2020 — offered up its share of hard-earned lessons to U.S. officials, too. Experts tracking Kremlin-backed information warfare have welcomed the administration's approach to combating Russia's disinformation campaign, along with efforts by social media companies to curb fake news at its source. ""One thing that's improved in recent years is that the social media companies have gone from saying, 'Oh, we're just, we're just a bulletin board….' to making a much more aggressive effort to weed out fake information,"" Lewis said. ""The Russians create hundreds of bogus individuals, using artificial intelligence to tweet out nonsense. But there's a much stronger effort to expose that.""

Launched in 2000, the space lab has orbited 227 nautical miles above Earth with more than 200 astronauts from 19 different countries enjoying stints aboard -- representing a continuous human presence in space. NASA said that commercially operated space platforms would replace the ISS as a venue for collaboration and scientific research. ""The private sector is technically and financially capable of developing and operating commercial low-Earth orbit destinations, with NASA's assistance. We look forward to sharing our lessons learned and operations experience with the private sector to help them develop safe, reliable, and cost-effective destinations in space,"" said Phil McAlister, director of commercial space at NASA Headquarters in a statement. ""The report we have delivered to Congress describes, in detail, our comprehensive plan for ensuring a smooth transition to commercial destinations after the retirement of the International Space Station in 2030."" In the International Space Station Transition Report, NASA said the plan was for the ISS to fall to Earth in an area known as the South Pacific Oceanic Uninhabited Area -- also known as Point Nemo. The report said that its budget estimate assumed that the deorbit would happen in January 2031. Named after the submarine sailor in Jules Verne's novel ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,"" Point Nemo is the point in the ocean that is farthest from land and has been a watery grave for many other spacecraft. The area is approximately 3,000 miles off of New Zealand's eastern coast and 2,000 miles north of Antarctica and it's estimated that space-faring nations such as the US, Russia, Japan, and European countries have sunk more than 263 pieces of space debris there since 1971. The report said the ISS would perform thrusting maneuvers that would ensure ""safe atmospheric entry."" The ISS won't rest on its laurels for the next eight years. NASA said goals for the next decade include using the ISS as an ""analog for a Mars transit mission,"" according to the report. ""The International Space Station is entering its third and most productive decade as a groundbreaking scientific platform in microgravity,"" said Robyn Gatens, director of the International Space Station at NASA Headquarters, said in the statement. ""This third decade is one of the results, building on our successful global partnership to verify exploration and human research technologies to support deep space exploration, continue to return medical and environmental benefits to humanity, and lay the groundwork for a commercial future in low-Earth orbit."" ""We look forward to maximizing these returns from the space station through 2030 while planning for transition to commercial space destinations that will follow."" The space station has been home to many scientific firsts. The first item to be 3D-printed on the space station occurred in 2014. NASA astronaut Kate Rubins sequenced DNA in space for the first time in 2016. And the fifth state of matter, called a Bose-Einstein condensate, was produced in space by NASA's Cold Atom Lab on the station in 2018. Astronauts have learned how to grow lettuces and leafy greens in space. The first space-grown salad was sampled by astronauts in 2015. Now, they're even growing radishes and chilis on the station. This could be used to one day help astronauts grow their own food on deep space missions. China, whose astronauts have long been excluded from the ISS, launched the first module of its planned space station last year. While not as large as the ISS, the Chinese space station is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year. Russia has said it will leave the ISS project in 2025 and plans to build its own space station that could launch in 2030. (©2022 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

2022-02-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-tensions-putin-united-states-nato-security/,Putin accuses U.S. and NATO allies of ignoring Russia's security needs,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia's top security demands but said Moscow is willing to talk more to ease tensions over Ukraine. The comments were his first on the standoff in more than a month and suggested a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine may not be imminent and that at least one more round of diplomacy is likely. Yet the two sides remain unyielding in their main positions, and there was little apparent hope for concessions. Russia is expected to respond soon to a U.S. proposal for negotiations on lesser Russian demands after which Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will speak. Lavrov and Blinken spoke Tuesday and reiterated positions put forward by Putin and President Joe Biden. The White House said Biden and Putin could also speak once the U.S. receives Russia's response. In remarks to reporters at a Moscow news conference with the visiting leader of NATO ally Hungary, Putin said the Kremlin is still studying the U.S. and NATO's response to the Russian security demands received last week. But he said it was clear that the West has ignored Russian demands that NATO not expand to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations, refrain from deploying offensive weapons near Russia and roll back its deployments to Eastern Europe. Putin argued that it's possible to negotiate an end to the standoff if the interests of all parties, including Russia's security concerns, are taken into account. ""I hope that we will eventually find a solution, although we realize that it's not going to be easy,"" Putin said. Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops along the border of Ukraine, fueling fears of an invasion. It has denied any intention to attack. Washington and its allies have rejected Moscow's key demands. They emphasize that Ukraine, like any other nation, has the right to choose alliances, although it is not a NATO member now and is unlikely to join any time soon. Putin said the Western allies' refusal to meet Russia's demands violates their obligations on the integrity of security for all nations. He warned that a Ukrainian accession to NATO could lead to a situation where Ukraine launches military action to reclaim control over Russian-annexed Crimea or areas controlled by Russia-backed separatists in the country's east. ""Imagine that Ukraine becomes a NATO member and launches those military operations,"" Putin said. ""Should we fight NATO then? Has anyone thought about it?"" Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 following the ouster of the country's Moscow-friendly president and later threw its weight behind rebels in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, triggering a conflict that has killed over 14,000 people. Putin charged that while the U.S. airs concerns about Ukraine's security, it is using the ex-Soviet country as an ""instrument"" in its efforts to contain Russia. He alleged that Washington may try to ""draw us into a military conflict and force its allies in Europe to impose the tough sanctions the U.S. is talking about now."" Another possible option would be to ""draw Ukraine into NATO, deploy offensive weapons there"" and encourage Ukrainian nationalists to use force to reclaim the rebel-held east or Crimea, ""drawing us into a military conflict,"" Putin claimed. Speaking after talks with Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, who has forged closer ties with Moscow than almost any other NATO member, Putin noted that it's still possible to negotiate a settlement that would take every party's concerns into account. ""We need to find a way to ensure interests and security of all parties, including Ukraine, European nations and Russia,"" Putin said, emphasizing that the West needs to treat Russian proposals seriously to make progress. He said French President Emmanuel Macron may soon visit Moscow as part of renewed diplomatic efforts following their call on Monday. In a bid to exert pressure on the West, Lavrov sent letters to the U.S. and other Western counterparts pointing out their past obligations signed by all members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a top trans-Atlantic security grouping. Russia has argued that NATO's expansion eastward has hurt Russia's security, violating the principle of ""indivisibility of security"" endorsed by the OSCE in 1999 and 2010. It says the U.S. and its allies have ignored the principle that the security of one nation should not be strengthened at the expense of others, while insisting on every nation's right to choose alliances. In his letter, which was released by the foreign ministry, Lavrov said ""there must be security for all or there will be no security for anyone."" And in his call with Blinken, Lavrov warned that Moscow will not allow Washington to ""hush up"" the issue. Blinken, meanwhile, emphasized ""the U.S. willingness, bilaterally and together with Allies and partners, to continue a substantive exchange with Russia on mutual security concerns."" However, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Blinken was resolute in ""the U.S. commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of all countries to determine their own foreign policy and alliances."" Blinken ""urged immediate Russian de-escalation and the withdrawal of troops and equipment from Ukraine's borders,"" Price said. He reaffirmed that ""further invasion of Ukraine would be met with swift and severe consequences and urged Russia to pursue a diplomatic path."" Senior State Department officials described the call as professional and ""fairly candid,"" noting that if Russia wanted to prove it isn't going to invade Ukraine, it should withdraw its troops from the border and neighboring Belarus. Shortly after speaking to Lavrov, Blinken convened a conference call with the secretary general of NATO, the EU foreign policy chief and the chairman-in-office of the OSCE as part of efforts to ensure that the allies are engaged in any further contacts with Russia. Speaking to reporters at the United Nations, Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the U.S. statement about its readiness for dialogue ""doesn't correlate"" with Washington sending planeloads of military equipment to Ukraine. ""I don't know why the U.S. is escalating tensions and at the same time accusing Russia,"" he said. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Kyiv for scheduled talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Johnson said the U.K. has a package of measures including sanctions ready to go ""the moment the first Russian toecap crosses further into Ukrainian territory."" ""It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy, and I believe that is still possible,"" Johnson said. ""We are keen to engage in dialogue, of course we are. But we have the sanctions ready."" He said he would have a call with Putin on Wednesday, noting that the Russian leader was trying to ""impose a new Yalta, new zones of influence"" in a reference to the 1945 deal between the allied powers. ""And it would not just be Ukraine that was drawn back into the Russian sphere of influence,"" Johnson added. In other developments, Biden was expected to nominate career foreign service officer Bridget Brink to assume the long-vacant diplomatic post of American ambassador to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official familiar with the decision. Brink currently serves as the ambassador to Slovakia.",29,7.563161396408973,4.9535848684735875,2.6095765279353857,18
2022-02-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-united-states-troops-eastern-europe/,"U.S. to deploy 3,000 troops to Eastern Europe amid Russia threat to Ukraine","About 3,000 U.S. troops will deploy to locations in Eastern Europe in the coming days in response to the continued Russian buildup near the borders of Ukraine and in Belarus. The deployments include 1,000 who will be moving from Germany to Romania, and 2,000 from the U.S. who will head to Germany and Poland. ""At the president's direction and following Secretary Austin's recommendation, the Department of Defense will reposition certain Europe-based units further east, forward deploy additional U.S.-based units to Europe, and maintain the heightened state of readiness of response forces to meet these commitments,"" a senior administration official told CBS News. The troops that are moving from Germany to Romania are coming from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. These forces are equipped with wheeled fighting vehicles, and they'll be joining the 900 troops that are already in regular rotation in Romania. About 1,700 of the 2,000 troops coming from the U.S. are coming from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from the 82nd Airborne Division. Another 300 will be provided by the 18th Airborne Corps. According to a fact sheet released by the Defense Department, these troops can perform a ""variety of missions to deter aggression."" On Wednesday morning, the Pentagon emphasized that the troop movement was temporary and that they would not deploy to Ukraine. ""I want to be very clear about something,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. ""These are not permanent moves. They are designed to respond to the current security environment. Moreover, these forces are not going to fight in Ukraine. They're going to ensure the robust defense of our NATO allies."" Kirby also noted that these deployments are taking place in addition to movements already made by NATO allies to support Eastern Europeans countries. For instance, six American F-15s and the U.S. Air Force personnel to fly them have arrived at an airbase in Estonia. They're joining Belgian F-16s as part of a multinational force conducting air patrols along the NATO's eastern flank this week. The Pentagon has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could launch an invasion of Ukraine at any time. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley on Friday said Russia has amassed over 100,000 ground forces, air forces, naval forces and special forces, as well as cyber and electronic warfare and other capabilities on Ukraine's border. The troops are moving within Europe to bolster the countries in the eastern flank of NATO. The U.S. already has thousands of troops in Europe that could be called upon to support. For instance, according to the Pentagon, there are approximately 100 rotational U.S. military personnel deployed to Lithuania, 4,000 to Poland, and 60 to Latvia and Estonia. President Biden has said no U.S. troops would deploy to Ukraine if Russia were to invade, but the administration did say it could deploy troops to the region even before an invasion. The U.S. and its partners in NATO have already sent assets to the region in a show of support. Ukraine is not a member of NATO but it shares a border with four NATO countries — Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania — which could face repercussions if Russia were to launch a full invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. has also put 8,500 stateside troops on heightened alert to deploy to Eastern Europe in case NATO activates its shared NATO Response Force, but the alliance has not yet activated it. If both the U.S. troops and the U.S. troops committed to the NATO Response Force deploy, there would be more than 8,500 U.S. troops bolstering the defense of NATO's eastern flank.

The deployment is just part of the Biden administration's efforts to bolster NATO defenses on the far eastern edge of Europe amid soaring tension with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin gave no indication on Tuesday that he was about to bow to pressure from the U.S. and its allies to start pulling back the 100,000-plus forces he has positioned around Ukraine's borders. Instead, he reiterated his accusation that NATO and the U.S. are causing the tension by placing missiles and troops in countries close to Russia's western borders and ignoring his demands for ""security guarantees"" from the alliance. Putin accused the U.S. of using Ukraine as a pawn in a bid to ""contain"" Russia, portraying his own country as the victim even though the current crisis grew out of his still-unexplained decision to deploy tens of thousands of troops around Ukraine's borders. The Kremlin has insisted for months that it's merely for exercises, and that Russian can do what it wants with its own forces on its own soil. But it was only eight years ago that Putin's forces last pushed into Ukraine, to fight alongside separatists who are still locked in battle with Ukrainian troops in the country's east, and to facilitate his annexation of the Crimean Peninsula away from his neighbor. Few countries recognize Putin's 2014 landgrab, but he made it clear again on Tuesday that, as far as his government is concerned, Crimea is now Russian territory. New images released this week by the Maxar satellite company show Putin's military buildup continuing in Crimea, which most nations still consider an occupied part of southern Ukraine, and to Ukraine's north in Belarus, and to its east, on Russian soil. ""During the past couple of weeks, several new significant military deployments have been observed in Belarus,"" Maxar said in an analysis accompanying its latest images. I said the pictures show new housing for forces, ""at virtually every deployment location in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia,"" indicating an ""increased level of activity and readiness."" President Biden has said there's a ""distinct possibility"" that Russia will invade Ukraine again this month, and the White House and its allies have said if that happens, it will be considered not only an aggression against an ally, but an assault on the basic tenets of European security that have kept relative peace on the continent since the end of World War II. The U.S. F-15s now in Estonia — a NATO ally that shares a land border with Russia — joined Belgian F-16s as part of a multinational force conducting air patrols along the alliance's eastern flank this week. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, the sub-freezing temperatures in Estonia are a far cry from North Carolina, where the planes and personnel of the U.S. Air Force's 336th Fighter Squadron are based. Around 120 U.S. personnel have been deployed to the Ämari Air Base, near Estonia's capital of Tallinn and right on Russia's doorstep, along with the fighter jets. D'Agata watched as American F-15 Screaming Eagles soared into the sky from Ämari in a show of U.S. military firepower. The message to NATO allies along the border separating European democracies from Russia is clear: The U.S. has your back. The message to Russia is just as clear: We're watching. The U.S. fighter squadron in Estonia is taking part in what NATO calls an ""enhanced air policing mission."" ""This is a team effort from the NATO alliance,"" Lieutenant Colonel Taylor Gifford, the 336th squadron's Director of Operations, told D'Agata. That cooperation is vital, because the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — all NATO members — are sandwiched between Russia, its ally Belarus and the Baltic Sea. The Russian military has already deployed fighter jets to the region, launched naval exercises in the Baltic and rolled missile systems and troops into Belarus. Moscow says it's just for exercises, but U.S. officials believe Putin could use the presence in Ukraine's northern neighbor, or in Crimea, as potential routes for an invasion. The NATO mission in Estonia was created as a direct response to Russian military aggression. Now, with Moscow threatening once again, it's never been more vital to security in the region. Steps to bolster NATO's presence in the Baltics with additional U.S. forces began after the Russian incursion into eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014. The commander of the Estonian Air Force, Brigadier General Rauno Sirk, told CBS News the U.S. jets that arrived this week are vital, ""to bolster, to strengthen the air policing here and to show that the alliance is taking its business seriously."" Sirk told D'Agata that a Russian fighter jet crossed into NATO airspace near Estonia over the weekend. On Wednesday, the U.K. scrambled fighter jets to intercept Russian aircraft approaching Britain's aviation ""area of interest"" north of Scotland. Eastern European leaders are calling for more U.S. military support in the region, including Estonia's prime minister, who said the only thing Russia respects is ""an American flag.""",29,2.4359845763328454,6.297162461729437,-3.8611778853965917,21
2022-02-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/havana-syndrome-cases-directed-energy/,"Expert panel reaffirms directed energy could be behind ""Havana Syndrome"" cases","Washington — A declassified summary of an expert panel's findings released Wednesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence found that the mysterious neurological condition known as ""Havana Syndrome"" may be ""plausibly"" explained by pulsed, electromagnetic energy, reaffirming the findings of a previous study but otherwise making little headway in affirmatively identifying a cause. The panel, which included experts from inside and outside the U.S. government, was established by the Biden administration last year with the task of identifying potential mechanisms behind the incidents that for several years have affected scores of U.S. government personnel. Some victims have suffered effects so debilitating they have had to leave the workforce. Intelligence officials familiar with the work of the panel, formally called the Intelligence Community (IC) Experts Panel on Anomalous Health Incidents (AHIs), said Wednesday that a ""subset"" of the incidents could not be explained by known environmental or medical conditions, suggesting they could be due to an external stimulus, including directed energy. ""Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radio frequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics, although information gaps exist,"" a redacted summary of the findings says. ""Using non-standard antennas and techniques, the signals could be propagated with low loss through the air for tens to hundreds of meters, and with some loss, through most building materials."" The panel noted, however, that ""there is a dearth of systematic research on the effects of the relevant electromagnetic signals on humans."" The officials also said that psychosocial factors, including mass sociogenic illness, could not alone account for the reported symptoms — though they could play a role in compounding or prolonging some victims' medical effects. The panel's main findings are in line with a previous study commissioned by the State Department and published in late 2020 by the National Academies of Sciences, which said the ""most plausible"" cause of the symptoms was ""directed, pulsed, radiofrequency energy."" A small number of members of the expert panel also worked on the National Academies study, officials said. The 2020 study, alongside anecdotal evidence cited by current and former American officials, fueled speculation that the cases could be the result of attempted intelligence collection by foreign government operatives who were using directed energy technologies or weapons, with Russia often mentioned as a leading suspect. No evidence has emerged publicly tying Russia or any other foreign actor or specific technology to the incidents. U.S. officials have warned the Russian government at least twice of consequences, however, if it was determined to have a role. Unlike the interim report issued by the CIA's internal task force last month, the experts panel did not consider questions related to attribution, including whether a foreign actor could be involved. According to the redacted summary, the panel examined thousands of classified documents and interviewed a select number of individuals who had reported symptoms. It focused its efforts on evaluating the plausibility of five potential causal mechanisms: acoustic signals, chemical and biological agents, ionizing radiation, natural and environmental factors, and radio frequency and other electromagnetic energy. It ruled out as ""implausible"" all but pulsed electromagnetic energy and ultrasound used in close proximity to a target. The other mechanisms the panel evaluated ""are unlikely on their own to account for the required effects or are technically or practically infeasible,"" according to the summary. The CIA's report, which did not extensively examine physical or technological explanations for the incidents, ruled out attacks by an adversary in a ""majority"" of cases it examined, while acknowledging they were still possible in a small group of roughly two dozen cases. Those cases are the focus of continued investigation by its task force, intelligence officials said. There have been roughly 1,000 reports of suspected incidents made by U.S. personnel since 2016, when the first spate of cases arose among diplomats and intelligence officers in Havana, Cuba. Incidents have since been reported from every populated continent, and in some cases required officials to be medevaced to the U.S. for treatment. The expert panel personally interviewed between 10 and 20 victims while examining the medical records of ""many, many more,"" officials said. ""We focused on ones that we felt were unique, without other possible explanations,"" one intelligence official said. ""Not to diminish the other cases, but to give us an ability to focus in on a certain number."" The panel's findings were cautiously welcomed by victims' groups, which urged continued investigation into the cause of symptoms that can include nausea, vertigo, ear ringing, debilitating headaches and, in some cases, a diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury. ""Today's release of the unclassified executive summary of the report by the expert panel … reinforces the need for the intelligence community and the broader U.S. government to redouble their efforts to fully understand the causes of Anomalous Health Incidents, or 'Havana Syndrome,'"" one victims' group said. Victims had been more critical of the CIA's interim findings, which they called a ""disturbing curtailment"" of government-wide efforts to arrive at attribution for the incidents and insisted ""must not be the last word on this matter."" Senior officials said the work of the expert panel would continue. ""Moving forward, the work of the IC Experts Panel will help sharpen the work of the IC and broader U.S. Government as we focus on possible causes. We will stay at it, with continued rigor, for however long it takes,"" Director of National intelligence Avril Haines and CIA Director William Burns said in a joint statement. ""The U.S. Government remains committed to providing access to care for those who need it, and we will continue to share as much information as possible with our workforce and the American public as our efforts continue. Nothing is more important than the wellbeing and safety of our colleagues,"" they said. ""We welcome the findings of the Intelligence Community Experts Panel on anomalous health incidents,"" a National Security Council spokesperson said. ""The Panel undertook a rigorous, multi-disciplinary study that has identified important findings and recommendations that will inform intensive research and investigation moving forward as we continue our government-wide effort to get to the bottom of AHI."" The expert panel made seven recommendations for better understanding, preventing and managing the incidents, including streamlining data collection, identifying new biomarkers associated with the illness, improving detection mechanisms and better coordinating communication about the incidents. Importantly, the panel found that in most cases, swift medical care was integral to recovery. ""What we do know is, if you report quickly and promptly get medical care, most people are getting well,"" one official said. Intelligence officials familiar with the panel's work acknowledged that the slow pace of progress in determining a cause was ""frustrating."" ""Part of the challenge is, humans are all different,"" one official said. He cited a panel member who had observed, ""humans are really good sensors, but not the best or sometimes inconsistent reporters."" ""One challenge we're dealing with is the signs, the symptoms, the incidents present themselves in a variety of ways,"" the official said. The officials also noted that some cases could have been exacerbated by the nature of some of the victims' work. ""Other incidents could be due to hyper vigilance and normal human reactions to stress and ambiguity, particularly among a workforce attuned to its surroundings and trained to think about security,"" the summary said. The panel's findings are the latest but presumably not the last of the administration's efforts to arrive at an explanation for the incidents. On Tuesday, President Biden named the senior director for intelligence programs at the National Security Council, Maher Bitar, to officially serve as the government's anomalous health incident interagency coordinator. Bitar had been effectively carrying out this role since early last year, but provisions in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the role be codified. Government agencies with personnel affected by Havana Syndrome — which include the State Department, the CIA and broader intelligence community, the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department, including the FBI — must also now name senior officials to serve as ""AHI Coordination Leads"" and update their guidance on the incidents to their respective workforces by February 25. Victims' groups lauded the appointment, calling it a ""welcome expression of concern and support by the President and his team."" ""We look forward to other agencies and departments designating their AHI leads, as appropriate, and issuing updated guidance to elements of their workforce who are determined to be at risk of exposure to AHI,"" the group's statement said.",3,8.718300537467924,8.073103861984341,0.6451966754835823,24

That assertion drew some fiery exchanges at the United Nations Security Council on Monday, as the U.S. pushed Russia to explain to the world why it has massed 100,000 troops around Ukraine's borders. Moscow's envoy said he didn't even know why the meeting had been called, and he accused the U.S. and its European allies of stoking unfounded fears of war. The gulf in the two global powers' positions is so vast they can't even agree on whether the Kremlin provided a written reaction on Monday to the Biden administration's response to Russian demands for ""security guarantees"" from NATO. A State Department spokesperson in Washington said on Monday that Moscow had delivered a response to the U.S., but that ""it would be unproductive to negotiate in public, so we'll leave it up to Russia if they want to discuss their response."" On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said his government had yet to reply to the counter proposals from the White House — which did not include anything close to what Moscow demanded, including Ukrainian NATO membership being ruled out. Lavrov said Russia would respond to the U.S. when it ""sees fit."" But while the two governments argue about who has replied to who and which side is really causing the tension along Ukraine's borders, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports from eastern Ukraine that for thousands of people, it's not a question of when war will start, but if it will ever end. Williams met Ukrainian troops who live in the freezing trenches that carve up farmland and villages across a vast swath of eastern Ukraine, splitting the country in two. The soldiers she met are already fighting Russian-backed separatists: They've been at war on the far eastern edge of Europe since 2014, when Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula. The simmering conflict has left devastation and, by the Ukrainian government's count, claimed more than 14,000 lives in the process. The town of Avdiivka, only around 200 yards from the front line, is battle scarred and broken — a skeleton of its former self with the wreckage of war scattered around its outskirts. Serhii Leyenkyi, who works for the local government, showed Williams and her team a field planted with a deadly crop: The entire area is a giant minefield. Eight years ago, the Russian-backed separatists took control of towns and cities across eastern Ukraine, and as the country spiraled into war, Avdiivka became a flashpoint. Its residents were caught in the crossfire and many people fled, left homeless and hopeless. As the U.S. warns of a possible new Russian invasion, Ukrainians seem remarkably calm — perhaps resigned to the fact that they cannot control their giant neighbor. Some believe Putin wants a Ukraine that answers to him, rather than an ally of the U.S., and that he intends to use force to get his way. That's not a new idea in Avdiivka, where they've been living with the daily punishment of war for years. ""War is every day difficult, you know. When you don't have water, when you don't have electricity, it's very, very bad,"" Leyenkyi told CBS News. Russia insists that it has no plan to invade again, but in Ukraine, Russian aggression isn't a possibility, it is a daily reality.",29,5.542262933645233,2.143434424184958,3.3988285094602753,18

2022-01-31,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-us-ukrainian-civilian-volunteers-train-for-war/,"As Russia sends mixed signals, Ukrainian civilians train for war","Eastern Ukraine — The U.N. Security Council held a meeting on Monday — called by the U.S. and over Russia's objection — to discuss the standoff on Ukraine's borders, along which Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops. The U.S. and its NATO allies have warned for weeks that President Vladimir Putin could use the forces to launch a new invasion of Ukraine as soon as February, though Putin's government denies any such intentions. The U.S. has responded by pouring military hardware in to bolster Ukraine's forces, and NATO has deployed troops, aircraft and warships to reinforce the bloc's defenses in the region. The U.S. and its European allies won't send troops into Ukraine as it's not a NATO member, but they've warned repeatedly that any Russian forces crossing the Ukrainian border will be considered an invasion, and will draw prompt and severe sanctions against Russia. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reports, Ukrainians are determined to defend their homeland, but even with an influx of American weaponry, they're massively outgunned and outnumbered by their colossal neighbor. Despite the odds, thousands of Ukrainian civilians have joined local defense units. Williams met some of the citizen soldiers on the outskirts of Ukraine's capital where, every Saturday, they gather and do a quick warm up before they're put through drills — training to help fight off a hypothetical Russian attack. ""I know Russians very well,"" Oleksei Vasilchenko told Williams. The defense unit volunteer works in marketing, but told CBS News he served in the Soviet army before Ukraine gained its independence from Moscow just over 30 years ago. ""If you want peace, you should be prepared for war,"" he said. The defense unit volunteers include everyone from urban professionals to military veterans like Vasilchenko, to new recruits. Many are thus far armed only with plywood rifles — stand-ins for the real thing. Russia's hardware, on the other hand, is impressive — and Moscow has been showing it off. Putin's forces have moved fighter jets, missile systems and about 5,000 troops into Belarus, an ally and neighbor that sits on Ukraine's northern border. Russia insists that it is merely carrying out joint military exercises there, and that there's no plan to invade Ukraine. But on Monday, the Russian military noted that the exercises were expanding with the establishment of ""mobile field command posts"" in Belarus. The lack of Russian command and control centers set up in the border region has been one factor noted by military analysts to suggest that Moscow is not, in fact, planning an imminent invasion. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council members on Monday that the U.S. had ""seen evidence that Russia intends to expand that presence [in Belarus] to more than 30,000 troops near the Belarus-Ukraine border, less than two hours north of Kyiv, by early February."" ""If Russia further invades Ukraine, none of us will be able to say we didn't see it coming,"" Thomas-Greenfield told the meeting, appealing to Russia to pursue a diplomatic path rather than further escalation. Russia fired back during the meeting, accusing the U.S. and its allies of interference for criticizing Russia's military exercises and dismissing the suggestions of a possible invasion as ""conjectures and unfounded accusations."" ""Our Western colleagues talk about the need for de-escalation, but first of all they themselves escalate tension with rhetoric and provoke an escalation,"" Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said. ""Talking about an impending war is provocative in itself."" But the drills in Belarus aside, Russia has done nothing to explain why it decided to move so many forces close to its border with Ukraine over the last year in the first place. Russian officials have said for months that the deployments are merely for exercises, and that they can do what they want when they want on their own soil. In what appeared to be a continuation of the mixed messages coming from Moscow, even as it announced the command posts being set up in Belarus, the Russian military also said on Monday that some 6,000 troops deployed to the west of the country weeks ago, for ""planned operational and combat training,"" had been moved back to their permanent bases. Back in the forest outside Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, the local defense unit's members remained just as uncertain about Putin's intentions as the rest of the world. But they're also determined to be ready. CBS News watched as they kept up their fitness and practiced for the possibility of urban warfare. ""Everywhere here is our land, so we have to defend it,"" said volunteer Oleksei Ilyushan, who's a criminal lawyer during the work week. ""It makes me angry, but it's not like, 'Aargh, What am I gonna do?' — It makes me angry like, to prepare myself, you know?"" The U.S. has said a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be horrific and change the world, but the Biden administration has also said there's still time for President Putin to choose de-escalation. Putin is still formulating his official response to proposals from Washington that were handed over last week as a reply to Russia's demands for ""security guarantees from NATO. Moscow demanded that NATO pull its forces back from Russian border regions and reject any new bids for membership from former Soviet states — most importantly, Ukraine. The U.S. and NATO made it clear that they would not bar any prospective new members on Russia's behalf, but they have indicated a willingness to negotiate on military exercises and weapons deployments in the region, in addition to other ""trust building"" actions that both sides might take to step back from the brink of war. Putin's spokesman said Monday that the Russian leader would give his reply ""as soon as he deems it necessary."" In the meantime, the U.S. and its allies were sure to try to use the public forum of a U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday to increase the pressure on Moscow. The next day, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was to hold a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to the Russian ministry. Britain's foreign and defense ministers were also expected to visit Russia next week, Moscow's ambassador in London told a Russian television station on Monday, as efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis gained urgency.

""There's no reason that this situation has to devolve into conflict,"" Austin said during a briefing with reporters. ""He can choose to de-escalate. He can order his troops away. He can choose dialogue and diplomacy."" Milley told reporters that Russia has gathered upwards of 100,000 forces near Ukraine's borders. He also listed the capabilities such as ground maneuver forces, ballistic missiles, air force and said civilians could suffer if war were to break out in the scale and scope possible.

Mr. Biden said at a press conference last week that it was his ""guess"" that Russia would invate Ukraine. Asked if Russian military force in Ukraine is imminent, Stoltenberg said there's ""no certainty."" ""Well, there's uncertainty about the Russian plans, and maybe they have not made any final decision,"" Stoltenberg said. ""... We are ready to engage in political dialogue, but we're also ready to respond if Russia chooses and armed conflict, confrontation. So we are ready for both options. We are working hard for the best peaceful political solution, but we are also prepared for the worst — Russia once again using force against a neighbor, Ukraine."" Ukraine is not a NATO member, and Russia has sought assurances that Ukraine will never be a NATO member. Stoltenberg described what preparation looks like militarily. ""We have already, after Russia used force against Ukraine in 2014, for the first time in our history deployed combat-ready NATO battle groups in the eastern part of the alliance—in the Baltic countries and in Poland,"" he said. ""We have air-policing both in the Black Sea region and in the Baltic region. We have more naval presence, and over the last weeks we have actually stepped up the number of planes and ships in these different missions."" But Stoltenberg declined to say what the threshold is for deploying a NATO response force. ""We will never give any potential adversary that kind of privilege of defining exactly the threshold,"" Stoltenberg said. ""What we will do is that we will always be sure that we have the necessary forces in the right place at the right time to defend and protect all allies."" Stoltenberg said NATO's core task is to defend its 30 allies, which represent roughly 1 billion people across North America and Europe. But the alliance has now stepped up its presence in its eastern parts for the first time in its history, so ""if Russia wants less NATO at its borders, they've actually achieved exactly the opposite."" In a news conference Friday, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Ukraine has the right to be independent, and strongly encouraged Russia to stand down. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said ""conflict is not inevitable,"" and there is still time for diplomacy. — CBS News' Mary Walsh, Richard Escobedo and Eleanor Watson contributed to this report.",29,2.2485301155139377,0.48407790115224336,1.7644522143616943,19
2022-01-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-reaction-united-states-nato-ukraine-crisis-war/,Russia's reaction to U.S. and NATO leaves Ukraine crisis to fester on the brink of war,"Kyiv — Russia and NATO are continuing their military buildup around Ukraine, including more Russian fighter jets just across Ukraine's northern border in Belarus. Russia's ongoing military exercises with its Belarusian allies have fueled fears that Russia could launch an invasion into Ukraine, as it did in 2014. The U.S. and its NATO allies presented President Vladimir Putin's government with a written response to his demands for ""security guarantees"" on Wednesday, hoping to keep the crisis on a diplomatic track. But in the meantime, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams says America and its allies continue preparing for a possible Russian invasion. On Thursday, Russia's foreign minister said Putin had personally reviewed the response hand-delivered by the U.S. ambassador in Moscow. The reaction from Moscow indicated disappointment, but also a decision to keep talking, for now. The biggest ""guarantee"" Putin's regime sought is a commitment that NATO will rule out admitting Ukraine or any of its neighbors as new members of the trans-Atlantic security alliance, while also pulling forces back from Russian borders. NATO has bolstered troop and weapons deployments in the region — as a direct response to Russia moving some 100,000 of its forces close to Ukraine's eastern frontier, and now to its north in Belarus. The U.S. and NATO made it clear even before their formal response was delivered to Moscow that any ban on new NATO members in Eastern Europe was a ""non-starter,"" but they indicated a willingness to discuss other issues, including military exercises, weapons deployments in the region and other ""trust-building"" actions that could be taken by both sides. ""There was no positive response to the main question,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a statement on Thursday, referring to Ukraine's bid for NATO membership, but ""there is a response which gives hope for the start of a serious conversation on secondary questions."" But while diplomacy appeared set to continue, including bilateral talks expected in the coming days between Putin and France's leader, both sides in the standoff are keeping the pressure on. Russian military drills continue near Ukraine's borders. On Thursday, Moscow accused the U.S. of planning to position more missiles in the region. A senior foreign ministry official warned that such steps risked sparking a ""new missile crisis."" His warning came weeks after Russia refused to rule out positioning military hardware in Venezuela or Cuba, which brought echoes of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Six U.S. fighter jets arrived in Estonia, meanwhile, to take part in NATO military exercises. Slovakia's foreign minister said on Thursday that NATO was considering deploying additional troops to his country, too. Estonia and Slovakia are both NATO members. Estonia shares its eastern boundary with Russia, while Slovakia sits just west of Ukraine. NATO military deployments like those — in what Russia considers its own backyard — are something the Biden administration has indicated a willingness to negotiate on. ""The placement of offensive missile systems in Ukraine, military exercises and maneuvers in Europe — all of these things would address, I think, mutual concerns, including concerns stated by Russia,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday as the U.S. response to Russia's demands was delivered. While the U.S. and its allies have made a point of stressing their unity in confronting Russia's aggression, some of those allies rely heavily on Russia to meet their energy needs, including Europe's largest economy, Germany. That has tested the alliance's resolve. Germany is the biggest buyer of Russian natural gas, and it has refused to send weapons to Ukraine. But Germany's top diplomat indicated on Thursday that the country was in lockstep with its NATO allies in confronting Russia via sanctions, at least — even if that means looking for other gas suppliers, with some help from Washington. ""We are working on a strong package of sanctions,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told her nation's parliament on Thursday, noting that those sanctions could impact the long-awaited switching-on of the new ""Nord Stream 2"" gas pipeline, which connects Russia's suppliers directly with Western European consumers. The U.S. has long pressured Germany to avoid increasing its dependency on Russian energy with the pipeline, and it seemed assurances from Washington — to help arrange alternate gas supplies if Germany backs sanctions that impact Russian energy sales — may have helped to get Berlin on board. ""Should Russia choose to weaponize its natural gas by cutting supply to Europe even more than it's already done, we're in discussions with governments and major producers around the world about surging their capacity,"" Blinken said on Wednesday, alluding to discussions with U.S. allies in the Mideast who have their own gas fields. But while both sides continue to dig in, literally and figuratively, along the frontier separating Russia and European democracies, the people of Ukraine remain stuck in the middle. At the ornate, golden-domed St. Michael's Monastery in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, where the faithful have worshiped for over 900 years, some Ukrainians told Williams that they're praying for peace. One woman told CBS News that she hopes God himself will talk some sense into Russia. The U.S. said that with the handover of the response to Russia's questions on Wednesday, the ball is back in Moscow's court. With the Kremlin voicing disappointment, but not abandoning diplomacy, the next move is still hard to predict.",29,0.7449882209002766,3.171038338599268,-2.4260501176989915,18
2022-01-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-cyberattack-high-alert-united-states/,"DHS says U.S. on ""heightened alert"" for Russian cyberattack","With more than 100,000 Russian troops poised at the Ukrainian border, the Department of Homeland Security is warning that Russia could conduct a cyberattack against the United States if it feels threatened by further actions the U.S. takes in response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to a DHS Intelligence and Analysis bulletin sent to law enforcement partners nationwide, the U.S. government assesses that Russia would consider a cyberattack if ""a US or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security."" ""Russia maintains a range of offensive cyber tools that it could employ against US networks—from low-level denials of service to destructive attacks targeting critical infrastructure,"" the bulletin issued Sunday and obtained by CBS News, continued. The advisory follows the U.S.' decision to surge lethal weaponry to Ukraine's military in an effort to shore up its defenses. Last week, the Biden administration approved a proposal by NATO members Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia to send Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger air-defense systems to Ukrainian forces, as well as the transfer of light anti-tank weapons from the United Kingdom. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CBS News Thursday, ""it's very difficult to calibrate the likelihood"" of a cyberattack launched by the Russian government or its proxies in response to American support to Ukraine. But the secretary conceded the U.S. is currently on ""heightened alert by reason of the geopolitical landscape."" ""When the specter of harm arises, we call for vigilance. And quite frankly, in the cybersecurity arena, ever-present vigilance is what we call for,"" Mayorkas added. DHS indicated in its assessment that ""Russia's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyber attacks in the Homeland probably remains very high."" Officials ""have not observed Moscow directly employ these types of cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure—notwithstanding cyber espionage and potential prepositioning operations in the past."" In 2021, Russian-linked cyber gangs launched two devastating cyberattacks on the United States. Cybercriminals targeted the computer networks of Colonial Pipeline, America's largest fuel pipeline operator, responsible for delivering 45% of fuel along the East Coast and forced the shutdown, in April. Weeks later, an attack on JBS — the world's largest meat processing company – forced the company to halt cattle-slaughtering operations at 13 of its plants. The U.S. has also blamed the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) for the 2020 SolarWinds breach. The sophisticated spy campaign infiltrated more than 18,000 government and private computer networks and ultimately targeted nine federal agencies and scores of U.S. companies. Last week, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency known as ""CISA"" issued a memo urging leaders and network defenders to be on alert for malicious cyber activity after Ukrainian government servers were hit by an overnight defacement campaign. The digital sabotage forced government websites to be taken down, including the homepage for the Foreign Ministry, which temporarily displayed a message warning Ukraine's people to ""be afraid and expect the worst."" Ukrainian officials pointed the finger at Russia for another cyber outage. In 2016, Russian cybercriminals crashed the Ukrainian power grid with a click, causing nearly a quarter of a million people to lose power in the Ivano-Frankivsk region. In a sign of the U.S.' growing concern, both the DHS intelligence bulletin and the CISA memo followed a joint intelligence advisory from CISA, the FBI and NSA issued earlier this month, informing U.S. organizations of ""Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure."" ""As we push towards a conflict and we escalate, [cyber attacks] are more likely to be used by Russia that allows them to be aggressive, without escalating to a full out war,"" John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at Mandiant Threat Intelligence, briefed reporters, last week. ""Russia is a full spectrum player,"" Hultquist added. ""They send teams out physically, they hijack supply chains, they do information operations, they carry out cyber attack and cyber espionage. Thinking about their operations, they're very comfortable within the limitations of cyber.""",3,4.841799115067865,2.773553688255307,2.0682454268125583,1
2022-01-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-tactics-war-nato/,"If not a full-scale invasion, what might a Russian attack on Ukraine look like? We've seen it before.","Kyiv, Ukraine — The U.S. government's warning that Russia could launch a cyberattack targeting America's critical infrastructure likely surprised very few Ukrainians. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams and her team have been reporting on Russia's aggression in Ukraine — in its many forms — since Vladimir Putin's forces last invaded in 2014. Russia's buildup of about 100,000 troops around Ukraine's eastern borders has fueled fear of a full-scale invasion. Stressing their unity, the U.S. and its European allies have issued increasingly stark warnings that any Russian forces crossing the border would bring ""massive"" and ""severe"" consequences for Putin's government. But Williams' reporting on the war that has simmered quietly for seven years on the fault line between Russia and the democratic West shows Putin's tactics are often obscured. The question for Ukrainians now is not just if Russia will attack, but how. As NATO deployed fighter jets, troops and ships to reinforce defenses in Eastern Europe, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed his people on Monday evening. He urged them not to panic. Russia still insists it has no plans to invade Ukraine. The Kremlin blames the U.S. and NATO for causing the current crisis. Putin's spokesman pointed on Tuesday to the Biden administration putting 8,500 more troops on a state of heightened alert, ready to deploy to Europe if needed, as another ""escalation of tension."" But Russia has invaded Ukraine before, seizing control of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. That experience, and Russia's actions since, have drawn warnings from the U.S. that Moscow could rely on more secretive tactics. ""Paramilitary tactics, so-called gray zone attacks, and actions by soldiers not wearing Russian uniforms,"" said President Biden last week. Russia already stands accused of that in eastern Ukraine. Williams and her team witnessed first-hand Russian-backed separatists taking control of towns and cities in the Donbas region in 2014. That conflict has now killed more than 14,000 people. The U.S. says Russia controls the armed rebels. Seven years ago, CBS News saw well-equipped forces working alongside those rebels with all identifying insignia and national colors missing from their uniforms. ""I'm just a person,"" one of the men told Williams when she asked if he was Ukrainian or Russian. He wouldn't say any more. As recently as November last year a verdict delivered by a Russian court in a bribery case appeared to inadvertently reference the presence of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine's rebel-held Donbas region. Moscow flatly denies the presence of any Russian forces in Ukraine. Asked about the verdict that mentioned such a presence — which was quickly removed from the court's website — Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was ""probably the mistake of those who wrote this text."" Then there's Russia's proclivity for virtual warfare. Suspected Russian hackers have previously succeeded in crashing parts of Ukraine's power grid. When one power station came under attack in 2015, nearly 250,000 people lost electricity. The Department of Homeland Security has warned law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that Russia could target America with cyberattacks if ""a US or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security."" ""Russia maintains a range of offensive cyber tools that it could employ against U.S. networks — from low-level denials of service to destructive attacks targeting critical infrastructure,"" a bulletin issued Sunday by DHS warned. There is still hope that diplomacy can resolve the tension, however. Ukrainian and Russian officials will meet in Paris on Wednesday, along with their French and German counterparts, and Putin was to speak directly on the phone with French leader Emmanuel Macron in the coming days.",29,2.7837993767951095,3.9049890904245905,-1.121189713629481,20
2022-01-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-8500-troops-united-states-pentagon-nato/,"Pentagon puts 8,500 troops on heightened alert to deploy if requested by NATO","The Pentagon has notified military units in the U.S. that they should be prepared to deploy to Europe if the NATO alliance requests them, as tensions with Russia over its buildup on the border of Ukraine continue to rise. The vast majority of the 8,500 troops who have been put on alert would deploy as a part of the NATO Response Force if activated by NATO. Some, however, could deploy unilaterally to bolster countries on the eastern flank of NATO if the security situation in Eastern Europe deteriorates. The Pentagon has not yet identified which units have been put on alert, but the capabilities include additional brigade combat teams, reconnaissance, logistics, aviation, and transportation. U.S. forces in Europe could also be put on heightened alert to move within Europe if asked. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday that the decision was made by President Biden to put these troops on heightened alert, and was in part the result of advice given by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley. ""As of now, the decision has been made to put these units on higher alert, and higher alert only,"" Kirby said. ""No decisions have been made to deploy any forces from the United States at this time."" Some of these have already been in a heightened readiness to deploy posture, and Austin decided ""to shorten the tether even more,"" according to Kirby. Some of the units were on heightened alert to deploy within ten days if asked and now have been told they should be ready in as little as five days. The decision to put these forces on alert comes as NATO announced Monday it will be sending additional capabilities to the countries in the eastern flank of the alliance, and as embassies in Ukraine, including the American embassy, order some departures from the country. Kirby said Monday that Russia has not shown signs of deescalation and has in fact built up more forces along its border with Ukraine and in Belarus in recent weeks. Russia has amassed 100,000 troops along the border with Ukraine in recent weeks, and Mr. Biden said last week that it was his ""guess"" that Russia plans to invade.

2022-01-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-border-russia-forces-war-fear/,"Anxiety in Ukraine as NATO, U.S. and Russia bolster forces and accuse each other of pushing toward war","Kyiv, Ukraine — With more than 100,000 Russian troops massed near the Ukrainian border, the U.S. government ordered the families of American staff members to leave the country's capital, Kyiv. The State Department advised all private U.S. citizens to do the same, along with American non-essential embassy personnel. Moscow has denied a British government intelligence report suggesting that President Vladimir Putin wants to install a puppet government in Kyiv. But with his forces now deployed on three sides of Ukraine, American officials say Putin has the capacity to launch an invasion at any point — though they remain uncertain as to whether he's made the decision to do so. The Kremlin has sent mixed signals. Moscow denies any intention to invade Ukraine, as it did in 2014, but has warned repeatedly of unspecified ""military action"" if Putin's demands — most notably for NATO to rule out accepting new members in eastern Europe, including Ukraine — are not met. But while American and British diplomats pack their families up and send them home, many Ukrainians tell CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams that they have nowhere to run. They can only hope for peace, while the threat of a Russian attack hangs over them. Williams traveled from Kyiv to a crossing point on Ukraine's northern border with Russia. Just across the frontier, Russia has massed tens of thousands of its forces — on its own soil. Just to the west, Russian fighter jets, troops and missile systems have been moved into Belarus — a Russian ally that also shares a border with Ukraine — for what Moscow says are military exercises. Three decades after the Cold War inspired hope for a safer, more stable world, a U.S. ally in Europe is living in fear of a Russian invasion. Nina Belaya lives in one of the villages nearest to the border — potentially in the firing line if there is any Russian incursion. She showed Williams her cellar, where she stores food for the winter and where, more recently, she's planned to hole up for shelter if Russia attacks. Many Ukrainians now believe their freedom and their country's young democracy are being threatened by their colossal neighbor, and what some believe is Vladimir Putin's ambition to create a new Russian empire. Russia insists there are no plans to launch an invasion, and Putin's government blames the soaring tension on the U.S. and its allies, for arming Ukraine and refusing to reduce the Western military presence in the region. But the fact is that Ukraine is already fighting Russian-backed separatists, and it has been since Putin invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The U.S. has stepped up its support of Ukraine's forces with both training and weapons. The latest support, $200 million in emergency military assistance from the U.S., has already started arriving. On Monday, NATO said member states had put forces on standby and deployed at least one warship and fighter jets to Eastern European nations as part of efforts ""reinforcing the eastern part of the alliance."" ""NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. ""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment,"" he said, noting Denmark's recent deployment of a warship and some planes to the Baltic states, Spain boosting its naval presence in the Mediterranean and the Netherlands putting one ship and some land-based military units on standby. A Pentagon official told CBS News' David Martin over the weekend, meanwhile, that President Biden had been presented with options to send ""several thousand"" American troops to Eastern Europe to bolster NATO allies in the face of the Russian buildup. Russia reacted to the NATO movements, and the possibility of more U.S. troops arriving in what it considers its backyard, by claiming it all as further evidence that it is the West stoking tension, not Moscow. Russian lawmaker Andrei Kartapolov, who heads the defense committee in Russia's parliament, said Moscow would ""respond appropriately"" if the United States sent more forces to Eastern Europe or the Baltic countries, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. The attempt to frame the crisis as the West's fault is all straight out of Russia's playbook, according to former U.S. National Security Advisor, General HR McMaster. ""What they do is they twist reality,"" he told CBS News. ""They're always denying what is quite obvious in terms of the form of aggression that they're undertaking."" McMaster said President Putin only understands one thing: deterrence, and if the U.S. should have learned one thing by now about how to negotiate with his government, it's that the Russian leader will always push his luck. ""It's power. I think Putin understands this,"" said McMaster. ""Putin will take whatever he can get.""

The exercise, called Neptune Strike '22, has been in the works since 2020 and is not designed to test any potential scenarios related to Ukraine, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Friday. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that ""this exercise will help demonstrate the unity, capability, and strength of the transatlantic alliance."" The Russian Ministry of Defense announced last week in a press release its own exercises across all areas of responsibility, including in the Mediterranean Sea. The exercises are scheduled to take place in January and February and are planned to involve more than 140 ships and supporting vessels, 60 aircraft, and about 10,000 military personnel. The USS Harry Truman carrier strike group is under the command and control of NATO in the exercise which is scheduled to go until February 4. NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said this is the first time a U.S. aircraft carrier has come under NATO's command since the Cold War. The exercise comes as the American and European officials continue to express concern of Russia's military buildup near the borders of Ukraine that is showing no signs of deescalating. NATO announced on Monday it will send additional ships and fighter jets to NATO to allies in eastern Europe as a deterrent, with the potential to send more if Russia invades Ukraine. ""We have a U.S. aircraft carrier group under NATO command - that is not in the Baltic Sea - but of course it matters for the security of Europe, so we have stepped up,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday, as he listed other steps the alliance has taken recently. ""But this is defensive. NATO is not threatening Russia. It is proportionate,"" Stoltenberg said. Kirby said Friday there were considerations over potentially calling off the exercise given tensions with Russia but ultimately, NATO decided to go ahead with the long-planned exercise. Russia has amassed upwards of 100,000 troops along the border with Ukraine, and American officials have said that Russian President Vladimir Putin has the capacity to launch an invasion at any point — though they remain uncertain as to whether he's made the decision to do so.

""I believe we are on a clearer path to understanding each others' concerns,"" Blinken said. America and its European allies were prepared to look for ways to address Russia's own concerns over NATO's presence near its borders, but only ""in the spirit of reciprocity."" ""I laid out several ideas to reduce tensions and increase security,"" Blinken said, noting that the ideas had been formulated with American allies in Europe, and that there could be no resolution to the standoff that failed to secure Ukraine's safety and self-determination as a sovereign nation. ""If any Russian forces move across Ukraine's border, that's an invasion,"" Blinken said. ""It would bring a swift, severe, and a united response from the United States and our partners and allies."" There are roughly 100,000 Russian troops massed along Ukraine's border, and President Joe Biden said this week that his ""guess"" is that Russia will ""move in"" to Ukraine. Mr. Biden has warned that an invasion would be met with tough new economic sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime and lead to a ""consequential"" loss of Russian life. But amid a lack of clear consensus among the U.S. and its NATO allies over exactly how to deter Russia, or how to respond to any hypothetical incursion into Ukraine, the U.S. has continued pushing for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. The Biden administration was hoping to gauge, through Blinken's meeting with Lavrov, what Putin's intentions really are, and whether there are concessions that both sides could agree on to pull back from the brink of war, as NATO and Russia continue moving weapons and forces to the border region. Ukraine's capital of Kyiv is almost 5,000 miles from American soil, but the Biden administration has said the conflict — which has simmered in eastern Ukraine since Putin's forces invaded in 2014 and is now threatening to escalate dramatically — is no simple regional dispute far from American shores. It's about protecting democracy, and stopping Russia from turning its neighbors into puppet states, Blinken said this week. Moscow has consistently denied any intention to invade Ukraine, but has said that if NATO refuses to meet Putin's demands for ""security guarantees,"" it could reply with unspecified military action. New satellite images show the massive buildup of Russian troops and weaponry along Ukraine's borders. Mr. Biden has said a Russian incursion might not use conventional tactics, suggesting Putin could instead rely on ""paramilitary tactics, so-called grey zone attacks, and actions by soldiers not wearing Russian uniforms."" The U.S. has also voiced concern that Russia could use a so-called ""false-flag"" operation as a pretext to attack Ukraine. To step back, Russia has demanded commitments from NATO, including a total withdrawal of NATO troops from Bulgaria and Romania, and for the Western military alliance to promise it will not admit Ukraine — or any other former Soviet State — as a new member. The U.S. and its partners have called that last demand a non-starter, insisting that NATO membership is for the alliance to decide, not Moscow. Blinken and Lavrov spoke separately after their talks in Geneva. Lavrov came to a podium first, saying he expected the United States to provide a clear, written response to all of its demands next week. He was dismissive of the U.S. and NATO's claims that Russia was poised to attack Ukraine, again insisting there were no such plans. ""Today I did not hear a single argument that would substantiate the American position on what is happening on the Russian-Ukrainian border, only concerns, concerns, concerns,"" he said. ""Our concerns are about real facts that no one hides: pumping weapons into Ukraine, sending hundreds of Western military instructors to Ukraine."" The U.S. is sending up to $200 million worth of emergency military aid to Ukraine and has authorized its European allies to transfer American-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to the country. But the U.S. has ruled out sending troop in to bolster Ukraine's forces. Many believe Putin's real motive is to gain control over as much territory in neighboring nations as possible, by any means necessary. ""He works like a terrorist — with nuclear weapons… but he's still a terrorist,"" Ukrainian political analyst Mykola Davydiuk told CBS News. It's been 30 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, but now a European capital is again staring down the barrel of a Russian gun, and Ukrainians are frightened. ""It's not only threaten for Ukraine, it's threaten for all the world,"" Kyiv resident Natalia told Williams on Friday. ""We want a normal life, how we want it, not anybody telling us what to do,"" said another local, Viktor. Before heading into their closed-door meeting, both Blinken and Lavrov played down expectations. ""We don't expect to resolve our differences here today,"" Blinken told reporters before the 90 minute talks. ""But I do hope and expect that we can test whether the path of diplomacy or dialogue remains open."" ""This is a critical moment,"" he added. Lavrov said he didn't ""expect a breakthrough at these negotiations either. What we expect is concrete answers to our concrete proposals."" It was clear that Blinken did not give Russia direct answers to its security demands on Friday. The chances of Moscow getting the answers it wants to demands it has framed as ultimatums still looked slim after the senior diplomats' discussion in Geneva. But they did appear to have bought some more time. The big questions remain, however: How much common ground can the U.S. and Russia find to keep the diplomacy going and a wider armed conflict at bay, and how will Putin respond, as soon as next week, to not getting everything he's demanded from the West? Lavrov said he and Blinken expected to speak again soon, after the U.S. provides formal responses to Moscow's demands.

2022-01-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/havana-syndrome-cia-task-force-foreign-attacks-rule-out/,"CIA ""Havana Syndrome"" task force rules out foreign attacks in most reported cases in interim report","The Central Intelligence Agency has issued a set of interim findings on hundreds of reported cases of the mysterious neurological illness known as ""Havana Syndrome,"" ruling out in the ""majority"" of instances an attack by a foreign adversary, but vowing to intensify its focus on a group of two dozen ""priority"" cases that remain unexplained. ""We assess that the majority of reports of [anomalous health incidents] can be reasonably explained by medical conditions or environmental and technical factors, including previously undiagnosed illnesses,"" a senior CIA official said, using the term coined by the Biden administration to describe the incidents. Summarizing the findings of an internal CIA task force dedicated to investigating the cases, the official said, ""In this extensive investigation we have so far not found evidence of state-actor involvement in any incident,"" adding, ""[W]e assess it unlikely that a foreign actor, including Russia, is conducting a sustained, worldwide campaign, harming U.S. personnel with a weapon or mechanism."" However, the official emphasized, the agency's task force would continue investigating a small number of cases whose cause could not be determined. In those cases, the official said, the CIA has still ""not ruled out the involvement of a foreign actor."" ""There is a subset of cases, some of our toughest cases, that remain unresolved and remain the focus of active investigation,"" the official said, confirming they involved U.S. personnel from the CIA and other government agencies, but declining to specify where or when those incidents had occurred. In a statement, CIA Director William Burns said, ""We are pursuing this complex issue with analytic rigor, sound tradecraft, and compassion and have dedicated intensive resources to this challenge."" ""While we have reached some significant interim findings, we are not done. We will continue the mission to investigate these incidents and provide access to world-class care for those who need it,"" said Burns, who, since he was nominated to lead the agency, has repeatedly vowed to find answers and provide care to affected personnel. The CIA's findings, which reflect the intelligence community's current view, come amid an ongoing, government-wide effort to understand and identify the cause of the mysterious affliction, which is characterized by symptoms like nausea, dizziness, ear popping and headaches, and is often preceded by a sensation of heat or pressure. The incidents first gained prominence after they were reported by personnel at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. There has since been a stream of reports made by American diplomats, intelligence officers and military personnel stationed or traveling in countries worldwide — including Austria, Colombia, Germany, Serbia, India, Vietnam and others — many of which resulted in victims being medevaced to the U.S. for medical treatment. There have also been cases reported on U.S. soil, including in Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and Boston. In 2020, a study by the National Academies of Sciences commissioned by the State Department said the ""most plausible"" cause was ""directed, pulsed, radiofrequency energy."" That study, alongside other evidence circulated by current and former American officials, fueled unofficial hypotheses that the cases were the result of attempted intelligence collection by Russian or other government operatives who were using directed energy technologies or weapons. Burns has in the past said that Russia ""could be"" behind the incidents, but also allowed that there were ""a number of possibilities."" He also personally warned the Russians during meetings in Moscow last November of ""consequences"" if they were found to be involved. It was the second time the incidents were known to have been raised with Russia; they were also raised briefly during President Biden's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva last June. Burns personally witnessed a member of his staff suffer symptoms consistent with Havana Syndrome during a trip to Delhi, India, in September. The officer sought immediate medical care following the incident. Moscow has consistently denied involvement in the incidents, and no evidence has emerged publicly tying Russia to the illness. In early 2021, the Biden administration launched an intelligence review and established an expert panel of intelligence officers and medical experts to evaluate reported cases and the possible technologies behind them; its findings are expected to be delivered soon . National security adviser Jake Sullivan also appointed a senior director at the National Security Council to streamline data collection and lines of inquiry. As part of its efforts, the Biden administration and the agencies with personnel who have been affected encouraged employees to report health incidents they suspected might be linked to Havana Syndrome. The result was a significant influx of reports, many of which CIA officials acknowledged may have been made out of an ""abundance of caution"" and out of a growing awareness about the incidents among government employees. Over time, the drumbeat of reports began to resonate among the workforces at the State Department, Pentagon and CIA, whose employees were most often involved. Unease about the cause of the symptoms and concerns about several incidents that involved family members and children led some employees considering deployment overseas to waver, according to people familiar with the discussions. The continuing reports also prompted rare bipartisan action from Congress, which unanimously passed legislation, signed into law by President Biden last fall, designed to boost compensation and access to medical care for victims with confirmed brain injuries. The CIA and the State Department are currently working on establishing internal criteria for compensating victims who have suffered symptoms, as required by the legislation. Many U.S. officials affected by the syndrome struggled with debilitating symptoms for years, and paid out of pocket for diagnostic and medical care. As the cases gained prominence and Congress and the administration took action, many expressed a sense of relief that their experiences were being recognized and acknowledged as real by government leaders. A number of victims have also since begun receiving treatment at either Walter Reed or Johns Hopkins Medicine, both of which have established specialized programs for evaluating and treating the incidents. But victims' groups responded to the CIA's interim findings with concern and disappointment, and urged investigations into the incidents' cause to continue. ""[A]s the CIA itself acknowledges, not all the cases can be explained away. This cannot and must not be the last word on this matter, because it is neither definitive, nor comprehensive,"" the ""Advocacy for Victims of Havana Syndrome"" group said in a statement. ""We respectfully ask the President of the United States to tell the interagency to keep working and return to him at such time as they have a collective answer or hypothesis."" The group also called on congressional oversight committees to ""examine the conclusions"" and crafting of the report, as well as the decisions that led to its release. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said of the CIA's assessment, ""[I]t's important to note that today's assessment, while rigorously conducted, reflects only the interim work of the CIA task force."" ""The Senate Intelligence Committee will continue pressing for answers on a bipartisan basis, and we look forward to a final government report, as well as the conclusions of the outside experts panel that has been assembled to seek answers to these very urgent and difficult questions,"" Warner said. ""This is an extraordinarily difficult problem set, and a whole of government approach is required to solve it, using all the resources of the [intelligence community] and [Department of Defense], as well as open source and commercially available data,"" said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer who resigned a senior post after struggling with debilitating symptoms that began during a 2017 visit to Moscow. CIA officials who briefed reporters on the agency's interim findings said there was ""community agreement"" across U.S. intelligence agencies that there was no evidence of a global campaign being waged by a foreign actor, though some intelligence agencies had differing confidence levels in that assessment. They also said the task force had worked closely with other U.S. and foreign government partners in looking into the matter. The National Security Council referred questions about the CIA's findings and process back to the agency. The officials noted that there were no common characteristics among the unexplained cases, which complicated efforts to understand their cause. ""This has been one of the conundrums and really what has made this harder than probably any other we've looked at analytically in the agency's history, there definitely aren't patterns in the data,"" one CIA official said of the analysis done to date by the task force, which, the official said, would remain ""fully staffed, fully resourced and fully invested in its mission."" But something about the outstanding cases at least suggest that they may pave the way to more answers in the future. ""We are focused most intensely on this couple of dozen because we view those as the most likely to produce progress at this point,"" the official said. ""[I]f and as we receive additional reports from our colleagues that have concerning phenomena or symptoms, we are going to be investigating and reporting them, and we don't want to prejudge what we're going to find,"" the CIA official said.",3,7.503891073433496,1.6510778536894533,5.852813219744043,24
2022-01-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/cia-havana-syndrome-cases-not-caused-by-russia-agency-criticized-by-those-reporting/,CIA: 'Havana Syndrome' Cases Not Caused By Russia; Agency Criticized By Those Suffering Symptoms,"MIAMI (CBSMiami) – The Central Intelligence Agency is now saying that most cases of the mysterious, neurological illness known as ""Havana Syndrome"" were not caused by Russia or a foreign adversary. The intelligence agency said a majority of the 1,000 cases reported to the government can be explained by environmental causes, undiagnosed medical conditions or stress, rather than a sustained global campaign by a foreign power. U.S. officials said the CIA believes it's unlikely that Russia or another foreign adversary is using microwaves or other forms of directed energy to attack hundreds of American diplomats and intelligence officers who attribute their brain injuries and other symptoms. The findings are drawing criticism from those who have reported cases and from advocates who accuse the government of long dismissing the array of ailments. Former Senior CIA Intelligence Officer Marc Polymeropoulos said a work trip to Moscow changed his life and ended his 26-year career. ""I awoke in the middle of the night. It was an incredible case of vertigo. The room was spinning. I had terrible headaches. I felt like I was going to be nauseous. It started a long medical journey of a headache that never goes away,"" he said. His headaches and nausea were consistent with symptoms that have been referred to as 'Havana syndrome.' The first cases were reported by U.S. embassy and intelligence officials in Cuba in 2016. Scientists had suspected the cause of the symptoms were directed, radio-frequency energy. ""This is really a silent injury, a silent wound,"" Polymeropoulos said. US Lawmakers had raised concern about what's been described as an increasing pattern of suspected attacks. The Russian government was widely suspected to be involved, but the U.S. government had not officially blamed anyone for the incidents. (© Copyright 2022 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

2022-01-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-attack-short-notice-blinken/,"In Ukraine, Blinken warns Russia could attack with ""very short notice""","Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Wednesday that Russia has positioned itself to attack Ukraine on ""very short notice,"" even as he urged Moscow to pursue a ""diplomatic and peaceful path."" In remarks to U.S. embassy staff in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, Blinken said Russia's buildup of 100,000 troops had made it ""a critical time for Ukraine."" ""[W]e know that there are plans in place to increase that force even more on very short notice,"" Blinken said, ""and that gives President Putin the capacity, also on very short notice, to take further aggressive action against Ukraine."" Blinken's visit to Kyiv is the first of three stops in a last-minute diplomatic push that includes meetings with counterparts from Germany, France and Britain on Thursday and culminates in an in-person meeting in Geneva with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday. While in Kyiv, Blinken offered a measured lookahead to the meeting in Geneva. ""[W]e'll see where we are at the end of the week,"" he said, adding, ""I strongly, strongly hope that we can keep this on a diplomatic and peaceful path, but ultimately that's going to be President Putin's decision."" Blinken's engagements follow a week of mostly fruitless diplomatic talks that the Russians claimed had hit a ""dead end."" Moscow has for weeks made a set of public demands for binding security guarantees from the West that the NATO alliance will not expand eastward to include Ukraine as a member, and to reduce the troops and weaponry currently deployed in eastern and Baltic European states. The U.S. and NATO have dismissed those Russian demands as ""non-starters"" while offering to begin talks on other security issues like arms control. Following meetings with President Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Wednesday, Blinken told reporters that he would not be providing written responses on Friday to Russia's demands — an expectation Moscow has raised repeatedly. ""I won't be presenting a paper at that time to Foreign Minister Lavrov. We need to see where we are and see if there remain opportunities to pursue the diplomacy and pursue the dialogue, which again, as I said, is by far the preferable course,"" Blinken said. He also urged unity on the part of the Ukrainian government, which has been beset by domestic political turmoil even as the threat of Russian aggression mounts. ""Our strength depends on preserving our unity, and that includes unity within Ukraine,"" Blinken said. ""I think one of Moscow's longstanding goals has been to try to sow divisions between and within countries, and quite simply, we cannot and will not let them do that."" U.S. officials have issued increasingly urgent warnings about the potential for a Russian invasion in recent days. Last Friday, the Biden administration accused Moscow of prepositioning trained operatives in Ukraine who could carry out ""acts of sabotage"" against Russian proxy forces to create a pretext for invasion. Yesterday, a senior State Department official said Russia's recent movement of troops and hardware into neighboring Belarus was ""neither an exercise nor normal troop movement,"" and could open up another front in a potential invasion. At a think tank in Moscow on Wednesday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov again denied that the Kremlin had any plans to invade Ukraine. ""I am certain that there is no risk of a large-scale war which might break out in Europe or anywhere else,"" he said, Russian state media reported. ""We do not intend to take any aggressive actions. We will not attack, raid or invade Ukraine."" But he reiterated Moscow's demands on curtailing future NATO expansion. ""The priority for us is to achieve solid legally binding assurances from the United States that [Ukraine], along with the other countries we have already mentioned, will not become NATO members,"" Ryabkov said.",29,6.0771594381131155,5.065692483767874,1.0114669543452415,18
2022-01-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-russia-arrests-revil/,Russia arrests 14 alleged members of REvil ransomware gang,"Russia's domestic intelligence service announced a special operation campaign against the notorious criminal ransomware group, REvil, Friday. According to the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russian authorities raided 25 addresses, resulting in the arrest of 14 individuals and seizure of more than $1 million worth of assets: 426 million rubles, $600,000, 500,000 euros, computer equipment, crypto wallets and 20 luxury cars. The Russia-based REvil gang has waged a spate of high-profile attacks on major U.S. and international companies, including the July 4 attack on software company Kaseya and a May ransomware attack on JBS USA, the world's largest meat processing company. Earlier this year, REvil reportedly demanded $50 million from Apple ahead of its product launch after hacking one of its suppliers, Quanta Computer. Associates of the criminal ransomware group have been linked to the May shut down of Colonial Pipeline, the nation's largest oil producer. The FSB's announcement came as Ukraine scrambled to respond to a cyber attack shutting down its public-facing government websites, including the homepage for the Foreign Ministry, which temporarily displayed a message warning Ukrainians to ""be afraid and expect the worst."" Ukraine's security service said, Friday, ""there are some signs of involvement [by] hacker groups associated with the Russian secret services."" The FSB claimed those arrested Friday, had ""developed malicious software and organized the theft of funds from the bank accounts of foreign citizens and cashed them out, including by purchasing expensive goods on the Internet."" ""As a result of the joint actions of the FSB and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, the organized criminal group ceased to exist,"" the statement boasted. The White House acknowledged, Friday, that one of the hackers arrested had been involved in the Colonial Pipeline incident. ""We understand that one of the individuals who was arrested today was responsible for the attack against Colonial Pipeline last spring,"" a senior administration official briefed reporters, Friday. ""We're committed to seeing those conducting ransomware attacks against Americans brought to justice."" The FSB also handed out footage depicting agents raiding homes, tackling suspects to the floor, handcuffing individuals with blurred-out faces and sorting through stacks of Russian rubles. Suspected REvil hacker Roman Muromsky, 33, has been detained following the raids, though it's unclear if the former leader of cybercriminal gang EvilCorp appears in the handout video. Moscow's Tverskoi District Court has placed the Muromsky, a Russian national suspected of illegal trafficking of means of payment, in custody for two months. ""The court has granted the motion from the investigation to select two-month custody until March 13 as a measure of restraint for Roman Gennadyevich Muromsky,"" court spokesperson Kseniya Rozina said Friday. The court has also jailed Andrei Bessonov, Russian news agencies reported, Friday. But Russia won't extradite to the U.S. those members of the REvil hacker group who have Russian citizenship, a knowledgeable source told Interfax Friday. ""The law of the Russian Federation prohibits extradition of Russian citizens to a foreign state,"" the source said, without specifying whether all the detained hackers were Russian nationals. In their statement, the FSB said Friday's investigation came at ""the request of competent US authorities,"" who were later ""informed about the results of the operation."" The U.S.-Russia collaboration marks a bright spot in an otherwise tense moment for the two countries, following a week of failed diplomatic efforts to curb Russia's military buildup bordering on Ukraine. As Ukraine's communication intelligence service responds to the cyberattacks targeting as many as 70 of its websites, U.S. and Ukrainian officials tell CBS News that the Kremlin is actively preparing the battlefield by using information warfare. ""These arrests are another example of the significant actions taken by the United States to curb the multifaceted extortion crisis. Threat actors are reevaluating whether they should continue their criminal activities in light of the arrests and indictments,"" Charles Carmakal, SVP and CTO of Mandiant told CBS News. ""Still, the timing is strange here,"" Ken Westin, Director of Security Strategy for Cybereason cautioned, in an interview with CBS News. The Russian-led raids ""could be a smokescreen or red herring."" ""Taking down a ransomware leader is like cutting the head off a hydra,"" Westin added. ""New leaders will step in to fill the void. The relationship between ransomware gangs and Russian APT groups are well known and the true actors behind these groups will continue to operate with impunity."" On Thursday, prior to public reports of the Russian-led REvil operation, U.S. Secret Service cyber chief Jeremy Sheridan told the Washington Post that ransomware criminal actors often mature, evolve or adjust, reappearing under different facades. ""With these small groups working with illicit exchanges, there's an expression that a colleague of mine uses,"" Sheridan said. ""It's the same 200 people chasing the same 200 people. There are certainly the influx of new actors in this space. But a lot of times what we see with a new variant or a new cyberattack, it's the same developers who have just changed their technology to some degree."" Last summer, the State Department offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of key REvil group leaders. In November, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced seizure of more than $6 million in cryptocurrency after REvil leader and Russian national Yevgeniy Igorevich Polyanin, scooped up $13 million from ransomware victims. The suspected ""author"" of the REVIL ransomware, Polyanin, has been charged with 14 counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and money laundering.

2022-01-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-us-talks-unsuccessful-military-infrastructure-cuba-venezuela/,"Russia ""won't exclude"" putting military hardware in Cuba or Venezuela amid ""unsuccessful"" talks with U.S. over Ukraine","Moscow — A senior Russian diplomat wouldn't rule out the possibility of his country placing military infrastructure in Cuba or Venezuela, as the Kremlin called two recent rounds of talks with the U.S. and NATO ""unsuccessful."" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, who led negotiations with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman in Geneva this week, said Thursday that he didn't want ""to confirm anything, [but] won't exclude anything here either,"" when asked whether Russia might consider establishing a military presence in America's backyard. ""It depends on the actions of American colleagues,"" Ryabkov said Thursday in an interview with the RTVI channel, adding that Russia could also undertake unspecified ""measures"" involving its navy. It was a significant ratcheting up of the tension between the U.S. and Russia in a week that many hoped would put diplomacy front and center. The current standoff between Moscow and Washington has been casually framed as a contemporary echo of the Cold War for weeks, but Ryabkov's remarks were sure to resonate loudly in the ears of Americans either aware of or old enough to remember the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. There was no immediate reaction from Russia's allies in Havana or Caracas to Ryabkov's remarks. A few weeks ago, Moscow sent Washington a list of ""security guarantees"" demanding that NATO halt its eastward expansion and, most importantly, close the door for Ukraine to join the alliance. Following high-stakes talks in Geneva and Brussels this week, Sherman called some of Moscow's demands ""simply non-starters."" ""We will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy,"" she told reporters on Wednesday. ""We are not going to agree that NATO cannot expand any further."" Russia's military has massed about 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, stoking fears that it could be preparing for another invasion of the country as it did in 2014, when Vladimir Putin sent in his forces and annexed the Crimean Peninsula. U.S. officials have said an invasion could begin as soon as January or February and involve as many as 175,000 Russian troops. Russian officials have sent mixed signals on whether Putin indeed plans to attack Ukraine, denying any intention to do so outright, but stressing that all options remain on the table in the standoff, including military action to ""counter threats"" if the West refuses to agree to its demands. ""The jury's out on which path Vladimir Putin is going to choose,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told MSNBC on Thursday. ""Is he going to choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue to resolve some of these problems or is he going to pursue confrontation and aggression?"" Moscow has seen Ukraine as a potential security threat since elections there ushered in new leadership that severed longtime close ties with Russia and instead shifted the country's alliance to the West. Ukraine is actively seeking NATO membership. In talks with NATO on Wednesday, Russia said that if the Western security alliance wants to ""deescalate"" the situation around Ukraine, it must ""abandon all military assistance to Ukraine and stop supplying weaponry."" Earlier on Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the Russian-U.S. talks over Moscow's demanded security guarantees ""unsuccessful,"" and slammed the U.S. over new sanctions drafted in Congress targeting senior Russian officials amid the push for diplomatic détente. ""We view such documents and such statements in an extremely negative way — especially against the backdrop of continuing negotiations, which may be unsuccessful but are still talks,"" Peskov said during a daily briefing call with reporters. The proposed package of sanctions submitted by U.S. senators on Wednesday, with support from the White House, is intended to ""devastate"" the Russian economy should Moscow attack Ukraine. The measures include personal sanctions against Putin and several other top officials, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. ""Introducing sanctions against the head of the government or the head of Russia is an extreme measure which is comparable to severing relations,"" Peskov said. According to the draft, the U.S. government would also have to investigate and present a report on Putin's personal wealth and assets held by his family members, or any other people who may be holding them on his behalf. The last round of talks between Russia and the West, this time under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), was to wrap up on Thursday. As Poland begins its year-long chairmanship of that security organization, the country's Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau warned that the risk of war in Europe was ""now greater than ever before in the last 30 years."" ""For several weeks we have been faced with the prospect of a major military escalation in Eastern Europe,"" Rau said, addressing the 57-member alliance of nations. Russia's Ryabkov said that Moscow would decide on its next actions after it receives a written response to its demands, which it expected next week.",29,5.455060862043053,0.3668642117648831,5.08819665027817,18
2022-01-12,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-russia-talks-ukraine-significant-differences/,"NATO and Russia fail to resolve ""significant differences"" on Ukraine but may continue talks","The second of three diplomatic engagements scheduled this week between Western powers and Russia yielded no meaningful breakthroughs on Wednesday, but appeared to buy some time for NATO allies still wary of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine. Speaking in Brussels after a four-hour meeting of the NATO-Russia Council on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the talks between the 30 NATO members and Moscow were ""not easy,"" and that the risk for armed conflict in Europe remained ""real."" ""We had a very serious and direct exchange on the situation in and around Ukraine and the implications for European security. There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Our differences will not be easy to bridge, but it is a positive sign that all NATO allies and Russia sat down around the same table and engaged on substantive topics,"" he added. Both Stoltenberg and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who led the U.S. delegation to the talks and spoke at a separate press conference, said NATO allies proposed a number of areas where dialogue with Russia could continue, including on increasing the transparency of military exercises, reducing space and cyber threats, and addressing arms control and nonproliferation. The Russian delegation said it was ""not ready"" to commit to future talks, Stoltenberg said, but indicated a ""general willingness"" to continue diplomatic engagement. The central impasse — the issue of Ukraine's accession to NATO — was unresolved. Stoltenberg repeatedly said there would be no compromise on NATO's ""core principle"" that every nation could choose its own path. Sherman reiterated, as she did following Monday's bilateral talks in Geneva, that neither the U.S. nor NATO allies would agree that the alliance could not expand to include Ukraine or any other country that met its membership criteria. ""We were basically saying to the Russians, some of the things you put on the table are nonstarters for us,"" she said. There was also no indication that Russia would draw down its troops along the Ukrainian border, Sherman said. ""There was no commitment to deescalate,"" she said. ""Nor was there a statement that there would not be."" Russia began massing tens of thousands of troops at its border with Ukraine in the fall, and last month published a series of demands that included a guarantee from Western powers that Ukraine would never be allowed to join NATO. The Russians have called the alliance an ""instrument of confrontation."" The U.S. and NATO have for weeks dismissed that and other demands made by the Kremlin, while expressing an openness to engagement on other security issues, including arms control. ""There is plenty to work on, where we have places where we can enhance mutual security. There are some places we cannot. But there is progress that can be made,"" Sherman said. ""All of us, including Russia, have to go back to our governments to decide on next steps,"" she added. NATO's Stoltenberg also said Wednesday that the alliance proposed reopening, without preconditions, both the NATO office in Moscow and Russia's mission to NATO, both of which were shuttered in October following a dispute over what NATO called ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers."" ""We believe in dialogue. And we believe that these offices, these diplomatic personnel, they are part of the infrastructure we need to have a meaningful dialogue,"" Stoltenberg said. The third and final diplomatic session this week will take place on Thursday in Vienna, where a group of 57 nations comprising the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) — including the United States, Russia and Ukraine — will meet for wide-ranging talks.",29,0.32573167149881854,0.475268836309895,-0.14953716481107648,18
2022-01-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-united-states-talks-arms-control-nato-expansion/,U.S.-Russia talks notch minor progress on arms control but remain stuck on NATO expansion,"Top diplomats from the United States and Russia each said Monday that bilateral, ""business-like"" talks in Geneva offered some openings for future engagement on missile systems and military exercises. But the two sides remained at an impasse on the future of NATO membership, which the Russians called a ""top priority."" Speaking from Geneva, where the two delegations met to kick off a week of intensive diplomacy, deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said the U.S. had offered to meet again ""soon"" to discuss missile placement and a possible revival of the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. She also said the U.S. had signaled its openness to setting ""reciprocal limits on the size and scope of military exercises, and to improve transparency about those exercises."" Two officials from the Department of Defense, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, Eurasia Laura K. Cooper and Lieutenant General James J. Mingus, are accompanying Sherman during her meetings. Speaking from the Pentagon on Monday, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said the Department of Defense is aware of and supports discussing missile capabilities in Europe assuming that there would be reciprocity from Russia in negotiations on that point. The U.S. does not have intermediate-range missiles in Europe and has no plans to put them there, so there would likely need to be more concessions from Russia regarding missiles. Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led the Russian delegation, told reporters after the nearly eight-hour meeting that the talks were ""very professional"" and repeated that Moscow had no intention of attacking Ukraine. ""There is no reason to fear some kind of escalatory scenario,"" he said. But key issues were ""still pending,"" he said, and said Russia's demand that Ukraine and Georgia ""never, ever"" join NATO was a ""top priority"" for Moscow. ""We need ironclad, waterproof, bulletproof, legally binding guarantees. Not assurances, not safeguards, but guarantees,"" Ryabkov said. Western powers weeks ago began publicly dismissing that demand as a non-starter, which Sherman also reiterated Monday. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's ""Open Door"" policy, which has always been central to the NATO Alliance,"" Sherman said. ""We will not forego bilateral cooperation with sovereign states that wish to work with the United States. And we will not make decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, about Europe without Europe, or about NATO without NATO."" And while she acknowledged the Russians claimed to have no intention of invading Ukraine, she said whether that was true and Moscow would move to deescalate remained an open question. ""I would note that none of this was notified to anyone, and it is typical that we notify each other's exercises to each other where we can,"" she said. ""And they can prove that, in fact, they have no intention by de-escalating and returning troops to barracks."" Monday's meeting was the first of several diplomatic engagements with Russia scheduled in three cities this week, but the only time diplomats from the U.S. and Russia were expected to speak one-on-one. The talks took place in a forum called the Strategic Stability Dialogue, which was relaunched after President Biden and Putin met in Geneva in June 2021 and focuses most closely on mitigating the risk from nuclear weapons and conflict. On Tuesday, Sherman will meet with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels, Belgium, ahead of Wednesday's NATO-Russia Council meeting there. On Thursday, a group of 57 nations comprising the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) – which include Russia and Ukraine – will convene a meeting in Vienna, Austria. ""I fully expect that the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE this week, Russia will hear a consistent message from the United States and from our allies and partners – namely, that it is on Russia to de-escalate tensions so that we have a real chance at finding diplomatic solutions,"" Sherman said Monday.

2022-01-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-talks-ukraine-diplomatic-united-states-nato/,"Russia-Ukraine conflict: What you need to know about the state of diplomatic talks with the U.S., NATO","Delegations from the United States, NATO and other international partners will meet overseas this week for several rounds of high-stakes diplomatic talks with Russia, as Moscow continues its military buildup and other destabilizing activities near its border with Ukraine. Over the past several months, Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops at Ukraine's eastern border and, according to U.S. officials, mounted an aggressive influence campaign. Its actions have prompted concerns among Western and Ukrainian officials that an invasion could occur as soon as this month. The United States, the G7, NATO and the European Union have each warned of massive economic consequences to a Russian invasion. The U.S. has also said it would continue bolstering Ukraine's military defenses, and that NATO would move to reinforce its eastern flank. There are three different groups meeting on different days in Geneva, Switzerland, Brussels, Belgium and Vienna, Austria this week. Each session is expected to focus on different security issues, though there may be some overlap among them. Deputy Secretary Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov met on Sunday evening in Geneva, where the two sides discussed the topics to be addressed on Monday and in the coming days, according to a readout from the State Department. Finally, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will also meet on Monday with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba during a gathering of the NATO-Ukraine Commission in Brussels, where the U.S. will be represented by the recently confirmed U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Julie Smith. No, the presidents are not expected to participate in any of the meetings next week. Their last direct interaction was a phone call that took place at Mr. Putin's request on December 31, 2021. The issues addressed will depend on the forum. No agendas have been publicly released. The first, bilateral meeting on January 10 is expected to focus on arms control issues, from traditional nuclear weapons to nontraditional arms like hypersonic weapons, space and cyber technologies. On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there ""may be grounds"" for renewing a treaty with Russia that governs the deployment of intermediate nuclear forces in Europe. The Trump administration exited a version of that treaty in 2019, citing repeated violations by Russia. Blinken also said the U.S. was ready to address the ""scope and scale"" of military exercises in Europe, provided the Russians reciprocate. He said scaling down troop levels, however, was not being considered. On Wednesday, the NATO-Russia Council is expected to address some of the public demands Russia has made, including security guarantees from the alliance that it will not expand eastward. NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, has already said that only the alliance will determine its future membership. U.S. officials have said consistently that the U.S. was coordinating closely with its allies on the agendas for each session, and stressed the phrase, ""nothing about you, without you"" — to underscore that no security discussions will take place without European allies, including Ukraine, present. In remarks at the State Department on Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine's security would be ""front and center"" in all the talks. ""We will make the point in every single one of these fora that the aggression against Ukraine will be met with… massive consequences,"" he said. Last month, the Russians made public an eight-point draft security proposal that outlined a range of demands. They include, among others, a commitment that Ukraine will never join NATO; that military arms be withdrawn from and drills be halted in countries that joined the alliance after 1997; and a ban on deploying intermediate-range missiles and nuclear weapons from outside countries' national territories. While U.S. and NATO officials have already ruled out some of the Russian proposals, they have said some, including a discussion of arms control and increased transparency in military activities, could serve as a starting point for negotiations. First and foremost, Western powers want indications of de-escalation from Moscow, which have thus far not materialized. Blinken said on Friday that Russia had massed nearly 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border, with ""plans to mobilize twice that number on very short order."" U.S. officials have otherwise been more circumspect in detailing their asks for Moscow. Senior administration officials have said they would offer a detailed ""laydown"" of concerns at the appropriate time, but have declined to specify either what the U.S. hopes to achieve or what it rejects from Russia's public demands. A wholesale breakthrough is not impossible, but highly unlikely. Because these are complex issues being discussed in multiple venues by a variety of stakeholders, the pace of dialogue is likely to be incremental and piecemeal. Both Russian and American officials offered pessimistic outlooks over the weekend. In remarks following a meeting of foreign ministers on Friday, NATO's Stoltenberg said that the alliance had a ""dual-track"" approach to Moscow and, while it would prioritize dialogue and a political solution, would also have to be ""prepared for the possibility that diplomacy will fail."" Blinken said Sunday that the U.S. was ""committed to dialogue and diplomacy,"" but that the U.S. would deal ""very resolutely"" with Russia if it pursued conflict. It means the risk of an invasion is still real and acute. Russia has shown no signs of pulling back forces since its buildup began. U.S. defense and intelligence officials have said Russian units are positioned for a rapid, large-scale invasion. Stoltenberg emphasized on Friday that Russia's military buildup had ""not stopped."" ""We see armored units, we see artillery, we see combat-ready troops. We see electronic warfare equipment and we see a lot of different military capabilities, which are gradually building up in and around Ukraine,"" he said. ""The capabilities, the rhetoric and the track record, of course, that sends a message that there is a real risk for new armed conflict in Europe."" ""[T]o make actual progress, it's very hard to see that happening when there's an ongoing escalation, when Russia has a gun to the head of Ukraine,"" Blinken said Sunday.",29,0.4218727889679215,0.9492308285821935,-0.5273580396142721,18

The White House is pushing back against a report that said the Biden administration might be willing to consider lowering troop levels in Eastern Europe if Russia would pull back its forces from near Ukraine, Christina Ruffini reports for ""CBS Saturday Morning."" A senior State Department official told reporters on Friday, ""I want to be crystal clear that that is not accurate."" But the Putin problem remains. ""Russia's aggressive actions are a threat to peace and security in Europe,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a rare Friday news conference. He threatened massive consequences for further Russian aggression in Europe, but said diplomacy is still an option. The U.S. wants Russia to reduce its troop presence along Ukraine's eastern border, where Russian forces annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia, in turn, has made its own demands, including that no new countries be allowed to join NATO. Both the U.S. and NATO have called that a nonstarter. ""We will not compromise on core principles, including the right for every nation to decide its own path, including what kind of security arrangements it wants to be a part of,"" said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. A U.S. intelligence report estimated the nearly 100,000 Russian forces near Ukraine could be ready to invade at the start of this year. This week, Russian paratroopers landed in neighboring Kazakhstan after its president requested help controlling anti-government protests. ""I think one lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,"" said Blinken. President Biden has said U.S. forces won't be going into Ukraine, but they might be needed in NATO ally countries around Eastern Europe if Russia decides to venture past its border.",29,0.8986974533202574,6.687342244976525,-5.788644791656268,25
2022-01-05,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-rocket-angara-a5-reentry-earth/,Russian rocket part from failed launch makes uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere,"Part of a failed Russian rocket launch made an uncontrolled re-entry back to Earth on Wednesday — and officials have confirmed it landed in the Pacific Ocean. Scientists launched the third test flight of the Angara-A5 heavy-lift rocket, named after a river in Siberia, from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwestern Russia on December 27. According to state-run media, the purpose was to test a new upper-stage rocket, called the Persei booster, for the first time. The launch was initially declared a success, with officials stating that all operations took place properly. But the booster apparently suffered engine failure, preventing the launcher from reaching higher than low-Earth orbit. The part was expected to re-enter between 2027 UTC (3:37 p.m. EST) and 2121 UTC (4:21 p.m.), according to astronomer Jonathan McDowell. On Wednesday evening, the 18th Space Control Squadron confirmed the re-entry occurred at 4:08 p.m. EST over the South Pacific. No other details were provided. It's common for debris from space to burn up when reentering Earth's atmosphere, posing no harm. However, larger parts can be dangerous depending on where they land. ""To be clear, I do NOT regard this object as a significant risk,"" McDowell tweeted. ""Reentries for a object with dry mass of about 4 tonnes may see some debris reach the ground, but not much."" McDowell tweeted Wednesday afternoon that the re-entry window had passed. U.S. Space Command has not yet confirmed where the re-entry occurred. Space debris has become somewhat of a politically-charged issue, especially as the amount in low-Earth orbit has become a recurring danger to the International Space Station, delaying spacewalks and even causing damage to the exterior of the ISS. In November, the U.S. said debris from a Russian anti-satellite missile test forced the space station crew to take shelter as a precaution. Last May, NASA slammed China for ""failing to meet responsible standards"" after rocket debris used to launch that country's new space station landed in the Indian Ocean. ""Spacefaring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement at the time. ""It is critical that China and all spacefaring nations and commercial entities act responsibly and transparently in space to ensure the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of outer space activities."" The most significant re-entry breakup over a populated area was from the space shuttle Columbia disaster in February 2003. When 200,000 pounds of spacecraft broke up over Texas, a significant amount of debris hit the ground, but there were no injuries. ""There's an old saying that space is big,"" John Crassidis a professor at the University at Buffalo who specializes in space debris, told ""CBS Mornings"" last year. ""Not anymore. It's getting smaller and smaller by the day!""",3,4.822475749493534,6.036800393190347,-1.2143246436968136,3

It's the second call on the subject within a week for Mr. Biden, who spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday. Mr. Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky's call came as the U.S. and Western allies prepared for a series of diplomatic meetings to try to de-escalate a crisis that Moscow said could rupture ties with Washington. ""President Biden made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement following the call. Psaki added that Biden underscored his commitment to the principle of ""nothing about you without you,"" the tenet that it won't negotiate policy that impacts Europe without its allies' input. Biden has spoken of hitting Russia with economy-jarring sanctions if it moves on Ukraine's territory, but he said last month that U.S. military action is not on the table. The Kremlin has demanded that any further expansion of NATO exclude Ukraine and other former Soviet countries. The Russians have also demanded that the military alliance remove offensive weaponry from countries in the region. ""If the obviously aggressive line of our Western colleagues continues, we will take adequate, retaliatory military-technical measures [and] react toughly to unfriendly steps,"" Putin told senior military officials during a meeting in remarks carried by Russian state TV last week. ""I want to emphasize that we have every right to do so."" The White House has dismissed Russia's demands on NATO as a non-starter. A key principle of the NATO alliance is that membership is open to any qualifying country. And no outsider has membership veto power. While there's little prospect that Ukraine would be invited into the alliance anytime soon, the U.S. and its allies won't rule it out. Zelensky said in a Twitter posting after Sunday's call that ""keeping peace in Europe, preventing further escalation, reforms, deoligarchization were discussed."" ""We appreciate the unwavering support,"" Zelensky said. Senior U.S. and Russian officials are scheduled to meet January 9-10 in Geneva to discuss the situation. Those talks are to be followed by meetings at the NATO-Russia Council, and at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Biden spoke with Putin for nearly an hour on Thursday. He told reporters the next day that he warned Putin that his economy would pay a ""heavy price"" if Russia, which has massed some 100,000 troops near the border, made further moves against Ukraine. ""I'm not going to negotiate here in public, but we made it clear that he cannot — I emphasize cannot — move on Ukraine,"" Biden said Friday. Biden said he told Putin it was important for the Russians to take steps before those meetings toward easing the crisis. Putin's foreign affairs adviser, in describing the presidents' conversation this past week, said Biden's pursuit of sanctions ""could lead to a complete rupture of relations between our countries and Russia-West relations will be severely damaged."" U.S. intelligence findings indicate Russia has made preparations for a potential invasion in early 2022. But White House officials say it remains unclear whether Putin has already made a decision to move forward with military action. Still, Biden said he remained hopeful for the upcoming talks. White House officials say they will consult closely with Western allies. ""I always expect if you negotiate you make progress, but we'll see,"" he said Friday. ""We'll see."" Past military incursions by Putin loom large as Mr. Biden weighs his next steps. In 2014, Russian troops marched into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and seized the territory from Ukraine. Russia's annexation of Crimea was one of the darker moments for President Barack Obama on the international stage. The U.S.-Russia relationship was badly damaged near the end of President George W. Bush's administration after Russia's 2008 invasion of its neighbor Georgia after Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili ordered his troops into the breakaway region of South Ossetia. Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday he feared that Putin was intent on invading Ukraine and ""nothing other than a level of sanctions that Russia has never seen will deter him."" ""Russia needs to understand we are united in this,"" Schiff told ""Face the Nation"" on CBS. ""I also think that a powerful deterrent is the understanding that if they do invade, it is going to bring (NATO) closer to Russia, not push it farther away.",29,6.766592759002903,1.2229770359220316,5.543615723080872,25

In recent years, President Vladimir Putin has grown increasingly insistent that NATO is encroaching close to Russia's borders, and Moscow last week demanded ""legal guarantees"" that the U.S.-led alliance will halt its eastward expansion. ""How can one count on equal relations with the United States and the West in such a position?"" Gorbachev told state news agency RIA Novosti on the eve of the anniversary of his resignation as the leader of the USSR. He noted the ""triumphant mood in the West, especially in the United States"" after the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991. ""They grew arrogant and self-confident. They declared victory in the Cold War,"" Gorbachev, 90, said. He insisted that it was ""together"" that Moscow and Washington pulled the world out of confrontation and the nuclear race. ""No, the 'winners' decided to build a new empire. Hence the idea of NATO expansion,"" Gorbachev added. However, he welcomed upcoming security talks between Moscow and Washington. ""I hope there will be a result,"" he said. Last week, Moscow presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet countries. Putin said Thursday that Washington has been willing to discuss the proposals and talks could happen at the start of next year in Geneva. A senior U.S. official said Washington was ready for talks ""as soon as early January"". Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991, days after the leaders of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine said the USSR no longer existed.

The Russian leader warned that if the U.S. and NATO do not halt what Moscow considers aggressive actions along the country's border with Ukraine, Russia would respond in a ""retaliatory military"" manner. ""If the obviously aggressive line of our Western colleagues continues, we will take adequate, retaliatory military-technical measures [and] react toughly to unfriendly steps,"" Putin told senior military officials during a meeting in remarks carried by Russian state TV. ""I want to emphasize that we have every right to do so."" Putin had previously spoken of his ""red lines"" on Ukraine — first and foremost his demand that the U.S. block Ukraine's bid to become a NATO member. He had accused the West of crossing his red lines already, but the stern warning in Tuesday's speech marked the first time he had personally warned of potential military action. ""They are doing whatever they want. But what they are doing now on the territory of Ukraine, or trying and planning to do, it is not a thousand kilometers from our national border, it is at our doorstep,"" Putin said, lamenting that Russia had ""nowhere to retreat."" Speaking to CBS ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated the Biden administration's support for Ukraine and warned that the U.S. and its allies were prepared to respond to any Russian incursion with harsh sanctions. The Biden administration has not ruled anything out in the standoff, but has not thus far said explicitly what level of assistance Ukraine could expect from Washington if Putin does attack. U.S. officials say they believe Putin has not yet made up his mind about whether to do that. ""We are very clear that Russia should not invade the sovereignty of Ukraine, that we must stand up — and we are standing up — for its territorial integrity,"" Harris told Brennan. ""We are working with our allies in that regard, and we've been very clear that we are prepared to issue sanctions like you've not seen before."" The vice president declined to say whether any new sanctions would target Putin directly, but noted that the administration and U.S. allies were in ""direct conversations"" with the Kremlin, and making their concerns and their own red lines well understood. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Dr. Karen Donfried, meanwhile, told reporters in a telephone briefing from Brussels on Tuesday morning that the U.S. was prepared to engage diplomatically through ""multiple channels,"" including bilateral engagement with Russia, through NATO talks with Moscow and through other regional blocs. Donfried said bilateral engagement between the U.S. and Russia was likely to take place ""in January,"" but offered no further detail on where or between whom. U.S. intelligence agencies raised the alarm weeks ago over Russia's massing of troops near its border with Ukraine, spurring fear in Western capitals of a potential repeat of Putin's 2014 invasion, which saw him annex the Crimean Peninsula away from the smaller neighboring nation. American officials say Russia has massed about 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border, but Moscow rejects all claims that it's preparing for an attack as ""fake news."" Last week, Russia sent a formal, sweeping list of demands to the U.S., including that NATO cease its eastward expansion and reject any former Soviet country's bid for membership, including Ukraine. Many analysts said the proposals were essentially a non-starter, and the White House has made it clear that membership in the transatlantic defense alliance is for applying nations and current members to decide, not Russia. Following Putin's recent video call with President Biden, the countries appointed working teams to meet and seek a way to ease the tension. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that the relevant contacts were taking place and the U.S. had expressed ""readiness"" to engage in a dialogue with Russia. But Putin on Tuesday stressed that he would only accept ""long-term, legally binding guarantees"" from the U.S. ""You and I know well that even they, legal guarantees, cannot be trusted, because the U.S. easily withdraws from all international agreements it loses interest in for one reason or another while explaining it somehow or giving no explanations whatsoever,"" Putin said. ""Yet we need at least something, some legally binding agreements, not just verbal assurances. We know well the value of such assurances, words, and promises."" Speaking at the same meeting, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the U.S. had ""deployed some 8,000 troops"" near Russian borders and, along with NATO allies, held frequent exercises within the vicinity of Russia using strategic bomber aircraft. He also shared plans for the Russian Armed Forces to grow by nearly 15,000 regular forces and hold two largescale exercises next year.",29,1.266089152097217,1.4040025380741856,-0.13791338597696856,18
2021-12-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-troops-in-donbas-court-document-amid-concern-invasion/,"A Russian court document mentioned Russian troops ""stationed"" in eastern Ukraine. Moscow insists there are none.","Moscow — A Russian court's verdict in a bribery case last month appears to have inadvertently referenced the presence of Russian troops in the rebel-held Donbas area of Ukraine. A district court in Russia's Rostov region, on the Ukrainian border, disclosed that the manager of a company called Tekhnologiya LLC was responsible for stocking and selling food to Russian troops stationed in eastern Ukraine. The court sentenced the manager to five years in prison on charges of transferring about $13,500 from his boss to a local government official, to curry favor with authorities and avoid disruptions in the supply chain. ""These rations were intended to be sent to military units of the Russian Armed Forces stationed on the territory of the DNR and LNR,"" the court said in the verdict that was posted online, referring to the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk ""people's republics"" in eastern Ukraine. After the document started spreading on Russian media, the page was quickly taken down from the court's website. CBS News has reviewed an archived digital copy of the verdict. The document was first spotted by a Ukraine watcher who posts under the Twitter handle Necro_Mancer and reported by RFE/RL. Moscow has repeatedly denied the presence of Russian soldiers in Donbas, where rebels have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014. President Vladimir Putin's government insists Russia is not a part of the conflict. The U.S. and the European Union accuse Russia of supporting the separatists with troops, hardware and funding. The Kremlin on Thursday said the information contained in the document was ""a mistake."" ""This is probably the mistake of those who wrote this text. Because this is impossible,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. ""There have never been and there are no Russian Armed Forces present on the territory of the self-proclaimed republics."" The verdict from the court, however, included details on the complications of the seemingly clandestine logistics operation. The defendant had told the court that some drivers were paid relatively large sums of money — between $880 and $1,090 — for one delivery route due to ""the complexity and danger of the route."" The defendant said the drivers were ""risking their own lives at the border,"" had to remove their government license plates, hand over documents and proceed to unloading docks escorted by the receiving party. Food supplies to the people's republics were scheduled once every two weeks, the verdict said. One caravan consisted of more than 70 vehicles, capable of transporting 1,300 tons of cargo, including flour, canned food and fresh vegetables. One such shipment was estimated to have cost over $1 million. The conflict that broke out with Putin's unilateral annexation of Crimea away from Ukraine in 2014 has now claimed more than 13,000 lives. On Friday, the Ukrainian military said in a Facebook post that a soldier was killed in a new ""ceasefire violation by the Russian occupational forces."" The tense military standoff has escalated in recent weeks amid U.S. intelligence warnings that Russia is massing troops along its side of the Ukrainian border. Washington has been pushing its European allies to prepare a new round of tough economic sanctions against Moscow, and warning Putin against any invasion of Ukraine. U.S. officials previously told CBS News that Russia could have around 175,000 troops deployed to the border area by early next year, making an assault possible as early as January. The State Department has said, however, that the U.S. doesn't yet know whether Putin has made a decision to attack. The Kremlin has consistently denied any plans to invade Ukraine and Putin has repeatedly called NATO's eastward expansion a threat to Russia. He has demanded that his ""red lines"" when it comes to Ukraine be respected — most importantly that the U.S. shut Kyiv's door to NATO membership. U.S. President Joe Biden rebutted the accusations of NATO aggression and said it wasn't up to Moscow whether a country is admitted to the alliance. Last week, the two leaders held a two-hour video summit to discuss the crisis. They agreed to deploy representatives to working groups to start looking for ways to ease the tension. Earlier this week, Putin demanded ""immediate"" high-level talks to address Moscow's security concerns. Russian diplomats have sent the U.S. a list of proposals for mutual security guarantees, passing it to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried, who was in Moscow after holding talks in Kyiv. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Friday that Russia was no longer willing to let the current situation stand, and he called on the West to engage immediately in serious talks, without preconditions, to try to mend ties. ""We do not use the language of ultimatums with anyone, we approach our own safety and the safety of others very responsibly. The question here is not whether we have put forward an ultimatum, it is not one,"" insisted Ryabkov, adding: ""But the matter is that the seriousness of our warning should not be underestimated."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Air Force One on Friday that the U.S. had seen Russia's proposals, but that there would be ""no talks on European security without our European allies and partners.""",29,2.019909342429787,4.935410037199266,-2.915500694769479,18
2021-12-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-domestic-violence-eu-court-orders-pay-damages-survivors/,"Court orders Russia to pay damages to survivors, take action against domestic violence on ""staggering scale""","London — Europe's highest human rights court slammed Russia's lack of domestic violence legislation this week, saying the country ""had failed to establish a legal framework to combat domestic violence effectively,"" in breach of two articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court also ordered that the Russian state pay over $400,000 in compensation to four women who were brutally attacked by their partners, but ignored by the authorities when they initially sought help. The majority of the compensation was due, the court ruled, to Margarita Gracheva, whose husband threatened her repeatedly after she told him she wanted a divorce. She went to the police, but her complaints were dismissed. Her husband then dragged her into the forest and cut off both of her hands with an axe. ""When women and girls ask me what they should do, unfortunately I can only tell them, 'Run away. Look for a way out.' Because the police don't help,"" Gracheva told CBS News in an interview last year. On Thursday, she said in an Instagram post that she was happy with the EU court's verdict, and hoped it would raise attention, according to AFP. ""There are many of those who are already dead and can't tell their stories anymore,"" she said. After the attack, her husband was sentenced to 14 years in jail — in part, Gracheva believes, because of the publicity her case attracted. ""I am very scared of the moment when my husband walks out of prison, because there is no protection for me. When he cut off my hands, he said he would come to kill me. For me personally, that's terrifying. I am afraid that all this talk will end when I am dead, and then people will remember that something had to be done,"" she told CBS News last year. ""WE WON!"" Mari Davtyan, one of the lawyers representing the women, wrote on social media in response to the Tuesday ruling by the EU court. ""This is not the first time the court has paid attention to Russia's non-fulfillment of its positive obligations to protect against domestic violence, but now the Court has clearly and in detail pointed out what measures Russia MUST take, including legislation against domestic violence,"" she said. Domestic abuse was partially decriminalized in Russia in 2017 when the government decided that if a man hits his wife for the first time and she doesn't need to be hospitalized, it's an administrative rather than a criminal offense. If a report is made and evidence is provided, the abuser only faces a potential fine of between about $70 and $300 — which is paid to the authorities, not to the victim or survivor. Even when abuse becomes so bad that it could be considered a crime under Russian law, it is very difficult for victims and survivors to get help, in the form of restraining orders or other legal protections. The European Court of Human Rights said there were ""systematic problems in securing prosecutions and convictions,"" for domestic violence, which it said women in Russia are facing on a ""staggering scale."" The courts said ""the failure of the Government to pass legislation to address this problem had led to a continuing climate that was conducive to domestic violence,"" and that Russia should, ""among other things, introduce legislative and other changes without further delay."" Reacting to the court's ruling on Thursday, and the years-long campaign by activists for the laws to be strengthened on domestic violence, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was dismissive, saying Russia's leaders ""believe current legislation provides all necessary tools to combat this evil and law enforcement agencies are making efforts."" ""Of course, unfortunate and tragic incidents do occur,"" Peskov said, adding: ""I don't want to comment on the decision of the court.""",13,4.874725444578701,2.5437797073606916,2.330945737218009,19
2021-12-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zelimkhan-khangoshvili-killing-germany-vadim-krasikov-convicted-russia-ordered-killing-judge/,Russian man convicted of brazen daylight killing in Germany that judge says was ordered by Moscow,"A Russian man was convicted Wednesday of a brazen daylight killing in Germany's capital two years ago that judges said was ordered by federal authorities in Russia and was labeled as ""state terrorism"" by a Berlin court. The 2019 slaying of Zelimkhan ""Tornike"" Khangoshvili, 40, a Georgian citizen of Chechen ethnicity, sparked outrage in Germany and inflamed diplomatic tensions between Moscow and Berlin. It prompted the German government to expel two Russian diplomats followed by a reciprocal response from Russia. The Berlin regional court said in its verdict that Russian authorities provided 56-year-old Vadim Krasikov with a false identity, fake passport and the resources to carry out the hit on August 23, 2019. ""The central government of the Russian Federation was the author of this crime,"" presiding judge Olaf Arnoldi said. ""It commissioned the accused."" The Kremlin has called the allegations of Russian involvement in the Berlin killing ""absolutely groundless."" The court found Krasikov guilty of murder Wednesday and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Defense lawyers had asked the court to acquit their client, who claimed a case of mistaken identity. Judges said Krasikov bore ""particularly grave responsibility"" for the slaying, meaning he won't be entitled to the automatic parole after 15 years that is customary in Germany. German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit declined to comment immediately on the verdict. The outcome of the trial could stoke new tensions between Germany and Russia at a time when the new government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz is trying to find its foreign policy footing with Moscow. The victim's relatives, who under German law were allowed to take part in the trial as co-plaintiffs, accused Russia last week of trying to ""send a message"" to its political enemies by killing Khangoshvili. The presiding judge said that the victim had considered himself a Chechen patriot and had taken part in fighting against Russian forces in Chechnya from 2001 onward. In 2004, Khangoshvili led a group of fighters who carried out an attack on a police station in the Russian town of Basran in which civilians were also killed. ""There is no doubt that Khangoshvili bears responsibility for people's deaths,"" Arnoldi said, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's description of the victim in December 2019 as a ""terrorist and murderer."" The victim had survived an assassination attempt in Georgia before moving to Berlin in 2016, where he applied for asylum, the judge said. German authorities denied Khangoshvili's asylum request and an appeal was rejected in 2018 on the grounds that he didn't face political persecution in his home country. ""This later proved to be obviously wrong,"" said Arnoldi, adding there was no evidence that Khangoshvili was politically active in Germany or continued to pursue extremist or terrorist ideas. Judges concluded that overwhelming evidence reviewed over the course of dozens of hearings, including from 47 witnesses, left no doubt that Krasikov had carried out the killing that occurred a few hundred meters from the court. In a lengthy summary of the verdict, Arnoldi said that while Krasikov — a twice-married father of three — had no previous convictions, he had been sought by Russian authorities over the killing of a businessman in Moscow in 2013. The case was dropped in 2015. Evidence reviewed by the court, including material unearthed by the investigative news site Bellingcat, showed that Krasikov had been employed by a Russian security agency and was likely asked to carry out the hit in 2019, Arnoldi said. A month before the killing, Russian authorities issued Krasikov with a fake passport under the alias Vadim Sokolov that he used to travel to Berlin, where he shot the victim repeatedly from behind with a silencer-fitted handgun near the Kleiner Tiergarten park. Witnesses saw the suspect throw a bike, a gun and a wig in the Spree River near the scene and alerted police, who quickly arrested him before he could make off on an electric scooter parked in a doorway. The court concluded that the killing wouldn't have been possible without unidentified helpers in Berlin, that Moscow had a motive for targeting the victim, and that Russian law permits the killing of alleged terrorists, including abroad if authorized by the president. ""If a business card belonging to a member of the Russian federal government had been found at the scene of the crime, it couldn't have been more damning,"" Arnoldi said. The ruling can be appealed. A year after the killing, German-Russian relations suffered another blow when then-Chancellor Angela Merkel intervened to fly poisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny to Berlin for medical treatment. Navalny says he was poisoned by Russian agents, which Moscow denies. After returning to his home country, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. German's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has called for a tougher stance toward Russia, especially over its military buildup near Ukraine. But Scholz has called for a new ""Ostpolitik"" - or policy toward the east - of the kind that his Social Democratic predecessor as chancellor, Willy Brandt, pursued during the Cold War.",13,1.994142947327487,5.640667576403987,-3.6465246290765005,10

With tension high and still mounting between the West and both of their countries, Putin and Xi praised strengthening Russia-China ties, with the Russian leader calling them ""a true example of interstate cooperation in the 21st century."" ""A new model of cooperation has been formed between our countries, based, among other things, on the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and respect for each other's interests, and the determination to turn the common border into a belt of eternal peace and good-neighborliness,"" Putin declared in televised remarks after the virtual meeting. Xi highlighted his closeness with Putin by noting that it was the 37th direct discussion held between the two leaders since 2013. Putin also said he planned to meet Xi in person in Beijing in February and take part in the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which the U.S. and some of its allies are diplomatically boycotting. ""I would like to note that we have always supported each other on issues of international sports cooperation, including in rejecting any attempts to politicize sport and the Olympic movement,"" Putin said in reference to the U.S. decision not to send government officials to the Games. Amid soaring tension between Moscow and Washington over Russia's military buildup along the Ukrainian border, Putin has had a series of calls over the last week with European leaders to demand guarantees that NATO will not seek to expand further eastward, toward Russia's border. Putin's government has made it clear that Ukraine joining the transatlantic defense alliance would be a ""red line"" for the Kremlin. Ukraine, a U.S. and European Union ally, is actively seeking NATO membership, and the Biden administration has refused to rule it out, insisting it is a matter for Ukraine's sovereign government and NATO members to decide. U.S. officials, meanwhile, have rung alarm bells for weeks over Russia's massing of tens of thousands of troops along its border with Ukraine. The White House has been warning European allies that Moscow could even launch another invasion of Ukraine this winter. The Kremlin insists it has no nefarious intentions and the troops deployed on Russia's own soil pose no threat to Ukraine. Putin and other officials routinely accuse NATO and the West of being the aggressor, by beefing up troop presence on the Ukrainian side and in other eastern European countries. The U.S. and the EU have warned Russia that any military action against Ukraine would be met with a coordinated barrage of economic sanctions. On Tuesday, in a phone call with the Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, whose country has often served as neutral ground for contacts between Moscow and Western capitals, Putin demanded ""immediate"" security talks with NATO. ""Vladimir Putin again stressed the importance of immediately starting talks with the United States and NATO,"" the Kremlin said in a readout. ""The goal of the talks would be to draft international legal security guarantees for Russia, ruling out NATO's further movement eastward and the deployment of weapons systems threatening Russia in Ukraine and other adjacent states."" Putin reiterated the same demands in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, as the Russian military said it was monitoring a French warship in the Black Sea. Putin's meeting with Xi came a day after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned that Moscow could resort to militarily action if the ongoing discussions with European leaders fail to resolve the standoff over Ukraine and NATO. ""The lack of progress towards a political-diplomatic solution to this problem will lead to the fact that we will respond militarily,"" Ryabkov told the state-run news agency RIA Novosti.",29,3.874488636266335,1.066425558420145,2.80806307784619,18

The plans involve extensive movement of 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated 175,000 personnel, along with armor, artillery and equipment, according to an administration official. Roughly 70,000 Russian troops are currently deployed opposite Ukraine, although they lack the support units needed to launch an invasion. That support would come from reservists. According to the administration official, Russia has embarked on a sudden and rapid program to establish a ready reserve of contract reservists — something that was not seen back in the spring during a rapid Russian military buildup near Ukraine's borders. A National Security Council spokesperson said the Biden administration has been consistent in its message to Russia, which is that the United States does not seek conflict, and that diplomacy and de-escalation should be used to avert a crisis. ""We are deeply concerned by evidence that Russia is stepping up its planning for significant military action against Ukraine,"" the spokesperson told CBS News. The U.S. and other officials have been sounding the alarm in recent weeks over Russian troops massing, concerned that an offensive or an escalation of a seven-year-long conflict in the volatile eastern region of Donbas could be on the horizon. Russian officials, however, have said reports of a military buildup are baseless and in turn accused NATO of building more of a foothold in what Russia considers its own backyard. The country's top diplomat attacked the alliance this week for deploying a significant amount of military hardware near Russia's borders and said Moscow could respond to security threats from Western countries and Ukraine if necessary. ""The fact that we are being accused of conducting military exercises on our sovereign territory by the countries that are bringing troops and military equipment to our borders in huge quantities from overseas and the fact that the United States has surrounded us from all sides with their military bases is something every schoolkid knows,"" Russia's Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday. ""And yet this hysteria is constantly being whipped up,"" he said. The U.S., however, has information indicating that Russian media outlets and others have been increasing content disparaging Ukraine and NATO, partly to blame a possible Russian military escalation on Ukraine, according to the administration official. There are also indications that Russian officials have proposed emphasizing a narrative that Ukrainian leaders were installed by the West, harbor hatred for the ""Russian world"" and were acting against the Ukrainian people's interest.

2021-12-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/britain-mi6-boss-says-china-is-the-single-greatest-priority-for-mi6/,"British spy chief on why China is the ""single greatest priority"" for MI6, and what's needed to respond","London — The head of Britain's MI6 spy agency, akin to the CIA in the U.S., said in his first public speech and live interview this week that China was the ""single greatest priority"" for U.K. intelligence services. Richard Moore listed Russia, Iran, and foreign terrorism as other top security concerns. Moore is the only publicly identified member of MI6. He said he was issuing a rare public briefing on the secretive spy agency's priorities because, given rapidly developing technology around the world, ""to stay secret, we are going to have to become more open."" He said the intelligence agency would need to shift from keeping everything in-house, to working with private technology companies if it was to compete with the rapid advances of other nations. ""We are living through an era of dramatic change in the security landscape,"" Moore said. ""We face adversaries who are feeling emboldened, encounter fewer constraints and are able to draw on greater resources than in the past."" Moore told CBS News' partner network BBC News that while it was important to work with China to tackle pressing global issues like climate change and trade, ""it's also the case that China is controlled by an authoritarian regime. They don't share our values and often their interests clash with ours."" In a speech delivered to a security research group, he said ""the tectonic plates are shifting as China's power, and its willingness to assert it, grows."" China is rapidly expanding its technical capabilities, including in artificial intelligence, Moore said. If the U.K. wants to keep up, it needs to be able to compete and defend itself in digital spaces. ""The huge volumes of data now available across the globe, combined with ever increasing computer power and advances in data science, will mean the integration of artificial intelligence, AI, into almost every aspect of our daily lives. Others would speak to you about the benefits associated with these new discoveries, and they are myriad. But I am paid to look at the threat side of the ledger."" For example, China's surveillance state is targeting the minority ethnic Uighur population in the Xinxang region and has detained nearly 1 million people there, carrying out wide scale human rights violations in a repressive crackdown. ""Worryingly, these technologies of control and surveillance are increasingly being exported to other governments by China, expanding the web of authoritarian control around the planet,"" he said. In addition to ""data traps,"" China has also been increasing its international influence by setting ""debt traps,"" Moore said. In the last 10 years, China has become the largest non-commercial lender in the world, with its state-owned banks extending more credit to developing nations than the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, according to Bloomberg. ""If you take on loans and then you find it difficult to repay them, then, you know, we've seen some examples of this where the Chinese have then been able to acquire significant ports… which have the potential to become naval facilities,"" Moore told the BBC. ""We want other countries to be cleareyed about the debt traps, data exposure and vulnerability to political coercion that arise from dependency on relationships where there is no recourse to an independent judiciary or free press,"" he said in his speech. Moore also said that Beijing's increasing interest in exerting dominion over democratically governed Taiwan — by force if necessary — was a threat to global security. ""Beijing believes its own propaganda about Western frailties and underestimates Washington's resolve,"" he said. ""The risk of Chinese miscalculation through overconfidence is real."" Moore said that Russia continues to pose an ""acute threat"" to the U.K., launching cyber attacks, interfering in the democratic process in other countries, and attempting state-sponsored killings, like the 2018 poisoning of Sergei Skripal in England. He said Britain and its allies must stand up to Russia to deter such activity. ""No country in Europe or beyond should be seduced into thinking that unbalanced concessions to Russia bring better behavior,"" Moore said, noting Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its current troop buildup along the border with Ukraine, which the U.S. and NATO are treating as a threat. ""Iranian leadership has embraced an explicit doctrine of conflict with both Israel and the West,"" Moore said. ""Indeed, we deeply regret that a country with an almost unparalleled depth of history and culture, such as Iran, has been the source of instability across the region and beyond for over 40 years."" In addition to interference by backing extremist groups in countries like Syria, Iran's nuclear program is also a focus for MI6, Moore said. International negotiations on its program resumed this week in Vienna. ""There are many parallels with the challenge that Russia poses, and it is no coincidence that the two countries have made common cause in Syria,"" Moor said. ""We will continue to work to contain the threat posed by Iran, to the U.K. directly and to our allies in the region. That includes contesting Iran's development of nuclear technology, which has no conceivable civilian use."" The threat of terrorism has also changed as the world becomes more digital, with many terrorists and terrorist networks operating online. ""There is no longer such a thing as an analog intelligence operation in this digital world. Our intelligence targets have online lives. Our officers need to operate invisibly to our adversaries, and we need to be able to run our agent and technical operations in an environment in which 'made in China' surveillance technology is found around the world,"" Moore said. He said that it would become easier for those looking to carry out an attack to conceal their plans, and that sadly, some lone wolf attacks may well get through. The British spy chief also said the Taliban's victory in Afghanistan would mean an increased risk of international terrorist attacks. ""There is no doubt about the morale boost the Taliban victory in Afghanistan has given to the extremist movement globally, as well as its potential emboldening effect on countries such as Russia, China and Iran,"" he said. ""I won't soft-soap it: The threat we face will likely grow. Now we have left Afghanistan, al Qaeda and Daesh [ISIS] will seek to increase their foothold and to rebuild their ability to strike Western targets."" Moore said that to counter all these threats, MI6 would have to open itself up to working with tech experts in a way it has never done before. ""We can't match the scale and resources of the global tech industry, so we shouldn't try,"" he said. ""We are opening up our mission problems to those with talent in organizations that wouldn't normally work with national security. Unlike 'Q' in the Bond movies, we cannot do it all in-house.""",3,3.689379956397778,3.6239891343888724,0.06539082200890567,5
2021-12-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-united-states-embassy-staff-leave-2022/,Russia warns U.S.: More diplomats will have to leave next year,"Russian officials said Wednesday that a number of U.S. Embassy staff will have to leave the country before January, a new twist in an escalating diplomatic spat. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in a briefing the decision will affect diplomats who had spent more than three years in the country and would be a tit-for-tat response to the U.S. sending 55 Russian diplomats home. Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Antonov said last week that 27 Russian diplomats and their families are being expelled from the United States.""We are facing a serious staff shortage,"" he said. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said Monday ""what's happening is not an expulsion"" and that Russia had been warned of the measure. ""Just as the Russian Federation grants our diplomats with an initial three-way stay in Russia, the U.S. also informed Russia about a year ago that its diplomats would be subject to the same three-year assignments, which is not abnormal,"" spokesperson Jalina Porter said in a briefing. Porter said Russia can replace those who are departing with other staffers. Antonov had rejected the notion the Russian diplomats are leaving because their visas expired, saying that the U.S. refusal to extend them effectively amounts to an expulsion. ""We view the U.S. demand precisely as an expulsion and intend to respond accordingly,"" Zakharova said in a briefing. ""I would like to emphasize that the choice is not ours. This game was imposed on us by our American partners. We tried long and hard to reason with them."" After a series of expulsions, both diplomatic missions had to make significant cuts to their activities. In retaliation for sanctions, Moscow banned the U.S. mission from hiring locals to support the operation, which resulted in a suspension of consular services and the issuance of visas. The U.S. State Department warned that the embassy in Moscow could stop performing most of its functions in 2022. Last month, it added Russia to a short list of countries where ""the political or security situation is tenuous or uncertain enough"" to prevent the staff from processing immigrant visa applications. Russians were designated ""homeless nationals"" who have to apply for visas in third countries. The U.S. mission has about 120 people working in Russia, a fraction of the 1,200 staffers it had in 2017, while Russia has around 230 people in the United States, excluding those working in the U.N. mission in New York. The United States still has time to prevent a retaliatory expulsion of its diplomats from Russia, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Wednesday when commenting on the announcement. ""Of course, there is still time,"" he said, according to TASS. ""Our response will be symmetrical, and the same number of American personnel will leave our country based on the same principle: Those who 'overstay' their three-year term of service."" Ryabkov said Russia proposed the U.S cancel these requirements as ""it goes against the current practice and is interference in our own independent decisions.""",3,3.2671284409801844,3.119420671065228,0.14770776991495627,18

Newly appointed Ukrainian defense minister Alexey Reznikov suggested that the current buildup is ""most likely"" connected to a possible upcoming virtual meeting between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which the Kremlin said is in the works and may happen before the end of the year. On Friday, Mr. Biden told reporters he expected to talk to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ""in all probability."" Zelenskyy said during a press conference last weekend, ""I think we have been in the state of war for the past eight years. But when it comes to a full-fledged [offensive] … I think today some media have been fearmongering on that matter."" Ukraine's head of military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said more than 90,000 Russian troops are deployed in the vicinity of Ukraine, a smaller number compared to similar tensions last spring. Analysts point out there is little for the Kremlin to gain if an all-out war breaks out, which would sever already fraying ties with the international community. The escalation is largely seen as a signal that Putin strives to redraw ""red lines"" when it comes to Ukraine and reshuffle what Russia sees as an outdated European security system. ""NATO's expansion has shaped the politico-military landscape in which we live today,"" Fedor Lukyanov, chairman of Russia's Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, wrote in an op-ed. ""Maintaining such a perspective is fraught with aggravation, and parting with it requires… revision and establishment of a new system of 'red lines.'""

""First and foremost, this is about creating threats for us, that may come from this territory… if there will be missile strike systems in Ukraine, able to reach Moscow within 7-10 minutes, or five minutes if those would be hypersonic missiles, what are we supposed to do?"" Putin said, speaking at an investment forum in Moscow. ""We will have to create something similar against those who threaten us in such a way,"" Putin said.",29,3.7162305716616983,0.5939917135433268,3.1222388581183713,21

Ukraine says Moscow kept about 90,000 troops near their common border following massive war games in western Russia earlier this year. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said units of the Russian 41st army remain near Yelnya, about 260 kilometers (160 miles) north of the border. Moscow denies that it's planning any invasion and refuses to provide details about troop movements on its own territory. ""If Russia uses force against Ukraine that will have costs, that would have consequences,"" Stoltenberg said, ahead of a meeting of the 30-nation military organization's foreign ministers in Latvia November 30-December 1, where Russia's activities will be high on the agenda. He did not say what those costs would be. ""This is the second time this year that Russia has amassed a large and unusual concentration of forces in the region,"" Stoltenberg told reporters. He said it includes tanks, artillery, armored units, drones, and electronic warfare systems, as well as combat-ready troops. ""This military buildup is unprovoked and unexplained. It raises tensions and it risks miscalculations,"" Stoltenberg said. He conceded that ""there is no certainty about the intentions of Russia"" but said that ""this is a military buildup by a country that has invaded Ukraine before."" Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 after the country's Moscow-friendly president was driven from power by mass protests. Weeks later, Russia threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency that broke out in Ukraine's east. Ukraine and the West accused Russia of sending its troops and weapons to back the rebels. Moscow denied that, saying that Russians who joined the separatists were volunteers. More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting that devastated Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland known as Donbas. A 2015 peace agreement brokered by France and Germany helped end large-scale battles, but efforts to reach a political settlement have failed and sporadic skirmishes have continued along the tense line of contact. NATO would not be able to provide Ukraine with any substantial military support in time to make a difference against Russian forces, so economic measures like Western sanctions are more likely to be used to inflict a financial cost on Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday alleged that his country's intelligence service has uncovered plans for a Russia-backed coup d'etat in Ukraine next week, something which the Russian government denied. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Friday spoke with the head of the Presidential Administration in Ukraine, Andriy Yermak. The two discussed their shared concerns about ongoing Russian military activities near Ukraine's border and agreed that all sides should pursue diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions, National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said in a statement. ""Mr. Sullivan underscored the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the statement read.",29,0.9709859418614976,3.912188006715143,-2.9412020648536457,21
2021-11-26,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-mining-accident-at-least-52-dead-officials-say/,"At least 52 dead in Russian mine collapse, officials say","A devastating explosion in a Siberian coal mine Thursday left 52 miners and rescuers dead about 820 feet underground, Russian officials said. Hours after a methane gas explosion and fire filled the mine with toxic fumes, rescuers found 14 bodies but then were forced to halt the search for 38 others because of a buildup of methane and carbon monoxide gas from the fire. Another 239 people were rescued. The state Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies cited emergency officials as saying that there was no chance of finding any more survivors in the Listvyazhnaya mine, in the Kemerovo region of southwestern Siberia. The Interfax news agency cited a representative of the regional administration who also put the death toll from Thursday's accident at 52, saying they died of carbon monoxide poisoning. It was the deadliest mine accident in Russia since 2010, when two methane explosions and a fire killed 91 people at the Raspadskaya mine in the same Kemerovo region. A total of 285 people were in the Listvyazhnaya mine early Thursday when the blast sent smoke that quickly filled the mine through the ventilation system. Rescuers led to the surface 239 miners, 49 of whom were injured. Later in the day, six rescuers also died while searching for others trapped in a remote section of the mine, the news reports said. Regional officials declared three days of mourning. Russia's Deputy Prosecutor General Dmitry Demeshin told reporters that the fire most likely resulted from a methane explosion caused by a spark. The miners who survived described their shock after reaching the surface. ""Impact. Air. Dust. And then, we smelled gas and just started walking out, as many as we could,"" one of the rescued miners, Sergey Golubin, said in televised remarks. ""We didn't even realize what happened at first and took some gas in."" Another miner, Rustam Chebelkov, recalled the dramatic moment when he was rescued along with his comrades as chaos engulfed the mine. ""I was crawling and then I felt them grabbing me,"" he said. ""I reached my arms out to them, they couldn't see me, the visibility was bad. They grabbed me and pulled me out, if not for them, we'd be dead."" Explosions of methane released from coal beds during mining are rare, but they cause the most fatalities in the coal mining industry. The Interfax news agency reported that miners have oxygen supplies normally lasting for six hours that could only be stretched for a few more hours. Russia's Investigative Committee has launched a criminal probe into the fire over violations of safety regulations that led to deaths. It said the mine director and two senior managers were detained. President Vladimir Putin extended his condolences to the families of the dead and ordered the government to offer all necessary assistance to those injured. Thursday's fire wasn't the first deadly accident at the Listvyazhnaya mine. In 2004, a methane explosion left 13 miners dead. In 2007, a methane explosion at the Ulyanovskaya mine in the Kemerovo region killed 110 miners in the deadliest mine accident since Soviet times. In 2016, 36 miners were killed in a series of methane explosions in a coal mine in Russia's far north. In the wake of the incident, authorities analyzed the safety of the country's 58 coal mines and declared 20 of them, or 34%, potentially unsafe. The Listvyazhnaya mine wasn't among them at the time, according to media reports. Russia's state technology and ecology watchdog, Rostekhnadzor, inspected the mine in April and registered 139 violations, including breaching fire safety regulations.",17,5.902181013956488,6.299407203017428,-0.3972261890609401,27
2021-11-20,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-officials-warn-possible-russian-military-incursion-into-ukraine/,U.S. officials warn of possible Russian military incursion into Ukraine,"U.S. intelligence officials are warning European allies of a potential Russian military incursion into Ukraine, with the likelihood of one increasing as the weather gets colder. An incursion is weather-dependent, but could happen in a matter of weeks, barring intervention from the West, U.S. officials briefed on the matter told CBS News. Tens of thousands of Russian troops have amassed at the Ukraine border -- months after thousands of troops assembled at the border in the spring. But unlike last spring's buildup, which was regarded as a show of force, U.S. intelligence officials are warning that this one could be in preparation for an actual incursion into the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday the alliance was closely monitoring a ""large and unusual concentration of Russian forces"" near Ukraine's border. ""It is urgent that Russia shows transparency about this military build-up, de-escalates and reduces tensions,"" Stoltenberg said following a meeting with outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both American and British intelligence has been shared with European stakeholders. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley spoke with General Valery Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, on Friday. They discussed the security situation in Eastern Europe including Russia's ""concerning activity in the area,"" Joint Staff Spokesperson Col. Dave Butler said in a media release. ""The Chairman stressed the need for continued consultation amongst regional allies and partners, and reaffirmed U.S. support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" it said. The release noted Ukraine is a key NATO partner with a critical role in maintaining stability in Europe. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a joint press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that the U.S. does not ""have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook."" ""[O]ur concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014 when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory, and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" Blinken said. On Saturday, he said the U.S. has ""real concerns"" about Russia's activities at the Ukrainian border. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines met with top NATO leadership and Polish government officials while she was overseas this week. She briefed NATO ambassadors about U.S. intelligence and a possible Russian intervention in Ukraine, The New York Times reports. Haines' meetings followed a series of engagements in Moscow by a U.S. delegation led by CIA Director Bill Burns, who traveled at President Biden's request earlier this month to warn Russia against taking action in Ukraine. Some of Burns' meetings were highly charged and contentious, which was not unexpected, according to officials familiar with them. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez from New Jersey, introduced an amendment to the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act late Thursday night that would trigger possible sanctions and visa bans against top Russian officials should Russia invade Ukraine. Other targets of the sanctions would include the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a Kremlin-backed pipeline that would bypass Ukraine and deliver Russian gas directly to Europe. The sanctions could also hit major financial institutions, sovereign debt transactions and more. The amendment calls on President Biden to make a determination that the hostilities — defined as ""escalatory military or other offensive operations"" — warrant sanctions. U.S. concerns about a possible incursion into Ukraine come amid a crisis nearby, at the Poland-Belarus border. Officials have not yet determined whether there is any connection between Russia and the situation at that border, where thousands of desperate migrants funneled into Belarus from Iraq, Syria and Yemen had gathered in frigid conditions trying to get into Poland -- EU soil. On Friday, in a considerable de-escalation of tensions, Belarusian authorities cleared the camps where migrants had lived for weeks. But Polish officials said migrants had instead been shuttled elsewhere, in smaller groups, at multiple other border crossings. ""We have to prepare for the fact that this problem will continue for months. I have no doubt that that will be the case,"" Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said in a radio interview on Saturday.",29,4.261620862157575,5.410934704144121,-1.1493138419865456,21
2021-11-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cyber-security-cybersecurity-ransomware-hacking-businesses-worry-holidays/,"Businesses worried about cyberattacks during the holidays, report finds","Washington — After a year of headline-grabbing ransomware attacks, businesses say they're worried about the possibility they'll face cyber intrusions this holiday season, a time when many of their cybersecurity operations rely on skeleton staffing. Boston-based cybersecurity firm Cybereason commissioned a survey of 1,206 cybersecurity professionals at organizations that experienced a ransomware attack during a holiday or weekend within the last year. A whopping 89% of the respondents from the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, and UAE indicated that they were concerned about a repeat cyber intrusion ahead of the holiday season. However, 36% said they had no ""specific contingency plan in place to mount a response."" ""The question becomes, at what point does this concern from cyber professionals translate into an action plan?"" Cybereason CEO Lior Div told CBS News. ""Do organizations have the right tools, processes and people in place to deal with an attack specifically in the upcoming holiday season? Hackers love to hack when they know we're distracted and not ready to respond."" The study revealed that organizations in the healthcare (65%) and manufacturing (67%) sectors — two of the biggest targets for ransomware attacks — were among the industries least likely to have developed contingency plans. Cybercriminals have expanded hacking operations to repeatedly target the healthcare industry amid the coronavirus pandemic, leading to worsened health outcomes and excess deaths at hospitals. Ahead of Labor Day weekend, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a joint advisory warning of an ""increase in highly impactful ransomware attacks occurring on holidays and weekends — when offices are normally closed — in the United States,"" following a string of high-profile cyber incidents over long weekends. Days later, Howard University in Washington, D.C. was forced to cancel classes for more than a week after malicious actors held its network hostage. The July 4 holiday weekend saw one of the single largest ransomware attacks to date, when an affiliate of the ""REvil"" cyber gang targeted software company Kaseya just six weeks after the Russian-linked cyber criminals sabotaged meat processor JBS over Memorial Day weekend, extorting the company for an $11 million ransom. Colonial Pipeline paid a $4.4 million in ransom to the DarkSide group after being forced to shut down its operations during Mother's Day weekend, though the FBI later recovered $2.3 million of the ransom from the Russia-based hacking group. The new report by Cybereason revealed the human cost of such attacks, with 86% of respondents missing holidays or weekend activities with family and friends to return to work in the wake of a cyber incident. Nearly three-quarters surveyed admitted they were intoxicated while responding to a ransomware attack on the weekend or during a holiday, ""a risk factor for organizations that may not have been accounted for by incident response and business continuity plans,"" according to the report. And the vulnerability of these organizations is further exacerbated by holes in the workforce. In the United States, there are nearly 500,000 vacancies for cybersecurity jobs, according to Cyber Seek — a tech job-tracking database from the U.S. Commerce Department — and the trade group CompTIA. Ransomware payments reached over $400 million in 2020, the FBI reported. And this year, the average ransom payment is up more than 500% over 2020, amounting to $5.3 million, according to Cybereason. In June, President Biden demanded that Russian President Vladimir Putin put an end to cybercriminal operations using Russia as a safe harbor. But attacks have persisted despite ""too soon to tell"" and diplomatic efforts aimed at curtailing Russia-linked ransomware operations. ""From the beginning of this year, we've seen a massive push in cyber intrusions, specifically originating from the ransomware cartel in Russia, starting all the way from Colonial Pipeline to the JBS hack,"" Div told CBS News. ""We thought that after President Biden met with President Putin, we'd see a decrease in those types of attacks. But actually, what we see is a steady stream of these types of hacks. The ransomware cartel did not stop for even a single moment."" In early November, the country's top military cyber officer, Army General Paul Nakasone, said it was ""too soon to tell"" if the Kremlin had facilitated the international hunt for cybercriminals after the United States handed over names of wanted suspects. ""From an FBI perspective, we have not seen a decrease in ransomware attacks in the past couple of months originating from Russia,"" Bryan Vorndran, assistant director of the FBI's cyber division, told Congress on Tuesday. Tiny cybersecurity mistakes by companies or organizations can cause massive damage. A congressional investigation into three major ransomware events in 2021 noted that ""small lapses led to major breaches."" The report, released on Tuesday by the House Oversight Committee, indicated that ""Ransomware attackers took advantage of relatively minor security lapses, such as a single user account controlled by a weak password, to launch enormously costly attacks."" ""Even large organizations with seemingly robust security systems fell victim to simple initial attacks,"" the report continued, ""highlighting the need to increase security education and take other security measures prior to an attack."" In its own report, Cybereason offered companies and organizations advice aimed at reducing risk this holiday season. ""Practicing good security hygiene,"" ""lock down critical accounts for the holidays or weekend,"" and ""assure key players can be reached at any time of day,"" were among the laundry list of precautions suggested. ""Cyber defenders are heroes,"" Div added. ""We need to ensure that companies and organizations are providing them with the right tools and support to do their job right.""",3,4.46281188252098,5.214259281250232,-0.751447398729252,7
2021-11-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poland-belarus-border-crisis-lukashenko-putin-russia-europe/,"Belarus leader says he may ask Putin ""to get involved"" as Belarus-Poland migrant crisis escalates","Poland, near the border with Belarus — Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally, Belarus' long-time autocratic leader Alexander Lukashenko, are being accused of using immigration to stoke tensions in Eastern Europe. Belarus now faces new sanctions from the European Union over the worsening migrant crisis along its border with Poland. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, Polish authorities used water cannon and other means to keep thousands of increasingly frustrated migrants massed along the frontier out on Tuesday. There were chaotic scenes as a group of migrants charged the fence. One of the migrants told CBS News that Polish police responded with a volley of tear gas and rubber bullets, as well as the water cannon. Migrants were seen hurling rocks and stones at the barbed wire fence. The EU and the U.S. have accused Belarus of encouraging thousands of refugees to try to cross into Poland. D'Agata and his team tried to get to the border where, on the other side of the barbed wire, at least 2,000 migrants and refugees have camped out for days in freezing weather, hoping to find a path into Poland. But our CBS News team only made it as far as a Polish police checkpoint about two miles from the standoff. The Polish authorities don't want journalists to see what's unfolding along the heavily defended border. Desperate people have flocked to the area. Stranded and freezing, they've become pawns in an increasingly tense standoff between Russia and its Eastern European allies, and U.S. and NATO-aligned Western Europe. Poland has flatly refused to let any of the migrants in, accusing Belarus of ""weaponizing"" immigration in a bid to destabilize the European Union. Every night, some of the people gathered at the makeshift camp on the Belarusian side make a break for it, attempting to reach the woods on Polish side under the cover of night. In doing so, they risk arrest, or worse. Two brothers from Syria were recently rescued inside Poland, about 30 miles from the border, and were rushed to a hospital suffering from suspected hypothermia. D'Agata and his team saw an ambulance take them away after they were found by one of the humanitarian groups operating in the area. Aid worker Agata Kolodziej told CBS News they were barely conscious, and had they not been found, they might not have survived. ""This is something that we are seeing every day,"" Kolodziej said. ""It's going to get worse, because it's getting colder at night and in the day, and we find people in worse and worse conditions."" The U.S. and Europe accuse Lukashenko of manufacturing this migrant crisis by granting tourist visas and even organizing flights for migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere, with the promise of easy entry to the EU via the Polish border. Belarus' leader — often referred to as Europe's ""last dictator"" — is suspected of using the ""hybrid warfare"" tactic in retaliation for EU sanctions imposed after last year's disputed election in Belarus, and Lukashenko's ensuing crackdown on dissent. There's concern that new EU sanctions, if imposed on Lukashenko's regime over the current border standoff as now threatened, will only make things worse. The Belarusian strongman has made it clear that he's not about to back down, warning on Tuesday that he was ready to ask Putin for help, ""if necessary."" ""I will talk with the President of Russia and ask him to get involved and, if necessary, provide appropriate assistance, without drawing them [Russia] into this refugee crisis,"" Lukashenko said before a phone call with Putin. He accused ""these scoundrels of the collective West"" of blaming Russia for the standoff, which he insisted had nothing to do with the migration crisis on his border, ""yet."" But while his actions, purportedly designed to stoke tension within the EU, may help Lukashenko and his vital ally in Moscow, it is innocent people trying to escape desperate situations in their own countries who are paying the price. Akram, from Northern Iraq, told D'Agata that he and his travelling companion were beaten by Belarusian soldiers before making it across the border to Poland, and things didn't get much better on the other side. ""It was very hard, no water, no food,"" he told CBS News. ""We were arrested by Polish police and brought to this isolation camp."" Speaking Tuesday ahead of a meeting with EU defense ministers, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was ""deeply concerned about the way the Lukashenko regime is using vulnerable migrants as a hybrid tactic against other countries and he is putting the lives of the migrants at risk."" ""We stand in solidarity with Poland and other affected allies,"" said the NATO chief. The dispute has escalated with accusations of Russian interference. Poland has sent some 15,000 troops to help defend its border, while Russia has sent bombers to patrol Belarusian airspace as its paratroopers conduct joint exercises along the border. NATO has warned Russia against any ""further provocation,"" and suggested the dispute may be intended as a distraction from what's going on another highly contentious border: Around 100,000 Russian troops have gathered along Ukraine's frontier with Russia. Russia insists there's no threat, and that it will move its forces around as it likes on its own soil. Europe and the U.S. have voiced increasing concern, however, that Russia could be preparing for another incursion into Ukrainian territory, as it did when Putin unilaterally annexed Crimea away from Ukraine in 2014. Meanwhile, thousands of migrants remain trapped, unwilling pawns on the front line of a geopolitical battlefield where tension is rising, and temperatures are dropping by the day.",29,5.747092365595869,3.519851927018467,2.2272404385774016,21
2021-11-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/space-junk-problem-worse-russia-anti-satellite-missile-test/,Space Junk Problem Just Got Worse With Russia's Anti-Satellite Missile Test,"MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP/CNN) -- Russian officials are denying accusations that they endangered astronauts aboard the International Space Station by conducting a weapons test that created more than 1,500 pieces of space junk. U.S. officials on Monday accused Russia of destroying an old satellite with a missile in what they called a reckless and irresponsible strike that could pose a threat to space activities for years to come. The missile test created more than 1,500 pieces of trackable debris, according to US Space Command. The fragments are a hazard to the current seven-person crew on the International Space Station -- which includes two Russians -- and to other satellites that provide crucial communication services back on Earth. Russia's Defense Ministry on Tuesday confirmed carrying out a test and destroying a defunct satellite, but insisted that ""the U.S. knows for certain that the resulting fragments ... did not and will not pose a threat to orbital stations, spacecraft and space activities."" It called remarks by U.S. officials ""hypocritical."" But NATO's chief agreed that Russia's actions endangered the space station. This is not the first time Russia has carried out such tests. But Monday's incident drew Western condemnation for potentially endangering the ISS and its crew. The crew had to quickly don their spacesuits and jump into their spacecrafts in case the station was hit by some passing debris, according to Russia's space agency ROSCOSMOS. But in a message posted on Twitter, Roscosmos downplayed the danger. ""The orbit of the object, which forced the crew today to move into spacecraft according to standard procedures, has moved away from the ISS orbit,"" Roscosmos tweeted. ""The station is in the green zone."" The newly-created space junk adds to the more than 9,600 tons of debris orbiting our planet, according to the European Space Agency.

2021-11-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-space-missile-test-satellite-debris/,"Russia defends anti-satellite missile test that U.S. called ""reckless and dangerous""","Russia confirmed it successfully took down one of its own Soviet-era satellites in its first demonstration of military capability to strike space targets with a missile from Earth, and it hit back at U.S. officials who said the test posed a threat to the International Space Station crew. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said Russia had ""recklessly conducted a destructive test of a direct-ascent anti-satellite missile against one of its own satellites."" The Russian military confirmed the launch the next day, saying they fired a missile at the defunct Soviet radio surveillance system Tselina-D, also known as Cosmos 1408 in the West, which has been in orbit since 1982. ""We indeed successfully tested our promising system,"" Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Tuesday, according to Russia's TASS news agency. ""It hit the old satellite with surgical precision."" The strike created about 1,500 pieces of trackable space debris, as well as fragments that are too small to be detected by ground-based radar, increasing the collision hazard for satellites or the ISS, U.S. officials said said. The debris from the Russian test forced the current ISS crew to seek shelter in their return spacecraft as the station was passing through the cloud of debris. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson called Russia's strike an ""unconscionable action"" that could ""endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts. Their actions are both reckless and dangerous."" Russia, however, denied that. ""The United States knows for a fact that the fragments did not pose a threat due to the timing of the test and the orbit parameters and will be no threat to space stations, satellites, or space activities in the future,"" the Russian defense ministry said in a statement. ""The fragments have been added to the main catalogue of the domestic space surveillance systems, and monitoring of them began immediately,"" the ministry said. ""Monitoring will continue until the fragments are gone."" Nelson said Tuesday that he spoke with Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, and expressed ""dismay over the danger"" to the astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the space station. ""It's critical that we ensure the safety of our people and assets in space,"" Nelson tweeted. NASA officials are currently in Moscow on a visit and will seek to discuss the weapon test with Russian counterparts, state-run media reported, citing sources within Roscosmos. Roscosmos said Tuesday that the the safety of the astronauts remains its ""main priority."" Russia has been doubling down on efforts to reestablish itself in space. Moscow locked horns with other big space powers, like the U.S. and China, over setting rules for how much all sides can militarize space, and publicly said it stands against weaponization. In response to criticism of this recent test, Russian diplomats said it was ""hypocritical"" of the U.S., accusing Washington of ignoring proposals from China and Russia to map out weapons regulations in space. ""While doing so, the United States has been actively advancing this kind of arms race. They formed the Space Command in 2020 and approved a space strategy, which is aimed, in particular, at comprehensive military superiority in outer space,"" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. ""Seeking to implement this strategy, the Pentagon has been testing offensive weapons in orbit, including the deployment of orbital missile defense systems, without notifying anyone,"" he continued. This is only the fourth known anti-satellite missile strike to have taken place, with the last one carried out by India in 2019. The test created hundreds of pieces of shrapnel in orbit, to much criticism from other spacefaring nations, including the United States. The U.S. shot down a failed satellite in 2008, saying it was for safety reasons, and China carried out a strike on one of its old satellites in 2007. The Russians have tested anti-satellite weapons several times, but this is believed to be the first to actually destroy a satellite. Russia previously faced criticism from the U.S. for its 2020 launch of a ""nondestructive test of a space-based anti-satellite weapon"" done by releasing a ""projectile"" into orbit. At the time, U.S. Space Command said the test demonstrated ""further evidence of Russia's continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin's published military doctrine to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space assets at risk."" There are over 7,000 U.N.-registered satellites currently in orbit, according to the Online Index of Objects Launched into Outer Space, which is managed by the United Nations. The number is likely to increase significantly in the coming years as the private sector expands. On Tuesday, Russia also announced that it plans to launch a military satellite from Pletetsk cosmodrome on November 25, using a Soyuz-2 carrier rocket, Interfax reported.",3,2.1402768449763725,1.53419716053041,0.6060796844459624,5

""I'm outraged by this unconscionable action,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. ""With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts. ""Their actions are both reckless and dangerous, not even to speak of the threat to the Chinese space station and the taikonauts on board."" State Department spokesman Ned Price said the Russian Federation ""recklessly conducted a destructive satellite test of a direct ascent anti-satellite missile against one of its own satellites."" ""The test has so far generated over 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris and hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris that now threaten the interests of all nations."" He said the ASAT test ""will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, as well as to other human spaceflight activities."" ""Russia's dangerous and irresponsible behavior jeopardizes the long term sustainability of outer space and clearly demonstrates that Russia's claims of opposing the weaponization of space are disingenuous and hypocritical,"" Price said. He added that the United States will work with its allies and partners ""to respond to Russia's irresponsible act,"" but did not indicate what sort of response might be made. Flight controllers in Houston woke up the space station crew overnight to inform them of the possible close encounter, or ""conjunction,"" with satellite debris. ""Station on space-to-ground 2 for an early wakeup,"" mission control called. ""We were recently informed of a satellite breakup and need to have you guys start reviewing the safe haven procedure."" The crew was told to close hatches between the U.S. and Russian segments and to seal off modules extending radially from the lab's long axis, which includes the European Space Agency's Columbus module, Japan's Kibo, the U.S. Quest airlock and NASA's Tranquility module. ""Because of the nature of the satellite breakup, we expect that we would see this risk every 90 minutes,"" mission control radioed. ""And while the teams on the ground are analyzing the situation, we expect we could be staying in the config with the radial hatches closed for up to a day."" After sheltering in their respective spacecraft during the initial close approach period, the crew members were cleared to return to the station's interior and reopen hatches between the U.S. and Russian segments. The U.S. crew was allowed to briefly open side-hatches as needed between possible encounters. ""Thanks for a crazy but well-coordinated day,"" astronaut Mark Vande Hei said during an end-of-day planning conference with flight controllers in Houston. ""We really appreciate all the situational awareness you gave us. And it was certainly a great way to bond as a crew starting off in our very first work day in space!"" Vande Hei and Soyuz MS-19/65S crewmates Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov were joined last Thursday by four fresh crew members who arrived aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. ""We really appreciate you guys' patience,"" mission control replied to Vande Hei. ""It's a crazy way to start a mission, we definitely understand, and you guys were troopers through all this. We really appreciate it."" Said Vande Hei: ""We're looking forward to a calmer day tomorrow."" U.K.-based Seradata, which operates the commercial SpaceTrak satellite database, reported earlier the breakup appeared to involve Cosmos 1408, a long-retired Russian electronic eavesdropping spacecraft in polar orbit. U.S. Space Command confirmed that later in the day, saying that along with 1,500 pieces of trackable debris the test ""will likely generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris."" The initial assessment ""is that the debris will remain in orbit for years and potentially for decades, posing a significant rick to the crew on the International Space Station and other human spaceflight activities."" Army General James Dickinson, commander of U.S. Space Command, said the test demonstrated ""a deliberate disregard for the security, safety, stability and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations."" ""The debris created by Russia's (test) will continue to pose a threat to activities in outer space for years to come, putting satellites and space missions at risk, as well as forcing more collision avoidance maneuvers,"" he said. ""Space activities underpin our way of life and this kind of behavior is simply irresponsible."" U.S. radar systems constantly track objects in low-Earth orbit and compute possible close approaches between spacecraft, prioritizing piloted vehicles like the space station. Depending on how close to the lab a piece of debris is predicted to pass, the crew can be asked to take shelter in their respective spacecraft, ready to make a quick return-to-Earth in case of an impact. During Monday's encounter, Shkaplerov, Dubrov and Vande Hei sheltered in place in their Soyuz MS-19/65S spacecraft. The newly arrived Crew Dragon astronauts — Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn, Kayla Barron and Matthias Maurer — sheltered in their ""Endurance"" capsule at the forward end of the space station. The Russian ASAT test is the latest in a series of exercises to perfect weapons capable of disabling or destroying an adversary's satellites. China destroyed a defunct weather satellite in 2007 that produced a cloud of debris that continues to threaten other spacecraft, including the ISS.

2021-11-12,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-us-ukraine-war-europe-military-activities-belarus-migrants-eu/,"U.S. and Europe eye ""rather worrying"" Russian military maneuvers near Ukraine, and now in Belarus","Brussels - The European Union said Friday that it was alarmed by Russian military activities close to Ukraine's border. The bloc voiced its concern after Washington demanded an explanation from Moscow about the troop movements, and amid mounting tension between the U.S. and Europe in the west, and Russia and its small ally Belarus in the east. ""We continue to watch the situation and the information we gathered so far is rather worrying,"" EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano told journalists. He said the 27-nation bloc was monitoring the situation with partners including the United States and Britain and ""we are open to look at further steps as necessary."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday warned Russia against making another ""serious mistake"" on Ukraine, as Washington sought clarity about Russian troop movements near the border. Welcoming Ukraine's foreign minister to Washington, Blinken said the U.S. was ""concerned with reports of the unusual Russian activity near Ukraine."" ""We don't have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook,"" Blinken told a joint news conference. ""Our concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Russian movements were ""unusual in its size and scope,"" and added that it was ""not exactly clear what the Russian intentions are."" Ukraine has been ensnared in a deadly war with Moscow-backed separatists in its east since 2014 when Russia seized the Crimean peninsula. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen discussed the situation around Ukraine with U.S. President Joe Biden during a visit to Washington this week. ""The EU and the U.S. fully support the territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" von der Leyen tweeted after the meeting. ""We are fully behind them in their efforts to modernize their economy and build up resilience."" An official at U.S.-led NATO said the alliance was ""vigilant and routinely monitors Russian force movements. It's important to ensure transparency and avoid any miscalculation."" Russia downplayed the concerns as it did the last time it massed forces along Ukraine's border, with a Kremlin spokesman dismissing the reports as a ""groundless escalation of tensions."" He insisted that ""Russia poses no threat to anyone,"" and accused NATO of stoking tensions by being ""very, very active and assertive in the immediate vicinity of our borders, whether it is air, water, or whether it is land."" Europe and American concerns over Russia's military posturing along the Ukrainian border come amid another standoff between Eastern and Western powers, with innocent migrants and refugees caught in the middle. Europe and the U.S. believe Belarus' Russian-backed autocratic regime has deliberately lured thousands of desperate people from conflict zones to travel to Belarus with the hope of then crossing the country's border onto EU soil in neighboring Poland. Thousands of migrants, many from Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and other war-torn nations, have massed along the Belarusian border over the last week — along with hundreds of security forces on both sides — sleeping in makeshift camps in freezing conditions with little or no provision for their basic needs. EU sanctions against Belarus, levied over the summer in response to strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko's treatment of dissidents and pro-democracy activists, are thought to be the motivation for his regime's ""instrumentalization"" of migration, which the EU sees as a means of retribution. Speaking Friday during a visit to Paris, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said the Biden administration was ""very concerned"" about the Belarusian state's actions along the border, and ""closely paying attention to it."" ""The Lukashenko regime, I believe, is engaged in very troubling activity. It is something that I discussed with [French] President Macron, and the eyes of the world and its leaders are watching what is happening there,"" she said. Lukashenko ratcheted up the pressure, meanwhile, warning he could cut off natural gas supplies to Western Europe, which flow through his country from Russia, bringing significant funds to the Belarusian state budget. But on Friday his Russian backers made it clear the threat from Lukashenko was made without consultation, and the Kremlin said Russian gas would keep flowing to Europe as the cold winter months approached. Moscow and Belarus did, however, announce a sudden ""surprise combat readiness"" training exercise on Friday, for which Russian paratroopers were flown into the neighboring country. Belarus' defense ministry said the exercise was planned due to ""the build-up of military activity"" near its border.",29,6.309335366878537,4.630122305250697,1.6792130616278405,21
2021-11-08,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-attacks-united-states-6-million/,U.S. seizes over $6 million from ransomware attacks,"The Justice Department announced Monday that U.S. officials have seized more than $6 million in cryptocurrency and arrested two individuals they say are behind the July 4 weekend REvil ransomware attacks, in which the hacking of a Florida-based software firm Kaseya infected more than a thousand businesses worldwide. Ukrainian National Yaroslav Vasinskyi was arrested in Poland last month after crossing over the Ukrainian border and has been indicted on 11 federal counts for allegedly creating and utilizing the ransomware program colloquially known as REvil to demand hundreds of thousands of dollars from 10 American entities and companies. ""The Poles have been terrific partners. We're very grateful for their assistance,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters Monday. Russian national Yevgeniy Igorevich Polyanin is also accused of ""authoring"" the REVIL ransomware and is charged with 14 counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and money laundering. U.S. officials alleged the cybercriminal conducted 3,000 ransomware attacks in total. According to court documents, Polyanin used REvil to infiltrate more than a dozen government entities in August of 2019. ""Today, and now for the second time in 5 months, we announce the seizure of digital proceeds of ransomware deployed by a transnational criminal group,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said. ""This will not be the last time. The U.S. government will continue to aggressively pursue the entire ransomware ecosystem and increase our nation's resilience to cyber threats."" In May, the federal government recovered approximately $2.3 million dollars in cryptocurrency from Russia-based hacking group Darkside, after cybercriminals had attacked the country's largest fuel pipeline, prompting gas shortages across the southeastern U.S. Garland announced Monday that REvil ransomware alone has been deployed on approximately 175,000 computers worldwide, with at least $200 million paid in ransom. According to the two separate indictments unsealed Monday in the Northern District of Texas, Vasinskyi, Polyanin and unnamed co-conspirators designed the malicious computer program, also called Sodinokibi, with the intent of using it to hold computer systems hostage in exchange for cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Monero. Prosecutors allege the program's designers used it to ""infect victims' computers in various ways, including by deploying phishing emails to collect the recipients' credentials and to deliver malware."" Once the hackers gained sufficient access to the networks, they allegedly encrypted the files and held the then-encrypted information on the computers as ransom, demanding cryptocurrency in return for decryption keys. The indictment alleges Vasinskyi held the encrypted data of one company from Fairfield, New Jersey, for $700,000 ransom. In some instances, to prove to the attacked companies that their threats were legitimate, investigators say the hackers posted some of the information they gathered on a blog in an attempt to further threaten their victims. In all, the men are accused of using REvil to attack dozens of protected computer networks in the government, nonprofit, financial services, and information technology sectors, including the Forida-based Kaseya for which Vasinskyi is allegedly responsible. Polyanin, of Russia, remains at large. If convicted of all counts, each faces a maximum penalty of 115 and 145 years in prison, respectively. Alex Iftimie, a former national security official at the Department of Justice, tells CBS News that Monday's action has ""lifted the veil of anonymity"" that typically shields cyber criminals. The arrest of Vasinskyi could tip the scale for would-be hackers considering joining a ransomware group. ""The U.S. government has done a lot here to change the risk calculus for ransomware actors who are thinking, 'I too can have a Maserati if I engage in this kind of conduct,"" Iftmie, a partner at Morrison & Foerster, added. Along with the Kaseya attack, the FBI formerly attributed a May ransomware attack on JBS USA, to REvil. The world's largest meat processing company announced in June that it paid an $11 million ransom to REvil cybercriminals after it was forced to halt cattle-slaughtering operations at 13 of its meat processing plants. Earlier this year, REvil reportedly demanded $50 million from Apple ahead of its product launch after hacking one of its suppliers, Quanta Computer. In 2020, ransomware payments reached over $400 million, according to the FBI, a nearly 21% increase in reported ransomware cases and a 225% increase in associated losses compared to 2019. Monday's cyber crackdown represents a significant step in the Biden administration's long-term mission to counter ransomware attacks, which began to proliferate during the pandemic, culminating in a number of critical infrastructure breaches earlier this year. But while ransomware attacks continue, law enforcement's success in tracking down perpetrators has led some of the actors to cool down operations in recent months. U.S. Cyber Command, the Department of Defense's offensive arm, targeted REvil's servers last month, prompting the cybercriminals to shut down their website used to extort victims, according to The Washington Post. Last week, Romanian authorities arrested two more alleged REvil operatives, Europol announced Monday. South Korean authorities extradited a Russian man accused of participating in a different cyber criminal ring to the United States, last month. In June, President Biden pressured Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop giving safe harbor to cybercriminals in Russia, after a slew of cyber attacks. National Security Agency Director General Paul Nakasone said last week it was ""too soon to tell"" if the Kremlin has facilitated the international hunt for cybercriminals after the United States handed over names of wanted suspects. Kaseya Senior Vice President Dana Liedholm thanked the FBI for its help in pursuing the the cyber thieves responsible for July's supply chain hack. ""From day one, the FBI has, and continues to be, a great partner to us,"" Liedholm said in a statement. Wray called Monday's cyber crackdown ""yet another example highlighting why the public needs breach reporting legislation that provides the FBI real time access to information about ransomware attacks."" On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators moved to include a provision in the defense budget that would require certain critical infrastructure groups to report major cyber incidents to the government within 72 hours. The amendment, written by top Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and Senate Intelligence Committee, also requires certain infrastructure groups, nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, and businesses report ransom payments made to cybercriminals within 24 hours.",3,6.786733549047686,3.5312171457759307,3.2555164032717556,7
2021-11-02,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-director-meets-in-moscow-with-top-russian-official-amid-heightened-tensions/,CIA director meets in Moscow with top Russian official amid heightened tensions,"CIA Director William Burns met with a top Russian security official on Tuesday, a spokesperson from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow confirmed. At President Biden's request, Burns was leading a delegation of senior American officials on a two-day trip to Moscow. ""They are meeting with members of the Russian government to discuss a range of issues in the bilateral relationship,"" the spokesperson said. The interaction comes amid simmering tensions with the Kremlin, although at the same time, the Biden administration is trying to foster a more stable and predictable relationship after issuing a raft of sanctions for past offenses in April. Mr. Biden met in June with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva to discuss areas of potential cooperation, including arms control and cybersecurity, among other topics. But U.S.-Russia relations have continued to be turbulent; Kremlin-linked hackers are still launching ransomware attacks on U.S. companies, and Moscow persists in its efforts to meddle in U.S. elections. And earlier this week, satellite imagery showed Russian armored units, soldiers and artillery nearing Ukraine's border, renewing concerns about a potential military incursion. Moscow's diplomatic engagements with the West have been souring on several fronts. Last month, NATO announced it was expelling eight Russian diplomats it alleged were undeclared Russian intelligence officers and reduced Russia's delegation to the alliance, prompting Moscow to shut down NATO's outpost there. The Kremlin has also banned the American embassy from employing local Russian staff, virtually eliminating its ability to issue visas or provide other consular services, U.S. officials said last week. On Tuesday, Russia's Security Council posted a photograph of Burns meeting with its Secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, a former director of Russia's domestic intelligence service and close associate of President Vladimir Putin. ""The parties discussed Russian-American relations,"" its one-sentence caption said. The CIA declined to comment on Burns' travel, and a spokesperson for the National Security Council declined to elaborate on the agenda for the American delegation in Moscow or why Burns was tapped to lead it. Since he became CIA director, Burns has spoken publicly about health incidents known as ""Havana Syndrome"" that have befallen more than 200 American officials — including 100 intelligence officers. He has said Russia ""could be"" behind the incidents, which can cause dizziness, nausea and debilitating headaches, but he and other senior intelligence officials have stressed that agencies have not determined their cause. It was not clear whether Burns would address the health incidents while he's in Moscow — they were raised briefly by the president during his June summit with Putin, a senior administration official said. A former deputy secretary of state who, over a three-decade career in diplomacy, served as U.S. ambassador to Russia and Jordan, Burns has engaged numerous times in recent months with counterparts in fraught diplomatic and security situations. In August, he met with leading Taliban officials in Kabul as the U.S. scrambled to complete its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Before that, Burns met with then-president Ashraf Ghani at CIA headquarters, where the two discussed the embattled leader's handling of a potential political transition. At a recent appearance at Stanford University, Burns discussed making the transition from career diplomat to director of the country's leading spy agency, which, he said, had required him to present an ""oftentimes…grim intelligence landscape."" ""I'd like to think – at least I hope – that my experience as an ambassador, as a policymaker, will make me a better director of CIA,"" Burns said, ""In other words, better able to connect the work that we do at CIA to what matters most to policymakers."" ""I think part of the obligation for CIA, for an intelligence agency, is to be very mindful of the ways in which policymakers are going to have to wrestle with choices,"" he said.",3,3.373254389140463,2.970845197648286,0.40240919149217724,24
2021-10-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nra-hack-ransomware-gang-grief-russia/,Ransomware gang says it hacked the National Rifle Association,"A ransomware gang believed to operate out of Russia says it hacked the National Rifle Association, the most powerful gun-rights group in the United States. The gang, which calls itself Grief, published a handful of what appear to be the NRA files on a so-called dark web site. The files, reviewed by The Associated Press, relate to grants the NRA has awarded. Ransomware gangs often post a victim's files publicly in hopes of spurring them to pay out a ransom. The NRA did not immediately return a request for comment. But a person with direct knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity said the NRA has had problems with its email system this week — a potential sign of a ransomware attack. Ransomware attacks have spiked in recent years against all manner of companies and organizations, but rarely are the targets as politically sensitive as the NRA. The group has long enjoyed close ties to top Republican lawmakers and been a been a major supporter of Republican candidates. The NRA spent tens of millions of dollar in the past two presidential elections trying to help Donald Trump. The group has been beset by legal and financial troubles in recent years but remains a potent force politically and has more than 5 million members. Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it's highly unusual for a politically active group such as the NRA to be targeted by ransomware gangs, but he said there is no evidence the attack was politically motivated. He said ransomware gangs usually do not target organizations, but rather vulnerable technologies. ""It's not likely that this was specifically targeted at the NRA — the NRA just happened to get hit,"" he said. ""You never know, though."" Liska said the email problems could be related to the ransomware attack. He said email systems are top targets of ransomware gangs because they often contain sensitive information and hamper an organization's response to an attack, further incentivizing them to pay a ransom. Victims of ransomware attacks run the risk of repeat attacks, according to a report published by U.S. cybersecurity firm, Cybereason. The Boston-based firm found that 80% of organizations that previously paid ransom demands confirmed they were exposed to a second attack, according to a commissioned survey of 1,263 cybersecurity professionals in varying industries from the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, France, United Arab Emirates and Singapore. Spokespeople for the FBI did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Greif is believed by many cybersecurity experts to be linked to Evil Corp, a ransomware gang that was previously active. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the group in 2019, saying it had stolen more than $100 million from banks and financial institutions in 40 countries. U.S. and Russian ties have already been strained this year over a string of high-profile ransomware attacks against American targets launched by Russia-linked cyber gangs. According to research from cybersecurity firm Analyst1, Russian intelligence services worked with prominent ransomware gangs to compromise U.S. government and government-affiliated organizations. President Joe Biden has warned Russian President Vladimir Putin in an effort to get him to crack down on ransomware criminals, but several top Biden administration cybersecurity officials have said recently that they have yet to see evidence of that.",3,2.877542471105776,1.1389930232718126,1.7385494478339636,7
2021-10-25,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-russian-hackers-nobelium-cloud-services-supply-chain/,"Microsoft says Russia-backed hackers are targeting cloud services, supply chain","Microsoft says the same Russia-backed hackers responsible for the 2020 SolarWinds breach continue to attack the global technology supply chain and have been relentlessly targeting cloud service companies and others since summer. The group, which Microsoft calls Nobelium, has employed a new strategy to piggyback on the direct access that cloud service resellers have to their customers' IT systems, hoping to ""more easily impersonate an organization's trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers,"" Microsoft said. Resellers act as intermediaries between software and hardware makers and product users. ""Fortunately, we have discovered this campaign during its early stages, and we are sharing these developments to help cloud service resellers, technology providers, and their customers take timely steps to help ensure Nobelium is not more successful,"" the Seattle-based software giant said in a blog post on Sunday. ""This is the same actor behind the cyberattacks targeting SolarWinds customers in 2020 and which the U.S. government and others have identified as being part of Russia's foreign intelligence service known as the SVR,"" the company said. SVR is one of two Russian intelligence bureaus that were linked to prominent ransomware gangs in a report earlier this year by cybersecurity firm Analyst1. Russian intelligence services worked with cybercriminals to compromise U.S. government and government-affiliated organizations, the report said. The ransomware groups used a technique called ""domain fronting"" to hide their activity. They likely relied on a time-tested hacking tool called Mimikatz to infiltrate targeted systems, then distributed malware using a PowerShell Windows application, according to Analyst1. The Biden administration downplayed the impact of the Russian efforts. A U.S. government official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record noted that ""the activities described were unsophisticated password spray and phishing, run-of-the mill operations for the purpose of surveillance that we already know are attempted every day by Russia and other foreign governments."" Microsoft has been observing Nobelium's latest campaign since May and has notified more than 140 companies targeted by the group, with as many as 14 believed to have been compromised. The attacks have increased dramatically since July, Microsoft noted. The company wrote that it told 609 customers that they had been attacked 22,868 times by Nobelium between July 1 and October 19, with a success rate in the low single digits. That's more attacks than Microsoft had flagged from all nation-state actors in the previous three years. Earlier this month, Microsoft reported that Russia accounted for the majority of state-sponsored hacking it detected during the past year. Most of the attacks targeted government agencies and think tanks in the United States, followed by Ukraine, Britain and European NATO members. The U.S. government has previously blamed Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency for the SolarWinds hack, which went undetected for most of 2020, compromised several federal agencies and badly embarrassed Washington. The Russian government has denied any wrongdoing. Microsoft said the recent activity ""is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling — now or in the future — targets of interest to the Russian government.""",3,1.0503982500417108,3.609236736437607,-2.558838486395896,1
2021-10-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-spies-nato/,NATO expels eight Russians it says were spies,"NATO said Wednesday it would expel eight Russian diplomats that it alleges were operating as ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" in a sign strained relations between Moscow and Western powers continue to worsen. The alliance will also reduce from 20 to 10 the size of Moscow's diplomatic representation in NATO's Brussels headquarters, according to a spokesperson. ""We can confirm we have withdrawn the accreditation of eight members of the Russian Mission to NATO, who were undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" the spokesperson said. ""NATO's policy towards Russia remains consistent. We have strengthened our deterrence and defence in response to Russia's aggressive actions, while at the same time we remain open for a meaningful dialogue."" The spokesperson did not elaborate on what actions by Russia had triggered the measure. NATO previously expelled seven diplomats and reduced Moscow's delegation from 30 to 20 in 2018, following the poisoning in the United Kingdom of former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal. Several Western countries, including the United States, have recently expelled Russian officers for a variety of reasons, including espionage, election interference, and cyber intrusions. The Biden administration imposed a raft of sanctions on Russia this spring, citing ""reckless and adversarial actions"" by the Kremlin. Relations between NATO and Moscow have steadily deteriorated since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. The massive buildup of Russian military forces on Ukraine's border in the spring – which Moscow claimed at the time were planned exercises – further exacerbated tensions. Senior Russian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky told the Interfax news agency that Russia would retaliate with unspecified ""asymmetric"" measures. Representatives from Russia and NATO met last month during the United Nations General Assembly, where, at the start of the session, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov quipped to reporters that ""Russia does not intend to join NATO.""",29,2.4153087007641183,6.304861929813773,-3.889553229049655,18
2021-10-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-film-crew-first-movie-scenes-space-yulia-peresild/,Russian film crew blasts off to shoot first movie scenes in space,"America won the race to the moon, but Russia still proudly claims the most space ""firsts,"" including the first satellite, the first man in space, the first woman, the first spacewalk, the first multi-member crew and the first space station. Now, with commercial spaceflight blasting off in the United States, Russia began a mission to chalk up another first Tuesday, launching a Russian actress and director to the International Space Station to film scenes for a feature-length movie — ""The Challenge"" — about a medical emergency in orbit. Thirty-seven-year-old actress Julia Peresild and director Klim Shipenko lifted off aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with veteran cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov. With Shkaplerov at the controls, flanked on the left by Shipenko and on the right by Peresild, the Soyuz MS-19/65S spacecraft atop a Soyuz 2.1a rocket launched right on time from Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan just before 5 a.m. EDT. In so doing, the Russian space agency Roscosmos sought to upstage any western actors who might be considering a shoot in space. NASA and its partners are not currently planning any such mission, officials say, despite unsubstantiated media reports claiming Tom Cruise is considering such a project. But non-government space missions are now a reality thanks to SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and available-for-hire Crew Dragon capsules, along with commercially developed sub-orbital spacecraft owned by Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos. Both billionaires flew to space this summer and both are on the verge of full-scale commercial operations. William Shatner, who became a cultural icon playing Star Trek's intrepid Captain Kirk, plans to blast off aboard a Bezos-owned New Shepard rocket Oct. 12 for a sub-orbital up-and-down trip to the edge of space. A SpaceX Crew Dragon carried four private citizens on a more ambitious flight to orbit last month and a second commercial flight, this one sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space, will carry four private citizens to the space station early next year. As for the Russian movie mission, Peresild said in an earlier, translated Instagram post that the crew was ready. ""Even though we are, of course, nervous,"" she said. ""And that's why we support each other all the time. No one had this experience yet. It's always difficult and scary to be pioneers, but it's very interesting!"" If all goes well, Shkaplerov will monitor an automated two-orbit rendezvous with the International Space Station, docking at the Russian Rassvet module at 8:12 a.m., about three hours after launch. Standing by to welcome them aboard will be French station commander Thomas Pesquet and his three SpaceX Crew Dragon crewmates — Shane Kimbrough, Megan McArthur and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide — along with Oleg Novitskiy, Pyotr Dubrov and NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who rode to orbit last April aboard the Soyuz MS-18/64S spacecraft. Peresild and Shipenko plan to spend 12 days aboard the space station, filming in the Russian segment of the lab before returning to Earth in the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft with Novitskiy, who will be wrapping up a 190-day mission. Shkaplerov will remain aboard the station and return to Earth next March or April aboard the MS-29 spacecraft with Dubrov and Vande Hei, who will have logged around 330 days — almost a full year in orbit — since launch last April 9. In ""The Challenge,"" Peresild will play a Russian doctor sent to the station to treat a critically ill cosmonaut. Shkaplerov, Novitskiy and Dubrov will assist and presumably play small roles in the drama. Shipenko will be responsible for lighting, makeup and camera operation. The movie is a joint project between Roscosmos, the state-owned Channel One Russia and the Yellow, Black and White film studio. In remarks provided by Channel One, Shipenko was asked about Tom Cruise. The director said talk of a flight by the American actor prompted the Russian team to ""speed up the production, the preparation process."" Shipenko said Cruise would have made a great addition to ""The Challenge"" cast. ""He would've made a great American astronaut helping our heroine meet the challenge,"" said Shipenko. ""It would've been great. This type of creative collaboration would've been akin to the Apollo-Soyuz docking. Too bad that Tom Cruise isn't going to space right now, that we won't meet him there."" While Shipenko and Peresild presumably will be welcome to visit the American segment of the station in their spare time, filming will take place mostly in the Russian segment, made of the Poisk and Rassvet docking modules, the Zarya and aft Zvezda modules and the newly arrived Nauka multi-purpose laboratory module. ""This job would've been enormous even on Earth,"" Peresild said. ""We'll have ten days. But it won't be like ten regular 12-hour shooting days, rather like two to three hours a day, when the cosmonauts will be able to work with us. The rest of time Klim and I will be shooting with only me in the frame. ""Our only task out there is shooting the film without interfering with the crew."" Peresild and Shipenko were assigned to the Soyuz MS-19/65S crew in May, selected from a list of candidates after an ""open competition"" at the end of 2020, Roscosmos said. The two were selected ""based on the results of medical and creative selection."" Training for the Soyuz flight began in June. ""We have received safety training,"" Peresild said. ""We have also received emergency training. Our duties will be simple: we mustn't break anything. We mustn't prevent the crew from following the schedule or distract the ISS crew members' attention, either."" Shipenko was assigned the left seat in the Soyuz capsule, a position normally held by a professional cosmonaut or astronaut extensively trained to assist the commander and able to take over in an emergency. Peresild was assigned the right seat, which requires less hands-on training in critical systems. Neither Peresild nor Shipenko had any aerospace experience prior to their selection, and not everyone in the Russian space establishment was on board with the assignments. Sergei Krikalev, one of Russia's most respected cosmonauts, a Hero of the Russian Federation, a six-flight veteran and then director of the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, reportedly protested the mission, apparently because civilian passengers force highly trained professional cosmonauts to wait longer for a flight. He was not alone in his concern. ""A cosmonaut prepares for flight for many years and when the left or right seat of a Soyuz is given to a passenger, this pushes back the timing of an expedition into orbit for someone,"" retired cosmonaut Sergei Zhukov was quoted by The Times of London. The Russians plan another commercial flight before the end of the year, launching Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, his assistant Yozo Hirano and cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin for another 12-day visit brokered by the company Space Adventures. All three plan to return to Earth aboard their Soyuz MS-20/66S spacecraft on December 20. That flight will be followed by yet another commercial SpaceX Crew Dragon flight in February, a mission mounted by Axiom that will carry retired astronaut Mike Lopez-Alegria and three wealthy crewmates to the outpost for a 10-day stay. NASA is making room in the space station schedule for up to two commercial flights per year by SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's not-yet-operational Starliner capsule.",3,5.309221632524904,6.414163590850844,-1.1049419583259397,3

In July, President Biden said he told President Putin in a phone conversation that the U.S. expected Putin to take action to disrupt Russia-based ransomware groups. ""I made it very clear to him that the United States expects that when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it is not sponsored by the state, we expect him to act if we give him enough information to act on who that is,"" Mr. Biden said at the time. The phone call followed an in-person summit between the two presidents during which Mr. Biden warned of ""consequences"" for cyberattacks originating in Russia. The Russia-linked REvil gang, best known for extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS in May, fell quiet for several weeks following the presidential summit, but reemerged publicly late last week. It, along with a different criminal group known as DarkSide — which attacked fuel transporter Colonial Pipeline in May — has demanded multi-million dollar payments from victim companies in the past year. National Cyber Director Chris Inglis said at an event hosted by the Reagan Institute last week that attacks were unlikely to stop, absent intervention by Moscow. ""What I think will make the difference is whether Vladimir Putin and others who have the ability to enforce the law, international law…will ensure that they don't come back,"" Inglis said. General Paul Nakasone, Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, said Tuesday that ""options,"" which could include offensive operations, would be prepared for Mr. Biden to review. ""[A]s the president determines a way forward, we will provide a number of different options that are available, and that's across all of our agencies, and certainly U.S. Cyber Command,"" Nakasone said.",3,5.099846192574984,5.268756804651797,-0.16891061207681357,25
2021-09-09,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/space-station-smoke-burning-russian-zvezda/,Crew smells smoke and burning In Russian part of International Space Station,"A smoke alarm sounded Thursday in Russia's segment of the International Space Station (ISS) and astronauts smelled ""burning"" on board, Russia's space agency and NASA said. The incident, which the Russian space agency Roscosmos said happened at 1:55 a.m. GMT (9:55 p.m. EDT Wednesday) ahead of a scheduled spacewalk, is the latest in a string of problems to spur safety concerns over conditions on the Russian segment. ""A smoke detector was triggered in the Zvezda service module of the Russian segment of the International Space Station during automatic battery charging, and an alarm went off,"" Roscosmos said in a statement. French astronaut Thomas Pesquet said ""the smell of burning plastic or electronic equipment"" wafted to the US segment of the station, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported, citing a NASA broadcast. The Russian crew turned on a filter and, after the air was cleaned up, the astronauts went back to sleep, Roscosmos said. The space agency said the planned spacewalk would go ahead as scheduled. Russia's Oleg Novitsky and Pyotr Dubrov were scheduled to leave the station to continue work on the Nauka science module that docked in July. ""All systems are operating normally,"" Roscosmos said. The Russian segment of the ISS has experienced several problems recently and a space official warned last month that out-of-date software could lead to ""irreparable failures"". The Zvezda service module, part of the Russian segment, has experienced several air leaks, including earlier this year and in 2019. Citing concerns stemming from aging hardware, Russia has previously indicated that it plans to leave the ISS after 2025 and launch its own orbital station. In July, the entire ISS tilted out of orbit after the thrusters of the Nauka module reignited several hours after docking.",3,5.647815135159458,2.396663855733967,3.2511512794254913,3
2021-07-21,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-launch-international-space-station-lab-module/,Russia launches long-delayed lab module to space station,"A heavy-lift Proton rocket roared to life and blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan Wednesday, sending a long-delayed 44,000-pound laboratory module into orbit for an eight-day flight to the International Space Station. The towering Proton, the most powerful rocket in the Russian inventory, took off at 10:58 a.m. EDT (7:58 p.m. local time), quickly climbing away from the sprawling cosmodrome atop a long jet of flaming exhaust. Nine minutes and 40 seconds later, the unpiloted Nauka module, also known as the multi-purpose laboratory module, or MLM, separated from the Proton's upper stage, deployed its solar arrays and set off after the space station. The trip will take eight days, giving engineers and flight controllers time to check out and test the new module in space and to clear a docking port on the space station to make way for the lab's arrival. Russian flight controllers must first detach the two-decades-old Pirs docking and airlock compartment currently connected to a port on the Earth-facing side of the station's aft Zvezda module. The Progress MS-16/77P cargo ship, launched to the station in February, is now docked to Pirs. On Friday, at 9:15 a.m., the Progress will back away, pulling the Pirs module away with it. Three hours later, the cargo ship's thrusters will fire to drop both spacecraft into the atmosphere where they will both burn up. The maneuver is timed to ensure any debris that survives the heat of re-entry will fall harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean. Following the removal of Pirs, NASA's Canadian-built robot arm will carry out a detailed photo inspection of the vacated Zvezda docking port to make sure no debris is present that might prevent an airtight seal with Nauka arrives. Assuming no problems are found with Nauka or the docking port, the lab module will complete its rendezvous with the space station next Thursday, moving in for docking at Zvezda's Earth-facing port at 8:25 a.m. on July 29. It will take up to 11 Russian spacewalks over about seven months to electrically connect and outfit the new lab module, providing a new airlock, research space, living quarters, a European Space Agency robot arm and other systems. Nauka's docking will come the day before a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket launches a Boeing CST-100 Starliner crew capsule to the station in an unpiloted test flight. The Starliner, like SpaceX's already operational Crew Dragon spacecraft, is designed to ferry U.S. and partner-agency astronauts to and from the space station on a commercial basis. An initial Starliner test flight in December 2019 had major software problems, prompting Boeing to launch a second unpiloted test flight before the ship's first planned launch with a crew on board late this year. For the test flight, the Starliner will dock at the front end of the station's forward Harmony module. To make way for the Boeing capsule, four station astronauts — Shane Kimbrough, Megan McArthur, Thomas Pesquet and Akihiko Hoshide — boarded their Crew Dragon early Wednesday, undocked from the forward port, looped up above the station and re-docked at Harmony's space-facing port. If all goes well, the Starliner capsule will blast off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station atop its Atlas 5 rocket at 2:53 p.m. July 30 and dock at Harmony's vacated forward port at 3:06 p.m. the next day. The spacecraft will remain attached until Auguar 5 when it will undock, drop out of orbit and descend to a parachute-assisted touchdown at White Sands, New Mexico. While the Starliner flight keeps U.S. flight controllers busy, the Russians will be focused on the newly arrived Nauka module. The module is similar to the Russian-built NASA-financed Zarya module, or FGB, that connects Zvezda to the U.S. segment of the station. The FGB-2 originally was intended as a backup for Zvezda but construction was stopped in the 1990s. Roscosmos then decided to convert the unfinished module into the MLM configuration in the early 2000s, but launch was repeatedly delayed by a variety of technical issues. Once attached and outfitted, the MLM/Nauka module will provide a crew airlock, an experiment airlock, research facilities, another oxygen generator, a new toilet, expanded living quarters and the European robotic arm, or ERA. The module is equipped with its own solar arrays, thrusters and an independent guidance and navigation system to help orient the station as needed. During its initial outfitting, Russian cosmonauts will plug the module into NASA-supplied power during the first in a series of spacewalks. Electrical and data lines will be connected, docking systems hooked up, installation of a heat-rejecting radiator, airlock and robot arm preps and installation of debris shields.",3,0.783325587985541,7.593252073394859,-6.809926485409318,3
2021-07-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-white-house-cybersecurity-task-force-calls-for-retaliation-russia/,White House launches ransomware task force amid calls for retaliation against Russia,"Washington — Following a slew of high-profile ransomware attacks, the Biden administration has formed a multi-agency government task force aimed at curtailing malicious, state-sponsored cyber activity and hardening the nation's cybersecurity defenses, as more and more of American critical infrastructure migrates online. The weekly, cross-agency summits held by the task force have kickstarted a series of initiatives aimed at building up digital resilience among small businesses, preventing anonymized cryptocurrency platforms from being used for ransom payments and offering up to nine figures in cash rewards for information leading to the arrests of state-linked ransomware actors. Lawmakers and private industry leaders have piled pressure on President Joe Biden as the White House contemplates more forceful retaliation in response to what U.S. officials consider Russian President Vladimir Putin's failure to curb ransomware operators. The cyberattacks that led to the days-long fuel shortage on the East Coast, halted one of America's largest beef suppliers and hamstrung thousands of businesses over the July 4th weekend have fueled calls for tougher action. ""We're looking for an enduring impact on the ransomware that's plaguing companies around the world, governments around the world,"" a senior administration official told reporters on Wednesday. ""No one thing will achieve that."" The kitchen-sink approach to cybercrime harnesses the collective authorities and skillsets of the Departments of Justice (DOJ), Homeland Security (DHS), State and Treasury, among other agencies. DHS' cyber arm, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), will unveil a new website, stopransomware.gov, as a one-stop-shopping hub for small businesses looking for tips to boost their security and resiliency to attacks. Government agencies led by the Department of Justice will work to halt ransom payments made through anonymized cryptocurrency platforms. ""The exploitation of virtual currency to launder ransomware proceeds is, without question, facilitating ransomware,"" a senior administration official told reporters. ""There's inadequate international regulation of virtual currency activity, which is a key factor in how cybercriminals are able to launder their funds, demand ransomware payments, and fuel sophisticated cybercrime as a service business model."" But experts say that halting illicit transactions with virtual money, and tackling ransomware more broadly, will require intense international cooperation. Political leaders at the latest G7 Summit in the U.K. addressed ransomware at length. They called on all nations to ""urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders."" But many of America's European allies continue to rely on Russian energy supplies, which may dampen calls for harsher retaliation. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or ""FINCEN"" plans to host a virtual conference on ransomware with ""institutions, technology firms, third party service providers and federal government agencies to discuss ongoing concerns regarding ransomware,"" according to a senior administration official. The State Department plans to commission a ""Rewards for Justice"" program, paying up to $10 million in cash in exchange for tips leading to the arrests of state-linked ransomware actors. Only days after the president and lawmakers called on Russia to sanction ransomware groups targeting Americans, the ""REvil"" cybercriminal gang, which carried out this month's attack on American software company Kaseya, disappeared off the dark web. Both the group's blog site and ransom negotiation portal shut down, CBS News confirmed. It remains unclear whether the U.S. or Russia disrupted REvil's online infrastructure, or if the criminals simply decided to pull back as other groups have done when they come under the scrutiny of U.S. intelligence and cybersecurity agencies. Asked whether the U.S. government had done anything to take down REvil's websites or pressured Russia to do so, a senior administration official would only say that White House officials had ""noted the disruption of the REvil infrastructure and have no further comments on that at this time."" President Biden and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan have indicated that the U.S. government is still searching for signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin took last month's diplomatic summit in Geneva to heart. ""We're looking for meaningful, meaningful progress on ransomware, particularly that's disruptive to critical infrastructure,"" the senior administration official said. ""So we're watching closely, and we are looking for the Russians to make progress."" During a news conference on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied any direct knowledge or involvement in REvil's abrupt disappearance, saying he didn't ""know which group has disappeared from where."" Anne Neuberger, U.S. deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, briefed senators on the administration's plan during a 35-minute phone call on Wednesday. That call was followed later in the evening by a briefing for all House members. While Neuberger dominated much of the call, one Senate aide said the Biden administration had gained two more notable cyber leaders: Chris Inglis was sworn in as the first-ever national cyber director last month, overseeing the national cyber strategy from the White House and, on Tuesday, following a drawn-out confirmation process, Jen Easterly began work as director of CISA, installing its first Senate-confirmed leader in more than eight months. In their discussions with congressional leaders, the officials requested new authorities to establish mandatory cyber standards for operators of critical infrastructure, according to Senate aides. In May, following the Colonial Pipeline hack, DHS mandated cybersecurity regulations for the nation's leading pipeline companies,. But a majority of the nation's critical infrastructure sectors — including dams, public health and agriculture — still do not impose mandatory cyber standards. Lawmaker efforts to institute mandatory cyber requirements dictated by Congress failed nearly a decade ago in the face of strong industry dissent. The federal government's ransomware task force rollout comes as Congress considers bolstering cybersecurity funding, and debates legislation that would obligate critical infrastructure companies to report hacks directly to the federal agencies.",3,7.864438164386876,0.7253580145937115,7.139080149793164,7
2021-07-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-attack-revil-hackers-demand-70-million/,REvil hackers demand $70 million to end biggest ransomware attack on record,"Cybersecurity teams are working feverishly to stem the impact of the single biggest global ransomware attack on record, with some details emerging about how the Russia-linked gang behind it breached the company whose software was the conduit. An affiliate of the notorious REvil gang, best known for extorting $11 million from the meat-processor JBS after a Memorial Day attack, infected thousands of victims in at least 17 countries on Friday, largely through firms that remotely manage IT infrastructure for multiple customers, cybersecurity researchers said. REvil was demanding ransoms of up to $5 million, the researchers said. But late Sunday it offered in a posting on its dark web site a universal decryptor software key that would unscramble all affected machines in exchange for $70 million in cryptocurrency. Earlier, the FBI said in a statement that while it was investigating the attack its scale ""may make it so that we are unable to respond to each victim individually."" Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger later issued a statement saying President Joe Biden had ""directed the full resources of the government to investigate this incident"" and urged all who believed they were compromised to alert the FBI. Mr. Biden suggested Saturday the U.S. would respond if it was determined that the Kremlin is at all involved. Less than a month ago, he pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop giving safe haven to REvil and other ransomware gangs whose unrelenting extortionary attacks the U.S. deems a national security threat. On Monday, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was asked if Russia was aware of the attack or had looked into it. He said no, but suggested it could be discussed by the U.S. and Russia in consultations on cybersecurity issues for which no timeline has been specified. A broad array of businesses and public agencies were hit by the latest attack, apparently on all continents, including in financial services, travel and leisure and the public sector, though few large companies, the cybersecurity firm Sophos reported. Ransomware criminals infiltrate networks and sow malware that cripples them by scrambling all their data. Victims get a decoder key when they pay up. The Swedish grocery chain Coop said most of its 800 stores would be closed for a second day Sunday because their cash register software supplier was crippled. A Swedish pharmacy chain, gas station chain, the state railway and public broadcaster SVT were also hit. In Germany, an unnamed IT services company told authorities several thousand of its customers were compromised, the news agency dpa reported. Also among reported victims were two big Dutch IT services companies, VelzArt and Hoppenbrouwer Techniek. Most ransomware victims don't publicly report attacks or disclose if they've paid ransoms. CEO Fred Voccola of the breached software company, Kaseya, estimated the victim number in the low thousands, mostly small businesses like ""dental practices, architecture firms, plastic surgery centers, libraries, things like that."" The company said Monday in a notice posted on its website that it ""has unfortunately been the victim of a sophisticated cyberattack."" Voccola said in an interview that only 50 to 60 of the company's 37,000 customers were compromised. But 70% were managed service providers who use the company's hacked VSA software to manage multiple customers. It automates the installation of software and security updates and manages backups and other vital tasks. Experts say it was no coincidence that REvil launched the attack at the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend, knowing U.S. offices would be lightly staffed. Many victims may not learn of it until they are back at work on Monday. Most end users of managed service providers ""have no idea"" whose software keep their networks humming, said Voccola, Kaseya said it sent a detection tool to nearly 900 customers on Saturday night. ""We have been advised by our outside experts that customers who experienced ransomware and receive communication from the attackers should not click on any links — they may be weaponized,"" the company warned. The REvil offer to offer blanket decryption for all victims of the Kaseya attack in exchange for $70 million suggested its inability to cope with the sheer quantity of infected networks, said Allan Liska, an analyst with the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. Although analysts reported seeing demands of $5 million and $500,000 for bigger targets, it was apparently demanding $45,000 for most. ""This attack is a lot bigger than they expected and it is getting a lot of attention. It is in REvil's interest to end it quickly,"" said Liska. ""This is a nightmare to manage."" Analyst Brett Callow, of Emsisoft, said he suspects REvil is hoping insurers might crunch the numbers and determine the $70 million will be cheaper for them than extended downtime. Kevin Reed of Acronis said the offer of a universal decryptor could be a PR stunt because no human involvement would be needed to pay a $45,000 base ransom demand apparently sent to the vast majority of targets. Analysts reported seeing demands of $5 million and $500,000 for bigger targets, which would require negotiation. Sophisticated ransomware gangs on REvil's level usually examine a victim's financial records — and insurance policies if they can find them — from files they steal before activating the ransomware. The criminals then threaten to dump the stolen data online unless paid. In this attack, that appears not to have happened. Dutch researchers said they alerted Miami-based Kaseya to the breach and said the criminals used a ""zero day,"" the industry term for a previous unknown security hole in software. Voccola wouldn't confirm that or offer details of the breach - except to say that it wasn't phishing. ""The level of sophistication here was extraordinary,"" he said. When the cybersecurity firm Mandiant finishes its investigation, Voccola said he is confident it will show that the criminals didn't just violate Kaseya code in breaking into his network but also exploited vulnerabilities in third-party software. It wasn't the first ransomware attack to leverage managed services providers. In 2019, criminals hobbled the networks of 22 Texas municipalities through one. That same year, 400 U.S. dental practices were crippled in a separate attack. One of the Dutch vulnerability researchers, Victor Gevers, said his team is worried about products like Kaseya's VSA because of the total control of vast computing resources they can offer. ""More and more of the products that are used to keep networks safe and secure are showing structural weaknesses,"" he wrote in a blog Sunday. The cybersecurity firm ESET identified victims in least 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Mexico, Indonesia, New Zealand and Kenya. Kaseya says the attack only affected ""on-premise"" customers, organizations running their own data centers, as opposed to its cloud-based services that run software for customers. It also shut down those servers as a precaution, however. Kaseya, which called on customers Friday to shut down their VSA servers immediately, said Sunday it hoped to have a patch in the next few days. Active since April 2019, REvil provides ransomware-as-a-service, meaning it develops the network-paralyzing software and leases it to so-called affiliates who infect targets and earn the lion's share of ransoms. U.S. officials say the most potent ransomware gangs are based in Russia and allied states and operate with Kremlin tolerance and sometimes collude with Russian security services. Businesses around the world are attacked using ransomware roughly every 11 seconds, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The security firm projects that global ransomware losses this year will reach $20 billion. Cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch, of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank, said that while he doesn't believe the Kaseya attack is Kremlin-directed, it shows that Putin ""has not yet moved"" on shutting down cybercriminals.

2021-07-04,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/solarwinds-60-minutes-2021-07-04/,How U.S. cyber policy changed after SolarWinds,"In March of last year, thousands of companies and U.S. government agencies were sent a routine software update. This happened regularly with SolarWinds Orion software. There was no reason to suspect anything was wrong with the update. What they couldn't see at the time was a malicious piece of code buried deep within the update, a Trojan horse planted by Russian military hackers looking for a backdoor to important American computer networks. Nine months after that compromised software update, cybersecurity firm FireEye sounded the alarm. They had been hacked. Their crown jewels, what the company calls ""Red Team tools,"" had been stolen. FireEye suspected that anyone who had downloaded and installed the SolarWinds Orion update had been hacked too. The U.S. Treasury Department, Department of Justice, State Department, Energy Department, and the agency that protects and transports the U.S. nuclear arsenal, didn't see the Russians rummaging through their computer networks for nine months. Businesses, including software titan Microsoft, also found their systems compromised by the update. SolarWinds says its products are used by 300,000 customers around the globe, and that 18,000 customers downloaded its compromised software update. In February, 60 Minutes spoke to cybersecurity experts who said they believe the U.S. government's strategy for cyber warfare is inadequate and does not effectively deter its adversaries in cyberspace, including Chris Inglis, who was later chosen by the Biden administration to become the nation's first National Cyber Director. A month after 60 Minutes first aired its report on SolarWinds, the Biden administration levied sanctions against Russia, blaming the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) for the SolarWinds hack. President Biden has also taken executive action to bolster U.S. cybersecurity and spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin about recent cyberattacks on the U.S., although Russia has denied responsibility for the hack. Last month, the Senate confirmed Chris Inglis, a former deputy director of the National Security Agency, as National Cyber Director— a new White House role created this January when the National Defense Authorization Act passed in Congress. White House Advisor Jake Sullivan said Inglis would bring ""deep expertise, experience and leadership"" when the nomination was announced. In an interview with Bill Whitaker this February, Inglis said the separation between government and private enterprise, while bound by law and in line with American values, makes coordination on cyber defense difficult. Without a united line of defense, that separation can be exploited by an aggressor. ""It turns out that a division of effort is actually an agreement to not collaborate,"" he said. ""One party's attempting to defend their patch and another party's defending their patch. Both sides are ignorant. And the aggressor can pick you off one at a time."" He suggested greater collaboration between government and private business to identify and address cyber threats. ""Unless there's some collaboration of the defenders,"" he explained, ""No one person is going to have the god's eye view of what's happening in that network."" In an executive order this May, President Biden created strict new security standards that supply chain software companies like SolarWinds must meet to do business with the federal government. The order also requires those companies to maintain a vulnerability disclosure program and make automated security checks public. ""Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector,"" President Biden said in the order. ""The private sector must adapt to the continuously changing threat environment, ensure its products are built and operate securely, and partner with the Federal Government to foster a more secure cyberspace."" In his confirmation hearing last month, Chris Inglis said hacks like SolarWinds ""signal the urgent need to secure our national critical infrastructure"" and that his duties as National Cyber Director would require ""robust engagement"" with the private sector. In April, President Biden ordered the Treasury to designate six Russian technology companies believed to be providing support to the Russian Intelligence Service (SVR). ""We will continue to hold Russia accountable for its malicious cyber activities, such as the SolarWinds incident, by using all available policy and authorities,"" the White House said. Last month, Biden met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland. They spoke for roughly three hours, discussing cybersecurity, arms control, and other topics. Biden said the meeting was ""constructive."" Both leaders addressed reporters in separate news conferences afterward. Biden told reporters that Putin ""knows I will take action"" to stop Russia from engaging in hacking attacks, like those targeting SolarWinds. Biden added Putin ""knows there are consequences"" and said Russia's credibility ""shrinks"" when it participates in cyberattacks. When asked if he was confident Putin would change his behavior, he said, ""I'm not confident of anything."" In a separate press conference, Mr. Putin said the two countries would engage in ""consultations"" related to cybersecurity but denied Russian responsibility for recent cyberattacks. In a conversation with Bill Whitaker this February, James Lewis, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said fear of escalation has held the U.S. back from punishing Russia, and other nation-states, when they step out of line. ""Escalation's a reasonable concern. But it shouldn't be enough to say, 'Oh, we shouldn't do anything because the Russians might be mad,'"" he said. ""The goal is to make them mad. The goal is to make them afraid. How do you punish the Russians without triggering a major conflict?"" He suggested the U.S. experiment with tactics to find creative ways of inflicting revenge on Russia. ""Could you interfere with their media? Could you start putting stories in the Russian media?"" he offered. ""The one that bothers them the most is corruption because it creates the popular discontent in their own populations that they don't want."" He said interfering with money allegedly stashed away in other financial systems by powerful Russians in government and business could be another deterrent. ""We could interfere a little bit with their financial activities,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Lewis suggested. ""They have money squirreled all around the world."" James Lewis retains hope that the Biden administration will be more willing to explore an offensive strategy with the Russians, and other nations like China, who attack the U.S. in cyberspace. ""[Biden] could rethink how we use the exquisite capabilities that NSA and Cyber Command have to inflict pain on Russia and the others,"" he said. ""It's risky. But if we don't take risk, we're not gonna be able to work our way out of this."" The video above was originally published on February 14, 2021 and was produced by Will Croxton and Mabel Kabani.

2021-07-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/revil-cyber-attack-leaves-july-4-weekend-ransomware/,'REvil' Cyber Attack Leaves U.S. Businesses Scrambling on July 4 Weekend,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Businesses around the world rushed Saturday to contain a ransomware attack that has paralyzed their computer networks, a situation complicated in the U.S. by offices lightly staffed at the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend. It's not yet known how many organizations have been hit by demands that they pay a ransom in order to get their systems working again. But some cybersecurity researchers predict the attack targeting customers of software supplier Kaseya could be one of the broadest ransomware attacks on record. It follows a scourge of headline-grabbing attacks over recent months that have been a source of diplomatic tension between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin over whether Russia has become a safe haven for cybercriminal gangs. Biden said Saturday he didn't yet know for certain who was responsible but suggested that the U.S. would respond if Russia was found to have anything to do with it. ""If it is either with the knowledge of and or a consequence of Russia then I told Putin we will respond,"" Biden said. ""We're not certain. The initial thinking was it was not the Russian government."" Cybersecurity experts say the REvil gang, a major Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate, appears to be behind the attack that targeted the software company Kaseya, using its network-management package as a conduit to spread the ransomware through cloud-service providers. ""The number of victims here is already over a thousand and will likely reach into the tens of thousands,"" said cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank. ""No other ransomware campaign comes even close in terms of impact."" The cybersecurity firm ESET says there are victims in least 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Mexico, Kenya and Germany. In Sweden, most of the grocery chain Coop's 800 stores were unable to open because their cash registers weren't working, according to SVT, the country's public broadcaster. The Swedish State Railways and a major local pharmacy chain were also affected. Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola said in a statement that the company believes it has identified the source of the vulnerability and will ""release that patch as quickly as possible to get our customers back up and running."" Voccola said fewer than 40 of Kaseya's customers were known to be affected, but experts said the ransomware could still be affecting hundreds more companies that rely on Kaseya's clients that provide broader IT services. John Hammond of the security firm Huntress Labs said he was aware of a number of managed-services providers — companies that host IT infrastructure for multiple customers — being hit by the ransomware, which encrypts networks until the victims pay off attackers. ""It's reasonable to think this could potentially be impacting thousands of small businesses,"" said Hammond, basing his estimate on the service providers reaching out to his company for assistance and comments on Reddit showing how others are responding. At least some victims appeared to be getting ransoms set at $45,000, considered a small demand but one that could quickly add up when sought from thousands of victims, said Brett Callow, a ransomware expert at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Callow said it's not uncommon for sophisticated ransomware gangs to perform an audit after stealing a victim's financial records to see what they can really pay, but that won't be possible when there are so many victims to negotiate with. ""They just pitched the demand amount at a level most companies will be willing to pay,"" he said. Voccola said the problem is only affecting its ""on-premise"" customers, which means organizations running their own data centers. It's not affecting its cloud-based services running software for customers, though Kaseya also shut down those servers as a precaution, he said. The company added in a statement Saturday that ""customers who experienced ransomware and receive a communication from the attackers should not click on any links -- they may be weaponized."" Gartner analyst Katell Thielemann said it's clear that Kaseya quickly sprang to action, but it's less clear whether their affected clients had the same level of preparedness. ""They reacted with an abundance of caution,"" she said. ""But the reality of this event is it was architected for maximum impact, combining a supply chain attack with a ransomware attack."" Supply chain attacks are those that typically infiltrate widely used software and spread malware as it updates automatically. Complicating the response is that it happened at the start of a major holiday weekend in the U.S., when most corporate IT teams aren't fully staffed. That could also leave those organizations unable to address other security vulnerabilities, such a dangerous Microsoft bug affecting software for print jobs, said James Shank, of threat intelligence firm Team Cymru. ""Customers of Kaseya are in the worst possible situation,"" he said. ""They're racing against time to get the updates out on other critical bugs."" Shank said ""it's reasonable to think that the timing was planned"" by hackers for the holiday. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it was affecting hundreds of businesses and was ""another reminder that the U.S. government must take the fight to these foreign cybercriminal syndicates"" by investigating, disrupting and prosecuting them. The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement that it is closely monitoring the situation and working with the FBI to collect more information about its impact. CISA urged anyone who might be affected to ""follow Kaseya's guidance to shut down VSA servers immediately."" Kaseya runs what's called a virtual system administrator, or VSA, that's used to remotely manage and monitor a customer's network. The privately held Kaseya is based in Dublin, Ireland, with a U.S. headquarters in Miami. REvil, the group most experts have tied to the attack, was the same ransomware provider that the FBI linked to an attack on JBS SA, a major global meat processor forced to pay a $11 million ransom, amid the Memorial Day holiday weekend in May. Active since April 2019, the group provides ransomware-as-a-service, meaning it develops the network-paralyzing software and leases it to so-called affiliates who infect targets and earn the lion's share of ransoms. U.S. officials have said the most potent ransomware gangs are based in Russia and allied states and operate with Kremlin tolerance and sometimes collude with Russian security services. Alperovitch said he believes the latest attack is financially motivated and not Kremlin-directed. However, he said it shows that Putin ""has not yet moved"" on shutting down cybercriminals within Russia after Biden pressed him to do so at their June summit in Switzerland. Asked about the attack during a trip to Michigan on Saturday, Biden said he had asked the intelligence community for a ""deep dive"" on what happened. He said he expected to know more by Sunday. © Copyright 2021 Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

2021-07-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/advisory-warns-russia-linked-hackers-targeting-hundreds-of-u-s-and-european-entities/,"Russia-linked hackers targeting hundreds of U.S. and European entities, new advisory warns","Hackers from Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, are engaged in a global campaign to target ""hundreds"" of predominantly American and European entities, including government and military organizations, energy companies, think tanks and media companies, according to a new joint cybersecurity advisory issued by U.S. and U.K. national security agencies Thursday. The campaign began in mid-2019 and is ""almost certainly"" ongoing, the advisory warned, noting hackers are using an amplified and anonymized version of what are known as ""brute force"" access attempts – trying to log in to target networks by repeatedly guessing passwords – against a broad range of government and private organizations around the world. The advisory did not identify any specific victims or indicate how much or what kind of data may have been exfiltrated. It urged organizations to ""adopt and expand"" protective and mitigation techniques including multi-factor authentication, lock-out features and mandatory use of strong passwords. It said the types of targeted organizations included government and military organizations, political consultants and parties, defense contractors, energy companies, higher education institutions, logistics companies, law firms, media companies and think tanks. ""This lengthy brute force campaign to collect and exfiltrate data, access credentials and more, is likely ongoing, on a global scale,"" said Rob Joyce, the NSA's Director of Cybersecurity. ""Net defenders should use multi-factor authentication and the additional mitigations in the advisory to counter this activity."" An NSA spokesperson said this GRU-led campaign was separate from the SolarWinds supply chain attack, which was attributed to a separate Russian intelligence service known as the SVR. It is also differs from other recent, notable ransomware attacks on Colonial Pipeline or JBS meat supplier, which were targeted by two distinct criminal ransomware groups known to have links to Russia. The GRU hackers, operating as part of the elite military unit 26165 – which was also behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee as part of Moscow's sprawling 2016 election interference campaign – principally targeted Microsoft Office 365 cloud services, but also targeted and other email servers and service providers in their attempts. While the ""brute force"" technique is not new or particularly sophisticated, the GRU ""uniquely leveraged"" software containers to scale its effort, the advisory said. It was released by the National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). The hackers drew in part on an open-source platform called Kubernetes to augment and anonymize their password spray activity, which also sometimes used Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and The Onion Router (TOR). According to the advisory, once the hackers correctly identified given login credentials, they were combined with known software vulnerabilities to allow hackers to burrow deeper into victim networks, where they could access and remove data. The advisory is one of several recent disclosures made by government agencies in an attempt to help potential victim organizations protect themselves against nation-state attackers. It is also the latest in a series of cyber incursions attributed to Russia. ""The GRU appears to pursue a traditional intelligence collection campaign here by targeting organizations of strategic interest to the Russian Federation, such as energy companies, political parties, think tanks and government,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technology officer at cybersecurity company Crowdstrike and current executive chairman at Silverado Policy Accelerator. ""The danger, however, is that this campaign can easily turn from traditional espionage into a 'hack and leak' or destructive action as we have seen from past GRU attacks."" Last May, the NSA also warned that Russian hackers from the so-called ""Sandworm team"" of the GRU were exploiting a vulnerability in Exim Mail Transfer Agent, a type of popular email software. In June, after a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Biden said that the U.S. and Moscow would begin ""consultations"" on a range of cyber-related issues. The Biden administration has not offered specifics on the timing or focus of potential talks. Joyce recently said the NSA was unlikely to take part directly in any consultations with Moscow, but that it would ""absolutely"" use the agency's threat reporting to inform policymakers leading the negotiations.",3,1.3471861412127741,6.45620960441003,-5.109023463197255,1
2021-06-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/germany-lithuania-nato-soldiers-investigation-sexual-assault-anti-semitism/,"Germany investigating claims of sexual assault, anti-Semitic remarks by soldiers at booze-fueled hotel party","Berlin — Germany's military is pulling an entire armored infantry unit out of Lithuania as it investigates claims of extremist, anti-Semitic remarks and a purported sexual assault at a booze-fueled hotel party. An official investigation was launched in Germany after allegations emerged of a raucous party by members of the unit on April 30 at a hotel in the central Lithuanian town of Rukla. Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer announced last week that the entire infantry unit would be withdrawn. The 30 soldiers have been based in Lithuania as part of a NATO Enhanced Forward Presence mission — part of the transatlantic alliance's military posturing on Europe's far-eastern flank, close to the border with Russia. Members of the infantry unit have regularly spent weekends at the hotel for a break from their exercises with Lithuanian and other international partners. In military jargon, the breaks are referred to as ""recreational exercise."" On April 30, a small cohort of the unit's members allegedly partied and consumed large amounts of alcohol in one of the hotel rooms. German soldiers at the NATO camp are subject to a general ban on alcohol consumption, which is only lifted on special days such as Christmas or New Year's Eve. The Bundeswehr is investigating several soldiers over allegations including the sexual assault of a fellow soldier, bullying, threats of violence, and singing anti-Semitic songs. The allegations were brought to light by one of the unit's members who reported to a superior. Videos showing some of the incidents are said to exist, but they have not come out publicly. Formal proceedings are already underway against at least three soldiers, who have been sent back to Germany. However, the incident was not officially reported until June 8, and the Defense Ministry is now also investigating whether superior officers in Lithuania tried to settle the matter internally, without notifying their own commanders. The broadening scandal led the country's defense chief to announce the full withdrawal of the unit from Lithuania, but the remaining members were still in the country as of Tuesday. The Bundeswehr has thus far refused to provide any details about its ongoing investigations. A spokesman for the Operations Command has said only that there were indications of ""misconduct"" by German soldiers involving ""statements of a right-wing radical and anti-Semitic nature,"" as well as sexual violence and discrimination against a female soldier on the basis of her gender. All of the accusations are being taken ""very seriously,"" the spokesman said. The Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) mission in Lithuania is part of NATO's show of force and deterrence against Russia. In the wake of Moscow's unilateral annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, NATO has strengthened its operational readiness along its eastern flank with new troop deployments, including one multinational battalion each in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. NATO's expanded troop presence in eastern Europe has been closely monitored by Russia since the start of the mission, and the deployments have been targeted by disinformation campaigns. There have already been several attempts, mostly via social media, to spread fake stories about misconduct by German troops in Lithuania. In 2017, for instance, rumors were spread online about a Bundeswehr soldier committing a rape. The allegations were groundless. Badly faked photos purporting to show German troops desecrating Jewish cemeteries have also cropped up on the internet repeatedly, but no such incidents have been reported by officials. Germany's intelligence service and NATO have said Russian internet ""trolls"" are likely behind the disinformation, which they consider an attempt to undermine support for the NATO mission in Lithuania. The Bundeswehr has coordinated successfully with local authorities in Lithuania to counter the malicious rumors and prevent them from spreading too far. However, if the allegations against the troops in Rukla do result in punitive action, it would be more than just an embarrassment for Germany. ""The misconduct of some soldiers in Lithuania is a slap in the face of everyone who serves the security of our country day after day in the Bundeswehr,"" German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said. She vowed that troops found guilty of the behavior alleged in Rukla would be punished with ""the utmost severity,"" suggesting any soldiers involved could face repercussions under both military and criminal law.",29,4.8524141980045945,5.953204678273036,-1.1007904802684418,8
2021-06-16,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/university-colorado-cyber-attack-ukraine-clop-ransomeware/,Ukraine Authorities Arrest CL0P Ransomware Gang Linked To University Of Colorado Cyberattack,"BOULDER, Colo. (CBS4) - Criminals tied to what is believed to be the largest cyberattack on the University of Colorado appear to have been arrested in the Ukraine. CU announced the leak in February and later said that it did not pay ransom demands. The Ukraine government has released video of the arrest. The arrests are of suspects associated with the CL0P ransomware gang, believed to have targeted CU. Ukraine authorities believe the group may have caused a half-billion dollars in financial damages around the world. They claim to have shut down the infrastructure after searches of 21 homes and vehicles. It is not clear if those arrested are core members of the ransomware operation. The U.S. and South Korea helped in the international operation. The attack targeted a vulnerability in the File Transfer Appliance from Accellion, a third-party vendor. CU Boulder was notified of the data breach on Jan. 25. The university's Office of Information Security determined files uploaded by 447 CU users were at risk of unauthorized access. In March, CBS4 reported the ransomware group CL0P began gradually leaking data from more than two dozen Accellion hacks on the dark web, including data from CU. Officials said some staff who use the file transfer service received emails that their personal data had been stolen and would be published if the university didn't pay the $17 million ransom. The demand was later lowered to $5 million and the university does not intend to pay. The FBI says payment does not guarantee files will be recovered and it could encourage criminals to carry out future attacks. CU announced it will provide credit and identity monitoring along with fraud consultation and identity theft restoration to those affected by the data breach. The bulk of the data came from CU Boulder but some other files were accessed from CU Denver. CU's Colorado Springs and Anschutz Medical Campus were not affected.",3,6.725605858256508,7.040444900468429,-0.3148390422119203,7
2021-06-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-press-conference-nato-summit-putin/,Biden declines to preview what he wants from Putin in brief press conference,"President Biden wouldn't say much about his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, though it was the topic of several questions posed by reporters at his news conference Monday after meetings with NATO leaders in Brussels. The president's meeting Wednesday is perhaps the most-anticipated aspect of his week-long foreign trip to the United Kingdom, Belgium and Switzerland. ""I'll tell you that when it's over,"" Mr. Biden deflected, replying to a correspondent's question about his expectations of the Russian president and concessions he hoped to get. He said he wouldn't negotiate in the press. In response to a question from CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes, Mr. Biden also sought to put to rest any concern that meeting with Putin so soon in his presidency could unduly raise his prominence. ""Every world leader here that's a member of NATO that spoke today ... thanked me for meeting with Putin now,"" the president said, putting the number of leaders who had done so at about 10 to 12. ""They thought it was thoroughly appropriate that I do so,"" In his brief press conference, which was delayed for 2 hours and 40 minutes, the president said the NATO nations addressed the threats posed by Russia and affirmed the sovereignty of Ukraine. ""I'm not looking for conflict with Russia, but we will respond if Russia continues its harmful activities,"" the president said. Mr. Biden explained his delay to the press conference by saying he had a chance to meet with several leaders and had calls with others. He characterized his meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as positive and said he believes that the U.S. and Turkey can work together on some things. Reporters were supposed to be let into the room to see the two leaders before their meeting but were only allowed in for a moment following the meeting, and neither Mr. Biden nor Erdoğan made remarks or answered questions. Mr. Biden said everyone at NATO understood that ""America is back."" ""NATO stands together. That's how we've met every other threat in the past,"" the president said. At NATO headquarters, Mr. Biden underscored the U.S. commitment to Article 5 of the alliance's charter, which states that any attack on one member is an attack on all members, and therefore must to be met with a collective response. ""I will make it clear that the United States' commitment to our NATO alliance and Article 5 is rock solid,"" Mr. Biden told American troops in England last week. ""It's a sacred obligation."" In a communique issued after Monday's session, the heads of the NATO countries said they ""remain firmly committed to NATO's founding Washington Treaty, including that an attack against one Ally shall be considered an attack against us all, as enshrined in Article 5."" The lengthy message took aim at Russia, saying the country ""continues to breach the values, principles, trust, and commitments outlined in agreed documents that underpin the NATO-Russia relationship."" ""Until Russia demonstrates compliance with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities, there can be no return to 'business as usual,'"" the communique stated. ""We will continue to respond to the deteriorating security environment by enhancing our deterrence and defence posture, including by a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance."" The statement included language about updating Article 5 in relation to major cyberattacks, which have become a significant and growing concern after a number of intrusions by Russia-based hackers targeting the U.S. government and businesses worldwide. The leaders said decisions about whether to invoke Article 5 after a cyberattack ""would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis."" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the update would make it possible for an alliance member to invoke Article 5 and seek technical or intelligence support from NATO partners in response to a cyberattack. Mr. Biden's itinerary in Europe, which started with the G-7 summit in England over the weekend, was planned so that he would meet with America's closest allies before his much anticipated summit with Putin in Geneva. CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe said Mr. Biden was hoping to build in Brussels on what he called a ""productive"" meeting with the other G-7 leaders, as he tries to restore relationships with NATO allies that became frayed under the previous U.S. administration. The agenda for the NATO summit included everything from the security implications of climate change, cyberattacks and disinformation, to terrorism, nuclear deterrence and the alliance's role in the resource-rich and rapidly melting Arctic. But China's precipitous rise and Russia's increasingly aggressive actions, especially against Ukraine, were expected to be at the forefront of the discussions, and Mr. Biden has already been talking tough. Just days before he's to come face to face with Putin, the president said of Russia's leader, ""There's no guarantee you can change a person's behavior or the behavior of his country. Autocrats have enormous power, and they don't have to answer to a public."" Mr. Biden agreed with Putin's recent assessment that relations between the U.S. and Russia have reached their lowest point in years. But while Putin regularly blames that chasm on American policy and ""Russia-phobia,"" Mr. Biden clearly sees it as Moscow's doing, and he said the ball was in Putin's court. ""I think he's right that it's a low point,"" Mr. Biden said on Sunday, ""and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not."" The president kicked off the workweek by meeting on Monday with leaders of the Baltic states and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. After Mr. Biden's meeting with Stoltenberg, the NATO chief tweeted a photo of the two of them walking together and thanked the president for ""his rock solid commitment to our Alliance.""",29,6.7171344744678905,4.09361003748907,2.623524436978821,25
2021-06-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/jbs-cyberattack-meat-supplier-fbi-attributes-revil-ransomware-operation-russia-greeley/,FBI Attributes JBS Cyberattack To Russia-Linked 'REvil' Ransomware Operation,"GREELEY, Colo. (CBS4) - The cyberattack that disrupted operations at JBS, the world's largest meat supplier, is now attributed to a Russia-linked ransomware operation. In a statement on Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it is working diligently to bring the threat actors known as ""REvil"" or ""Sodinokibi"" to justice. JBS became aware of the cyberattack on Sunday over Memorial Day weekend. In a statement on Tuesday night, the company said it had made ""significant progress"" in resolving the hack, which disrupted operations at more than a dozen U.S. facilities, including a beef plant in Greeley. JBS officials said the ""vast majority"" of its meatpacking plants would be operational by Wednesday. ""Our systems are coming back online and we are not sparing any resources to fight this threat. We have cybersecurity plans in place to address these types of issues and we are successfully executing those plans,"" stated Andre Nogueira, JBS USA CEO. ""The company is not aware of any evidence at this time that any customer, supplier or employee data has been compromised."" The REvil Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation, also known as Sodinokibi, provides malware kits for criminal affiliates to launch cyberattacks in exchange for a cut of the profit, usually around 20-30%. In October 2020, REvil reportedly invested $1 million in bitcoin to employ new recruits, according to Forbes. In previous operations, REvil has used spearphishing techniques to gain access to systems via malicious attachments, including Microsoft Word documents. It's unclear how the criminal group gained access to servers supporting JBS's North American and Australian IT systems. JBS has not said how much ransom the hackers are demanding and if the company plans to pay. The company's operations in Mexico and the UK were not impacted by the breach. In a tweet on Wednesday, Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican who represents Colorado's 4th Congressional District, urged the Biden administration to hold REvil distributors and affiliates criminally accountable for the attack. IBM Security X-Force reports REvil profited at least $81 million from extortion threats in 2020. Cybersecurity experts say the criminal group appears to consider an organization's annual revenue, with ransom demands ranging from $1,500 to $42 million. ""REvil has been one of those most prolific groups and accounts for about 4% of all ransomware activity. The group has also been responsible for some of the largest ransoms to have become publicly known, including a $42 million demand in the case of entertainment law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks,"" said Brett Callow, a threat analyst with the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. ""Like many other groups, REvil operates an affiliate model. While the people who created the ransomware are believed to be based in Russia, the people who use it to carry out the attacks - the affiliates - could be based anywhere."" The JBS cyberattack comes just weeks after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline prompted gas shortages in several states. Colonial paid nearly $5 million in ransom to the Russian hacking group DarkSide. Soon after, the extortion gang claimed it was ending its operation before disappearing offline. Some meat industry experts estimate JBS may already be tens of thousands of heads short in their processing due to the ransomware attack.",3,5.831921180841063,0.6665586288326982,5.165362552008365,7
2021-06-03,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jbs-meat-cyberattack-resumes-production/,JBS resumes meat production after weekend cyberattack,"The world's largest meat processing company has resumed most production after a weekend cyberattack, but experts say the vulnerabilities exposed by this attack and others are far from resolved. In a statement late Wednesday, the FBI attributed the attack on Brazil-based meat processor JBS SA to REvil, a Russian-speaking gang that has made some of the largest ransomware demands on record in recent months. The FBI said it will work to bring the group to justice and it urged anyone who is the victim of a cyberattack to contact the bureau immediately. REvil has not posted anything related to the hack on its dark web site. But that's not unusual. Ransomware syndicates as a rule don't post about attacks when they are in initial negotiations with victims — or if the victims have paid a ransom. In October, a REvil representative who goes by the handle ""UNKN"" said in an interview published online that the agriculture sector would now be a main target for the syndicate. REvil also threatened to auction off sensitive stolen data from victims who refused to pay it. The attack targeted servers supporting JBS's operations in North America and Australia. Backup servers weren't affected and the company said it was not aware of any customer, supplier or employee data being compromised. JBS said late Wednesday said that it expects to resume production at all its plants on Thursday and be running at ""close to full capacity"" across its global operations. It is not known if JBS paid a ransom. The company hasn't discussed it in public statements, and did not respond to phone and email messages Wednesday seeking comment. The FBI and the White House declined to comment on the ransom. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday the U.S. is considering all options in dealing with the attack and that President Joe Biden intends to confront Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, about his nation's harboring of ransomware criminals when the two meet in Europe in two weeks. ""I can assure you that we are raising this through the highest levels of the U.S. government,"" she said. ""The president certainly believes that President Putin has a role to play in stopping and preventing these attacks."" While there is no evidence Russia benefits financially from ransomware crime — which has hit health care, education and state and local governments especially hard during the pandemic — U.S. officials say its practitioners have sometimes worked for Kremlin security services. Ransomware expert Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said JBS was the largest food manufacturer yet to be hit by ransomware, in which criminal hackers paralyze entire networks by scrambling their data. But he said at least 40 food companies have been targeted by ransomware gangs over the last year, including brewer Molson Coors and E & J Gallo Winery. Food companies, Liska said, are at ""about the same level of security as manufacturing and shipping. Which is to say, not very."" The attack was the second in a month on critical U.S. infrastructure. Earlier in May, hackers believed to operate with impunity in Russia and allied states shut down operation of the Colonial Pipeline, the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, for nearly a week. The closure sparked long lines and panic buying at gas stations across the Southeast. Colonial Pipeline confirmed it paid $4.4 million to the hackers, who then turned over a software decryption key. Cybersecurity experts said the attacks targeting critical sectors of the U.S. economy are evidence that industry hasn't been taking years of repeated warnings seriously. Cybercriminals previously active in online ID theft and bank fraud moved into ransomware in the mid-2010s as programmers developed sophisticated programs that permitted the software's more efficient dissemination. The ransomware scourge reached epidemic dimensions last year. The firm CrowdStrike observed over 1,400 ransomware and data extortion incidents in 2020. Most targeted manufacturing, industrials, engineering and technology companies, said Adam Meyers, the company's senior vice president of intelligence. ""The problem has been spiraling out of control,"" said John Hultquist, who heads intelligence analysis at FireEye. ""We're already deep into a vicious cycle."" Hultquist said ransomware syndicates are going after more critical and visible targets because they've invested heavily in identifying ""whales,"" companies they think will yield big ransoms. JBS is the second-largest producer of beef, pork and chicken in the U.S. If it were to shut down for even one day, the U.S. would lose almost a quarter of its beef-processing capacity, or the equivalent of 20,000 beef cows, according to Trey Malone, an assistant professor of agriculture at Michigan State University. Mark Jordan, who follows the meat industry as the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, said the disruption to the food supply will likely be minimal in this case. Meat has around a 14-day window to move through the market, he said. If a plant is closed for a day or two, companies can usually make up for lost production with extra shifts. ""Several plants owned by a major meatpacker going offline for a couple of days is a major headache, but it is manageable assuming it doesn't extend much beyond that,"" he said. Jordan said a closure that runs closer to a week would be more serious, especially for a company like JBS, which controls around one-fifth of the country's beef, pork and chicken supply. Critical U.S. infrastructure might be better hardened against ransomware attacks were it not for the 2012 defeat of legislation that would have set cybersecurity standards for critical industries. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups lobbied hard against the bill, condemning it as government interference in the free market. Even a watered-down version that would have made the standards voluntary was blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate. Right now, the U.S. has no cybersecurity requirements for companies outside of the electric, nuclear and banking systems, said David White, president of the cyber risk management company Axio. White said regulations would help, particularly for companies with inadequate or immature cybersecurity programs. Those rules should be sector-specific and should consider the national economic risks of outages, he said. But he said regulations can also have an unintentional negative effect. Some companies might consider them the ceiling — not the starting point — for how they need to manage risk, he said. ""Bottom line: regulation can help, but it is not the panacea,""' White said. JBS plants in Australia resumed limited operations Wednesday in New South Wales and Victoria states, Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said. The company hoped to resume work in Queensland state on Thursday, he said. JBS, which is a majority shareholder of Pilgrim's Pride, didn't say which of its 84 U.S. facilities were closed Monday and Tuesday because of the attack. It said JBS USA and Pilgrim's were able to ship meat from nearly all facilities Tuesday. Several of the company's pork, poultry and prepared foods plants were operational Tuesday and its Canada beef facility resumed production, it said. The plant closures reflect the reality that modern meat processing is heavily automated, for both food- and worker-safety reasons. Computers collect data at multiple stages of the production process; orders, billing, shipping and other functions are all electronic.",3,0.2676645685893942,0.027463150788133328,0.24020141780126086,7

Most targeted manufacturing, industrials, engineering and technology companies, said Adam Meyers, the company's vice president of intelligence. ""The problem has been spiraling out of control,"" said John Hultquist, who heads intelligence analysis at FireEye. ""We're already deep into a vicious cycle."" Hultquist said ransomware syndicates are going after more critical and visible targets because they've invested heavily in identifying ""whales"" - companies they think will yield big ransoms. JBS is the second-largest producer of beef, pork and chicken in the U.S. If it were to shut down for even one day, the U.S. would lose almost a quarter of its beef-processing capacity, or the equivalent of 20,000 beef cows, according to Trey Malone, an assistant professor of agriculture at Michigan State University. Mark Jordan, who follows the meat industry as the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, said the disruption to the food supply will likely be minimal in this case. Meat has around a 14-day window to move through the market, he said. If a plant is closed for a day or two, companies can usually make up for lost production with extra shifts. ""Several plants owned by a major meatpacker going offline for a couple of days is a major headache, but it is manageable assuming it doesn't extend much beyond that,"" he said. Jordan said a closure that runs closer to a week would be more serious, especially for a company like JBS, which controls around one-fifth of the country's beef, pork and chicken supply. Critical U.S. infrastructure might be better hardened against ransomware attacks were it not for the 2012 defeat of legislation that would have set cybersecurity standards for critical industries. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups lobbied hard against the bill, condemning it as government interference in the free market. Even a watered-down version that would have made the standards voluntary was blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate. Right now, the U.S. has no cybersecurity requirements for companies outside of the electric, nuclear and banking systems, said David White, president of the cyber risk management company Axio. White said regulations would help, particularly for companies with inadequate or immature cybersecurity programs. Those rules should be sector-specific and should consider the national economic risks of outages, he said. But he said regulations can also have an unintentional negative effect. Some companies might consider them the ceiling — not the starting point — for how they need to manage risk, he said. ""Bottom line: regulation can help, but it is not the panacea,""′ White said. JBS plants in Australia resumed limited operations Wednesday in New South Wales and Victoria states, Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said. The company hoped to resume work in Queensland state on Thursday, he said. JBS, which is a majority shareholder of Pilgrim's Pride, didn't say which of its 84 U.S. facilities were closed Monday and Tuesday because of the attack. It said JBS USA and Pilgrim's were able to ship meat from nearly all facilities Tuesday. Several of the company's pork, poultry and prepared foods plants were operational Tuesday and its Canada beef facility resumed production, it said. The plant closures reflect the reality that modern meat processing is heavily automated, for both food- and worker-safety reasons. Computers collect data at multiple stages of the production process; orders, billing, shipping and other functions are all electronic. (© Copyright 2021 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

2021-05-31,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-military-units-nato/,Russian military to add 20 new units in country's west to counter NATO,"Russia's military will form 20 new units in the country's west this year to counter what it claims is a growing threat from NATO, the defense minister said Monday. Sergei Shoigu made the announcement at a meeting with top military officials. He pointed to a growing number of flights by U.S. strategic bombers near Russia's borders, deployments of NATO warships and increasingly frequent and major drills by alliance forces. He charged that such actions ""destroy the international security system and force us to take the relevant countermeasures."" ""We will form another 20 units and formations in the Western Military District until the year's end,"" Shoigu said. He added the military units in Western Russia have commissioned about 2,000 new pieces of weaponry this year. Asked Monday about Russia's plans, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noted that ""Russia over the last years has invested heavily in new, modern military capabilities, from conventional to nuclear weapon systems"" and ""has been willing to use military force against neighbors, in Georgia, in Ukraine."" ""This is one of the main reasons why NATO over the last years has increased the readiness of (its) armed forces,"" he told reporters before Tuesday's meeting of the alliance's foreign and defense ministers. Currently, thousands of NATO troops, several warships and dozens of aircraft are taking part in military exercises stretching across the Atlantic, through Europe and into the Black Sea region. NATO says the war games aren't aimed at Russia, but the Steadfast Defender 21 exercises are simulating the 30-nation military organization's response to an attack on any one of its members. It will test NATO's ability to deploy troops from the U.S. and keep supply lines open. Last month, a troop buildup in Russia's south and southwest near the Ukrainian border raised concerns in Ukraine and the West, which urged Moscow to withdraw its forces. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 following the ouster of the country's Moscow-friendly president and then threw its weight behind separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in seven years of fighting in eastern Ukraine. Russia has recalled some troops from its western part after sweeping maneuvers in April, but Shoigu ordered them to leave their weapons behind for Russia's Zapad (West) 2021 military exercises in September. He noted Monday that preparations for the exercises, which will be conducted jointly with Belarus, are now in their final stage and emphasized that the maneuvers have an ""exclusively defensive character."" Last week, Russia offered political support to its ally Belarus, which diverted a Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania as part of a ruse to arrest a dissident journalist. The European Union denounced the flight's diversion as piracy and responded by barring the Belarusian flag carrier from its airspace and advising European airlines to skirt Belarus' airspace.",29,8.380829053715937,2.5091682119054988,5.871660841810439,21

The Kremlin said the meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday bode well for a potential summit this summer between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden. Both sides described the discussion, which went on for almost two hours, as constructive, but cautioned that there were a lot of issues still to address before bilateral relations — currently wallowing near Cold War lows — could be normalized. ""Indeed, there are piles of problems. It will be difficult to clear this logjam,"" Lavrov told journalists after the meeting, which took place on the sidelines of an Arctic Council summit in Iceland. ""But I felt that Antony Blinken and his team are willing to do it, and we are ready to work together."" U.S. officials said that no substantive agreements were reached but described the meeting as an open dialogue which could help to bridge the gap between the two countries. Blinken pressed Lavrov on the jailing of U.S. citizens Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed, and he ""raised deep concerns"" over Russia's recent military buildup near the Ukrainian border and its treatment of jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny and the repression of other dissidents, according to U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price. Blinken told his Russian counterpart that the U.S. ""sought a more stable and predictable relationship with Moscow,"" Price said, while reiterating ""President Biden's resolve to protect U.S. citizens and act firmly in defense of U.S. interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies."" One senior Russian senator noted ""reserved optimism"" in Moscow after the two top diplomats' sit-down. ""I liked the reserved optimism of the head of our Foreign Ministry towards the end of this,"" Konstantin Kosachev, head of international affairs within the Russian parliament, wrote on Facebook. ""Knowing Sergey's [Lavrov's] traditionally realistic assessments, I think this is a very good sign."" One thing did happen on Wednesday that could be a decisive factor in pushing Russia to agree to a bilateral presidential summit later this year. But while the announcement coincided with Blinken and Lavrov's meeting, the news came out of Washington, not Iceland: The U.S. government confirmed that no sanctions would be levied against the company in charge of the controversial Russian-European Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The massive piece of infrastructure stretches from Russia to Germany and it will facilitate much smoother Russian gas sales to all of Europe. ""I have determined that it is in the national interest of the United States to waive the application of sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, its CEO Matthias Warnig, and Nord Stream 2 AG's corporate officers,"" Blinken said in a statement. The Kremlin welcomed the decision as another ""positive sign."" The U.S. had previously slammed the project as a threat to European energy security, as Russia reiterated its frequent complaint that Washington relies too heavily on economic punishment in its foreign policy. The Kremlin said Putin was briefed on Lavrov's discussion with Blinken, but that the meeting had to be analyzed before a final decision was made regarding the prospect of a presidential summit. The rumor is that both sides have been preparing for the potential Biden-Putin meeting to take place in June, in an as-yet-undetermined European capital. The White House first floated the idea of a presidential summit last month in an apparent move to restore some lines of communication with Moscow. Bilateral relations were already fraught when they took a nose-dive in March, after Mr. Biden agreed with a description of Putin as ""a killer."" Envoys in both countries were recalled to their home capitals for consultations. Washington then imposed new sanctions over ""malign"" activities, denied by the Kremlin, leading to another wave of diplomatic expulsions. The Kremlin on Wednesday signaled that Putin would be willing to look past Mr. Biden's previous comments if the meeting does take place this summer. ""This incident is not the main thing,"" the Russian leader's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday. ""We are talking about strategic stability — it worries the whole world, it concerns the whole world, and our bilateral relations. These are the main topics on the agenda."" Mr. Biden and Putin had one early success, prolonging the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty for five more years when the fate of the pact — the only remaining nuclear treaty between the two atomic bomb-wielding countries — hung in the balance early in Mr. Biden's tenure. Russia says it now wants to get the U.S. back into other agreements that were severed during the four years of the Trump administration, including the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) and the Open Skies Treaty.

2021-05-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-russia-relationship-arctic-summit/,"Can the U.S. have ""a stable and more predictable relationship with Russia""?","Moscow — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov were set to face off late Wednesday in the first high-level meeting between Russian and American officials under the Biden administration. They will meet as relations between the two rival powers hover near Cold War-lows. ""It would be our preference to have a more stable and more predictable relationship with Russia,"" Blinken said the day before the meeting. ""If these are stable and predictable sanctions, then it's probably not what we need, and we won't be judging the U.S. calls to normalize relations by their words,"" Lavrov responded a few hours later in Moscow, reiterating a common Russian complaint that the U.S. relies too heavily on economic punishment for its foreign policy. The two senior diplomats have a long list of hurdles to address, including Russia's treatment of jailed opposition figure Alexey Navalny, recent saber-rattling near the Ukrainian border and sanctions that Washington hit Russia with recently over alleged interference in U.S. elections and hacking attacks on American infrastructure. The meeting on the sidelines of the Arctic Council summit in Iceland on Wednesday was likely to make or break a highly anticipated summit between President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, which is expected to take place in June in Europe, if it does in fact go ahead. Bilateral relations were already fraught when they nose-dived in March, after Mr. Biden agreed with a description of Putin as ""a killer."" Envoys in both countries were recalled to their home capitals for consultations. Washington then imposed new sanctions over ""malign"" activities, denied by the Kremlin, leading to another wave of diplomatic expulsions. Russia added the U.S. to a new ""list of unfriendly"" nations, preventing the U.S. Embassy from employing local staff. The White House first floated the idea of a presidential summit last month in an apparent move to restore some lines of communication. The Kremlin said it was considering the offer, but it hasn't publicly confirmed that the meeting will take place. Despite the increasingly adversarial relations, however, Russia has signaled that it sees issues like nuclear arms control and strategic stability as areas of mutual interest on which the two nations might cooperate. The Kremlin on Wednesday signaled that Putin would be willing to look past Mr. Biden's previous comments if the meeting does take place this summer.

""We are talking about strategic stability — it worries the whole world, it concerns the whole world, and our bilateral relations. These are the main topics on the agenda."" Russian officials also responded positively to U.S. media reports suggesting the Biden administration has decided against sanctioning the company in charge of the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, stretching from Russia to Germany to enable easier Russian gas sales to Europe. The U.S. had previously slammed the project as a threat to European energy security.

""The return of the United States to the JCPOA is the main, key issue from our point of view, which requires a solution,"" Lavrov's deputy, Sergey Ryabkov, said Wednesday ahead of the meeting in Iceland. Russia's ambitious economic and military plans for its northern territories have also emerged as a growing point of contention with the U.S., as Russia takes over from Iceland as the rotating chair of the Arctic Council. Ahead of the Reykjavik summit, Blinken criticized Russia's military buildup in the Arctic region and its ""unlawful maritime claims"" after Moscow obliged foreign vessels transiting the so-called ""Northern Route,"" the shipping passage around the country's northern coastline, to obtain permission and let Russian maritime officers board the vessels as they go through. Lavrov rebuked the statement, saying Moscow considers the region ""its own land,"" and that Russia has the right to ensure the security of its northern coastline.

2021-05-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-cisa-chief-christopher-krebs-biden-order-on-cybersecurity/,"Former CISA chief says Biden order on cybersecurity is ""dramatic game change""","Christopher Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security, praised the Biden administration for taking action to address cybersecurity threats. Krebs spoke with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett for this week's episode of ""The Takeout"" podcast. President Biden signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at hardening the federal government's cybersecurity defenses by directing the Commerce Department to author new standards for software vendors supplying the federal government. Krebs called the action a ""dramatic game change"" that showed Mr. Biden's ""committed leadership vision"" to prioritize cybersecurity concerns. Highlights from this week's episode: ""It dramatically increases security expectations of the software products that are sold to the federal government,"" Krebs said, explaining that this would have a ""cascading effect"" for products sold to ordinary American customers. Krebs praised Mr. Biden for ""jettisoning the traditional approach"" to addressing cybersecurity, but said that Congress needed to act to shore up the nation's cyber infrastructure as well. Krebs has previously called on Mr. Biden to incorporate this into his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal. ""You need both,"" Krebs said, meaning presidential and congressional action. Krebs also responded to the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, after the company announced Wednesday that it has begun restarting pipeline operations after a cyberattack forced the company to take some of its systems offline last Friday. ""Ransomware is a really, really profitable business these days,"" Krebs remarked. The company, which operates a major energy pipeline, first announced the hack a week ago, also soon disclosed that ""this incident involves ransomware."" Several sources told CBS News on Thursday that Colonial Pipeline did pay a ransom to the hackers who had infiltrated its computer network. The money was paid shortly after the computer systems started locking up late last week. The FBI said Monday that the attack was the work of a criminal gang known as DarkSide, an operation which Krebs said was composed mainly of Russian individuals, many in their teens or early twenties. Colonial Pipeline said an outside security firm is investigating the incident. Krebs said that DarkSide not only holds data for ransom, but exfiltrates it as well, calling the operation ""fifth-dimension chess here from a criminal perspective."" Mr. Biden said Thursday that there's no evidence that the Russian government was involved in the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, although U.S. intelligence suggests the hackers live in Russia. Krebs said that he had ""a hard time seeing how it would be possible"" for DarkSide to operate without Russian domestic intelligence having knowledge of their actions. ""There are prior examples of ransomware crews coordinating and collaborating with Russian intelligence,"" Krebs said. The decision to take the company's systems offline led to long lines in some states this week, as gas prices in some areas hit a nearly seven-year high, and gas stations in several states were plagued by long lines and many ran out of gasoline. The 5,500-mile pipeline supplies about 45% of the East Coast's fuel. Krebs also discussed the SolarWinds hack last year, an intrusion that initially gave cyber criminals access to 18,000 government and private computer networks, though a much smaller number were the actual targets of espionage. The National Security Agency, FBI and CISA have formally attributed the attack to Russia, saying the country's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, directed the intrusions. The Biden administration recently issued sanctions on Russia in part in response to the SolarWinds intrusion. Krebs, whose cybersecurity consultant firm is working with SolarWinds, said that ""there are plenty of lessons learned that everyone can take"" from the intrusion. ""Everybody can do better. The threats are so diverse right now,"" Krebs said. He added that there were many businesses that needed to improve their ""corporate citizenship"" by upping their cybersecurity practices. Krebs was fired by former President Trump in November after he continued to debunk the president's false claims that the election was stolen from him.

2021-05-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/souyz-flight-yulia-peresild-russia-international-space-station/,"Russia clears actress, filmmaker for flight to International Space Station","Russian actress Yulia Peresild and filmmaker Klim Shipenko will join cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station on October 5 to shoot scenes for an upcoming movie, the Russian space agency announced Thursday. ""At the end of 2020, an open competition was announced for the lead role in the first feature film to be filmed in space,"" Roscosmos said on its website. Peresild, 36, and Shipenko, 37, were selected ""based on the results of medical and creative selection."" Training will begin in June. ""They will have to go through, among other things, tests on a centrifuge, a vibration stand, to make introductory and training flights on an airplane in zero gravity, to undergo parachute training,"" Roscosmos said. The training and the flight will be covered by Russia's Channel One television network. In a related development, Roscosmos and Space Adventures, a company that brokers commercial flights to the space station, announced that Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and a production assistant, Yozo Hirano, will launch aboard another Soyuz Dec. 8. Maezawa, founder of ZoZotown, one of Japan's largest retail websites, also has chartered an eventual flight around the moon aboard a SpaceX Starship rocket. The two 12-day Soyuz flights were expected, but Thursday's announcement makes it official, meaning NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who launched to the station last month with two Russian cosmonauts, will remain in orbit for nearly a full year before another seat is available to bring him back to Earth. He knew when he launched April 9 that his planned six-month mission could be extended if Roscosmos approved the launch of an actress and director in September. But he said he was prepared for a longer stay. ""We try to make sure we're ready for anything,"" he told CBS News before takeoff. ""I certainly feel emotionally prepared. ... I'm going to try to really be meditative about the time, try to focus on positive things. I think you could end up in a tough spot if you don't recognize that it's a challenging environment."" Former astronaut Scott Kelly holds the record for the longest U.S. spaceflight, logging 340 days aboard the space station in 2015-16. If Vande Hei returns next March 28 aboard the next available Soyuz as expected, he will set a new NASA record, spending 353 days in orbit. Vande Hei is not the only station crew member getting a mission extension. Cosmonaut Pyotr Dubrov, who launched with Vande Hei and Oleg Novitskiy, will remain aboard the outpost when Novitskiy departs Oct. 17 with Peresild and Shipenko. Dubrov also will log 353 days in space before returning to Earth with Vande Hei and Shkaplerov next March. The upcoming Soyuz launches, along with two SpaceX Crew Dragon flights carrying all-civilian crews, are the latest milestones in a new era of commercial human spaceflight. If the current launch schedule holds up, 12 non-government space flyers will reach orbit over the next seven months along with 12 professionals — six representing NASA, the European Space Agency and Roscosmos and six making up the first two crews to visit the core module of China's new Tianhe space station. SpaceX plans to launch four civilians to low-Earth orbit aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft in September in a mission, dubbed Inspiration4, to benefit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. That flight, chartered by billionaire Jared Isaacman, will not visit the space station. But in January, Houston-based Axiom Space plans to launch four private citizens to the lab complex aboard another Crew Dragon, the first commercial flight to the outpost by an all-civilian crew. In addition, Blue Origin, owned by Amazon-founder Jeff Bezos, plans to launch a non-government crew on a sub-orbital space flight July 20, the company's first piloted launch of its New Shepard rocket and spacecraft. Additional up-and-down flights to space are planned before the end of the year. Virgin Galactic, owned by Richard Branson, also is gearing up to begin piloted sub-orbital spaceflights. Both companies plan to launch ""space tourists"" as well as government-sponsored crew members and microgravity payloads. ""This truly is a renaissance in U.S. human spaceflight,"" Phil McAlister, NASA's director of commercial spaceflight development, said earlier this week during a briefing about the Axiom mission. ""I think that's the perfect word for what we're experiencing. ""This is a real inflection point, I think, with human spaceflight. I'm very bullish on the tourism market and the tourism activity, I think more people are going to fly, they're going to want to do more things in space. The more things they want to do, that will attract more people. ... It's just what we envisioned for the Commercial Crew Program when we embarked on that about 10 years ago.""",3,7.290894549166027,6.171768179462623,1.1191263697034044,3
2021-05-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-defense-live-stream-2021-05-13/,Biden urges calm as Colonial Pipeline comes back online,"Washington — President Biden said on Thursday that Americans should soon begin to see the effects of the Colonial Pipeline coming back online, as the company restarts operations after a cyberattack forced its systems offline last week. The halt in pipeline operations has left many gas stations without gas in the Southeast, and often long lines in the stations that do have gas. ""They should be reaching full operational capacity as we speak, as I speak to you right now. That is good news,"" the president said. ""But I want to be clear. You will not feel the affects at the pump immediately. This is not like flicking on a light switch."" Mr. Biden noted that there are 5,000 miles of pipeline to bring back online, and said a return to normalcy could stretch into next week. He urged Americans not to panic, acknowledging that it's stressful to see gas stations without gasoline. He also urged gas stations not to gouge prices. ""Do not get more gas than you need in the next few days,"" Mr. Biden said. ""As I said, we expect the situation to begin to improve by the weekend and into early next week, and gasoline supply is getting back online, and panic buying will only slow the process."" The ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, which was announced by the company on Friday, is the latest cybersecurity crisis confronting the Biden administration, following a sweeping cyber espionage campaign attributed to Russia that impacted nine federal agencies and 100 private companies, as well as a Chinese-linked Microsoft Exchange breach that affected scores of businesses nationwide. Mr. Biden said there's no evidence that the Russian government was involved in the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, although U.S. intelligence points to the hackers living in Russia. That comment was met with immediate criticism from Russia hawks. Asked if he's confident Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn't involved, the president responded: ""I am confident that I've read the report of the FBI accurately. And they say they were not, he was not, the government was not."" The FBI on Monday identified the criminal gang known as DarkSide as behind the attack. Mr. Biden said he is not ruling out retaliatory cyberattacks to shut down the perpetrators of the Colonial Pipeline attack. The president declined to comment Thursday on a report from Bloomberg that Colonial Pipeline paid the hackers a $5 million ransom. White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated at the White House press briefing that ""it continues to be the position of the federal government, the FBI, that it is not in the interests of the private sector for companies to pay ransom because it incentivizes these actions."" In the face of the growing cyber threat, Mr. Biden took unilateral action Wednesday with an executive order aimed at shoring up the federal government's cybersecurity defenses. While the order does not address critical infrastructure, it calls for the Commerce Department to craft new standards for software vendors working with the federal government and establishes a ""Cybersecurity Safety Review Board,"" composed of people from the public and private sectors. The ransomware attack that hit Colonial Pipeline forced the company to shut down all 5,500 miles of its pipeline, which supplies 45% of the East Coast's fuel. While the Biden administration eased regulations to avoid fuel supply disruptions as part of an ""all-hands on deck"" approach, the cyberattack still led to long gas lines as residents feared fuel shortages. Numerous agencies across the federal government, including the Departments of Transportation and Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency, took steps to boost the gas supply in affected states. On Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas approved a temporary waiver to the Jones Act to an individual company to ease oil supply constraints related to the Colonial Pipeline incident. After Colonial Pipeline announced Wednesday evening it initiated a restart of pipeline operations, Psaki said in a statement that ""there's an end in sight."" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm tweeted Thursday morning that the restart of the pipeline ""went well,"" and predicted a return to normalcy by the end of the weekend, while the company said it has ""made substantial progress"" in restarting its pipeline system. ""This is a whole of government response to get more fuel more quickly to where it's needed and to limit the pain being felt by American customers,"" Mr. Biden said.",3,6.691788983691351,0.2698739277932502,6.4219150558981015,7
2021-05-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/dfw/news/colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-service-weekend-oil-prices/,After Cyberattack Pipeline Officials Hope To Have Service Back By The Weekend -- But Oil Prices Fall,"WASHINGTON (CBSDFW.COM/AP) — The operator of a major U.S. fuel pipeline -- that runs from Texas to the northeast -- said it hopes to have services mostly restored by the end of the week after a massive cyberattack. The FBI and administration officials have identified the culprits as a gang of criminal hackers. U.S. officials sought to soothe concerns about price spikes or damage to the economy by stressing that the fuel supply had so far not experienced widespread disruptions, and the company said Monday that it was working toward ""substantially restoring operational service"" by the weekend. The White House said in a statement late Monday that it was monitoring supply shortages in parts of the Southeast and that President Joe Biden had directed federal agencies to bring their resources to bear. Colonial Pipeline halted operations last week after revealing a ransomware attack that it said had affected some of its systems. Nonetheless, the attack underscored the vulnerabilities of the nation's energy sector and other critical industries whose infrastructure is largely privately owned. Ransomware attacks are typically carried out by criminal hackers who scramble data, paralyzing victim networks, and demand large payments to decrypt it. The Colonial attack was a potent reminder of the real-world implications of the burgeoning threat. Even as the Biden administration works to confront organized hacking campaigns sponsored by foreign governments, it must still contend with difficult-to-prevent attacks from cybercriminals. ""We need to invest to safeguard our critical infrastructure,"" Biden said Monday. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the attack ""tells you how utterly vulnerable we are"" to cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure. The attack came as the administration, still grappling with its response to massive breaches by Russia of federal agencies and private corporations, works on an executive order aimed at bolstering cybersecurity defenses. The Justice Department, meanwhile, has formed a ransomware task force designed for situations just like Colonial Pipeline, and the Energy Department on April 20 announced a 100-day initiative focused on protecting energy infrastructure from cyber threats. Similar actions are planned for other critical industries, such as water and natural gas. Despite that, the challenge facing the government and the private sector remains immense. In this case, the FBI publicly assigned blame Monday by saying the criminal syndicate whose ransomware was used in the attack is named DarkSide. The group's members are Russian speakers, and the syndicate's malware is coded not to attack networks using Russian-language keyboards. Russia, however, denied any involvement in the attack. Anne Neuberger, the White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said at a briefing that the group has been on the FBI's radar for months. She said its business model is to demand ransom payments from victims and then split the proceeds with the ransomware developers, relying on what she said was a ""new and very troubling variant."" She declined to say if Colonial Pipeline had paid any ransom, and the company has not given any indication of that one way or the other. Though the FBI has historically discouraged victims from making payments for fear of promoting additional attacks, she acknowledged ""the very difficult"" situation that victims face and said the administration needs to look ""thoughtfully at this area"" of how best to deter ransomware. ""Given the rise in ransomware, that is one area we're definitely looking at now to say, 'What should be the government's approach to ransomware actors and to ransoms overall?'"" Speaking later in the day at a conference on national security, Neuberger said the administration was committed to leveraging the government's massive buying power to ensure that software makers make their products less vulnerable to hackers. ""Security can't be an afterthought,"" Neuberger said. ""We don't buy a car and only then decide if we want to pay for seatbelts and airbags."" The U.S. sanctioned the Kremlin last month for a hack of federal government agencies, known as the SolarWinds breach, that officials have linked to a Russian intelligence unit and characterized as an intelligence-gathering operation. In this case, though, the hackers are not known to be working at the behest of any foreign government. The group posted a statement on its dark web site describing itself as apolitical. ""Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society,"" DarkSide said. Asked Monday whether Russia was involved, Biden said, """"I'm going to be meeting with President (Vladimir) Putin, and so far there is no evidence based on, from our intelligence people, that Russia is involved, although there is evidence that the actors, ransomware, is in Russia. ""They have some responsibility to deal with this,"" he added. The Kremlin on Tuesday rejected any suggestion it was involved in the attack. ""Russia has nothing to do with these hacking attacks. Russia didn't have anything to do with hacking attacks that had taken place earlier,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said during a conference call with reporters. ""We categorically don't accept any accusations against us in this regard."" U.S. officials have sought to head off anxieties about the prospect of a lingering economic impact and disruption to the fuel supply, especially given Colonial Pipeline's key role in transporting gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and other petroleum products between Texas and the East Coast. Colonial is restarting portions of its network. It said Monday that it was evaluating the product inventory in storage tanks at its facilities. Administration officials stressed that Colonial proactively took some of its systems offline to prevent the ransomware from migrating from business computer systems to those that control and operate the pipeline. In response to the attack, the administration loosened regulations for the transport of petroleum products on highways as part of an ""all-hands-on-deck"" effort to avoid disruptions in the fuel supply. ""The time of the outage is now approaching critical levels and if it continues to remain down we do expect an increase in East Coast gasoline and diesel prices,"" said Debnil Chowdhury, IHS Markit Executive Director. The last time there was an outage of this magnitude was in 2016, he said, when gas prices rose 15 to 20 cents per gallon. The Northeast had significantly more local refining capacity at that time. The pipeline utilizes both common and custom technology systems, which could complicate efforts to bring the entire network back online, according to analysts at Third Bridge. Granholm, the Energy secretary, said ""Cyber attacks on our critical infrastructure — especially energy infrastructure — is not going away."" ""This is a serious example of what we're seeing across the board in many places and it tells you that we need to invest in our systems, our transmission grid for electricity. We need to invest in cyber defense in these energy systems,"" she told Bloomberg TV. The attack has not affected the supply of gasoline, she said, ""but if it goes on too long, of course that will change.″ Gasoline futures ticked higher Monday. Futures for crude and fuel, prices that traders pay for contracts for delivery in the future, typically begin to rise anyway each year as the driving season approaches. The price you pay at the pump tends to follow. The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline has jumped 6 cents over the past two weeks, to $3.02 per gallon, which is $1.05 higher than a year ago. The year-ago numbers are skewed somewhat because the nation was going into lockdown due to the pandemic. The attack on the Colonial Pipeline could exacerbate the upward pressure on prices if it is unresolved for a period of time. (© Copyright 2021 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

2021-05-11,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-kemp-suspends-gas-tax/,Colonial Pipeline Cyberattack: Gov. Kemp Temporarily Suspends Gas Tax,"ATLANTA, Ga. (CW69 News at 10/CNN) – Following a ransomware attack that took a major east coast pipeline that runs through Atlanta offline, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed an executive order temporarily suspending the state gas tax. A top federal energy regulator is calling on energy CEOs to step up their cyber defenses. Considering the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed an executive order temporarily suspending the gas tax in Georgia. Kemp said, ""Unfortunately, extensive media coverage has caused people to panic which has resulted in higher gas prices. We are taking action to relieve some of the cost burden from Georgians as Colonial recovers by suspending fuel taxes, increasing the weight limit for supply trucks, and prohibiting price gouging."" ""This is a real wake up call,"" Neil Chatterjee, a commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, told CNN Business in an exclusive interview Monday. Alpharetta based Colonial Pipeline, which delivers nearly half of the diesel and gasoline consumed on the East Coast, shut down Friday following the cyberattack. The supply disruption is raising the specter of $3 a gallon gasoline in the United States for the first time since 2014. ""Every CEO in the energy sector — and especially pipeline CEOs — should immediately convene their incident management teams to do a deep dive review of their security posture and protocols,"" Chatterjee said. The incident underscores just how vulnerable the nation's critical infrastructure is to cyberattacks. ""These pipelines are now, in many ways, on the frontlines of our national defense,"" said Chatterjee, a Republican who previously chaired FERC, which regulates the power grid and evaluates pipeline applications. (The Transportation Safety Administration regulates pipeline safety.) 'Red alert' for Washington A criminal group originating from Russia named ""DarkSide"" is believed to be responsible for the attack on the Colonial Pipeline, the largest refined products pipeline in the United States. The FBI confirmed Monday that DarkSide ransomware was used in the attack. ""The United States government at its highest levels needs to be firm and clear that we will not tolerate nation states like Russia harboring ransomware teams. And we will defend our national interests,"" Chatterjee said. Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments, said the latest hack should be a ""red alert"" for the White House following years of hackers blackmailing local governments, businesses, and hospitals. ""This lucrative enterprise has emboldened criminals, but the response from Washington has been glacial, even as far more sophisticated hacks increase from countries like Russia and China,"" Valliere wrote in a note to clients Monday. The White House formed an inter-agency working group over the weekend to discuss scenarios and plan for next steps. A person familiar with the matter told CNN's Kevin Liptak that the Biden administration is finalizing an executive order to better respond and defend against major cyberattacks. Prolonged shutdown could cause 'widespread' fuel shortages It would be hard to find a larger target than the Colonial Pipeline, which transports more than 100 million gallons of fuel daily from the US Gulf Coast to the East Coast. ""I can't emphasize enough how critical it is,"" Chatterjee said of the pipeline. The worry is that a prolonged shutdown will leave drivers and airports without the fuel they need — just as the US economy reopens from the pandemic. ""Depending on the duration, the supply shock could leave the region with widespread fuel shortages,"" Michael Tran, RBC Capital's director of global energy strategy, wrote in a note to clients. That would be on top of various shortages impacting the US economy, including computer chips, steel, lumber and even workers. The Colonial Pipeline Company, a privately held firm based in Alpharetta, Georgia, said Sunday it is developing a system restart plan. The company said its four main pipelines remain offline, but some smaller ones between terminals and delivery points are now operational. ""Our primary focus continues to be the safe and efficient restoration of service to our pipeline system, while minimizing disruption to our customers and all those who rely on Colonial Pipeline,"" the company said in a statement. The White House said Monday there are no issues with fuel supply, and the Biden administration is working closely with Colonial Pipeline to mitigate the effects of the ransomware attack and subsequent shutdown of the pipeline. Ready for the next attack? The attack is just the latest surprise event to disrupt a key part of the world's energy infrastructure. In 2019, an attack on Saudi Aramco caused a severe outage that briefly sent oil prices skyrocketing. Earlier this year, a deadly blackout gripped Texas after freezing temperatures knocked offline natural gas, coal and wind facilities. The Colonial Pipeline shutdown also raises questions about the cyber preparedness of the facility and the energy industry at large. The pipeline, whose owners include Royal Dutch Shell and Koch Industries, said it ""proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat"" and immediately hired third-party cyber experts to launch an investigation. ""They worked quickly to try and maintain operational security,"" Chatterjee said. ""But clearly the fact that such a critical pipeline has come offline is of concern to everyone."" Asked if the federal government is doing enough to protect against cyber threats, Chatterjee said, ""We can always do better."" And he emphasized that the standards set by regulators need to be the floor, not the ceiling, when it comes to cyber defenses. ""Our adversaries are sophisticated and are consistently evolving and continually evolving their tactics and methods and approaches,"" Chatterjee said. ""And we need to do the same."" ©2021 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved. CNN contributed to the story.",3,0.7311014495135146,4.8430361496878644,-4.11193470017435,7

The press service of the President of Tatarstan, of which Kazan is the capital, confirmed that at least four male and three female students, one female teacher and one other woman were killed. The regional president's office said 20 people were injured, most of them students. ""The terrorist has been arrested, (he is) 19 years old. A firearm is registered in his name,"" Tatarstan governor Rustam Minnikhanov told reporters after visiting the scene. ""Other accomplices haven't been established, an investigation is underway.""

Video posted to social media during the attack showed at least two people falling or jumping from a third-floor window of the School No. 175 building, which was said to have about 700 students in attendance on Tuesday when the shooting started.

After watching the drills, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared the maneuvers over and ordered the military to pull the troops taking part in maneuvers in Crimea and western Russia back to their permanent bases. ""I consider the goals of the snap check of readiness fulfilled,"" Shoigu said. ""The troops have shown their defense capability and I decided to complete the drills in the South and Western military districts."" Shoigu said the troops should return to their bases by May 1, but he also ordered to keep the heavy weapons deployed to western Russia as part of the drills for another massive military exercise later this year. Shoigu said they should remain at the Pogorovo firing range in the southwestern Voronezh region. The sprawling range is located about 100 miles east of the border with Ukraine. The Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that came amid increasing violations of a cease-fire in Ukraine's east has raised concerns in the West, which urged the Kremlin to pull its forces back. The Russian military hasn't reported the number of additional troops that have been moved to Crimea and parts of southwestern Russia near Ukraine, and it wasn't immediately clear from Shoigu's statement if all of them will now be pulled back. The U.S. and NATO has said that the Russian buildup near Ukraine was the largest since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and threw its support behind separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry said the maneuvers in Crimea involved more than 60 ships, over 10,000 troops, around 200 aircraft and about 1,200 military vehicles. The exercise featured the landing of more than 2,000 paratroopers and 60 military vehicles on Thursday. Fighter jets covered the airborne operation. Shoigu flew in a helicopter over the Opuk firing range in Crimea to oversee the exercise. He later declared the drills over, but ordered the military to stand ready to respond to any ""adverse developments"" during NATO's Defender Europe 2021 exercise. Last week, Russia announced that it would close broad areas of the Black Sea near Crimea to foreign navy ships and state vessels until November, a move that drew Ukrainian protests and raised Western concerns. Russia also announced restrictions on flights near Crimea this week, arguing that they fully conform with the international law. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned Tuesday that the Russian buildup across the border was continuing and ""expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops"" in about a week. He urged the West to beef up sanctions against Moscow. Moscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the buildup, arguing that it's free to deploy its forces anywhere on Russian territory and insisting they don't threaten anyone. But at the same time, the Kremlin sternly warned Ukrainian authorities against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel east, where seven years of fighting have killed more than 14,000, saying that Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region. Amid the tensions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday signed a law allowing the call-up of reservists for military service without announcing a mobilization. The new law will allow to quickly equip the military with reservists, ""significantly increasing their combat effectiveness during military aggression,"" Zelenskyy's office said in a statement.",29,4.801621269778579,0.5236303450819827,4.277990924696597,21

In a clear sign of cooling relations, the United States' ambassador in Moscow confirmed he was leaving the country for ""consultations"" back in the U.S. Over 20 Russian vessels took part in the latest exercises along with Su-25SM3 attack aircraft, as part of a check of the fleet's forces, Russia's Black Sea Fleet said on Tuesday. Russia also announced that it was closing the airspace over parts of Crimea and the Black Sea, saying the areas had been ""declared temporarily dangerous for aircraft flights,"" Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday, citing an official notice sent to pilots. Over 100,000 Russian forces have massed on Ukraine's border and in Crimea, the office of European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said after a briefing by Ukraine's foreign minister. Crimea is the peninsula that was unilaterally annexed away from Ukraine by President Vladimir Putin in 2014. His government now considers it Russian territory, and while the U.S. and Europe have refused to acknowledge the takeover, the Russian military has firm control over the outcrop of land in the Black Sea. ""It's the highest military deployment of Russian army in Ukrainian borders ever,"" said Borrell. He initially said Russia had massed over 150,000 troops in the region, but his comments were later corrected without elaboration. The Maxar satellite imagery company provided almost a dozen images on Tuesday that it said showed increased movements and an influx of Russian military hardware at numerous locations in Crimea, Ukraine, and near the shared border over the past several weeks. The buildup has come amid a spike in hostilities in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been locked in a simmering war with Ukraine's U.S. and European-backed military since 2014. The increase in the violence in eastern Ukraine has raised fears internationally of a possible flareup in the so-called frozen conflict. While U.S. military officials haven't seen anything yet to suggest Russia is gearing up for an imminent cross-border incursion into Ukraine, the United States, the U.K. and European states have criticized Moscow for the military buildup. The Kremlin has shrugged off all calls to withdraw the troops and hardware, saying Russian forces are free to move about Russian territory as they see fit, and to respond to what Moscow calls ""provocative"" moves by the NATO alliance near its borders. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that Moscow was not responsible for the soaring tension. He called on other countries to refrain from ""mass anti-Russian psychosis."" Last week, Russia's Defense Ministry said it had closed off navigation in parts of the Black Sea to foreign military and other official vessels from mid-April until the end of October. The move was condemned by the West. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price called it ""yet another unprovoked escalation in Moscow's ongoing campaign to undermine and destabilize Ukraine,"" and ""particularly troubling amid credible reports of Russian troop buildup in occupied Crimea and around Ukraine's borders."" Two British warships were to set sail for the Black Sea in May, The Sunday Times newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing senior U.K. naval sources. The deployment is meant to show solidarity with Ukraine and Britain's NATO allies, the newspaper reported. According to the report, one Type 45 destroyer armed with anti-aircraft missiles and an anti-submarine Type 23 frigate will detach from the Royal Navy's carrier task group in the Mediterranean and sail through the Bosphorus into the Black Sea. RAF F-35B Lightning stealth jets and Merlin submarine-hunting helicopters will stand ready on the task group's flagship, the carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, the newspaper said. Turkey's government announced last week that the U.S. was planning to deploy two warships to the Black Sea, but then later said the Pentagon had cancelled the deployment. U.S. officials never confirmed nor denied that the deployment had been ordered, but a Pentagon spokesman noted that U.S. vessels have operated previously in the international waters of the Black Sea. U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan said he would travel back to Washington this week for consultations after Russia's Foreign Ministry suggested he do so amid a diplomatic crisis between the two countries. ""I believe it is important for me to speak directly with my new colleagues in the Biden administration in Washington about the current state of bilateral relations between the United States and Russia,"" he said in remarks published by the embassy in Moscow. Sullivan, a Trump appointee, said he intended to come back to Moscow in the coming weeks, before any meeting between Presidents Biden and Putin. His departure follows Russia's response to the latest round of U.S. sanctions, announced last week, which included the expulsion of 10 American diplomats from Russia and a ban on the U.S. Embassy hiring any Russian nationals as staff. Russia's Ambassador to the U.S. has been back in Moscow for a month, after being recalled by the Foreign Ministry for consultations.",29,0.9092192832224938,0.5509060260052401,0.3583132572172537,21
2021-04-14,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-united-states-standoff-fears/,"Russia warns U.S. to stay away for its ""own good"" as Ukraine standoff intensifies","Moscow — Russia warned the United States on Tuesday against sending warships to the Black Sea, urging American forces to stay away from the annexed Crimean peninsula ""for their own good"" as the situation along Ukraine's border caused increasing concern in the West. The U.S. Secretary of State, meeting with Ukrainian and NATO officials in Brussels, made it clear that the Biden administration, along with its allies in Europe, has Ukraine's back and considers Russia's ongoing military buildup in the region ""very provocative."" The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Friday that Washington had informed Ankara that two U.S. warships would pass through Turkish waters this week to be deployed in the Black Sea. The deployment would come amid a significant escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine's forces, which have U.S. and European support. Hostilities first flared in 2014 when Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea — a peninsula that sticks out into the Black Sea and is home to a Russian navy base — away from Ukraine, drawing condemnation from the Western world and a series of sanctions. Russian Deputy Foreign Ministry Sergei Ryabkov was cited by Russian news agencies on Tuesday as calling the deployment of U.S. warships in the Black Sea a provocation designed to test Russia's nerves. ""There is absolutely nothing for American ships to be doing near our shores,"" Ryabkov said, warning there was a very high risk of unspecified incidents if U.S. military hardware were to be positioned in the Black Sea. ""We warn the United States that it will be better for them to stay far away from Crimea and our Black Sea coast,"" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. ""It will be for their own good."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby declined during a regular press briefing on Friday to confirm the Turkish government's statement that U.S. warships were being sent to the Black Sea. He noted that the U.S. ""routinely"" operates in the Black Sea, but said he wouldn't ""speak to operations."" The current escalation has added strain to already tense U.S.-Russian relations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Russia against aggressive actions in an interview aired over the weekend, saying any aggression in Ukraine would have consequences. Ryabkov responded on Tuesday, accusing the Russian ""adversary"" of trying to undermine Russia's position on the international stage. He reiterated Russia's readiness to defend the interests of its citizens, and ethnic Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing itself in the event any new sanctions should be imposed on Moscow by the U.S. or its global partners. Meanwhile, Russia has continued to move forces into both Crimea and the region along its border with Ukraine. The Defense Ministry reported on Tuesday that 15 warships and vessels of the Caspian Flotilla had been sent to the Black Sea as part of previously announced military exercises. Ukraine said earlier this week that Russia had already massed more than 40,000 troops along its border, and at least 40,000 more in Crimea. Russia says the troop buildup is part of exercises, and has stressed that its forces will go where they want, when they want on Russian territory. Top U.S. officials are in Europe this week, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Blinken. Austin announced during a stop in Germany on Tuesday that the U.S. was going to deploy an additional 500 troops to that country. When asked if the move was meant as a message to Russia, he said it was ""a sign to NATO"" of the U.S. commitment to the transatlantic alliance, and of the firm commitment to Germany. Under President Donald Trump, Washington said it would withdraw thousands of the American forces who've been stationed in Germany for decades. That decision was suspended by the Biden administration, and now the force is set to grow. Blinken, meanwhile, was in Brussels, meeting NATO partners, and he met separately with his Ukrainian counterpart to discuss the standoff with Russia. ""The United States stands firmly behind the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and I'm her to reaffirm that with the foreign minister today,"" Blinken said. ""That's particularly important in a time when we're seeing, unfortunately, Russia take very provocative action when it comes to Ukraine. We're now seeing the largest concentration of Russian forces on Ukraine's border since 2014. That is a big concern not only to Ukraine, but to the United States and indeed to many of our allies and partners."" Sitting across from him, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the Russian buildup was ""taking place not only along the border of Ukraine, but along the border of the democratic world. For thousands of kilometers to the north and to the east of our border with Russia, there is no democracy. So, this is the struggle that is taking place between democracies and authoritarianism, and in this struggle the support of the United States is absolutely crucial, and deeply appreciated."" Kuleba thanked NATO, also, and said that warnings already conveyed to Moscow through diplomatic channels, ""will be supported by actions that make it very clear for Russia that the price of further aggression against Ukraine will be too heavy for it to bear."" He said the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations in Brussels, and more broadly the NATO allies at large, would continue discussing ways to ensure stability along his country's tense border with Russia. While no NATO deployments have been confirmed, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the alliance was planning to position 40,000 more troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment close to Russian territory. He didn't elaborate, but said that ""in response to the military activity of the alliance that threatens Russia, we have taken appropriate measures."" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier on Tuesday that he was ""seriously concerned"" by Russia's deployment of additional forces to the Ukrainian border. ""Russia is now trying to reestablish some kind of sphere of influence where they try to decide what neighbors can do,"" Stoltenberg said.

Moscow denied receiving any request from Kyiv for such talks. Tension between the neighbors has grown steadily for several weeks, with intensified skirmishes in eastern Ukraine — a region that has been mired in conflict since Russia first backed Ukrainian separatists there seven years ago. Putin has sent thousands of forces toward the Ukrainian border recently, raising concerns among politicians in the United States and European Union. ""The president's office, of course, made a request to speak with Vladimir Putin. We have not received an answer yet and we very much hope that this is not a refusal of dialogue,"" Ukrainian presidential spokeswoman Iuliia Mendel told Reuters on Monday. She told Russia's Interfax news agency that the request for talks was sent on March 26, after four Ukrainian servicemen were killed by shelling in the country's east. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that he ""hasn't seen any requests in the past several days."" Mendel said Russia had massed more than 40,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border, and more than 40,000 in Crimea, the region that Putin unilaterally annexed away from Ukraine and declared Russian in 2014. Mendel said Zelenskyy would travel to Paris for talks this week on Russia's actions and the escalating conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region, Reuters reported. The current escalation is also further straining U.S.-Russian relations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned Russia against aggressive actions, accusing Putin's military of massing more forces near the Ukrainian border than at any time since 2014. ""President Biden's been very clear about this: If Russia acts recklessly or aggressively, there will be costs, there will be consequences,"" Blinken said during an interview over the weekend. The Kremlin has said that Russian and Ukrainian political advisers are working to organize a possible new round of talks under the so-called Normandy format — a multilateral dialogue that would involve the leaders of France and Germany. German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer on Monday called on Moscow to declare its intentions in the region, saying that if Putin's government ""has nothing to hide, it could easily explain why troops are being moved."" Manfred Weber, a prominent Member of the European Parliament from Germany, called Russia's troop buildup a test for the West, warning that if the situation continues to escalate, Moscow should face new sanctions. ""The answer needs to be clear and tough,"" he said. In an interview with CNN given as he visited his troops on the front line, Zelenskyy said Ukraine, ""needs more than words"" of support from Washington and other European allies as it faces off with Russia. The Kremlin has repeatedly said that Russia's military forces are free to move around within the country's territory as they see fit, and that the troop movements near the Ukrainian border — exercises, according to Moscow — pose no threat. Last week, Putin accused Ukraine of ""dangerous provocative actions"" in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Relations between Kyiv and Moscow have worsened since Putin first backed the separatists in the area and seized Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin insists its support for the separatists is limited to political and humanitarian backing, but the West has long accused Putin of sending military forces and hardware. The seven-year conflict between the pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian government has claimed more than 13,000 lives. On Sunday, the Ukrainian military reported another death — a soldier purportedly killed by artillery fire from the Russian-backed fighters. Over the weekend, Kremlin spokesman Peskov said no further peace talks could take place before conditions laid out in the Minsk peace accords were met. The Minsk accords, reached during 2015 talks in neighboring Belarus, brought an end to the worst of the hostilities in Donbas, but the full agreement has never been fully implemented.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Andrii Taran has spoken twice recently with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, most recently on Thursday, about the escalation of violence in the east of Ukraine. According to a readout issued by Ukraine's military, Austin promised his counterpart that, ""in the event of escalation of Russian aggression, the United States will not leave Ukraine alone."" The Kremlin reacted on Friday by saying that any deployment of U.S. or NATO troops to Ukraine would force Moscow to take unspecified ""extra measures"" to ensure its own security. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the situation along the so-called line of contact in eastern Ukraine, which separates the Ukrainian government forces and the Russian-backed separatists, was ""quite frightening."" Moscow has repeatedly blamed the current escalation on Ukrainian ""provocations"" in the region. When asked about the reported build-up of troops near the Ukrainian border and the Russian annexed Crimean Peninsula on Thursday, Peskov said that Russia moves its military forces within its own territory however it chooses, and ""takes measures to ensure the security of its borders."" He reiterated Russia's longstanding denials of any military involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which reached a crescendo in 2014 when President Vladimir Putin unilaterally annexed Crimea away from Ukraine, drawing condemnation and sanctions from the U.S. and Europe which remain in place today. A U.S. military official initially called the buildup of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border ""concerning"" this week, but later told CBS News national defense correspondent David Martin that it did appear to be a training exercise, albeit not exactly fitting the description of the wargames announced last month by the Russian Ministry of Defense. NATO officials also voiced concern over the sizable Russian military buildup near the border this week. Relations between Kyiv and Moscow have worsened since Putin backed the separatists in eastern Ukraine — support his government insists is only political and humanitarian — and seized control of Crimea in 2014. The military conflict between the pro-Russian rebels and Kyiv has continued simmering for seven years, claiming at least 14,000 lives since it began. In the first major flare-up in months, Ukraine said four of its soldiers were killed and two were injured a week ago by shelling in the country's east. The separatists denied responsible for the deaths. The OSCE's civilian Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine has reported hundreds of cease-fire violations in recent days. During a video conference call on Tuesday with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russia's Putin ""expressed serious concern about the escalation of armed confrontation,"" according to the Kremlin. He placed the blame squarely on Kyiv. Some analysts believe the simmering conflict was always going to ramp back up again at some point, given the lack of progress toward any peaceful, political resolution and the significant presence of weaponry and armed forces in the region. But most believe it's too soon to say how the current flareup will play out. Katharine Quinn-Judge, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, told CBS News that while ceasefire provisions laid out in July 2020 do seem to have ushered a considerable reduction in violence, that ceasefire was always destined to fray. ""This doesn't necessarily mean there will be a major escalation. Neither side wants to bear the political or economic costs this would bring,"" she said in comments emailed to CBS News from Kyiv. ""But these occasional spikes in violence... play to the interests of hardliners on all sides: They're a handy reminder that the enemy can never be trusted and that reconciliation under current circumstances is impossible."" The Minsk accords, reached during 2015 talks in neighboring Belarus, brought an end to the worst of the hostilities, but peace talks have been stalled for years, with Russia and Ukraine failing to find any common ground on which to build. Konstantin Skorkin, a contributor to the Moscow Carnegie Center, says Russia hasn't been able to get any of the concessions from Kyiv that it had hoped for when Zelenskyy came to power in 2019. Now, with the new Biden administration in Washington, Zelensky appears ever more confident that he'll have U.S. backing in his standoff with Russia. Skorkin told CBS News in a telephone interview that, in the circumstances, both sides may be deliberately inflaming the situation to ""raise stakes in the negotiations."" ""Russia demonstrates its might, while Ukraine demonstrates that it is not afraid of Russia,"" he said. But Skorkin warned that in such a tense atmosphere, with the heavy military presence, any incident could trigger an actual escalation of the armed fighting — regardless of whether either side really wants one.

But the gathering of troops comes amid heightened tension in the region, and Ukraine's Commander-In-Chief Ruslan Khomchack told his country's parliament this week that Russian forces from different regions had been assembling near the border. Russia's president has acknowledged an ""escalation of armed confrontation"" in the region. Training exercises were always a possible explanation for the buildup, but a U.S. defense official told CBS News that the locations and types of units seen on the ground didn't line up with what the Russian Ministry of Defense had announced last month. In a statement on Facebook on Wednesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that at the initiative of the U.S., chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milley, had a telephone conversation with his counterpart. ""Issues of mutual interest were discussed,"" the statement said. Ukraine and Russia have been in conflict since Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. The U.S. and its NATO allies do not recognize Russia's annexation of the peninsula, and the U.S contributes millions in both non-military and military aid each year to Ukraine. Relations between the two countries have been getting worse. Just four days ago, four Ukrainian soldiers were killed by Russian separatist shelling in eastern Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin noted the increase in violence on Tuesday, and blamed Ukrainian forces for it. An official readout from the Kremlin of a phone call that Putin had with the French and German leaders said he had, ""expressed serious concern about the escalation of armed confrontation on the contact line being provoked by Ukraine."" The U.S. Embassy in Kiev issued a statement last week calling on Russia to ""observe ceasefire measures"" and ""end daily violence that is causing senseless suffering,"" and end its aggression in Ukraine. On Monday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with the head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, and affirmed the U.S.' ongoing support for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and Euro-Atlantic aspirations in the face of continuing aggression, according to a readout from the NSC.",29,0.402319447468437,6.574281889327916,-6.171962441859479,21

The shells landed at the entrance and in the courtyard of the hospital in Atareb, a town in rural western Aleppo, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The hospital is located underground, a tactic used by the opposition to avoid targeting in the conflict-prone area. The Syrian American Medical Society, the aid group which supports the hospital, said three artillery strikes early Sunday caused extensive damage to the hospital, including destroying the orthopedic clinic and knocking out the electric generators on the roof of the hospital. ""The hospital has been evacuated for the moment,"" said Fadi Hakim, spokesman for the Syrian American Medical Society, who added that the emergency room has also sustained damage. The aid group said 17 people, including five medical staff, were injured. Four have been evacuated to Turkey for emergency treatment. Among those killed were a child and a woman, according to the Syrian Civil Defense volunteers, known as the White Helmets. A video posted on the local health directorate's Facebook page showed debris and blood stains at the entrance of the hospital. ""The medical staff was in a state of panic,"" said Omar Halaq, the director of the hospital in Atareb, also known as The Cave. Attacks on hospitals are common in the Syrian conflict, and are mostly blamed on government and its allied forces. Government forces knew about the hospital location, according to the Syrian American Medical Society, which had shared the coordinates of the hospital through the United Nations notification system, said partner aid organization, the International Rescue Committee. ""Health facilities are protected under international law and should be safe havens in times of crisis, but after 10 years of war this is not the case in Syria,"" said Rehana Zawar, IRC Country Director for northwest Syria. This is the 5th attack on health care recorded this year, IRC said, adding that facilities it supports have been attacked 24 times since 2018 alone. The U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights has documented 598 attacks on at least 350 separate health care facilities in Syria since March 2011, the vast majority of them allegedly committed by the Syrian government and allied forces, including Russia. In the same 10-year period, at least 930 medical personnel were killed, the rights group said.

2021-02-24,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/william-burns-cia-director-hearing-watch-live-stream-today-02-24-2021/,"William Burns, Biden's CIA pick, vows ""intensified focus"" on competition with China","Washington — Ambassador William Burns, President Biden's nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, vowed on Wednesday to boost efforts to collect intelligence on China and to approach competition with Beijing with ""intensified focus and energy."" A career diplomat, Burns appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for his confirmation hearing, where he earned bipartisan praise for his decades of public service and widespread support for his nomination to lead the spy agency. ""There will be areas in which it will be in our mutual self-interest to work with China,"" Burns said in his opening remarks before the panel, but said ""predatory Chinese leadership"" nonetheless posed the ""biggest geopolitical test"" faced by the United States. Burns said, if confirmed, he would implement a ""whole-of-agency approach to the operational and analytical challenges of this crucial threat,"" including by increasing the number of China specialists and Mandarin speakers at the CIA. He also cited lingering threats from the likes of Russia, North Korea and Iran, whose hostile behaviors Burns said would continue, in ways both ""familiar"" and unpredictable. ""Most of my white hair came from serving in Russia over the years,"" said Burns, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008 and dealt personally with its current president, Vladimir Putin. Under Putin, Burns said, Russia will continue to be ""at least as disruptive"" as China. Burns also fielded questions about the recent SolarWinds cyberattack on federal agencies and private sector companies, which the Biden administration has blamed on Russia. Burns called the intrusion a ""harsh wake-up call"" and said the U.S. must shore up crucial infrastructure to prevent and deter breaches. ""I think it's essential for the CIA in particular to work even harder to develop our capabilities to help detect these kinds of attacks when they come from external players, from foreign players, which is the responsibility of the CIA,"" Burns said, adding that the U.S. should ""develop our own technological and cyber capabilities"" to deter future attacks. ""Over time, I've been convinced, [we should] work with like-minded countries, allies and partners to not only build leverage, but to build rules of the road that help protect critical infrastructure, that help make clear international understandings that certain kinds of critical infrastructure are off-limits for those kinds of cyberattacks,"" Burns continued. ""That'll take time. That'll take enormous effort. But I think the CIA and intelligence will be an important part of that effort."" In response to concerns raised by multiple lawmakers of both parties, Burns also promised to ""get to the bottom"" of mysterious microwave attacks that have sickened dozens of former intelligence officers and diplomats since 2016. He repeatedly pledged to ensure agency employees and their families who were injured in the microwave attacks would get ""the care that they deserve"" from the National Institutes of Health and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. ""If I'm confirmed as director of CIA, I will have no higher priority than taking care of people, of colleagues and their families. And I do commit to you that if I'm confirmed, I will make it an extraordinarily high priority to get to the bottom of who's responsible for the attacks,"" Burns said. In 2016 and 2017, dozens of Americans who had worked in diplomatic facilities in China and Cuba came down with serious brain injuries, suffering what came to be known as ""Havana syndrome."" At least 40 Americans, including diplomats and CIA spies, came down with neurologic symptoms including memory loss, impaired vision and loss of balance. A U.S. government report issued in December 2020 found that ""Havana syndrome"" was likely caused by a form of targeted microwave energy, but the origin of the attack is still unknown. Former officers have said they suspect Russia is behind the attacks. ""It was very encouraging, and frankly pretty emotional to me personally, that Bill Burns pledged to Senators Rubio, Warner and Collins that he would absolutely ensure proper medical care at Walter Reed for our officers who are [traumatic brain injury] victims,"" said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA officer who began suffering debilitating symptoms after a trip to Moscow in 2017. He has struggled to receive medical care since then. At the beginning of the hearing, Burns was introduced by former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Leon Panetta, who served during the Obama and Clinton administrations, and former Secretary of State James Baker, who served during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. Panetta and Baker both praised Burns' long record of public service and urged senators to confirm him. Baker called Burns ""one of the finest and most intelligent American diplomats that I had the pleasure of working with."" His confirmation, Baker said, should be a ""bipartisan no-brainer."" Members of the committee near-uniformly praised Burns for his diplomatic accomplishments, and many posed questions that probed his knowledge of foreign policy rather than intelligence matters. Burns spent over three decades at the State Department, where he served as deputy secretary of state from 2011 to 2014. He has since retired from government and has been serving as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. If confirmed, he will be the first career diplomat to lead the CIA, though he served as ambassador in significant overseas posts — including Moscow and Amman — where the agency maintains a robust presence. He was also among the small group of U.S. officials tasked by former President Barack Obama to lead secret discussions with Iran about a potential nuclear deal beginning in 2013, though he left government before the final agreement was struck two years later, in 2015. The Biden administration has made several overtures to Tehran in an effort to restart talks on the nuclear deal, most of which have been publicly rebuffed. Burns' extensive overseas experience and contacts, alongside his reputation as a serious statesman, have made his nomination a welcome one to current and former intelligence officials. ""Bill Burns will make a terrific DCIA. He has been a consumer of intelligence for years, and he has worked closely with CIA officers both in Washington and overseas,"" said Michael Morell, former CIA acting director and CBS News Senior National Security contributor. ""Most important, his humanity and care for people will win over the organization."" Morell was himself considered a top candidate for the directorship but withdrew his candidacy after several Democratic senators indicated they would oppose his nomination over past comments he made about CIA's enhanced interrogation program. During the Trump administration, the agency was thrust repeatedly into an uncomfortable spotlight by the president himself, who complained frequently about what he termed a ""Deep State"" of operatives bent on undermining his administration. Burns' immediate predecessor, Gina Haspel, largely avoided public appearances throughout her tenure. At the hearing, Burns committed to keeping politics out of intelligence — something he said Mr. Biden had personally demanded. ""He said he wants the agency to give it to him straight,"" Burns said, ""and I pledged to do just that, and to defend those who do the same."" Burns, who has already held five Senate-confirmed positions, is expected to be confirmed on a bipartisan basis for a sixth time.",3,3.9466260120926786,2.292436815146201,1.6541891969464775,24
2021-02-15,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/solarwinds-hack-russia-cyberattack-60-minutes-2021-02-14/,"SolarWinds: How Russian spies hacked the Justice, State, Treasury, Energy and Commerce Departments","President Biden inherited a lot of intractable problems, but perhaps none is as disruptive as the cyber war between the United States and Russia simmering largely under the radar. Last March, with the coronavirus spreading uncontrollably across the United States, Russian cyber soldiers released their own contagion by sabotaging a tiny piece of computer code buried in a popular piece of software called ""SolarWinds."" The hidden virus spread to 18,000 government and private computer networks by way of one of those software updates we all take for granted. The attack was unprecedented in audacity and scope. Russian spies went rummaging through the digital files of the U.S. departments of Justice, State, Treasury, Energy, and Commerce and for nine months had unfettered access to top-level communications, court documents, even nuclear secrets. And by all accounts, it's still going on. Brad Smith: I think from a software engineering perspective, it's probably fair to say that this is the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen. Brad Smith is president of Microsoft. He learned about the hack after the presidential election this past November. By that time, the stealthy intruders had spread throughout the tech giants' computer network and stolen some of its proprietary source code used to build its software products. More alarming: how the hackers got in… piggy-backing on a piece of third party software used to connect, manage and monitor computer networks. Bill Whitaker: What makes this so momentous? Brad Smith: One of the really disconcerting aspects of this attack was the widespread and indiscriminate nature of it. What this attacker did was identify network management software from a company called SolarWinds. They installed malware into an update for a SolarWinds product. When that update went out to 18,000 organizations around the world, so did this malware. ""SolarWinds Orion"" is one of the most ubiquitous software products you probably never heard of, but to thousands of I.T. departments worldwide, it's indispensable. It's made up of millions of lines of computer code. 4,032 of them were clandestinely re-written and distributed to customers in a routine update, opening up a secret backdoor to the 18,000 infected networks. Microsoft has assigned 500 engineers to dig in to the attack. One compared it to a Rembrandt painting, the closer they looked, the more details emerged. Brad Smith: When we analyzed everything that we saw at Microsoft, we asked ourselves how many engineers have probably worked on these attacks. And the answer we came to was, well, certainly more than 1,000. Bill Whitaker: You guys are Microsoft. How did Microsoft miss this? Brad Smith: I think that when you look at the sophistication of this attacker there's an asymmetric advantage for somebody playing offense. Bill Whitaker: Is it still going on? Brad Smith: Almost certainly, these attacks are continuing. The world still might not know about the hack if not for FireEye, a three-and-a-half billion dollar cybersecurity company run by Kevin Mandia, a former Air Force intelligence officer. Kevin Mandia: I can tell you this, if we didn't do investigations for a living, we wouldn't have found this. It takes a very special skill set to reverse engineer a whole platform that's written by bad guys to never be found. FireEye's core mission is to hunt, find, and expel cyber intruders from the computer networks of their clients - mostly governments and major companies. But FireEye used SolarWinds software, which turned the cyber hunter into the prey. This past November, one alert FireEye employee noticed something amiss. Kevin Mandia: Just like everybody working from home, we have two-factor authentication. A code pops up on our phone. We have to type in that code. And then we can log in. A FireEye employee was logging in, but the difference was our security staff looked at the login and we noticed that individual had two phones registered to their name. So our security employee called that person up and we asked, ""Hey, did you actually register a second device on our network?"" And our employee said, ""No. It wasn't, it wasn't me."" Suspicious, FireEye turned its gaze inward, and saw intruders impersonating its employees snooping around inside their network, stealing FireEye's proprietary tools to test its clients defenses and intelligence reports on active cyber threats. The hackers left no evidence of how they broke in – no phishing expeditions, no malware. Bill Whitaker: So how did you trace this back to SolarWinds software? Kevin Mandia: It was not easy. We took a lotta people and said, ""Turn every rock over. Look in every machine and find any trace of suspicious activity."" What kept coming back was the earliest evidence of compromise is the SolarWinds system. We finally decided: Tear the thing apart. They discovered the malware inside SolarWinds and on December 13 informed the world of the brazen attack. Much of the damage had already been done. The U.S. Justice Department acknowledged the Russians spent months inside their computers accessing email traffic – but the department won't tell us exactly what was taken. It's the same at Treasury, Commerce, the NIH, Energy. Even the agency that protects and transports our nuclear arsenal. The hackers also hit the biggest names in high tech. Bill Whitaker: So, what does that target list tell you? Brad Smith: I think this target list tells us that this is clearly a foreign intelligence agency. It exposes the secrets potentially of the United States and other governments as well as private companies. I don't think anyone knows for certain how all of this information will be used. But we do know this: It is in the wrong hands. And Microsoft's Brad Smith told us it's almost certain the hackers created additional backdoors and spread to other networks. The revelation this past December came at a fraught time in the U.S. President Trump was disputing the election, and tweeted China might be responsible for the hack. Within hours he was contradicted by his own secretary of state and attorney general. They blamed Russia. The Department of Homeland Security, FBI and intelligence agencies concurred. The prime suspect: the SVR, one of several Russian spy agencies the U.S. labels ""advanced persistent threats."" Russia denies it was involved. Brad Smith: I do think this was an act of recklessness. The world runs on software. It runs on information technology. But it can't run with confidence if major governments are disrupting and attacking the software supply chain in this way. Bill Whitaker: That almost sounds like you think that they went in to foment chaos? Brad Smith: What we are seeing is the first use of this supply chain disruption tactic against the United States. But it's not the first time we've witnessed it. The Russian government really developed this tactic in Ukraine. For years the Russians have tested their cyber weapons on Ukraine. NotPetya, a 2017 attack by the GRU, Russia's military spy agency, used the same tactics as the SolarWinds attack, sabotaging a widely-used piece of software to break into thousands of Ukraine's networks, but instead of spying - it ordered devices to self-destruct. Brad Smith: It literally damaged more than 10% of that nation's computers in a single day. The television stations couldn't produce their shows because they relied on computers. Automated teller machines stopped working. Grocery stores couldn't take a credit card. Now, what we saw with this attack was something that was more targeted, but it just shows how if you engage in this kind of tactic, you can unleash an enormous amount of damage and havoc. Bill Whitaker: It's hard to downplay the severity of this. Chris Inglis: It is hard to downplay the severity of this. Because it's only a stone's throw from a computer network attack. Chris Inglis spent 28 years commanding the nation's best cyber warriors at the National Security Agency – seven as its deputy director – and now sits on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission – created by Congress to come up with new ideas to defend our digital domain. Bill Whitaker: Why didn't the government detect this? Chris Inglis: The government is not looking on private sector networks. It doesn't surveil private sector networks. That's a responsibility that's given over to the private sector. FireEye found it on theirs, many others did not. The government did not find it on their network, so that's a disappointment. Disappointment is an understatement. The Department of Homeland Security spent billions on a program called ""Einstein"" to detect cyber attacks on government agencies. The Russians outsmarted it. They circumvented the NSA, which gathers intelligence overseas, but is prohibited from surveilling U.S. computer networks. So the Russians launched their attacks from servers set up anonymously in the United States. Bill Whitaker: This hack happened on American soil. It went through networks based in the United States. Are our defense capabilities constrained? Chris Inglis: U.S. Intelligence Community, U.S. Department of Defense, can suggest what the intentions of other nations are based upon what they learn in their rightful work overseas. But they can't turn around and focus their unblinking eye on the domestic infrastructure. That winds up making it more difficult for us. He says history shows that once inside a network, the Russians are a stubborn adversary. Chris Inglis: It's hard to kind of get something like this completely out of the system. And they certainly don't understand all the places that it's gone to, all of the manifestations of where this virus, where this software still lives. And that's gonna take some time. And the only way you'll have absolute confidence that you've gotten rid of it is to get rid of the hardware, to get rid of the systems. Bill Whitaker: Wow. So unless you get rid of all the computers and all the computer networks, you will not be sure that you have gotten this out of the systems. Chris Inglis: You will not be. Jon Miller: We've never been left with a breach like that before where we know months into it that we're only looking at the tip of the iceberg. It's not everyday you meet someone who builds cyber weapons as complex as those deployed by Russian intelligence. But Jon Miller, who started off as a hacker and now runs a company called Boldend, designs and sells cutting-edge cyber weapons to U.S. intelligence agencies. Jon Miller: I build things much more sophisticated than this. What's impressive is the scope of it. This is a watershed style attack. I would never do something like this. It creates too much damage. Miller says with the SolarWinds attack, Russia has demonstrated that none of the software we take for granted is truly safe, including the apps on our telephones, laptops, and tablets. These days, he says, any device can be sabotaged. Jon Miller: When you buy something from a tech company, a new phone or a laptop, you trust that that is secure when they give it to you. And what they've shown us in this attack is that is not the case. They have the ability to compromise those supply chains and manipulate whatever they want. Whether it's financial data, source code, the functionality of these products. They can take control. Bill Whitaker: So, for instance, they could destroy all the computers on a network? Jon Miller: Oh, easily. The malware that they deployed off of SolarWinds, it didn't have the functionality in it to do that. But to do that is trivial. Couple dozen lines of code. Bill Whitaker: And there're still some companies that don't yet know they were breached? Jon Miller: It's still ongoing. New companies are getting breached. We'll see new companies breached today that weren't breached this morning. Where it's different in a lot of ways is normally when you catch someone in the act, they stop. That's not the case with this breach. Produced by Graham Messick and Jack Weingart. Broadcast associate, Emilio Almonte.

Russia's announcement followed the United States' exit from the treaty in November, which was sharply criticized by Russian officials. The Trump administration said it pulled out of the international accord over what it said were Moscow's repeated violations of the pact. Russian officials have consistently denied violating the agreement. The Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday citing a ""lack of progress"" in efforts to negotiate with other countries to keep the treaty functional following the U.S. withdrawal. ""We state with regret that they found no support on the part of the U.S. allies,"" the ministry said. Russia says the U.S. abandoned the treaty under ""artificial pretext"" and, in the process, ""essentially destroyed the balance of interests of the State-Parties reached when the Treaty was signed."" President George H.W. Bush negotiated and signed the 1992 agreement that permitted unarmed surveillance flights over the 35 countries that signed on. Under the Open Skies Treaty, which came into force in 2002, member states were allowed to conduct aerial surveillance of each other's territory to gather information on military forces and activities. Its members still include European countries, some former Soviet republics, and Canada. After the U.S. exit, Russia proposed that NATO allies should provide guarantees that they wouldn't transfer data collected during their observational flights over Russia to the U.S., but NATO wouldn't agree to it. Now Russia is launching the necessary domestic legal procedures to withdraw from the pact. The European Union had earlier urged the U.S. to reconsider its position, and Russia to remain in the treaty. When the Trump administration announced its intention to pull out of the treaty, United Nations Spokesman Stephane Dujarric warned that ""ending such agreements without anything to replace them could result in destabilizing activities such as a dangerous new arms race, leading to possible miscalculation."" ""We reiterate our concern regarding the erosion of the U.S.-Russia arms control regime,"" Dujarric told CBS News. ""We stress that the arms control regime has provided security benefits for the entire international community by constraining strategic arms competition."" Relations between Moscow and Washington have deteriorated, reaching Cold War levels, since 2014, when Moscow unilaterally annexed Crimea from neighboring Ukraine. In 2019, the Trump administration withdrew from the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, prompting Russia to follow suit and raising fears of a new arms race. The only U.S.-Russian arms control pact still in effect is the New START treaty, which is set to expire in three weeks. President-elect Joe Biden, who will succeed Mr. Trump next week, has said he favors the renewal of New START, but it remains unclear if the sides can reach an agreement on how to do that. New START was signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama. It limits each country to a maximum of 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads. It also limits the number of deployed nuclear-capable missiles and bombers for both countries.",29,5.178095062011772,3.173646478154172,2.0044485838575996,25

The Federal Security Service (FSB) said it had carried out a multi-stage mission with the US Department of Justice that ended with the seizure of 330 kilograms of cocaine with an estimated street value of 1 billion rubles (about $13.6 million). Video released by the FSB to Russian media showed plainclothes agents dragging suspects from cars as well as boxes of confiscated cash and drugs. The security agency said in a statement that the joint-US operation had disrupted ""a transnational criminal community that specialized in smuggling cocaine from South America to Russia and other European states."" The mission elapsed in several stages beginning in May this year in Saint Petersburg and concluded with the discovery of a cache in the Moscow region last month, the FSB said. The operation was a rare example of cooperation between Russia and the United States, which share a deep and mutual distrust over a range of issues including election meddling and hacking. Lawmakers in Washington said earlier this month that Russia was behind a recent massive cyber attack on U.S. government institutions, allegations that Russia said lacked evidence.

Cybersecurity experts believe that in March a well-organized group of hackers exploited a loophole in products developed by SolarWinds, an IT firm that provides technology software for government agencies and hundreds of large companies, including Microsoft which helped investigate and report the attack. By hacking SolarWinds, the attacker was able to access sensitive information and monitor the communications of dozens of companies and agencies that use the company's software, including the departments of Treasury, Commerce and Energy, as well as the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which oversees nuclear weapons. Details about the hack are still emerging, but officials call it an ""attack"" because it was an overt action likely perpetrated by a nation-state. Experts like Nick Merrill, director of the Daylight cybersecurity lab at UC Berkeley, say the breach is more akin to ""cyber-espionage"" because the attackers monitored the communications of corporate and government officials for months. While it's unknown if nuclear protocols were compromised, Merrill says this was a ""sophisticated cyberattack,"" and ""it is certainly possible that the attackers exploited other vulnerabilities that we do not yet know about."" In early December the same ""highly sophisticated threat actor"" is alleged to have purloined digital tools developed by the cyber-defense firm FireEye. FireEye detected the breach and alerted authorities, which helped lead to the discovery of intrusions into other companies and agencies. Experts believe the attacks are related and perpetrated by a group known as ""Cozy Bear,"" the code name used for the SVR, a wing of Russian intelligence linked to several recent high-profile hacks including the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and the Olympics in 2018. Although President Trump downplayed the hack and suggested China could be responsible, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it's ""pretty clear"" Russia is the culprit. ""This was a very significant effort, and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,"" Pompeo said in an interview on the Mark Levin talk radio program. On Monday, Attorney General William Barr agreed with Pompeo, stating that it ""certainly appears to be the Russians."" Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, denied Russian involvement in the hack. ""Russia is not involved in such attacks, namely this one. We state this officially and firmly,"" he said, calling the accusations ""absolutely baseless"" and likely a result of ""blind Russophobia."" Digital forensic experts suspect the hackers compromised a tool called Orion, which centralizes network monitoring, and a service called NetLogon, which verifies login requests. They also breached Microsoft Office 365, a service used by a number of government agencies. Over 18,000 companies and agencies are confirmed to be impacted, and the number might be as high as 33,000. The attack method was novel, says Bryson Bort, a former Army signals intelligence officer and advisor to the Army Cyber Institute, because it apparently didn't rely on traditional hacking methods like phishing — using a deceptive email or link to gain access — or a zero-day exploit, which takes advantage of a previously unknown software vulnerability to surreptitiously access private networks. Instead, says Bort, hackers co-opted the software update process by inserting malicious code into the Solar Winds software before clients downloaded the latest version. ""Then they spread out and used all kinds of different software to establish persistence"" on the network. He added that even after the hack is investigated, there is ""still the possibility [the attackers] remain cloaked on various systems for years."" Congressman Jim Himes, a Democrat who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, told CBSN, ""It was a very cleverly designed hack because it used U.S. IP addresses, it used a U.S. company, Solar Winds, and therefore the usual people who sort of stand on the wall and look outward for attacks that come from abroad were fooled by there."" Neil Walsh, who runs cybersecurity for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, says that subterfuge is common in cyberattacks and proper attribution could be murky for a long time. ""Attacks of this scale take time to understand, mitigate and attribute,"" Walsh explained. ""Imagine that a burglar wanted to break into your home to steal your banking details. Instead of bashing the door down, over a period of months, they design and test a skeleton key for the lock on your house. Then they enter your house and work out that they can see everything. Then they make an invisibility cloak and wrap themselves in it."" The fallout could be equally difficult to predict, but experts fear the damage will be severe and far-reaching. ""The scale,"" said Himes, ""is massive."" In 2017 a group called Shadow Brokers, who were also linked to Russian intelligence, hacked and publicly released cyberweapons from the U.S. National Security Agency. Those cyber tools, known as EternalBlue, resulted in a virulent and potent strain of ransomware called NotPetya. Attackers used it to paralyze major companies and government offices in Europe and around the globe, causing more than $10 billion in damage. At the time, it was considered the most devastating cyberattack in history. This attack is different, says Joel Benavides, the head of Global Legal at Redis Labs, but the repercussions could be broad. For example, these hackers were able to snoop on sensitive communications — including the email accounts of top Treasury officials — exfiltrate data from restricted government databases, and swipe corporate intellectual property at an unprecedented scale. ""The tremendous economic, societal and military impact cannot be overemphasized,"" Benavides said. ""Remediation costs, regulatory fines, and potential loss of trade secrets and industrial know-how will run into the billions of dollars."" Himes said, ""We know that this hack managed to penetrate all sorts of networks. We just don't know things like did it get into particularly sensitive networks — that would be government national security networks, financial entities might have your account information that could be sent somewhere else where it could be misused."" The long term impact, Benavides added, might be that the attack ""exposes weaknesses in our governmental cybersecurity infrastructure while driving further suspicion and eroding the public's trust of the very institutions that are meant to keep us all safe.""",3,2.625025151142006,0.4865836594567792,2.1384414916852266,1
2020-12-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pompeo-blames-russians-for-massive-cyberattack/,Pompeo blames Russians for massive cyberattack,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Russia for a massive cyberattack, saying ""it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity."" He said ""there was a significant effort to use a piece of third-party software to essentially embed code inside of U.S. government systems and it now appears systems of private companies and companies and governments across the world as well."" Pompeo made the remarks Friday on the conservative talk show ""The Mark Levin Show."" He said ""we're still unpacking precisely what it is, and I'm sure some of it will remain classified."" However, President Trump contradicted Pompeo, writing on Twitter that China ""may"" have been responsible for the attack. ""The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control. Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is, for mostly financial reasons, petrified of...discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!),"" Mr. Trump wrote in two tweets, tagging Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. However, Senator Marco Rubio, the acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter that he agreed with Pompeo. ""Increasingly clear that Russian intelligence conducted the gravest cyber intrusion in our history The process of determining its extent & assessing the damage is underway Remediation will take time & significant resources Our response must be proportional but significant,"" Rubio said. It may take months before the U.S. and other nations and some businesses can determine the extent of the damage done by the brazen attack, which went undetected for months. Sources told CBS News it is believed to be the largest cyber espionage campaign in U.S. history, and it's not over. ""This was really an attack of massive scale,"" Microsoft's president Brad Smith told CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge. The Kremlin has denied any involvement. Smith said the attack spans at least eight countries, with 80% of the targets in the U.S., including many of the company's clients. Targets included the State, Energy, Treasury and Homeland Security departments. ""This attack is still taking place. The industry is scrambling, people in government are scrambling to get it under control, but it's not under control yet,"" he said. Among the concerns: that the breach at the Treasury Department may have exposed taxpayer information. ""The impact is extraordinary,"" said former FBI operative Eric O'Neill. ""Any information of yours ... may have been compromised by very sophisticated attackers."" Officials say the tactics are similar to other large-scale attacks blamed on Russia. But investigators can't rule out other foreign adversaries. Smith said, ""We should assume that the number of victims is going to increase."" ""This is a bit like a natural disaster,"" he said. Sources say the hackers may have roamed free in unclassified systems and impersonated high-level officials to gain access to classified information. The hackers made their move at least as early as March and remained undetected until last week. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office in just over a month, said in a statement this week the intrusions were ""a matter of great concern"" and pledged to impose ""substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks.""",3,0.5268393435470824,0.570855382206035,-0.04401603865895265,1
2020-12-18,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nuclear-weapons-agency-suspected-russia-cyberattack-us-government/,Agency overseeing U.S. nuclear weapons targeted in suspected Russian cyberattack,"U.S. officials says a massive cyberattack, discovered a week ago and blamed on Russia, was far more wide-reaching than previously thought, CBS News' Catherine Herridge reports. The government's top cybersecurity agency says the hack compromised critical federal infrastructure, and according to reports, the breach struck at least seven government agencies — including the Department of Energy, which maintains the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and operates the Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico. In a statement, the department said there is so far no evidence the hack impacted nuclear weapons security. However, cybersecurity experts warn the damage done to the government's digital systems may take a long time to reverse. ""It's going to take a while for our forensic cyber sleuths to find out where this attack is, where the Russians have gotten their tentacles in,"" said former Principle Deputy Undersecretary for Homeland Intelligence Jack Thomas Tomarchio. U.S. officials call the hack ""highly complex"" and a ""grave risk."" Tomarchio worries the full extent of the damage has not been realized. ""We don't have an easy fix here,"" he said. ""I would say if you look at it as a hemorrhage, the hemorrhage is probably still happening."" The hackers made their move at least as early as March and remained undetected until last week. They had broken into SolarWinds, a Texas-based software company, that served government agencies and many Fortune 500 companies. Officials now say they managed to infect networks using other methods. Sources tell CBS News that President Trump has been briefed on the attack, but so far has made no public comments about it. Some lawmakers are calling on Mr. Trump's administration to act now. ""In this setting, not to have the White House aggressively speaking out and protesting and taking punitive action is really, really quite extraordinary,"" Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney told the Washington Post on SiriusXM. Despite what U.S. officials are saying, Vladimir Putin's government denies involvement. Microsoft confirmed it is a SolarWinds client on Thursday evening, and that the tech giant found malicious activity in its system. It also notes its customers were directly affected in at least eight countries including the U.S. However, Russia appears to have not been affected.",3,0.6431601114169496,4.450840947700499,-3.8076808362835495,1
2020-12-01,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/volga-maniac-radik-tagirov-serial-killer-arrested-russia/,"Russia detains suspected serial killer dubbed the ""Volga maniac""","Moscow — Russian authorities said Tuesday that they have detained a long-wanted serial killer, known as the ""Volga maniac,"" suspected of murdering at least 26 elderly women between 2011 and 2012. The suspect, identified as 38-year-old Radik Tagirov, was arrested by law enforcement operatives in the city of Kazan in southwestern Russia early Tuesday as part of a criminal investigation into the murders that authorities have attributed to a single person. The serial killer was dubbed in the press as the ""Volga maniac"" because many of his alleged crimes were committed in several regions lying along the Volga River, Europe's longest river. The killings took place in at least 12 different cities. Tagirov had previously been convicted in 2009 for theft. Investigators said in a statement that the suspect was identified using DNA evidence and shoe prints obtained from the crime scenes. Earlier local media reports indicate that most of his victims were elderly women, between 75 and 90 years old, who lived alone. Investigators said that the suspect posed as a social services or utilities worker to enter the apartments. Once inside, the suspect strangled the women with hands or nearby objects, and he often took some valuables and money from their homes. In 2017, federal investigators tripled the original reward from 1 million to 3 million rubles (about $40,000) for information that would help identify the killer. Reports suggest that the total number of his victims could be up to 32, what made him one of the most prolific serial killers in modern Russia. In a video released by the police online, a handcuffed Tagirov could be seen admitting he committed murders but he didn't specify how many. When asked by the police why all his victims were elderly women and why he decided to kill them instead of just robbing them, he said he couldn't explain that. ""All that happened spontaneously. I wanted to eat. I lived partly on the street,"" he said when answering what motivated him to commit the first murder. He said he couldn't recall when exactly it took place. Tagirov said that he chose to strangle the women as he thought it was ""quiet, fast"" and ""painless for them."" The suspect reportedly committed his first murder back in 2011 in Kazan. Within months that year several more women were found in the same city. One managed to survive, but she was blind and could not describe the attacker.",13,5.202372064782828,6.876989371282097,-1.6746173064992682,26
2020-10-22,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-emails-florida-alaska-arizona-no-evidence-breaches/,3 states targeted in Iranian email scheme report no evidence of breaches,"One day after top U.S. officials said Iran and Russia obtained some voter registration data, which Iran then used to send a recent spate of threatening emails to voters, officials in three states targeted in the email scheme say their voter databases have not been compromised. Hundreds of Democratic voters in Florida, Alaska and Arizona received threatening emails Tuesday and Wednesday claiming to have come from the far-right group The Proud Boys, which has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights advocacy group. The emails, which were routed through servers in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Estonia and Moldova to obscure their origin, included threats to ""come after"" voters unless they voted for President Trump. Some of the emails included the recipients' home addresses and other personal information. Others included a link to a video showing a computer user appearing to access voters' registration information to fraudulently complete absentee ballots used by Americans overseas. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that Iran had sent spoof emails ""designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump."" He did not directly reference the emails spoofing Proud Boys accounts. While Ratcliffe confirmed Iran and Russia had obtained voter registration information, he did not elaborate on how the two nations were able to acquire the data, raising questions as to whether systems had been breached or if the information was compiled through publicly available means. ""This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy,"" Ratcliffe said. On Thursday, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) issued a joint advisory stating that Russia had targeted the networks of dozens of state, local and tribal governments since late September, and successfully stole data from at least two of them as of October 1. The agencies warned that some of the networks might house election-related data, but said there is ""no evidence to date that integrity of elections data has been compromised."" Officials from elections offices in the three states targeted by the spoofed Proud Boys emails told CBS News there have been no breaches to their voter rolls. Varying degrees of voter registration information is considered public record in all three states. Mark Ard, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of State, said the emails had targeted voters in multiple counties but there ""has been no breach to Florida's Voter Registration database."" Gail Fenumiai, Alaska's director of the Division of Elections, said the office ""has no evidence from the FBI that the state's voter registration systems have been compromised."" Sophia Solis, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of State, said Arizona's voter database ""is secure and not affected by incidents reported nationally."" Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, an email security company that analyzes billions of emails a day, said the company identified 3,000 emails sent to corporate and organizational clients as it researched the campaign. DeGrippo said the messages were primarily sent on Tuesday and Wednesday, and revealed that Proofpoint found some of the emails had been routed through servers in Moldova, a detail that was not previously known. DeGrippo said ""a large percentage of these emails were sent to .edu addresses,"" a detail she said is in line with previous Iranian state-sponsored activities. ""Iran is obsessed with higher education and getting access into higher education institutions. They do campaigns constantly, and they have been doing them against higher education in a concerted effort for probably two years,"" DeGrippo said, citing the so-called ""Silent Librarian"" campaign that targeted hundreds of universities. A spokesman for the University of Florida told CBS News on Tuesday that the emails were sent to 183 accounts on the university's network. She said the use of email for voter intimidation, and the scale of the campaign, was unusual for a state-sponsored operation. ""A hundred is considered very big for a state-sponsored actor. A hundred emails out of a state-sponsored actor is crazy, but the difference here is that this is not [a malware] threat. This is social engineering and disinformation,"" DeGrippo said. ""They're not spreading malware with this. They're … trying to get people to take a physical action of some kind out in the world and trying to intimidate."" A spokesperson for Google told CBS News that 25,000 of the emails were sent to Gmail users, and 90% were blocked by the service's automated spam filter. The company said it referred the matter to the FBI. Iran denied targeting American voters. Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesperson for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, tweeted Wednesday that ""Iran does not interfere in other country's elections. The world has been witnessing US' own desperate public attempts to question the outcome of its own elections at the highest level."" Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, told CBS News most voter registration information is public and available online, and added that he has seen no evidence that voter registration databases were compromised. ""My personal sense is that the emails were much more about lashing out at America, trying to influence our election process and have people lose confidence in that process, rather than being about specific candidates,"" he said. Alperovitch, now the chairman of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, called the speed with which the intelligence community publicly attributed the email campaign to Iran ""unprecedented."" Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio said Wednesday that the intelligence community's determination that Iran was behind the campaign left him feeling exposed. ""This is just another news story, a cyberattack, but when this dust settles, the people who are in danger are going to be me and my guys, you know, nobody's going to provide security for us,"" Tarrio said. Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert at The Wilson Center, said the direct-emailing effort is the first she has seen from any adversary and said it indicates Iran is ""stepping up its game."" Such campaigns from foreign actors like Russia and Iran, she said, are aimed at destabilizing the U.S. without expending many resources. ""I don't think any disinformation actor is getting into this game thinking they're actually going to change votes,"" she said. ""Chaos and division in America is much more valuable to them in many ways."" The U.S. intelligence community and national security officials have warned that Russia, China and Iran would attempt to use cyber capabilities or foreign influence to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, including by using disinformation to sow chaos and division among U.S. voters. This month, the Department of Homeland Security warned in a homeland threat assessment Iran would continue ""to use online influence operations to increase societal tensions in the"" U.S. ""Tehran most likely considers the current U.S. administration a threat to the regime's stability,"" the department warned. ""Iran's critical messaging of the U.S. president almost certainly will continue throughout 2020."" The intelligence community has also made a series of disclosures to the American public about foreign threats to the election, as well as steps voters can take to mitigate those threats. In August, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director Bill Evanina detailed the candidate preferences of foreign actors, with Russia trying to ""denigrate"" Joe Biden and China preferring Mr. Trump wins reelection. Iran, he said, ""seeks to undermine U.S. democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country in advance of the 2020 elections."" ""Iran's efforts along these lines probably will focus on online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S. content,"" he said. ""Tehran's motivation to conduct such activities is, in part, driven by a perception that President Trump's reelection would result in a continuation of U.S. pressure on Iran in an effort to foment regime change."" CISA also this week rolled out a ""rumor control"" web page designed to educate voters about potential areas of disinformation, and Chris Krebs, the agency's director, urged voters on Twitter on Thursday to remember ""your vote is secure and we're on watch."" ""The American voter is the last line of defense in election security,"" he tweeted. ""Keep calm and vote on.""",3,5.853455940521074,2.4909394883097438,3.36251645221133,24
2020-10-19,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-military-officers-hacking-cyber-attacks-charged/,"Six Russian military officers charged with cyber attacks targeting 2018 Olympics, French elections","Washington — The U.S. has charged six Russian military intelligence officers in connection with high-profile cyberattacks that targeted the electric power grid in Ukraine, the 2017 French elections and the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, federal prosecutors announced Monday. A 50-page indictment unsealed in federal court in Pittsburgh details the computer intrusions and malware attacks mounted over the past five years by the members of Russia's military intelligence agency, known as the GRU. The Justice Department described the hacking campaign as the ""most disruptive and destructive series of computer attacks"" ever attributed to one group. ""No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously or irresponsibly as Russia, wantonly causing unprecedented damage to pursue small tactical advantages and to satisfy fits of spite,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said in a statement announcing the charges. According to the indictment, the Russian intelligence officers deployed ""destructive malware"" beginning around at least November 2015 and continuing through at least October 2019 in support of Russia's effort to undermine or retaliate against foreign nations and organizations around the world. The six defendants allegedly are behind the malware attacks on Ukraine's electric power grid in 2015 and 2016, as well as hack-and-leak efforts targeting the 2017 French elections and President Emmanuel Macron's political party. The indictment accuses the Russians of hacking into computers that supported the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, after Russian athletes were banned from competing because of the country's doping scandal, and deploying destructive malware known as NotPetya, which led to nearly $1 billion in losses to U.S. businesses whose computers were infected. The malware infected computers at hospitals and medical facilities in Pennsylvania, a FedEx subsidiary and a large U.S. drug manufacturer. The Justice Department said the cyberattacks caused damage to computer networks around the world, including in France, Georgia, the Netherlands, South Korea, Ukraine, the U.S. and the U.K. While the GRU has been found by U.S. intelligence agencies to be involved in the efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the indictment does not include charges relating to the 2020 presidential election. The individuals charged are: Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, 32; Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov, 35; Pavel Valeryevich Frolov, 28; Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, 29; Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko, 27; and Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin, 32.

In June 2017, the malware attacks infected computer systems, using malware known as ""NotPetya,"" within the Heritage Valley Health System. ""For more than two years we have worked tirelessly to expose these Russian GRU Officers who engaged in a global campaign of hacking, disruption, and destabilization, representing the most destructive and costly cyber-attacks in history,"" said U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady for the Western District of Pennsylvania. ""The crimes committed by Russian government officials were against real victims who suffered real harm. We have an obligation to hold accountable those who commit crimes – no matter where they reside and no matter for whom they work – in order to seek justice on behalf of these victims."" The six Russian officers, Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov, Pavel Valeryevich Frolov, Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko, and Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin, are all charged with conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, damaging protected computers, and aggravated identity theft. Along with the damage to the Heritage Valley Health System, they also caused damage and disruption in France, Georgia, the Netherlands, Korea, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. ""The exceptional talent and dedication of our teams in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Oklahoma City who spent years tracking these members of the GRU is unmatched,"" said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Michael A. Christman. ""These criminals underestimated the power of shared intelligence, resources, and expertise through law enforcement, private sector, and international partnerships."" Their efforts also attempted to undermine countries such as Ukraine, Georgia, and France. It also was an attempted cyber-attack on the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics where Russian athletes were banned from participating under the country's flag due to a government-sponsored doping scandal. If convicted of these charges, the six defendants could face nearly 100 years in prison.",3,0.8485847674506981,8.420104098087513,-7.571519330636815,10
2020-10-13,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/soyuz-nasa-flight-international-space-station-u-s-crew-ships/,Soyuz flight to space station sets stage for NASA transition to U.S. crew ships,"In a mission marking the end of an era, NASA astronaut and former virus hunter Kate Rubins, using NASA's last currently contracted seat on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, rocketed into orbit Wednesday with two cosmonaut crewmates on a record-setting flight to the International Space Station. Celebrating her 42nd birthday, Rubins' launch came just two weeks before the 20th anniversary of the arrival of the station's first crew on November 2, 2000. Since then, the lab complex has been continuously staffed by rotating crews, or expeditions, of American, Russian, Japanese, European and Canadian fliers, along with a handful of space tourists. ""It's just incredible that we've had a space station with continuous human presence for 20 years,"" Rubins said. ""It's one of the most incredible engineering achievements, I think, that humanity has done. And the fact that we've done it as an international partnership and a collaboration, I think that's absolutely the intangible benefit of all of this."" ""This is gonna be kind of a birthday that I'll never be able to beat,"" she said on a more personal note before the launch. ""It's pretty funny. It's incredible to launch to space on your birthday."" Rubins, Soyuz MS-17/63S commander Sergey Ryzhikov, a station veteran, and rookie co-pilot Sergey Kud-Sverchkov blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:45 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday (10:45 a.m. local time). In a first for the Soyuz program, the crew carried out a speedy two-orbit rendezvous, docking at the station's Earth-facing Rassvet module at 4:48 a.m., just three hours and three minutes after launch -- a new record for the fastest trip to the space station. ""Talk about taking the Express Train! Welcome to @Space_Station,"" NASA flight director Ed Van Cise tweeted. Standing by to welcome Ryzhikov and company aboard were Expedition 63 commander Chris Cassidy and cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. They were launched to the space station aboard the Soyuz MS-16/62S spacecraft on April 9. Since the space shuttle's last flight in 2011, NASA has depended entirely on Russia's reliable three-seat Soyuz and the Russian space agency's willingness to sell seats, albeit at premium prices, to the U.S. space agency and its international partners. Now, six years and roughly $5 billion after NASA began funding commercial development of SpaceX and Boeing astronaut ferry ships, NASA's reliance on Russia for basic space transportation is coming to an end. NASA paid Roscosmos $90.3 million for Rubins' ticket to ride, but it's the last such payment the agency hopes to make as it transitions to regularly scheduled launches using SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule and, starting next year, Boeing's CST-100 Starliner. The next planned launch of U.S. astronauts to the space station after Rubins will be aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon, making the program's first operational flight. Launch of the six-month ""Crew-1"" mission is targeted for early to mid November. NASA still plans to launch astronauts aboard Soyuz spacecraft through the life of the station program as a hedge against emergencies like a serious illness, for example, which could result in the early departure of a U.S. or Russian crew ship. Mixed crews would ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut on board the station at all times to operate their nation's systems. But those mixed flights, including the eventual launch of Russian cosmonauts aboard the new American spacecraft, will be covered by barter arrangements, not direct cash payments. NASA will still be paying for seats aboard U.S. spacecraft — the cost is not yet known — but that money will be spent in the United States. To put that in perspective, NASA has purchased 71 Soyuz seats for roughly $4 billion since 2006, a total that includes five seats purchased through Boeing for $373.5 million as part of a settlement between the company and a Russian counterpart. The total also includes $1 billion for 13 seats that were required because of delays getting the Commercial Crew Program off the ground. Overall, NASA paid an average cost per seat of $56.3 million for the 71 completed and planned missions from 2006 through Rubins' Soyuz MS-17 flight, with prices ranging from a low of approximately $21.3 million to the $90.3 million paid for Wednesday's flight. Appreciative of Russia's long-term support, NASA is eager to turn the page. The successful test flight of a Crew Dragon carrying two astronauts to the space station earlier this summer marked ""another milestone, a critical milestone in the development of our ability to launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil, now sustainably,"" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. ""These are very exciting times."" The Crew-1 astronauts will boost the station's staffing level from three to seven, and the U.S. segment's crew from one to five. ""When we increase the number of astronauts onboard, we're going to be able to get three times as much science done and three times as much technology development,"" Bridenstine said. ""And all of that is critically important for for our Artemis (moon) program, and eventually our Mars program. ""As we develop moon to Mars, we're going to be using low-Earth orbit to test all of these capabilities and technologies, ultimately, to create a sustainable return to the moon, and then take all of that knowledge onto Mars. So this particular mission is another critical milestone. We're very excited about it."" Ryzhikov, Kud-Sverchkov and Rubins plan to spend six months aboard the space station, greeting two SpaceX Crew Dragon crews before heading back to Earth around May 1. Kud-Sverchkov is the only rookie on the Soyuz crew. Ryzhikov spent 173 days aboard the station in 2016-17 and Rubins, who holds a Ph.D. in cancer biology from Stanford University, spent 115 days aboard the lab in 2016 during a mission that overlapped Ryzhikov's stay. She completed two spacewalks, including one to finish installing a docking port that will be used by visiting SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft, logging 12 hours and 46 minutes outside the station. While she will not be investigating COVID-19 during her second station expedition, Rubins will bring her expertise to bear with a wide variety of research and experiments. ""We're not researching coronavirus specifically on station, that needs to be handled in high biosafety level labs on Earth,"" she said. ""But we are looking at things like microbes in our environment, how we interact with those microbes, whether they're pathogenic or beneficial. The ""space station is an incredible place to study that, because it's isolated. ISS is sort of the ultimate quarantine. We're very interested in what happens with humans and their microbiome environment when we are living off of the planet. And we have been for almost 20 years now. I think that's going to be an incredibly exciting area of research."" Rubins, Ryzhikov and Kud-Sverchkov will have one week to get up to speed on station operations before Cassidy, Ivanishin and Vagner undock and return to Earth aboard their Soyuz MS-62/16S spacecraft to close out a 196-day mission. Landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan is planned for Oct. 21 (U.S. time). Cassidy, a former Navy SEAL, will have logged 378 days in space during three missions while Ivanishin's total will stand at 196 days over three flights. Vagner is completing his first flight. Landing will set the stage for launch of the Crew-1 mission from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in early November. On board will be mission commander Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker and Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi. Hopkins, Walker and Noguchi, who flew on the space shuttle as well as a Soyuz, are spaceflight veterans while Glover is making his first flight to space. Like Rubins, they plan to spend about six months aboard the station, handing off to an other SpaceX Crew Dragon crew next April. ""I'm really excited to be able to greet Crew-1 when they come across the hatch,"" Rubins said. ""They're going to be getting there pretty quickly after I arrive, and it's going to be incredible to have our station complement grow to a total crew of seven. ""There's a certain amount of time every week we have to devote to just maintaining the space station, keeping the equipment running, keeping our life support going,"" she said. ""When we have additional crew members on board, we can get that much more science done.""",3,6.921777842250239,7.48173850635782,-0.5599606641075807,3
2020-10-06,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-russia-and-white-supremacy-top-dhs-first-public-threat-assessment/,"China, Russia and white supremacy top DHS' first public threat assessment","The Department of Homeland Security has concluded its first-ever ""Homeland Threat Assessment,"" a comprehensive report designed to educate the public on the largest threats facing the country. The report, first obtained by CBS News, highlights major threats posed by China and Russia and identifies white supremacists as posing the ""most persistent and lethal threat"" of all domestic violent extremist groups. In an exclusive interview, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said the report ""touches on all the major threat streams that I look at on a daily basis."" In September, a senior DHS official alleged in a whistleblower complaint that Wolf told him to withhold an intelligence notification on Russian activities because it ""made the president look bad,"" and claimed senior Trump administration officials urged analysts to downplay the threat of violent white supremacy. But Wolf told CBS News on Monday that the Homeland Threat Assessment was free from political influence. ""I am obviously aware of those complaints,"" he said. ""I think if you look at the document, Russia is mentioned somewhere in the document between 30 and 40 different times, so if we were trying to downplay Russia, we didn't do a very good job, I would say. The threat is specifically called out there when we talk about election, potential election interference, or disinformation… We are very upfront."" These are the major takeaways from the report. The report cited multiple potential threats from China, warning the country ""already poses a high cyber espionage threat to the Homeland and Beijing's cyber-attack capabilities will grow."" It also said China has been a ""particularly persistent"" source of counterfeit medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that more than 1 million FDA-prohibited COVID-19 test kits and 75,000 counterfeit masks have been seized from illicit Chinese manufacturers. The report warned that Beijing has been monitoring shortages in U.S. medical supply chains, and said China could exploit those shortages to force the government to adopt more pro-China policies. Wolf told CBS News that he believes ""the most long term strategic threat to Americans to the Homeland and really to our way of life would be the threat from China."" ""It cuts across a variety of different threats, from the cyber threats we see, from foreign influence, to supply chain security, to exploiting our academic and visa systems, foreign investment here in the U.S., trade policy violations and the like. It goes on and on and on…"" he said. ""Just across the board, threat after threat stream, we see China playing a very significant and enhanced role trying to really do the U.S. some long-term harm."" The report also highlighted Russia's efforts to influence the 2020 U.S. Presidential election by exacerbating existing social and political tensions in an effort to ""sway U.S. voter perceptions."" The report did not indicate a preference by Russia for a specific candidate, but did note an effort to undermine the campaign of Joe Biden: ""Russia uses divisive measures to disrupt the electoral process — including denigrating former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment' — as part of a broader effort to divide and destabilize America,"" the report says. Wolf told CBS News that despite foreign attempts to influence the election, he does not believe that any election infrastructure has been compromised. ""What we know right now is that none of those nation states are targeting election infrastructure, at least haven't done so successfully,"" he said. ""That is different than what we saw in 2016 at this time, leading up to the election."" The report also highlighted Russia's skill in cyber espionage and cyber attacks, warning that the nation likely has the ability to conduct attacks that would last hours to days, and is developing the capability to conduct ""more debilitating"" attacks. The report found that the most likely terrorist threat to the United States comes from ""ideologically motivated lone offenders and small groups,"" with domestic violent extremists posing the ""primary terrorist threat"" inside the U.S. Of the domestic violent extremists, the report said, ""racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists—specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs)—will remain the most persistent and lethal threat."" White supremacist groups have killed more people than any other domestic violent extremist group, according to the report. But Wolf told CBS News that the report is ""also very clear to call out anarchist threats."" ""..if you are only looking at deaths, and you are not looking at property damage, insurance claims and all the other societal factors, and only looking at deaths, then yes, white supremacist extremists sort of lead that category,"" Wolf said. ""But as we have witnessed over the last several months, the movements and the civil unrest we have seen here inside the U.S., while maybe not lethal, certainly have lasting implications to the homeland and do serve as a threat to the homeland."" The report said that ""DHS law enforcement officers suffered over 300 separate injuries and were assaulted with sledgehammers, commercial grade fireworks, rocks, metal pipes, improvised explosive devices, and more"" as part of violence perpetrated by ""anarchist extremists."" The report touched on a number of other threats, including Iran and North Korea. While the report stressed that the cyber capabilities of both nations were weaker than those of China and Russia, it nevertheless warned that the nations could develop the ability to conduct disruptive attacks. While the report said that U.S. counterterrorism efforts have reduced the likelihood of a foreign terrorist attack on U.S. soil, it warned that terrorist groups ""can adapt quickly and resurge,"" and said Iran ""will continue to develop and maintain terrorist capabilities"" to deter the U.S. from ""regime-threatening actions"" or to retaliate for such activity. The report made clear that the founding principal of combatting terrorism ""will always be a priority to the Department of Homeland Security."" The report also cited illegal immigration, noting that while the vast majority of migrants do not pose a security risk, ""pathways used by migrants to travel to the United States have been exploited by threat actors."" The report concluded by noting the record-breaking hurricane and wildfire seasons that have caused billions of dollars in damage this year. While the report cited active land management as a potential solution for the wildfires, it did not mention climate change in either section — despite the fact that experts have linked the intensity of the hurricane and wildfire seasons to global warming.",3,5.470382695564061,4.904504794148816,0.5658779014152451,24

The woman was found unconscious with a head injury near the railway tracks in a park not far from the embassy on Wednesday, according to a police statement. She died in a hospital later in the day. A U.S. Embassy ID was found in her belongings. The Embassy confirmed the woman was a U.S. citizen in a statement and said they were ""heartbroken"" to report her death. Embassy officials were ""working with authorities to determine the circumstances of the death."" Police said the woman may have been assaulted, and that they were looking for a 30-to-40-year-old man wearing black shorts, dark-blue sneakers and a T-shirt. Artyom Shevchenko, the spokesman for Ukraine's Interior Ministry, said on Facebook that police were investigating the death as a murder but at the same time had not ruled out an accident. The woman was wearing sports clothes and headphones, he said. ""The death of such reckless pedestrians as a result of injuries (caused by a) train is not uncommon on the railways,"" Shevchenko wrote. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenakiy's office issued a statement offering condolences to the family and friends of the woman, who, according to the statement, had a husband and four children. ""We emphasize the necessity of a prompt and comprehensive investigation.

This week, Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space corporation Roscosmos, revealed that the country plans to send its own mission to Venus in addition to ""Venera-D,"" the planned joint mission with the US, the Russian state news agency TASS reported. Rogozin was addressing reporters at the HeliRussia 2020 exhibition, an international expo of the helicopter industry in Moscow. ""Resuming Venus exploration is on our agenda,"" he told reporters Tuesday. ""We think that Venus is a Russian planet, so we shouldn't lag behind,"" he said. ""Projects of Venus missions are included in the united government program of Russia's space exploration for 2021-2030."" The statement came the day after scientists revealed that a gas on Earth called phosphine had also been detected in the atmosphere of Venus. Venus is similar in size to Earth and is our closest planetary neighbor, but it spins backward compared to other planets. The study authored by Cardiff University professor Jane Greaves and her colleagues was published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy. The discovery of phosphine on Venus elevates it to an area of interest worth exploring in our solar system alongside the ranks of Mars and ""water world"" moons like Enceladus and Europa, Seager said. ""Our hoped-for impact in the planetary science community is to stimulate more research on Venus itself, research on the possibilities of life in Venus' atmosphere, and even space missions focused to find signs of life or even life itself in the Venusian atmosphere,"" Seager said. According to the European Space Agency, the Russians do have significant experience when it comes to Venus. Its website states: ""Between 1967-1984 Venusian studies carried out in Russia were at the forefront of international research into this planet. ""Since then, Russia has still preserved its unique expertise in designing and developing landing craft for Venus and continues to define scientific tasks for those craft.""

2020-09-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alexei-navalny-poisoning-russia-opposition-vladimir-putin-novichok-on-hotel-water-bottle-team-says/,New info emerges on poisoning of Russia opposition leader Alexei Navalny,"New details emerged Thursday about the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, including video from inside his hotel room purportedly taken just after the attack. Colleagues of the vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin said tests had revealed traces of a nerve agent on a water bottle from the hotel room. The video posted to Navalny's Instagram account purportedly shows members of his team combing through his hotel room just one hour after learning that he'd fallen gravely ill on a domestic flight in Russia. His associates can be seen carefully collecting anything that might provide clues. As CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, Navalny's team claim a German lab has confirmed that traces of a highly toxic Novichok nerve agent were detected on the water bottle found in the room. The Russian dissident's representatives originally said they believed he was likely poisoned with a cup of tea at an airport in the country's northern Siberia region, before boarding the flight to Moscow. During that flight, Navalny fell violently ill and the plane made an emergency landing in Siberia, where he was hospitalized for several days before being airlifted to Berlin for treatment. But chemical weapons expert Hamish DeBretton Gordon, who recently published a book on his work in the field entitled ""Chemical Warrior: Saving Lives on the Front Line of Modern Warfare,"" told CBS News that the tea-at-the-airport theory always seemed unlikely. ""Putting it on a water bottle would ensure that Navalny would poison himself,"" said de Bretton-Gordon, explaining that Novichok is so deadly, just coming into contact with ""a single molecule"" can prove fatal. Contaminating a water bottle that an intended target is expected to pick up, ""makes a lot more sense"" than trying to slip it into a cup of tea quickly in a busy airport, he told CBS News. It also appears similar to the tactics used in an attack on a former Russian double agent the U.K. Sergei Skripal and his daughter were both poisoned with Novichok in the English city of Salisbury in 2018. The U.K. has charged two alleged Russian agents in the attack, which left one woman dead after she sprayed the nerve agent onto her arm, thinking it was perfume. ""It's very similar to the delivery from the Salisbury attack, where the Novichok was put on a [door] handle,"" said de Bretton-Gordon. He said that, just as was the case in England, there would likely be a rush in Siberia to see ""who else has been contaminated and poisoned, remembering that Salisbury took 18 months to decontaminate from probably a similar amount."" The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the poisoning of Putin's fiercest opponent, accusing Germany of refusing to hand over data or lab samples that prove the accusation of Novichok poisoning. Labs in Sweden and France have now backed the German findings, however, and on Thursday, the global chemical weapons watchdog agency, the OPCW, confirmed that representatives had visited the Berlin hospital to collect samples from Navalny, and that its findings would be forthcoming. The first photo showing Navalny since the poisoning was posted to his Instagram account earlier this week. He was pictured sitting up in his hospital bed, looking alert and surrounded by his wife and children, just a couple days after he was brought out of a medically-induced coma and taken off a ventilator. Visiting the U.K., Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the British Foreign Secretary that the U.S. stands together with its European partners in the face of the latest alleged poisoning attack, calling any use of chemical weapons ""unacceptable under any circumstances."" Navalny's team says he has every intention of returning to Russia.",3,5.105767511965017,5.6253150285483615,-0.5195475165833443,29
2020-09-17,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venus-russian-planet-space-agency-chief-claims/,"Russia's space agency chief declares Venus a ""Russian planet""","Moscow — If there is life on Venus, it might want to start learning Russian. The boss of Russia's government space agency has claimed it as a ""Russian planet."" The bold territorial claim comes on the heels of scientific research suggesting life could exist on Earth's celestial neighbor, the second planet from the sun. Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin, who's known for espousing unconventional scientific views — and for frequently sarcastic anti-Western rhetoric — said this week that Russia wants to send its own mission to Venus, in addition to an already-proposed joint venture with the United States called ""Venera-D."" ""We think that Venus is a Russian planet, so we shouldn't lag behind,"" Rogozin, a former deputy prime minister, told reporters on Tuesday. He noted that the Soviet Union was ""the first and the only one"" to land a spacecraft on Venus. ""The spacecraft gathered information about the planet — it is like hell over there,"" he said in remarks quoted by the Tass news agency. Research published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy details British and American scientists' discovery of phosphine gas in the clouds around Venus, considered a potential sign of life on the planet. The atmosphere of Venus is made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide, and it's considered the hottest planet in our solar system. The new study renewed public interest in Venus, likely prompting the Roscosmos chief to remind the world of the former Soviet Union's achievements in early space exploration. NASA's Mariner 2 became the first spacecraft to fly by Venus and measure its extreme surface temperature in 1962. The Soviet Union launched several ""Venera"" spacecraft, and in 1970 Venera 7 became the first spacecraft to make a successful soft landing on the planet, though it melted within seconds. Its successor Venera 9 took the first image, and the only one to date, of the Venusian surface from the ground-level perspective. ""The huge gap between the Soviet Union and its competitors in Venus research contributed to the fact that the United States called Venus 'the Soviet planet,' the space agency wrote on its website on Tuesday. Shortly after the study was published this week, the Breakthrough Initiatives program, supported by Russian-born billionaire Yuri Milner, announced that it would fund a study into the possibility of primitive life in Venus' clouds, led by Sara Seager from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Last month, Rogozin declared Venus ""more interesting than Mars,"" suggesting that studying the planet could help scientists understand how to address climate change on Earth.",3,4.366979080899227,4.233317199520651,0.1336618813785755,6
2020-09-10,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-interference-russia-china-iran-microsoft-warning/,"Russia, China and Iran ramping up attacks ahead of election, Microsoft warns","Washington — Groups backed by Russia, China and Iran have in recent weeks launched cyberattacks targeting the Trump and Biden campaigns, as well as people and organizations involved in the 2020 race, as part of efforts to interfere in the upcoming election, Microsoft warned Thursday. Tom Burt, the company's corporate vice president of customer security and trust, said in a blog post that the malign activity ""makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election as has been anticipated."" Most of the attacks were detected by the tech company and stopped. The revelation comes after the Treasury Department announced sanctions against four people with links to Russia, including a Ukrainian lawmaker who met with Rudy Giuliani in December, for attempting to influence the U.S. presidential election. The lawmaker, Andriy Derkach, has been an ""active Russian agent"" for more than a decade and ""waged a covert influence campaign"" designed to cultivate unsupported narratives concerning officials in the presidential election, the department said. The U.S. intelligence community issued an assessment in August that warned of ongoing activity by China, Russia and Iran. Russia, according to the assessment, is actively trying to ""denigrate"" Biden, while China prefers Mr. Trump loses reelection. Iran, meanwhile, may attempt to ""undermine"" U.S. democratic institutions and the president through online content. Christopher Krebs, head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said they are aware of the hacking attempts detected by Microsoft and noted the efforts did not involve voting infrastructure or impact election systems. ""The announcement is consistent with earlier statements by the Intelligence Community on a range of malicious cyber activities targeting the 2020 campaign and reinforces that this is an all-of-nation effort to defend democracy,"" Krebs said in a statement. ""Everyone involved in the political process should stay alert against these sorts of attacks and today we are releasing guidance for improving cyber defenses against account compromise attacks. We encourage anyone that experiences a cyber incident to report to CISA and the FBI."" Microsoft identified three hacking groups that have targeted hundreds of organizations, consultants, think tanks and political parties involved in the upcoming election. Strontium, operating from Russia and also known as Fancy Bear, has launched a series of attacks observed by Microsoft beginning in September 2019, seeking to steal login credentials or breach accounts, ""presumably to aid in intelligence gathering or disruption operations,"" Burt said. The hacking group's targets include Republican and Democratic consultants, The German Marshall Fund of the United States and other think tanks, national and state party organizations in the U.S., and political parties in the United Kingdom. The Russia-based group was behind the attacks on the Democratic presidential campaign in 2016 and identified in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian meddling in the last presidential election. According to Microsoft, Zirconium, operating from China, has mounted thousands of attacks between March and September, leading to nearly 150 compromises. The hacking group, which is targeting those associated with the presidential campaigns, ""appears to have indirectly and unsuccessfully targeted the Joe Biden for President campaign through non-campaign email accounts belonging to people affiliated with the campaign. The group has also targeted at least one prominent individual formerly associated with the Trump administration."" The China-based hackers are also targeting individuals in the international affairs community, as well as academics from more than 15 universities and accounts with links to 18 international affairs and policy organizations, such as the Atlantic Council and the Stimson Center, Microsoft said. The third hacking group, Iran-based Phosphorus, has ""operated espionage campaigns targeting a wide variety of organizations traditionally tied to geopolitical, economic or human rights interests in the Middle East region."" The group has attempted to hack the personal or work accounts of people involved with the election. Microsoft said between May and June, Phosphorus unsuccessfully tried to log into the accounts of Trump administration officials and staff for Mr. Trump's campaign. Thea McDonald, spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said it takes ""cybersecurity very seriously and do not publicly comment on our efforts."" ""As President Trump's re-election campaign, we are a large target, so it is not surprising to see malicious activity directed at the campaign or our staff,"" she said. ""We work closely with our partners, Microsoft and others, to mitigate these threats."" The Biden campaign confirmed the attacks and said they unsuccessfully targeted ""non-campaign email accounts of individuals affiliated with the campaign."" ""We have known from the beginning of our campaign that we would be subject to such attacks and we are prepared for them,"" the campaign said. ""Biden for President takes cybersecurity seriously, we will remain vigilant against these threats, and will ensure that the campaign's assets are secured."" Microsoft said it would continue to disclose additional activity and called for more federal funding in the U.S. to ensure states can protect their election infrastructure. ""While the political organizations targeted in attacks from these actors are not those that maintain or operate voting systems, this increased activity related to the U.S. electoral process is concerning for the whole ecosystem,"" Burt said.",3,5.37189776633185,1.6379722208235363,3.733925545508314,24

""There are other attacks from foreign nations such as Russia, Ukraine, China and Iraq and possibly others,"" said Superintendent Alberto Carvalho at a Thursday afternoon news conference. ""That does not mean however, that individuals in those nations are necessarily launching the cyberattacks."" He explained people can purchase these highly disruptive services via the dark web. Meanwhile, it was revealed David Oliveros, a student at South Miami Senior High, was the teen arrested. He's a junior who is accused of eight cyberattacks against the District. In all there were more than two dozen. ""It takes no joy announcing the early morning arrest of a 16-year-old student,"" said Carvalho. Miami-Dade Schools Police say he confessed when detectives went to his home early in the morning, confiscating his computer and gaming system for forensic analysis. Detectives were able to trace an IP address responsible for the attacks back to Oliveros, according to a police incident report.

Oliveros is charged with Computer Use in an Attempt to Defraud - a 3rd degree felony, and Interference with an Educational Institution - a 2nd degree misdemeanor. He is now in custody at the Juvenile Assessment Center. Meantime, the virtual learning platform was better Thursday then the first three days of school this week. ""Where we stand today is in a far better place than we were yesterday and I expect continuous improvements made going into tomorrow,"" Carvalho said. For now, kindergarten through 5th grade will remain on the K12 platform, while all middle and high school students went back to Zoom and Microsoft Teams until September 11. That's is when the District will decide what to do next. ""While we have confidence that that platform can be reinitiated without the systemic problems that we identified, or if we abandon it altogether and continue to utilize the district approved, Zoom through Microsoft Teams platform access, we hope that the experience tomorrow will be even better than today's experience,"" said Carvalho.

The White House National Security Council (NSC) said in a statement that a Russian vehicle struck a U.S. mine-resistant all-terrain vehicle, ""causing injuries to the vehicle's crew."" A U.S. official told CBS News senior national defense correspondent David Martin that the Russian forces were operating inside a designated ""security zone"" that they had agreed to stay out of. There have been many encounters between Russian and U.S. forces on the ground in Syria and some have been tense, but the official told Martin the incident earlier this week was the first time American troops were injured in such a confrontation. Their injuries were minor, but the official called the Russian forces' actions ""reckless."" Russia's defense ministry released a statement saying it had warned the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition in advance that a column of its military police would pass through. ""In spite of this, in breach of the existing agreements the U.S. troops attempted to block the Russian patrol,"" it said, adding that Russian military police took ""necessary measures"" to end the incident and carry on their mission. The chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, gave ""full explanations"" in a Wednesday phone call with General Mark Milley, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Moscow said. The U.S. military declined to comment on the call beyond confirming that it had taken place, saying both sides had ""agreed to keep the specific details of their conversation private."" Videos shared on Twitter, apparently filmed by bystanders and the Russians themselves, appear to show Russian troop carriers and attack helicopters trying to box the U.S. vehicles in and then force them from the area, near Dayrick. Vehicles appear to bump each other, and at one point one of the helicopters hovers very low over the halted Americans, blasting them with propeller wash. National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said the U.S. vehicles were a security patrol of the anti-ISIS coalition. He said the patrol departed the area to de-escalate the situation. ""Unsafe and unprofessional actions like this represent a breach of de-confliction protocols, committed to by the United States and Russia in December 2019,"" said Ullyot.

""When service members collude to provide classified information to our foreign adversaries, they betray the oaths they swore to their country and their fellow service members."" Court documents indicate that Debbins, 45, was initially contacted by members of the foreign intelligence service while he was a college student studying abroad in Russia in 1996. In meetings with the unidentified intelligence officers, Debbins disclosed he was in his university's ROTC program and planned to join the military after college, but declared he was ultimately a ""son of Russia."" After graduating from college, Debbins returned to Russia in 1997, where he was assigned the code name, ""Ikar Lesnikov,"" by Russian intelligence. He subsequently signed a statement under his code name saying he wished to ""serve Russia."" After beginning U.S. active-duty service in 1998, Debbins was deployed to South Korea to serve as a lieutenant in the 4th Chemical Company. While on leave, he traveled to Russia and provided his contacts in the intelligence service with U.S. defense information, including the number of men in his platoon, their equipment, and mission. ""During these times, Debbins sought to help Russia, as he considered himself pro-Russian and a loyal son of Russia,"" the court documents say. ""Debbins thought that the United States was too dominant in the world and needed to be cut down to size."" Debbins received gifts in exchange for the information he provided to Russian intelligence. In 2000, he was given $1,000 ""as gratitude for his assistance to the Russian Intelligence Service."" Prosecutors say that while Debbins initially dismissed the payment because ""he had true love for Russia,"" he ended up taking it and signing for it with his given code name. Later he received a bottle of cognac and a Russian military uniform. After he left the Army in 2008, Debbins returned to Russia, ""angry and bitter"" about his service in the U.S. Special Forces, and eager to start a business venture in Russia. He ended up working as part of a front created by a GRU officer, and subsequently continued to provide them with information, including classified intelligence about his unit's missions in Georgia and Azerbaijan. He even handed over the names of his team members in the Special Forces, knowing that the Russian officers would try to contact them ""to see if they would cooperate with the Russian intelligence service."" Debbins' cooperation with GRU, also known as ""Fancy Bear,"" is significant, because that arm of Russia's intelligence service would later go on to hack the emails of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election. The Democrats' emails were disseminated via DCLeaks and WikiLeaks and were further amplified by a network of bot accounts on social media. Most recently, GRU has been tied to the hack of Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, was previously a board member. Debbins' arrest is the second high-profile espionage related arrest this week. On Tuesday, Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, a former CIA officer, was accused of selling top-secret information to China in a scheme that also lasted for over a decade. John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security said, ""Two espionage arrests in the past week – Ma in Hawaii and now Debbins in Virginia – demonstrate that we must remain vigilant against espionage from our two most malicious adversaries – Russia and China."" Debbins has been arrested and is being detained at the Alexandria Detention Center. He has been charged with one count of conspiracy to gather or deliver defense information to aid a foreign government, and if convicted, he could be imprisoned for life.",3,4.976405052334735,5.1576328009507195,-0.18122774861598412,24

All hostages were freed unharmed, officials said. The assailant agreed to release the hostages following a 15-minute phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Zelensky's deputy chief of staff Kyrylo Tymoshenko told reporters. Shortly after the call, Zelensky posted a brief video message on his Facebook page to urge Ukrainians to watch ""Earthlings,"" a 2005 American documentary alleging humanity's cruel exploitation of animals — as the hostage-taker had wanted. Minutes later, the assailant walked out of the bus and surrendered to the police. Authorities said all 13 hostages he held were freed and no one was hurt. Earlier, following negotiations with the first deputy chief of national police, Yevhen Koval, the man had released three of the hostages, including a pregnant woman. At one point during the conversation, he fired his gun through the bus window and a bullet narrowly missed Koval, who also brought water for the hostages. After the drama ended, Zelensky hailed law enforcement officers for saving the hostages. ""Human life is the most important value,"" he said on Facebook. ""Now families can finally hug their relatives who spent the entire day on the bus in anguish."" Speaking to reporters, Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov described the assailant as ""an unstable man who painted his vision of the world and invented a revenge for it."" ""He had his own vision of justice and the value of human life,"" Avakov said. Ukrainian media said the man was an animal rights activist who helped protect stray dogs. As the hostage drama unfolded, police sealed off the center of Lutsk, 250 miles west of the capital Kyiv. At one point, the assailant threw explosives out of a bus window, but no one was hurt. He also fired several shots at a police drone. The man called the police himself at 9:25 a.m. after taking control of the vehicle and introduced himself as Maksim Plokhoy, Deputy Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko said on Facebook. According to Gerashchenko, police have identified the man as Maksim Krivosh, a 44-year-old Ukrainian born in Russia. Krivosh had reportedly been convicted twice on a wide range of charges — robbery, fraud, illegal arms handling — and spent a total of 10 years behind bars. According to reports, Krivosh tried to reach out to journalists through hostages and their phones, demanding that they spread the word about his demands and get more reporters to arrive at the scene.",17,4.148763562415859,5.570609519964079,-1.4218459575482196,10
2020-07-12,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-bellingcat-tracked-a-russian-missile-system-in-ukraine-60-minutes-2020-07-12/,How Bellingcat tracked a Russian missile system in Ukraine,"On July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was on route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down by what prosecutors say was a Russian missile, killing all 298 people on board. Now, days away from the six-year anniversary, four men are on trial in the Netherlands for 298 counts of murder. In February, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley and producer Henry Schuster reported on the investigation that led Dutch prosecutors to charge Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Leonid Kharchenko, with 298 counts of murder. The investigation, known as the Joint Investigative Team (JIT), was established after the shootdown and led by Dutch police, assisted by Australia, Ukraine, Malaysia and Belgium. The trial began in March and while it is still in its preliminary stages, prosecutors have already revealed additional evidence uncovered by the JIT investigation— satellite images of a burned field, the alleged launch site, from the European Space Agency, telecoms data used to track the alleged missile system as it traveled through Ukraine, intercepted calls of defendants talking about a downed plane after the shootdown, and interviews with previously unknown witnesses. Prosecutors say one of those witnesses, identified as M58 in court records, is a Russian separatist who was guarding the launch site at the moment the missile was fired. M58 says they were told later that it had struck a civilian aircraft. M58 also claims that Russian military personnel were present at the launch site. Some of the earliest evidence in the case of MH17 wasn't discovered by a traditional investigative body. Instead, Bellingcat, an online investigative collective lead by Eliot Higgins, made a break in the case when it found videos and photos posted online, beginning the day of the shooting. Following a trail of digital ""breadcrumbs,"" the group spotted and identified a Russian Buk TELAR missile system as it made its way through rebel-controlled territory. The rebels were funded and armed by Russia, which had already annexed Crimea, another part of Ukraine. ""In this war zone of eastern Ukraine, there were a lot of people, average civilians, who were shooting videos and stills of military convoys going back and forth,"" Pelley tells 60 Minutes Overtime. ""There were quite a number of photographs of this particular missile system which was on the bed of a flatbed truck."" Bellingcat's Higgins showed 60 Minutes how his investigative team used open-source tools, including Google Maps and Google Earth, and videos and photos posted online, to trace the missile system all the way back to its suspected origin, a Russian military base in Kursk. Higgins says the Bellingcat team was able to identify a phone number on the side of the flatbed truck that was hauling the missile launcher. The number belonged to a vehicle yard in the separatist-controlled part of eastern Ukraine. Higgins says, ""In fact, people called that number up and asked the owner, 'What's going on? Why is your truck in this photograph?' And he said his vehicle had been taken over by separatists sometime earlier."" Bellingcat was also able to identify the location of the convoy by comparing images posted online to satellite imagery, in a process known as geolocation. Matching multiple unique objects in the images, Bellingcat's team was able to determine a precise location for each image. The team used shadows in the images to determine the approximate time of day that the photo or video was taken. The trail led them all the way to Kursk, Russia. ""And in Kursk, there's a missile brigade called the 53rd Air Defense Brigade, and we were able to establish for certain that the missile launcher came from that particular brigade,"" Higgins says. The JIT would later independently verify Bellingcat's findings, crediting their work as ""groundbreaking"" in the early stages of the investigation. All four of the defendants are still at large as the trial proceeds. 60 Minutes found Girkin living openly in Moscow and denying a role in the shootdown. Three of the defendants are being tried in absentia, while Oleg Pulatov is represented by a defense team. Under Dutch law, Putlatov does not need to attend the trial in person. Pulatov's lawyers maintain that he is innocent and have been granted additional time to conduct investigations and meet with Pulatov in person. The trial will resume on August 31st.

The plane was struck while flying over eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists had seized territory and were waging war against the Ukrainian military. The chain of events began when Russia moved its military into Crimea, which was part of Ukraine, earlier in the year. There was international outrage at what appeared to be the shootdown of MH17 and suspicion immediately fell on the rebels and their Russian backers. The U.S. government pointed the finger in their direction but would not release classified satellite data it had to support its charges. The demand for an investigation was strongest in the Netherlands, which had 193 citizens on board. Two official investigations were immediately launched. The Dutch Safety Board began looking at how MH17 was brought down. Dutch prosecutors and police formed a Joint Investigative Team (JIT) with their counterparts from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. All of those countries, except for Ukraine, had citizens on board MH17. Members of the JIT agreed that if they developed enough material, that cases would be tried in a Dutch court. There was also an unofficial investigation conducted by the newly formed online group known as Bellingcat, which began putting out its findings online within weeks of the crash. Early on, Bellingcat traced the path of a missile convoy through eastern Ukraine on the day of the shootdown and found video from the next morning showing the same convoy headed back towards the Russian border, with one of the missile missing from the launcher. In October 2014, the group would identify the missile as belonging to Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. A year after the shootdown, 60 Minutes producer Henry Schuster and correspondent Scott Pelley began reporting for a segment about MH17. ""At this point, there was still so much to be learned,"" Schuster tells Overtime. ""You had the Bellingcat investigations, but the Dutch Safety Board had not issued its report. The joint investigative team was not even at the point of issuing witness appeals."" Even though the official investigations were slow to progress, Schuster and his team continued with their research, speaking to next of kin on their loss, talking to prosecutors about the case and discussing with Eliot Higgins, Bellingcat founder, his open source investigative techniques. The team had even begun organizing a trip to rebel territory in Ukraine to re-trace the path of the missile that struck MH17, using Bellingcat data. ""For various reasons, we weren't able to go to Ukraine at that time so we put that story aside...[but] we always wanted to come back to it,"" Schuster says. ""How could 298 people be shot out of the sky, and we don't do a piece about this? This wasn't a plane crash. This was a shoot-down. This was, you know, this was murder."" Schuster kept in touch with his sources and watched the case progress, waiting for the right time to ""do the story that we were always meant to do."" ""And then we got word that the Joint Investigative Team had announced that they were charging four men, and that there would be a trial in the Dutch courtroom this March,"" Schuster explains. ""We thought, we have to come back."" The Dutch Safety Board had already published its findings, concluding that MH17 had been shot down by an anti-aircraft missile known as a Buk and that the trajectory of the missile indicated it had been fired from eastern Ukraine. In May of 2018, nearly four years after the crash, the JIT announced that they believed the Buk missile installation that brought down MH17 was fired from rebel territory and it belonged to the Russian military. And in the summer of 2019, Dutch investigators announced the date of the first MH17 trial and the names of the four men being tried: Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov from Russia, and Leonid Kharchenko from Ukraine. All were members of a pro-Russian rebel militia that was part of the self-declared Donetsk Peoples Republic. According to Schuster, these are the names of those ""who asked for and brought the murder weapon,"" but investigators are still working to identify and bring to just those who manned the missile launcher that day. The JIT is also investigating up the chain of command. In November it made a new appeal for witnesses and made public several phone intercepts between rebels and members of the Russian military. Among the names mentioned in those calls were the Russian defense minister, the deputy head of the FSB (Russia's internal security service) and an advisor to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The trial began in March and is still in its preliminary stages. Pulatov is the only defendant to hire attorneys; Dutch law allows him to not be present in the courtroom and he has remained in Russia. Before the trial got underway, 60 Minutes found Girkin living in Moscow and he denied the rebels shot down MH17. ""We have already learned so much from the prosecution has said at the trial,"" Schuster says. ""In our interviews with them before it began, the chief prosecutor hinted at more eyewitnesses and we are finding out just how much they saw of the missile battery before and after it was fired. There are more audio tapes we had not heard before that have the defendants on them."" While this trial may take more than a year, ""it's by no means necessarily going to be the last trial for the shoot down of MH17...this is only their opening round,"" Schuster says. New evidence implicating others has already been revealed in the early days of the trial. ""The four men who have been charged, they're in one sense at the middle level...I mean, they're gonna go lower. They're gonna go higher. And this could go all the way to the Kremlin.""

2020-05-28,CBS,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-security-agency-cyberattack-sandworm-russia-hackers/,NSA warns of new cyberattacks by Russian military hackers,"A notorious hacking team backed by the Russian government has been exploiting a serious flaw in commonly used email software, the National Security Agency (NSA) warned Thursday, issuing a rare advisory that publicly attributed attempts to utilize the software flaw to a nation-state actor. The NSA's Cybersecurity Directorate said a group of cyber actors known as ""Sandworm team"" from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, had identified and exploited a vulnerability in the popular email software Exim Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) since at least August 2019. ""The Russian actors … have used this exploit to add privileged users, disable network security settings, execute additional scripts for further network exploitation; pretty much any attacker's dream access – as long as that network is using an unpatched version of Exim MTA,"" the advisory said. The agency advised users to immediately update the software and warned that any outdated versions would likely remain vulnerable to attack. ""When the patch was released last year, Exim urged its users to update to the latest version. NSA adds its encouragement to immediately patch to mitigate against this still current threat,"" it said. Sandworm is known to have operated for at least a decade and has been linked to large-scale cyberattacks on government, energy and telecommunications sectors in Ukraine and Poland, as well as on NATO and the European Union. The group was determined to be behind the devastating 2017 NotPetya attacks, which caused billions of dollars of damage across Europe, the United States and Asia. In February, the State Department publicly blamed Sandworm for a widespread cyberattack on government and private websites in the country of Georgia. ""This is a dangerous vulnerability that can provide an entryway for one of the most threatening cyber actors into the inner sanctum of corporate and government networks,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and former chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and chairman of Silverado Policy Accelerator. ""It is an important sign that NSA is now providing this highly relevant context about which adversary is exploiting this vulnerability that is highly helpful for defenders to prioritize defense and other mitigation efforts,"" Alperovitch said. Michael Daniel, president of the Cyber Threat Alliance and cybersecurity coordinator in the Obama administration, said other cyber actors were also likely to follow the Russians' lead. ""If an adversary can carry out these actions on your network, they can do whatever they want and you have very limited ability to detect or stop them,"" Daniel said. ""If the Russians are exploiting this vulnerability, then other actors are either using it, too – or they soon will,"" he said, noting the recommended patch was a simple and effective fix. The NSA's Cybersecurity Directorate, which was restructured and newly launched last October, has been charged with disseminating more unclassified threat information more quickly, so that private sector entities can take steps to protect themselves from cyber attacks. In January, the directorate announced a critical flaw in Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system. It notably disclosed the vulnerability to the company instead of using it to carry out cyber activities of its own, as had been its practice in the past. The NSA on Wednesday launched a new Twitter account, @NSACyber, where news of the Exim vulnerability was also announced.",3,7.133114184736536,8.430894498773728,-1.2977803140371922,1

Now, a multi-national investigation is heading to trial in the Netherlands with the hope that the evidence, collected in the almost six years since the tragedy, will bring those responsible to justice. 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley and producer Henry Schuster reported this week on the case of Flight MH17 and the evidence that led Dutch prosecutors to indict four men on 298 counts of murder. The police investigation, known as the Joint Investigative Team (JIT) was established after the shootdown and is led by Dutch police, assisted by Australia, Ukraine, Malaysia and Belgium.

Because of its highly classified nature, the US material will not be presented as evidence in court. Today, even as the first trial in the shootdown of MH17 gets underway, the joint investigation is still far from over-they recently released intercepted phone calls that mention the Russian defense minister, the deputy director of Russian intelligence, and a senior aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russian satellites, launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome last November, were maneuvering very close to the U.S. satellite in what Space Command chief General John Raymond has called ""unusual and disturbing behavior."" Raymond, commander of the still-new U.S. Space Command, said in a statement provided to CBS News this week that the two satellites were acting similarly to another set of satellites Russia deployed about three years ago. He said the Russian government had characterized those as ""inspector satellites."" ""The Russian satellites launched in 2017 exhibited characteristics of a weapon when one of those satellites released a high-speed projectile into space,"" Raymond said this week. ""Similar activities in any other domain would be interpreted as potentially threatening behavior. This is unusual and disturbing behavior and has the potential to create a dangerous situation in space. The United States finds these recent activities to be concerning and do not reflect the behavior of a responsible spacefaring nation."" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed Tuesday that Russia had been contacted by U.S. officials about the issue. ""We in fact received appropriate signals from them, and we (will) give answers to these signals after they are processed internally in necessary formats,"" Ryabkov said according to Russia's Interfax news agency. Russian media have said the newer Russian satellite in question is the Kosmos-2542. It was launched on November 26 and later released another satellite, the Kosmos 2543. Russia's Defense Ministry previously described the satellites as a ""multifunctional space platform"" for inspection of other satellites from a close distance. Raymond told TIME magazine that, at times, the Russian satellites came within 100 miles of the U.S. satellite. TIME said the U.S. satellite, known as KH-11, monitors foreign military installations.

Around 60 more people were able to get back onto the shore on their own Tuesday evening, emergency officials said. Footage of the incident showed groups of people using smaller pieces of ice as rafts, trying to row to the Russian coast as the giant ice floe with the stranded fishermen slowly drifted further away from the land. Russian state television said others, on the larger piece of ice, simply continued fishing. According to some of the Russian fishermen, by the time they had been rescued the frigid water rift between the ice floe and the coast was already 660 feet wide. State-run TV said all the rescued fishermen declined any help from doctors. It's the third time in a week that emergency services in the Sakhalin region had to rescue ice fishermen stuck on drifting glacial masses. On Jan. 22, around 300 people got stranded on an ice floe and on Sunday 600 others did. Local authorities blamed the fishermen for ignoring safety warnings and going ice fishing despite the danger of being stranded on ice floes. Tragedy was averted, and according to Russian TV, the fishermen even managed to bring their catch with them onto the rescue boats.",17,6.948331727841104,5.720366893249162,1.2279648345919423,27

The conviction was denounced by human rights advocates who feared for her safety if she was sent to a men's prison. The 53-year-old woman, known among friends as Michelle, has been undergoing hormone therapy for a couple years but is still legally male, so would have been sent to a men's prison had the sentence not been thrown out. She was freed Wednesday from a local detention facility for men after an upper court ruled in favor of her appeal, her legal advisor said in comments posted online. Michelle was convicted last November in her hometown, the provincial city of Bryansk, about 200 miles southwest of Moscow, on child pornography charges for sharing the cartoons on her personal VK page, a popular Russian equivalent of Facebook. The investigators said the images Michelle posted were used to ""meet persons of non-traditional sexual orientation."" ""The verdict has been canceled as unfair, the case was sent for a retrial,"" lawyer Maksim Olenichev, who was part of the defense team, said Wednesday. He linked the ruling to a large campaign organized by Russia's LGBTQ activists in support of Michelle. It was not immediately clear on what grounds the Bryansk Regional Court had overturned the lower court's November verdict. Michelle is likely to face the same charges in her retrial, but under a different judge. The Bryansk court was expected to release a full report detailing its decision in the coming days. The lower court had convicted her of ""distributing pornography depicting minors"" for sharing the erotic cartoons. Investigators concluded that she had posted the images to ""meet persons of non-traditional sexual orientation,"" according to the charges seen by CBS News. When the charges were made public, Human Rights Watch called them ""bogus,"" and friends and activists voiced concern that a men's prison could effectively make her three-year prison sentence a ""death sentence."" ""She will be either killed or heavily beaten there,"" predicted Lada Preobrazhenskaya, a trans blogger and friend of Michelle's who helped fight the charges. She cited the poor human rights record of Russia's prison system and low tolerance towards LGBTQ individuals among inmates, and Russians in general. The defense team argued that no one had been defined as a victim in the case, as the depicted ""minors"" were cartoon characters whose legal age could not be established. Michelle will remain free pending her retrial, per the ruling handed down on Wednesday.",13,6.649871625604113,4.075645775662817,2.5742258499412953,10

The operation began in early November, as a congressional impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump was underway. That inquiry examined whether Mr. Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens. The hacking campaign was carried out by the Russian intelligence agency GRU, according to Area 1, the Silicon Valley-based company that discovered the breach. It is unclear what kinds of materials the hackers accessed or sought. The New York Times was first to report on the hacking campaign. Area 1 said the GRU hacking group, also known as ""Fancy Bear,"" launched a phishing campaign targeting Burisma employees in an effort to steal their usernames and passwords and enable the hackers to access employee accounts. ""We don't know what (the GRU is) going to do,"" Area 1 co-founder and CEO Oren Falkowitz told CBS News in a phone interview. ""I can just tell you from my experience working for the U.S. government: It's impossible to know what a hacker wants. You can just sometimes see that they're doing it."" Falkowitz said he spent seven years working at the National Security Agency, including some with an elite hacking unit known as Tailored Access Operations. ""Our report is not noteworthy because we identify the GRU launching a phishing campaign, nor is the targeting of a Ukrainian company particularly novel,"" the report says. ""It is significant because Burisma Holdings is publically [sic] entangled in U.S. foreign and domestic politics."" U.S. intelligence officials concluded that Russian hackers linked to GRU were responsible for hacking the email servers of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election. The emails were eventually disseminated through DCLeaks and WikiLeaks and amplified by a network of bot accounts on social media. Intelligence agencies later concluded that the hack was designed to boost the election chances of Donald Trump and damage those of Hillary Clinton. ""The timing of the GRU's campaign in relation to the 2020 U.S. elections raises the spectre that this is an early warning of what we have anticipated since the successful cyberattacks undertaken during the 2016 U.S. elections,"" the Area 1 report said. Falkowitz warned that, ""The hackers' relatively low-tech approach is a reminder that cyber attacks do not have to be sophisticated to be successful. ... Once again, phishing attacks were the root cause of a cyber security incident, which is the case in 95% of cybersecurity damages."" The Biden campaign declined to comment on the specifics of the report, but seized on the findings to criticize the president. ""Donald Trump tried to coerce Ukraine into lying about Joe Biden and a major bipartisan, international anti-corruption victory because he recognized that he can't beat the Vice President. Now we know that Vladimir Putin also sees Joe Biden as a threat,"" the Biden campaign's rapid response director Andrew Bates told CBS News. ""Any American president who had not repeatedly encouraged foreign interventions of this kind would immediately condemn this attack on the sovereignty of our elections."" No evidence has emerged that Hunter or Joe Biden broke any U.S. or Ukrainian laws in relation to Hunter's tenure on the Burisma board. Burisma did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Area 1 also said the phishing campaign was connected to another one targeting a media organization founded by Zelensky.",3,6.735776152341741,2.801902923607216,3.9338732287345253,24

Le Monde reported this month that 15 Russian spies had passed through Haute-Savoie region, close to the Swiss and Italian borders. The paper said they were members of the 29155 unit of Russia's GRU military spy agency — the unit accused of carrying out operations including the attempted poisoning of defector Sergei Skripal in Britain. ""We are compelled with regret to note that the total lack of any proof did not serve as an obstacle for publishing openly Russo-phobic material,"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. ""We consider the article as disinformation aimed at supporting the myth of the Russian threat in the minds of the European public."" Le Monde had published a list of 15 Russian members of the unit, which it said added five more names to those already published by online investigative outlets such as Bellingcat and The Insider. It said Western intelligence services began an investigation retrospectively after the attempted poisoning of Skripal in the English town of Salisbury in March 2018. Britain and its allies accuse the Kremlin of seeking to assassinate Skripal, a charge vehemently denied by Russia. Those who stayed in the Haute-Savoie included Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov — the cover names of the two GRU agents accused of carrying out the attack on Skripal, Le Monde reported. Western intelligence services have not so far found any material left behind by the agents during their stays in France, Le Monde said. But their presence has been confirmed by where they ate, stayed and also shopped in Haute-Savoie, it said. But the Russian foreign ministry said the timing of the report — coming on the eve of a December 9 summit in Paris between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky — was ""not accidental"". ""It had the clear aim of damaging the reputation of Russia and discrediting the policy taken by French President Emmanuel Macron to normalise relations with Moscow,"" it added. The ministry said: ""Russia does not have, and never had, any intention of carrying out destabilizing operations in Europe.""",3,4.825604510251452,2.5589265093115796,2.2666780009398724,29

The Wikileaks website published an email over the weekend from a member of the team that investigated the attack in the town of Douma in April 2018 that accused the body of covering up discrepancies. Russia and its allies have seized on the email and an earlier document which both question the conclusion by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in March 2019 that chlorine was used in Douma, likely dropped from aircraft. Britain, France and the United States unleashed missile attacks on three suspected chemical weapons facilities run by President Bashar al-Assad's regime after the attack. First responders said 40 people were killed in the Douma chemical attack. OPCW inspectors who went to Syria to investigate the attack said they were delayed for days in accessing Douma by Russian and Syrian authorities, who claimed security would not permit the inspectors to reach the site. ""It is in the nature of any thorough inquiry for individuals in a team to express subjective views,"" OPCW Director General Fernando Arias said in a speech to the body's annual meeting in The Hague. ""While some of these diverse views continue to circulate in some public discussion forums, I would like to reiterate that I stand by the independent, professional conclusion"" of the probe. Just nine days after the attack on Douma, with the OPCW inspectors still held back by Russian and Syrian officials, CBS News' Seth Doane made it into the town and to the very house where the suspected chemical attack took place. ""All of a sudden some gas spread around us,"" one neighbor told Doane. ""We couldn't breathe, it smelled like chlorine."" Nasr Hanan's brother Hamzeh is one of the people who appeared in videos posted online by activists. Hamzeh was seen lifeless and foaming at the mouth. His brother told CBS News how Hamzeh had tried to wash the chemicals off of himself before succumbing. He also brought CBS News to the roof of the building, where a large missile still rested in a hole it appeared to have created when it struck. That shell, he said, is what delivered the noxious gas that killed his brother. The leak of the email comes amid tension over the designation of a new OPCW team that will for the first time have a mandate to name the culprits behind chemical attacks in Syria. Russia had opposed granting the team the new responsibility to officially point the finger over such attacks, and Moscow threatened to block next year's budget for the OPCW over it. The United States, Britain, France and other allied members of the OPCW believe, however, that they have enough support to pass the budget with a large majority at the annual meeting of the group's 193 member states in The Hague, which began on Monday. OPCW members agreed in 2018 to give the U.N.-backed agency the new powers to name culprits of chemical attacks. Details of the Douma incident have now been passed to the new OPCW team, Arias said. At the time of the initial Douma probe, the OPCW only had the mandate to say whether or not toxic arms had been used, not to name perpetrators. The email by an unidentified investigator quoted by Wikileaks expresses the ""gravest concern,"" saying the OPCW report ""misrepresents the facts"" and contains ""unintended bias."" It focuses on the levels of chlorine allegedly found at the site, and whether or not barrels believed to have contained the chemical had been dropped from the air or placed manually. The Russian-backed Syrian regime had complete control of the airspace over Douma and was the only power flying aircraft in the region at the time. Russia and Syria have alleged that the incident was staged since soon after it took place. Russia even attempted to bolster its case by bringing individuals who it identified as Syrians seen in ""staged"" videos after the attack to testify to the OPCW at The Hague. European OPCW members rejected the Russian-Syrian claims outright, and refused to attend the session at OPCW headquarters. ""This obscene masquerade does not come as a surprise from the Syrian government, which has massacred and gassed its own people for the last seven years,"" France's ambassador to the Netherlands, Philippe Lalliot, said in response. The OPCW has already launched an internal investigation into the leak of the earlier document by a member of the Douma team raising similar concerns. Also slated for discussion at this week's OPCW meeting is a proposal to add Novichok nerve agents to the organization's list of officially banned chemical weapons. Novichok was developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It was used in the attempted assassination last year of Russian spy-turned-double-agent Sergei Skripal in England. The U.K. accused Russia of the March 2018 attack in the quiet town of Salisbury, which sickened Skripal and his daughter and left one innocent resident dead from exposure to the toxic chemicals. Russia has continued to deny any involvement, but Britain's allies, including the U.S., expelled Russian diplomats from missions in their countries in solidarity with the United Kingdom.",3,0.0,0.0,0.0,5
