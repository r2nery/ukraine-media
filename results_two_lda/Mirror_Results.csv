Footage recorded in the Bakhmut area of Donetsk Oblast showed the TOS-1A Multiple Launch Rocket Systems hitting their targets. The footage from Russian media site RIA shared the video alongside the caption: “Wagner Group fighters use Solntepek heavy flamethrower systems to hit Ukrainian forces in Artemivsk and its suburbs, RIA Novosti reports.” Someone replied to the video saying: ""To be on the wrong side of TOS would have to be a terrifying experience. Ruptured lungs and GI tract have gotta be a terrible way to go."" Since losing Kherson city, Russia has moved the battle eastwards and locals in the Luhansk region have been reporting heavy fire close by. Ukraine and NATO countries accused Russia earlier in the war of using thermobaric bombs, which are also known as vacuum bombs and have much more brutal consequences than conventional explosives. A CIA report said thermobaric bombs can cause ""many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness”. The pressure wave from the explosive destroys delicate air sacs or can cause an embolism, as the wide area of the ignited particles makes people 'suck in' oxygen in the first stage of the blast. Dr Marcus Hellyer, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the thermobaric weapons were effective at their ""specific purpose"" of ""primarily destroying defensive positions"". Speaking to the Guardian, he added: ""They are not illegal even though their effects can be pretty horrific, because of that effect of creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders"". Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration, said in a Telegram on Tuesday: ""On November 15, one civilian was killed in Donetsk region – in Bakhmut. ""Seven more people in the region were injured. In addition, law enforcers discovered three bodies of civilians killed by Russians during the occupation – two in Sviatohirsk and one in Shchurove."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Donetsk is hell. ""There it is just hell — there are extremely fierce battles there every day. But our units are defending bravely — they are withstanding the terrible pressure of the invaders, preserving our defence lines,"" he said. Read more",17,0.0,0.0,0.0,27
2022-11-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/iron-curtain-europe-again-miles-28524353,'Iron Curtain' in Europe again as miles of wired fences erected on Russia border,"A new 'Iron Curtain' has emerged in Europe as Poland, Finland and Latvia reinforce their borders with barbed wire. More then three decades after the Berlin Wall fell a new frontier is happening as countries who share a border with Russia tighten their borders. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin they have begun reinforcing their borders over fears they could be swamped with those trying to escape the Kremlin's regime. Western officials have dubbed it ""weaponised migration"" and ""hybrid warfare"" with Russia and its ally Belarus has been using the tactics before the Ukraine invasion began in February. Thousands of asylum-seekers, many from the Middle East, were ushered to border checkpoints by Russia in northern Finland in 2015 and 2016. The EU accused Lukashenko of tempting migrants to Russia using false promises of a way into Europe and pushing them towards the Polish border where they would be forced to illegally cross into Europe. Poland then built 115 miles of steel walls and wire fences along its border. But as tensions between Russia and the West remain strained more European leaders have started toughening their frontiers. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin pledged to fortify parts of her country's 830-mile border with Russia, claiming they would help buffer a 'hybrid threat' of large-scale and irregular migration by the Kremlin. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are also expected to do the same and Poland last month put up barbed wire fences along the length of its border with Kaliningrad. It is estimated the new border barriers will stretch 2,106 miles in length by 2025. Fences and electronic surveillance will help improve control at borders and prevent large surges of asylum seekers but they will provide scant protection from missiles or tanks. The historic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 as the Soviet Union began collapsing brought hope of European cooperation with Moscow. But Putin sending tanks across the Ukrainian border on February 24 has brought a new era of confrontation and the formation of a new 'Iron Curtain' - by the West. Klaus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London said the ''barbed wire curtain'' is a ""reality for much of Europe"" ""The optimism that we had in Europe after 1989 is very much now gone."" Some EU countries built border fences after more than one million refugees entered southern Europe from Middle East and Africa in 2015. The need to erect stronger borders increased in 2021 after Belarusian autocrat Alexander Lukashenko forced thousands of people into Poland. Michal Baranowski, head of the Warsaw office of the German Marshal Fund think tank, said most analysts reckon Belarus coordinated its effort with the Kremlin to destabilise borders before the Ukraine war. Stanislaw Zaryn, a Polish government official conceded the border wall doesn't stop everyone. But he added: ""It does allow our forces to act rapidly and more efficiently, without the need to deploy as much manpower as before."" He believed Belarus and Russia would think twice before using migration as a weapon. But human rights activists in Poland argue the 18-foot steel wall on its border argue it keeps out the weakest but not determined people Dodds, however, added the use of walls and borders ""sucks empathy and compassion from our societies"".",29,0.0,0.0,0.0,10
2022-11-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-russian-torture-dungeon-liberated-28516170,Inside Russian 'torture dungeon' in liberated Kherson where Ukrainians were held,"Ukraine has revealed the ghastly reality of inside a Russian ""torture dungeon"" found in liberated Kherson. The gruesome discovery was made during a patrol of the city by the SBU secret service and national police officers, who were believed to have been tipped off by locals. In brutal conditions, the invaders interrogated “local patriots” who “refused to cooperate with the enemy”, said the Ukrainian government. The authorities said: “Kherson residents were interrogated and brutally tortured. During the inspection, torture law enforcement officers found objects that directly indicate signs of torture.” Among the sinister finds were gas masks and bottles of liquid which are now being analysed. Wall markings from inmates were used to count the days they were held for. They claim to have found 11 illegal prisons and four torture chambers in Kherson after it was liberated. More than 700 people have been reported missing. Interior minister Denys Monastyrsky said the investigation into crimes there had only just begun, ""so many more dungeons and burial places will be uncovered"". Writing from a detainee on the wall of the hell chamber says: ""Pray to God for us. God, give us strength. God, save and protect."" There was also evidence that the Russians sought to clear away evidence before they fled Kherson. “A series of investigative and operational measures are being carried out to document all the crimes of the occupiers, identify the culprits and bring them to justice,” said the Ukrainian government. The Ukrainian minister of internal affairs, Denys Monastyrskyi, also said in a TV interview broadcast on Wednesday that the bodies of 63 people who had been tortured were found in the Kherson region. He said exhumations were ongoing. Oleksandr Kuzmin said to the Washington Post he was held in the detention centre for a day, during which people he suspected to be FSB agents smashed his leg with a hammer. He said that in a room below his cell, he could hear people screaming in pain and a young man he shared a cell with had electric shocks by the Russians on his nipples and penis. The Washington Post revealed that prisoners were forced to say, “Hail Putin” or “Hail Russia” to receive meals. Russia this month staged a humiliating retreat by Vladimir Putin ’s forces from the provincial capital in the face of a powerful Ukrainian counteroffensive. A feature of Russian retreats has been the discovery of torture chambers used by the occupiers. Read more",13,0.0,0.0,0.0,22
2022-11-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/dnipro-missile-attack-caught-camera-28514253,Missile attack caught on camera as commuters in cars hit by huge explosion,"At least four people have been killed and more than a dozen others wounded in drone and missile strikes around Ukraine with one horror video showing the moment of a blast. Air raid sirens sounded all across Ukraine early Thursday as the Kremlin unleashed its sixth mass attack since early October. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a terrifying video that he said was one of the blasts in Dnipro. The video from a vehicle dashcam shows cars heading down a road on Thursday morning before a fiery blast engulfs a rainy road and a huge fireball explodes. The attack wounded at least 14 people, among them a teenage girl. Maria Avdeeva, Research Director at the European Expert Association in Ukraine, wrote on Twitter : ""The moment of explosion in Dnipro. People commuting to work in the morning. Currently, 14 are injured, including a 15-year-old girl."" In Kyiv, the city’s military administration said air defences shot down at least two cruise missiles and five Iranian-made exploding drones, but some missiles and drones still got through in Dnipro and Odesa. According to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Russian troops hit the building of the Pivdennyi Machine-Building Plant, Ukraine’s largest aerospace manufacturer. Dnipro mayor Borys Filatov said a city hall employee was caught up in this morning’s attack while out helping elderly women. He said the employee is being operated on and shrapnel was stuck in her coat. ""During today’s rocket (attack), she and her colleague were just doing their job. Helping infirm elderly women"", he said. Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, said a large fire erupted in Dnipro after the strikes on the city hit an industrial target. A Russian strike that hit a residential building also killed at least four people overnight in Vilnia in the Zaporizhzhia region. Zelensky said: ""This is another confirmation from Dnipro of how terrorists want peace. The peaceful city and people’s wish to live their accustomed lives. Going to work, to their affairs. A rocket attack!” State energy company Naftogaz said that the Russian missile strikes on Thursday damaged or destroyed some of Ukraine’s gas production facilities. “Currently, we know of several objects that have been destroyed. Others have suffered damage of varying degrees,” Naftogaz chief executive Oleksiy Chernyshov said. The strikes came on the same morning that the Black Sea grain deal was extended by 120 days with the efforts of Turkey and the United Nations. “Grain Deal will be prolonged for 120 days. Ukraine together with [UN Secretary-General] Antonio Guterres and [Turkish President] Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a key decision in the global fight against the food crisis. Waiting for the official announcement from partners – Türkiye and UN,” Zelensky said on Twitter. Read more",17,0.0,0.0,0.0,27
2022-11-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/poland-missile-attack-nato-jolted-28505698,NATO 'jolted into near-war catastrophe' after 2 killed in Poland missile strike,"This was the knife-edge escalation that NATO leaders have been bracing for over the past nine months of brutal warfare in Ukraine. Thousands of missiles have been fired at Ukraine, most of them aimed at and many of them hitting, civilian targets. Soon after a missile smashed into Przewodow, just inside Poland’s border, a flurry of calls were made between NATO’s 30 member states. Last night (15 November) a missile struck NATO -member Poland, killing two people, just outside of the rural Polish village - about four miles (6.4 kilometers) west from the Ukrainian border. While it appears to have been an ""unfortunate accident"", it currently is not known who fired the missile, or precisely where it was fired from. Following this, world leaders gathering at the G20 summit in Bali are attempting to diffuse a potential escalation in the months-long Ukraine war. Meanwhile, NATO ambassadors have also met in Brussels to assess how to react to Russia's war spilling over into a member state, with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg telling reporters: ""Let me be clear, this is not Ukraine's fault. ""Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine."" Poland immediately called for NATO article 4 escalation - a demand for NATO to meet and discuss how to react - but one step from article 5 and possible war. Unnamed US intelligence officials and others behind the scenes ignited the escalation, stating that it was a Russian missile, leaving the world on a knife-edge, fearing all-out war. Behind the scenes NATO analysts were examining spy plane records of missile trajectories and hoovered up communication between Russian commanders. They will have quickly established whether Russia deliberately targeted Poland, whether it was an Russian overshoot or if Ukraine’s air defences had overshot. As the intelligence analysts worked away Poland’s military mobilised to the border and was put on high-alert. But US President Joe Biden ’s swift casting of doubt on whether it was a deliberate Russian attack calmed the mood. In the cold light of day even article 4 now looks unlikely. The G20 summit means western ambassadors were able unofficially to meet and talk about early indications of what really happened, avoiding the need for article 4. It now appears one or two Russian-made S-300 air-defence missiles landed inside Poland, hitting a grain silo and killing two victims. These are ground-to-air weapons, similarly used by Ukraine, primarily used to intercept incoming missiles. But Russia, desperately short of missiles, has adapted S-300’s to be fired at ground targets and they are notoriously inaccurate. These are thought to have a range of little more than 300 miles so could possibly have been fired from a warplane launched from Russian ally Belarus. They can be adapted to fire further, with lighter warheads and boosters to lengthen their journey. The target would likely be Lviv, in western Ukraine, a hub for incoming supplies from Poland, including weapons, or an infrastructure site nearby. In one day alone a record 100 missiles were fired into Ukraine on Tuesday so Kyiv’s air-defences were working at breakneck speed to shoot them down. Even if the missile strike in Poland was an S-300 Ukrainian air-defence missile, as NATO now believed is likely, these weapons would not be fired without provocation from Russia. A Russian missile was very likely fired close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, triggering Ukraine’s air defences. So without Russian missiles piling into Ukraine at such a deadly rate two people in Poland would not have been killed and the west, including the UK, would not have been jolted into a near-war catastrophe. Even though the blast appears not to be deliberate and may indeed have been a stray Ukraine air defence missile it is still a Russian provocation testing NATO resolve.",29,3.804437849207913,4.257602359182457,-0.4531645099745445,27
2022-11-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mystery-vladimir-putins-crony-colonel-28504451,Mystery as Vladimir Putin's crony colonel found dead in his office in Russia,"Russian President Vladimir Putin 's close crony has been found shot dead in his office in Russia in a mysterious discovery. Colonel Vadim Boyko, 44, was closely involved with the despot's mobilisation campaign for the war in Ukraine. In September, Putin announced a ""partial mobilisation"" of military reservists in Russia, meaning that thousands of untrained Russians were called up to fight in a desperate bid to prop up his failing war in Ukraine. According to reports, Boyko - who was also the deputy head of the prestigious Makarov Pacific Higher Naval School in Vladivostok - was found with ""multiple bullet wounds"" to his body. The dad-of two, who was reported to be in charge of armaments and ammunition at the elite academy, came into work as usual. But as he entered his office, five shots were heard soon after, reports say. A duty officer who heard the sound of gunfire then rushed to the scene and saw Boyko's body. While initial reports in Russia said that suicide was suspected, BAZA media - which has close law enforcement links - said criminal investigators had found five shell casings and four Makarov pistols beside the dead colonel. The BAZA report went on to question how the colonel could have shot himself in the chest five times. The report was also quick to challenge the suicide story as no suicide note was found, according to reports. Boyko is the latest Russian senior figure to have die in mysterious circumstances since the war started in February. Last month the body of lieutenant colonel Roman Malyk, 49, was found on a fence in the Primorsky region, in the southern far east, in the south-eastern part of Russia. The military commissar was in charge of enlistment for Putin’s chaotic mobilisation campaign in his district. While initially a suicide was suspected, a murder probe was late ropened. But then - just five days later - investigators claimed suicide was the likely cause of death. However, the FederalPress Telegram channel reported that Malyk's relatives and friends are disputing the cops findings, and have insisted that he was “balanced and self-confident”. They added that the married father-of-two a veteran of Russia’s war in Chechnya, and he proved his loyalty to Russia by being in charge of enlistment in Partizan district and surrounding areas in Primorsky region. Meanwhile, almost 100 military enlistment offices have been hit with Molotov cocktails amid anger over the tyrant's mobilisation plans.",14,4.318362012264669,4.4057838107421246,-0.08742179847745568,12

The image shows a mangled farm vehicle on the edge of a hole which is at least six-feet deep and around 20-feet wide, which was reportedly left in the ground after the missile hit. Two people died in the incident after missile landed in Przewodow - a village just three miles from the border with Ukraine. The bomb rocked the farm yesterday around 3.40pm and it's widely believed that the missile was Russian. Russia has denied any involvement, blaming Ukraine and a potential Western conspiracy instead. Whoever the missile was fired by, locals have been left traumatised after the ""whistling"" explosives shattered their small village yesterday. It comes as a leaked report from Germany's top military brass contends that a Russian invasion of Europe is at breaking point - and at its most likely since 1945. The document urges Germany to prepare itself for war or face being wiped off the map. The Ukraine crisis continues to simmer with Poland saying that a Russian-made missile fell in the east of the country killing two people - although US President Joe Biden said it was ""unlikely"" to have been fired from Vladimir Putin's army. But if Russia did attack a NATO country then it would lead to a united response from the treaty members to repel it. And German military leaders have said that the country needs to be better prepared as they believe this possibility of a European invasion is at its highest since World War Two. This is according to confidential documents that have been leaked to the German publication Der Spiegel. R ussia has denied involvement in the missile explosions, claiming reports were ""deliberate provocation to escalate the situation"" - seemingly referring to the war Vladimir Putin started in Ukraine. The Russian Defence Ministry came out strongly against reports this evening that two Russian missiles landed in the eastern Polish town of Przewodow, and killed two people. The ministry said: ""Statements by the Polish media and officials about the alleged fall of 'Russian' missiles in the area of the settlement of Przewodow is a deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation. ""No strikes were made against targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border by Russian means of destruction."" In the past Russia has spoken out aggressively about Poland's role in getting supplies from NATO countries to Ukraine. Some military experts have warned the strike, if purposeful, could be a ""test"" of the west by Russian forces.

Ekaterina Gubareva, 39, was reported missing today by her husband before confirmation that she had been held by Russian law enforcement. Since June she has been the deputy head of the Russian “civil-military administration” in the annexed Kherson region but is now in detention. Previously, the high-profile separatist official was the “foreign minister” of the Russian self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic [DPR]. Her confused fate may be a sign that Putin is losing control of his machine in occupied areas of Ukraine which the Kremlin still claims to hold. Seen as an ultra loyalist, sanctioned by the EU, reports say she travelled to Moscow to seek to silence her accusers but was detained when she returned to occupied Ukraine. While Russia has lost Kherson city, it still holds swathes of the Kherson region. A source told the independent Russian news outlet Caution News her enemies “decided to close her down. She tried to negotiate. She even went to Moscow….in the end she was arrested.” Military correspondent Semyon Pegov confirmed she had been detained over “economic crimes"", believed to relate to the theft of state cash by an organised group. He continued: ""Among other things, Ekaterina was absent from the Kherson region during the [recent] planned evacuation of the civilian population."" Law enforcement was now “carrying out appropriate procedures”. A computer scientist and artist, her husband Pavel Gubarev, 39, is also a prominent figure in separatist circles. He headed the mobilisation department of the defence ministry in the DPR and was a member of the neo-Nazi Russian National Unity grouping. In 2014 he was a leader of the self-proclaimed Putin-backing confederate state of Novorossiya in Ukraine. The father-of-three said today: “Around 4.30pm yesterday, my wife Ekaterina Gubareva disappeared. She has not been in contact since that time. “The last place where she was seen was the building of the government of the Kherson region in Genichesk. “Attempts to call Vladimir Saldo - [head of the annexed region] - to find out her whereabouts have so far been unsuccessful.” Read more",14,4.839245938908545,4.8864940007172315,-0.04724806180868679,1

The claims come after a senior US intelligence officer confirmed the incident that took place this afternoon. The missiles landed at the Polish town, at a grain silo, taking two lives and it is not yet known if it was a deliberate strike of an accidental impact. The incident could have massive ramifications for the war in Ukraine and the west because Poland is a NATO member, meaning it could invoke article 5 which states an attack on one member state is treated as an attack on them all. Already, a number of countries have come out against Russia after the missile strike killed two. In Poland, the country's prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, convened the Committee of the Council of Ministers for National Security and Defence Affairs ""as a matter of urgency"", government spokesman Piotr Müller confirmed. Müller said the meeting was being held due to a 'crisis situation' and started at 8pm GMT this evening. The missile struck in a village north of the Ukrainian city of Lviv, which has regularly been targeted by Russian strikes. Polish authorities and the army raced to the area and set up a cordon around the aftermath of the impact site. Armed forces are reportedly on 'high alert' and military planes were said to be scrambled in response and were in the air in the region. Images emerging from the aftermath of the strike show destroyed farm equipment and a large crater in the ground where the missiles exploded. Locals reportedly heard two explosions when the missiles fell and the Foreign Office confirmed it was 'urgently' investigating. A spokesperson said: ""We are aware of these reports and are urgently seeking clarity."" The Pentagon took a firm line on the incident but refused to confirm the incident and repeated previous promises of President Joe Biden and Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder reportedly said: ""When it comes to our security commitments and Article 5, we have been crystal clear: we will defend every inch of NATO territory.""

The two armies are now in a race against time as winter approaches to replenish ammo and weapons stocks amid fears Winter freezes will cause more battlefield casualties. Western officials also believe Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s brutal mercenary unit The Wagner Group is fast becoming part of Moscow’s regular military. Out of around 100,00 Russian troops currently fighting in Ukraine several thousand Wagner fighters - many of them ex-jailbirds- are on the frontline. And the west believes Wagner’s brutal, filmed “sledgehammer execution” of 55 year-old deserter Yevgeny Nuzhin was a warning to other recruits. Nuzhin changed sides as a defector and was then abducted and hammered to death by fighters working for Wagner, headed by Putin’s “chef” Yevgeny Prigozhin. The Wagner leader recruited many of his fighters from Russia ’s jails in return for clemency, despite their crimes, such as murder, kidnapping and robbery. It is believed Russia has just 120 Iskander missiles left and a mere month’s supply remaining of artillery shells available for the battlefield. Russia is also increasingly relying upon Iranian made, explosives -tipped Kamikaze drones, most of which are being shot down by Ukrainian defence systems. A Western official said: “Munitions supply is a big, limiting factor for both sides and that’s why we’ve seen the Russians going to great lengths to replenish. “The Ukrainians are doing the same thing. “We are still expecting to grind and it to be largely static, expecting neither side to win or lose and that extends all the way through 2023. “If people are expecting the collapse of forces on either side we can’t see anything which would indicate that from now through to the end of the year. “Neither side is in such a condition for their forces to collapse.” Officials said the horrific sledgehammer execution is likely to be probed as part of the near 40,000 alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces and their proxies. One said: “On the execution video - the use of a hammer as a tool is something which we’ve seen from Wagner before in the Syria conflict. “It’s absolutely messaging, aimed at the various people who have been conscripted and from prisons and from elsewhere - and the choices they will make. “It’s a brutalisation of war and I expect it’s an extra-judicial killing expected to feature in further investigations in due course.” The official added that the “Wagner Group now appears to be becoming more a part of Russian forces.” Even though fighting may slow down during the Winter freeze it may cause more deaths One source said temperatures are plummeting form 13 degrees to freezing and added that this will cut short the time needed to get casualties to aid stations, called the “Golden Hour.” The source said: “That impacts the golden hour - so we can expect more, more fatalities as a consequence of injuries on the battlefield.”",14,4.130088698801169,3.9860465261240323,0.14404217267713637,29
2022-11-15,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-kyiv-hit-missile-strikes-28496959,Kyiv hit by missile strikes as residential buildings seen burning,"Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of launching a barrage of strikes on civilian targets across the country, including in the capital Kyiv. Mayor Vladimir Klitschko reported two residential buildings were hit and Kyrylo Tymoshenko of the President's Office has shared a video of the aftermath of the strike with buildings engulfed in flames. The city of Kryvyi Rih, Poltava and Cherkasy regions have been hit, according to their respective city and regional heads. Hitting residential buildings constitutes a war crime and the barrage from Moscow’s depleting missile stock happened within hours of the Ukrainian President celebrating Kherson as akin to D-Day starting the end of World War II. The explosions sent plumes of smoke rising above the capital and sirens were heard across the city as medics raced to Kyiv’s Pechersk district, a wealthy area that is home to many embassies. At least four missiles were shot down over the capital, city officials said and the air attacks also smashed into targets in Lviv in the far west and Kharkiv — as the entire country was put on air-raid alert and braced for rising civilian casualties. On Twitter, it was claimed that Russia launched more than 100 missiles - targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure. At least one person has been killed after one missile hit a Kyiv building, the reports say. Electricity is out in half of Kyiv, 80 per cent of Lviv, as well as parts of Odesa, Mykolaiv, Dnipro. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget A Brink has described the series of attacks launched today by Russia on Ukraine as “another round of cruel attacks.” Several missile strikes also hit Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's native city and emergency services battled to rescue survivors. Both sides are now in a race against time as winter approaches to replenish ammo and weapons stocks amid fears Winter freezes will cause more battlefield casualties.

2022-11-15,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-russian-missiles-land-nato-27740368,Russian missiles land in NATO-member Poland killing 2 causing 'crisis situation',"Two Russian missiles have landed in NATO state Poland, killing two people and prompting a furious backlash from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and western heads of state as Russia denied the reports. The rockets fell on a farm in Przewodow, a village in eastern Poland, close to the Ukraine border where they exploded around 3:40pm local time yesterday afternoon. It is not yet known if the strike was intentional or not. The Polish Foreign Ministry said a Russian produced rocket had hit a grain drying facility in the farm, and confirmed they had since summoned the Russian ambassador. Three US officials speaking anonymously on Wednesday morning said that preliminary assessments suggested a missile could have been fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian projectile, resulting in the explosion. The incident could have serious ramifications because of Poland's status as a NATO country, meaning it could opt to invoke NATO's Article 5 - which states an attack on one member state is treated as an attack on them all. But reports suggest that the 30 member states will meet tomorrow morning as Article 4 may be activated instead, allowing NATO members to bring issues of concern to the bloc for discussion. A press secretary for the Pentagon warned: ""When it comes to our security commitments and Article 5, we have been crystal clear: we will defend every inch of NATO territory."" US President Joe Biden, who was woken up by his advisors to inform him of the attack, has called Polish President Andrzej Duda to express his ""deep condolences"" for the loss of life. He later held an emergency meeting of G7 world leaders in Bali, and afterwards told reporters that ""preliminary information"" suggested the missile may not have been fired from Russia itself. ""I don't want to say that until we completely investigate, but it's unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia, but we'll see"", he added. Russia dismissed claims of an attack on Polish soil as a 'deliberate provocation' - but Ukraine said that it had warned of such an attack for a long time. At 8pm GMT, government ministers in Poland gathered to discuss the incident and raised the readiness of parts of the country's army as they continued to investigate throughout the night. Poland's Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, convened the Committee of the Council of Ministers for National Security and Defence Affairs ""as a matter of urgency"" this evening, government spokesman Piotr Müller confirmed. Müller did not immediately confirm the reports of the US intelligence official and said the meeting was being held due to a 'crisis situation'. He confirmed two people had been killed, and said Poland was looking into whether it could activate NATO Article 4 - an article that lets members bring any issue of concern to the table for discussion. This would trigger a meeting of all NATO members. Reports since have suggested that Poland will trigger Article 4 and bring together NATO's member states for a meeting over the incident this morning. Poland President Andrzej Duda also announced a further meeting of the National Security Council, which will be held at midday on Wednesday. The two people who were killed were said to have died at the scene following the impact of the rockets, thought to have happened some time yesterday afternoon. Initially, local fire services confirmed an explosion in the area but it later emerged that rockets had fallen there. Both Russian missiles, according to Mirror sources, were S-300 weapons and Polish fighter jets were scrambled from Tomaszow-Lubelski airfield. Images from the impact site of the rockets show burnt and twisted farm equipment, destroyed by the rockets and a huge crater in the ground. Another image shows a plume of smoke rising into the air after the attack. Further pictures show had large bits of metal debris thrown across the area. Reports suggest local residents heard two explosions when the rockets fell, and the area remains cordoned off as Polish authorities investigate. NATO's Article 5 focuses on the principle of collective defence, and that any of its members is duty-bound to come to the aid of any other under attack. The bloc itself says this focus on 'collective defence' is at the 'very heart of NATO's founding treaty'. Simply put, an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all NATO members. So a deliberate attack on Poland is an attack on the UK and US according to the treaty. Article 5 was last used in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack. Click here to read more about NATO's Article 5. Jens Stoltenberg, the General Secretary of NATO, said it was 'closely monitoring' the incident. He tweeted: ""Spoke with President Duda about the explosion in Poland. I offered my condolences for the loss of life. NATO is monitoring the situation and Allies are closely consulting. Important that all facts are established."" The British Foreign Office were also 'urgently seeking clarity' like many countries who are scrambling to confirm all the facts before launching any action against Russia that could lead to the escalation of the war. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: ""I have just spoken with the Foreign Secretary and Defence Secretary. We are urgently looking into reports of a missile strike in Poland and will support our allies as they establish what has happened. ""We are also coordinating with our international partners, including NATO."" Politico reported that US officials believed the explosion wasn't caused by the remnants of a missile shot down by Ukraine armed forces, but rather a deliberate strike or an errant missile. Following the deaths, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russian terror would only continue to spread. In a video message this evening, he said: ""Today, something that we have been warning for a long time has also happened. Terror is not limited to our state borders. Russian missiles hit Poland ... hit missiles on NATO territory. ""It's a matter of time before Russian terror goes further. The longer Russia feels impunity, the more threats there will be for anyone who is in range of Russian missiles."" One of Zelensky's advisors said the attack was a 'disguised mistake' and not an accident but a 'deliberately planned hello'. Lord Richard Dannatt, former head of the British Army, told Sky News: ""Modern technology is pretty accurate, so it's quite difficult to explain away that this might have been an accident. ""If it wasn't an accident then it was a test of the West's response, and that's something that's got to be thought through very carefully."" Latvia's Minister of Defence, Artis Pabriks expressed their condolences to Poland and blasted the Russian regime as 'criminal'. Scenes from the on the ground this evening show a heavy presence of emergency services at the rural town as Poland continues its investigation. The Estonian Foreign Ministry: ""Latest news from Poland is most concerning. We are consulting closely with Poland and other Allies. Estonia is ready to defend every inch of NATO territory. We’re in full solidarity with our close ally Poland."" The Russian Defence Ministry denied reports of the attack and claimed it had nothing to do with them. It said: ""Statements by the Polish media and officials about the alleged fall of 'Russian' missiles in the area of the settlement of Przewodow is a deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation. ""No strikes were made against targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border by Russian means of destruction."" Neighbouring Moldova was also affected by more Russian strikes today after their bombardment of Ukraine knocked out power to much of the nation. The Pentagon said it is looking into the reports around the explosion but could not currently corroborate them. Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder reportedly said: ""When it comes to our security commitments and Article 5, we have been crystal clear: we will defend every inch of NATO territory."" Lithuania's president echoed this message as well and Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said on Twitter that the agency had seen reports out of Poland and was working with the Polish government to gather more information. Poland plays a vital role in NATO supplies reaching Ukraine and Russia has warned in the past of its actions supporting Kyiv. Russian ally Hungary have also convened a meeting of his country's defence council after the explosion in the eastern Polish village led to crude shipments on the Druzhba pipeline being suspended. Germany, long criticised for not taking a hard enough line on Russia, spoke out on the attack as well. The country's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said: ""My thoughts are with Poland, our close ally and neighbor. We are monitoring the situation closely and are in contact with our Polish friends and NATO allies."" It is not known if the missiles were a purposeful strike or an unintended consequence of its missile strikes on Ukraine which included strikes on Lviv in western Ukraine, just 50 miles from the border. But the action comes during the ongoing G20 summit where Putin's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov is present after Putin snubbed the meeting. French president Emmanuel Macron said the G20 meeting would be an important moment to highlight what has happened in Poland. Since the attack, Russian markets have responded and are significantly down and when confronted on the allegations over the deaths, Kremlin spokesperson told ITV News that: ""Unfortunately I don’t have any information on that."" Today, Russia also pounded Ukraine's energy facilities with one of its biggest barrage of missiles yet, causing widespread blackouts. They fired at least 90 missiles, estimated to be worth approaching half a billion dollars in total, in the shocking attack - one of the largest of its kind since the war began in February this year. Zelensky said around ten million Ukrainians were left without power, including most of the city of Lviv and the entire Kharkiv region.",29,3.70695071425719,5.66765872564375,-1.96070801138656,10
2022-11-14,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/zelensky-declares-russias-withdrawal-kherson-28487541,Zelensky declares Russia's withdrawal from Kherson 'beginning of the end' of war,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a triumphant visit to the newly liberated city of Kherson and hailed the Russian withdrawal as the ""beginning of the end of the war"". But he also acknowledged the heavy price Ukrainian soldiers are paying in their grinding effort to push back the invading force. The retaking of Kherson was one of Ukraine's biggest successes in nearly nine months since the invasion. It served another stinging blow to the Kremlin and could become a springboard for further advances into occupied territory. Zelensky walked the streets of the city on Monday, just hours after warning in his nightly video address of booby traps and mines left behind by the Russians before their retreat. ""This is the beginning of the end of the war,"" he said. ""We are step by step coming to all the temporarily occupied territories."" The end of Russia 's occupation of the city has sparked days of celebration - but also exposed a humanitarian emergency, with residents living without power and water and short of food and medicines. Russia still controls about 70% of the wider Kherson region. Zelensky has previously appeared unexpectedly in other front-line areas at crucial junctures of the war and his latest visit was both laden with symbolism and the common touch - clearly aimed at boosting the morale of both soldiers and civilians alike. In video published by a presidential aide, a visibly moved Zelensky stood with his right hand on his heart and sang the national anthem, as troops saluted and stood to attention and soldiers steadily hauled the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag up a flagpole. Other footage showed Zelensky waving to residents who saluted him from an apartment window and yelled: ""Glory to Ukraine!"" The reply - ""Glory to the heroes!"" - came back from Zelensky's group, made up of soldiers and others. The president also distributed medals to Ukrainian soldiers in a central square and posed for selfies with them. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday refused to comment on Zelensky's visit to Kherson, saying only that ""you know that it is the territory of the Russian Federation"". The Kremlin illegally annexed the Kherson region and three others earlier this year. After the Russian retreat, Ukrainian authorities say they are finding evidence of torture and other atrocities. In his nightly video address on Sunday, Zelensky said without giving details that ""investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes, and the bodies of both civilians and military personnel have been found."" ""In the Kherson region, the Russian army left behind the same atrocities as in other regions of our country,"" he said. ""We will find and bring to justice every murderer. Without a doubt."" Residents said departing Russian troops plundered the city, carting away loot as they withdrew last week. They also wrecked key infrastructure before retreating across the wide Dnieper River to its east bank. One Ukrainian official described the situation in Kherson as ""a humanitarian catastrophe."" Reconnecting the electricity supply is the priority, with gas supplies already assured, Kherson regional governor Yaroslav Yanushevych said. The Russian pullout marked a triumphant milestone in Ukraine's pushback against Moscow's invasion almost nine months ago. In the past two months, Ukraine's military claimed to have retaken dozens of towns and villages north of the city of Kherson.",14,5.673315631868588,3.556340729606425,2.116974902262163,1
2022-11-14,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/traumatised-sons-hit-out-vladimir-28486937,Traumatised sons hit out at Putin's 'fascists' who sledgehammered dad to death,"The Russian sons of a fighter bludgeoned to death ""for treachery"" have denounced the barbaric killing by a pro-Vladimir Putin mercenary army closely linked to the Russian president's defence ministry. Horrific footage, too graphic for the Mirror to show, was released showing convicted murderer Yevgeny Nuzhin, 55, being killed with a sledgehammer in an extrajudicial killing by the notorious private Russian military group, Wagner. The convict had been released from prison to go to fight against Ukraine but then he absconded, defecting to Ukraine, and criticised Putin’s war by claiming that he and others were “cannon fodder”. However, it appears Ukraine may have traded him back for possibly 20 of their own PoWs. Back in Russia, Nuzhin was evidently handed back by Putin’s officials to Wagner, which is run by his close crony Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as “Putin's chef”. An appalling video called Hammer of Vengeance was released by pro-Russian sources, possibly to deter in the most sickening way other defectors among Russia’s convicts fighting at the front, and other mobilised men. The horrific footage showed an unidentified man appearing to attack Nuzhin with a sledgehammer as he falls to the ground and is beaten to death. Speaking out about the killing, Nuzhin's eldest son Ilya Nuzhin, 31, said: “He was killed without a court investigation, killed like an animal.” Nuzhin's second son Nikita, 28, added: “Even animals aren’t killed like this…” Both sons had served in the Russian army while their father was serving his 24-year sentence. Ilya told Vladimir Osechkin, head of human rights group gulagu.net : “We are shocked - we have just seen this video today. There is no way to prepare yourself for this. We are petrified... “I started watching it with my wife. She shrieked with horror and I started to shake when I saw that. The whole family cried, even those who didn’t like him. The whole family cried. No-one deserves this... “Even though he was a convict, he served more than 20 years. He was unarmed, a prisoner of war.” Ilya also blamed Ukraine for exchanging his father in the knowledge he would face reprisals for his defection, he said: “The man wanted to live, he wanted to get back to his family. [Ukrainians] you gave him away to our men. “To those b***, who are an illegal armed formation [Wagner] who were waiting for exactly a case like this one, to execute them. “I can only say one thing. Our men are fascists - but theirs are just the same.” He added: “If he was passed [in a PoW swap], then all of them, starting from the jail he was in, the colony number 3 in the Ryazan region, Prigozhin, and ending up with Putin, they all deserve the same…. “Our father was killed like an animal.” Prigozhin has already sought to justify the killing, saying it was a “dog’s death to the dog”. He said: “Nuzhin betrayed his people, betrayed his comrades, betrayed consciously. He was not captured and did not surrender, but planned his escape. Nuzhin is a traitor.” The human rights group called for protection for the Nuzhin's family in Russia as the sons fear for the safety of themselves and their families amid accusations of treachery against their father.",13,5.03233026038862,5.954890569146492,-0.9225603087578724,12

The Ukrainian military has now claimed that the powerful shot is the second-longest sniper kill in the world, knocking the kill by British former soldier Craig Harrison out of second place. The images, which were obtained by the National Guard of Ukraine on November 11, along with a statement, show one of Vladimir Putin 's soldiers being ""eliminated by a precise shot"" 2.70 kilometres or 8,891 feet away. The statement reads: ""With the onset of dusk, snipers of special forces units of the National Guard go hunting. Very quick and accurate work by one of them last night."" The images were also relayed by the Office of Strategic Communications (StratCom) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on November 13, along with a statement saying: ""A Ukrainian sniper came very close to the world record for the longest combat sniper shot. ""The occupier was eliminated by a precise shot of our special forces from a distance of 2,710 metres - a distance that now ranks 2nd in the world ranking, confirmed by the command of the Armed Forces."" It continued to prompt: ""We would like to remind [people] that the first place in the world is occupied by a shot from a Canadian sniper at a distance of 3,540 metres [11,614 feet] while performing a task in Iraq. ""The second place belonged to the British Craig Harrison, at a distance of 2,475 metres [8,120 feet]."" Craig Harrison, formerly a cavalry Corporal in the British Army, held the world record for the longest sniper kill while he was serving in the British Army in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2009. A confirmed sniper kill in combat, he shot and killed two Taliban machine gunners from a distance of 2,475 metres. And in 2017, a sniper from Joint Task Force 2 neutralised an Islamic State target in Iraq at a distance of over 3,540 metres. This kill shot was confirmed with video footage and a statement from Canada's Armed Forces, saying: ""The Canadian Special Operations Command can confirm that a member of Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target at 3,540 metres."" Today has marked the 264th day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, after Russia's tyrant invaded the country on the February 24, in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"". The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has reported that between February 24 and November 14, Russia has lost about: 81,370 personnel, 2,848 tanks, 5,748 armoured combat vehicles, 1,839 artillery units, 393 multiple launch rocket systems, 206 air defence systems, 278 warplanes, 261 helicopters, 1,509 drones, 399 cruise missiles, 16 warships, 4,316 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 160 units of special equipment. However, Russia has claimed that its casualties have been much lower than reported, despite providing infrequent updates on its latest figures. Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has described the situation where Russian forces destroyed key infrastructure in the southern city of Kherson before they retreated as ""severe"", due to the lack of water, food and medicine. He added that Ukrainian forces had to painstakingly remove nearly 2,000 mines, tripwires and unexploded shells that had been left by the retreating Russian forces. Despite this, citizens across Ukraine have hailed the recapture of the southern city, as images of of locals welcoming the Ukrainian forces with tears of joy have made headlines around the world. Yaroslav Yanushevych, the Ukrainian Governor of the Kherson region, said that everything was being done to ""return normal life"" to the region. However, Zelensky on Sunday accused Russian soldiers of committing war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson, saying: ""Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. ""Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered.""",14,7.379007019023211,4.531773836896202,2.8472331821270087,8
2022-11-12,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/uk-says-putin-humiliated-after-28472467,UK says Putin 'humiliated' after failure and Russians ask 'what was it all for',"Russia has only achieved ""international isolationism and humiliation"" from its invasion of Ukraine, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. In a bold statement, Mr Wallace said the retreat of Vladimir Putin's invading forces from the key city of Kherson marks ""another strategic failure"" after Russia failed to achieve any of its key goals other than taking the city. It comes as the retreat is said to have cause ""panic"" in Russian ranks. Mr Wallace said in a statement today: “Russia’s announced withdrawal from Kherson marks another strategic failure for them. In February, Russia failed to take any of its major objectives except Kherson. “Now with that also being surrendered, ordinary people of Russia must surely ask themselves: ‘What was it all for?’ “The Russian army has suffered a huge loss of life as a result of their illegal invasion and have only achieved international isolationism and humiliation. Ukraine will press on. “The UK and the international community will continue to support them, and while the withdrawal is welcome, no one is going to underestimate the continuing threat posed by the Russian Federation.” The Russian retreat from Kherson marks the end of one of the bloodiest battles in the war so far. The retreat is said to have cause ""panic"" in Russian ranks, according to one an adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister. but cautioned the war is “far from over”. Yuriy Sak told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We always believed that we will liberate Kherson. “And we are confident that now Russians are beginning to believe that they will never be able to win this war. “We see the panic in their ranks. We see the panic in their propaganda machine. “But of course, this is a very important moment, but it is too early to relax… because this war is far from over.” He added: “At the moment we are quietly optimistic. We are beginning to carry out stabilisation measures in Kherson but of course we understand that there are future battles which we will have to win.” On Saturday, the White House praised Ukraine's ""extraordinary"" victory. National security advisor Jake Sullivan said: “It does look as though the Ukrainians have just won an extraordinary victory where the one regional capital that Russia had seized in this war is now back under a Ukrainian flag - and that is quite a remarkable thing."" “It’s a big moment and it’s due to the incredible tenacity and skill of the Ukrainians, backed by the relentless and united support of the United States and our allies."" The withdrawal from a regional capital in the south of Ukraine brings “significant reputational damage”, defence experts have said. British intelligence analysts believe Moscow’s exit from Kherson, a strategically key city, likely began as early as October 22 when Russian-installed figures urged civilians to leave. Following Russia's withdrawal from the city, videos and pictures posted on social media later showed residents celebrating in the streets, with the Ukrainian flag flying over a central Kherson square. Kherson was one of the first Ukrainian cities to be captured in the war Moscow waged on its neighbour from February 24. The retreat, which was ordered amid a Ukrainian counter-offensive, represents a huge blow to president Russian president Vladimir Putin – who has so far remained silent on the development. Ukraine is yet to claim the city is back in Ukrainian hands, but the country’s president Volodymyr Zelensky said “life is returning”. Russian forces still control about 70% of the wider Kherson region in the wake of the withdrawal. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) tweeted to say Moscow’s troops had “highly likely” destroyed road and rail bridges over the Dnipro River as part of their retreat. The exit was formally announced on November 9, but the defence experts said it is likely it started as early as October 22. “There is a realistic possibility that Russian military equipment and forces in civilian attire had been evacuating in conjunction with the 80,000 stated evacuated civilians in recent weeks,” they said. The MoD said is it probable Moscow is still attempting to evacuate forces from other parts of the region across the river to defensible positions on the eastern bank. “Kherson was the only regional capital city captured since February by Russian forces so the withdrawal brings significant reputational damage,” it said. “The withdrawal is a public recognition of the difficulties faced by Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro River. “It is likely that Ukraine has retaken large areas of Kherson oblast on the west bank of the Dnipro River, and that its forces are now largely in control of Kherson city itself.”",14,5.161130725478498,2.17958344846016,2.9815472770183375,1

A huge blast hit the Nova Kharkova dam near Kherson, in a move that environmentalists have warned could cause catastrophic flooding across Kherson and put hundreds of thousands of lives in danger. The shocking CCTV footage is seen as evidence of deliberate destruction by the Russians as they withdraw from Kherson city, with panicked troops reportedly dressing as civilians to escape. The US-based Institute for the Study of War said in October that Russia may plan to blow up the Nova Kharkova dam to flood Kherson. The dam provides electricity for hundreds of thousands of people and if it fails to operate it will be another huge blow to Ukraine's already faltering energy grid. Environmentalists have said that blowing up the dam would create an “atomic bomb” of water crashing through towns and villages. The Kremlin previously issued threats saying it would mine the area and unleash a “grandiose water apocalypse” to prevent a counter-offensive. The Antonivsky Bridge, the main crossing over the Dnipro River in the city of Kherson, was also blown up on Friday just before Ukraine’s forces entered the city. The Institute Study of War said that satellite imagery corroborates statements made by both Ukrainian and Russian sources that Russian troops destroyed the ""Antonivsky Bridge and Railway Bridge (near Kherson City) and the Nova Kakhovka dam bridge (east of Kherson City near Nova Kakhovka) over the Dnipro River and the Darivka Bridge (northeast of Kherson City) over the Inhulets River."" They said this was likely a final attempt to block Ukrainian advances towards central Kherson Oblast. Ukrainian forces raised their flag in central Kherson city on Friday and Ukrainians have been flocking to the streets to celebrate victory against the odds after Russia claimed all its troops had retreated. Residents said the bridge explosion gave hope that Moscow’s troops would not soon be back. Ukrainian President Zelensky appealed to any Russian soldiers still on the west bank to surrender. “We guarantee that you will be treated in accordance with the law and international standards. And to those Russian military who disguised themselves in civilian clothes and are hiding somewhere, I want to say that you cannot hide. We will find you anyway."" The statement came after there were reports that Russian soldiers were masquing as Ukrainians in plain clothes. Although Russian forces still control the broader Kherson region, losing the capital city is a huge blow after pro-Kremlin figures repeatedly claimed Russia would stay in Kherson “forever.” Russian President Vladimir Putin was desperate to annex Kherson, in violation of international law, as the city has strategic importance by offering the only land connection to Crimea. It is the gateway to the Crimea peninsula that Russia previously annexed. Moscow said yesterday that it had withdrawn all its soldiers and military hardware from Kherson after it had admitted days earlier that Ukrainian missile strikes had destroyed its army’s supply lines to the city and left its soldiers isolated. Despite the victory, many have issued caution as mines and booby traps likely litter the area. The Russian pullback of Kherson has been exceptionally methodical, heightening the risk that the Kremlin's forces will have laid tonnes of traps in their wake. Ed Arnold, research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told Sky News that the recapture of the port city was ""hugely significant"" for Ukraine and a ""moral victory"" for the country. Mr Arnold went on to say that while Ukrainian troops had ""momentum"" they would now have to cross the Dnipro river which is a ""complex operation"". He said: ""Military operations in the south will be quite complicated for Ukraine. However, saying that I do think the chances of continuing the counter-offensive in the east is probably for prudent for Ukraine at this time."" In Kherson city, locals pulled down a propaganda billboard emblazoned with the words: “Russia is here forever"" and were seen crying and hugging journalists and Ukrainian troops. They danced in the streets and sang patriotic songs around a bonfire: “Our glorious Ukraine shall — hey hey — cheer up and rejoice."" The Ukrainian army warned Russian soldiers who had been left in Kherson to lay down their arms or be killed. “Any Russian servicemen who offers resistance will be destroyed. Your only chance to avoid death is to immediately surrender."" Alexander Fomin, one of the members of the Russian-imposed administration in occupied Kherson oblast, has said Henichesk, along the Sea of Azov, has been declared the temporary administrative capital of Kherson. Henichesk is very close to the border with the Crimea region, but a significant distance from Kherson city and the Dnipro River. Despite the happiness in Kherson, Putin's brutal army continues to wreak havoc in Ukraine and yesterday morning a five-storey block of flats in Mykolaiv killed six people as they slept.

The city suffered eight months of ­occupation by Vladimir Putin ’s forces, leaving shortages of food and water. But people in the capital Kyiv sang and waved flags in the streets, while in Kherson memorial plaques installed by Russian officials were torn down. Moscow’s retreat from Kherson – the only regional capital Putin seized in the invasion – was ­announced on Wednesday but it may have started as early as October 22, British ­analysts believe. The Ministry of Defence said: “Kherson was the only regional capital captured since February so the withdrawal brings significant reputational damage. “The withdrawal is a public recognition of the difficulties faced by Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro River.” Around 200 officers were at work in the city today, setting up checkpoints and listing evidence of potential war crimes, police chief Ihor Klymenko said. He added they were also dealing with unexploded bombs and one soldier was injured while de-mining an office. Roman Holovnya, an adviser to Kherson’s mayor, described “a humanitarian catastrophe” in the city due to a lack of food but said supplies had begun to arrive from neighbouring Mykolaiv. Kherson’s energy firm Khersonoblenergo said ­electricity was being ­returned “to every settlement in the region” and Ukrainian TV and radio had also reportedly resumed. Russia confirmed 30,000 of its personnel had left the area. Locals welcomed Ukrainian soldiers into Kherson on Friday, with President Volodymyr Zelensky hailing it as a ­“historic day”. He told Russian soldiers left behind that surrender was their “only chance for salvation”. The MoD said it was “highly likely” Russians destroyed bridges over the Dnipro river as part of their retreat, while CCTV footage recorded them blowing up a nearby hydroelectric dam.

The footage emerges as Vladimir Putin begins his country's withdrawal from the southern Kherson region, moving back across the Dnieper River. A clip shows a Ukrainian soldier carrying a flag and raising it in the settlement as civilians celebrate the arrival of the liberators, hugging the soldiers and shouting ""Slava Ukraini!"", which translates to 'Glory to Ukraine!' The images were obtained from the 59th Separate Motorised Infantry Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces earlier today. It carried a statement saying: ""Soldiers of the 59th Separate Motorised Infantry Brigade named after Yakov Handziuk - 9th Battalion 'Vinnytsia Scythians' raised the blue-yellow flag in the liberated Blagodatny, Kherson Region. ""There is still a lot of work ahead. We will continue to liberate our native land step by step. Kherson region is Ukraine!!!"" The images and statement were also relayed by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24th February in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"". Today marks the 261st day of the war. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that between 24th February and 11th November, Russia had lost about 79,400 personnel, 2,814 tanks, 5,696 armoured combat vehicles and 1,817 artillery units. They also lost 393 multiple launch rocket systems, 205 air defence systems, 278 warplanes, 261 helicopters, 1,505 drones, 399 cruise missiles, 16 warships, 4,259 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 159 units of special equipment. Russia has claimed that its casualties have been much lower but provides infrequent updates on its latest figures. Ukrainian forces are reportedly closing in on the southern city of Kherson after Russia announced that it was retreating across the Dnieper River. Ukraine has said that it thinks it will take at least a week for the Russian troops to leave the city and has reportedly liberated the strategically significant town of Snihurivka in Mykolaiv Oblast, which lies near the border with Kherson Oblast, some 20 miles north of the city of Kherson. The Russian Ministry of Defence has said that its retreat from the region is currently underway, saying: “The Russian troop units are manoeuvring to a prepared position on the left bank of the Dnieper River in strict accordance with the approved plan.” The Ukrainian Defence Minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said that there are still approximately 40,000 Russian troops in the Kherson region. Reznikov said: “It’s not that easy to withdraw these troops from Kherson in one day or two days. As a minimum, one week.” Ukraine has said that it does not want to rush into the city as it could be a trap by the Kremlin. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said Ukraine could not currently confirm if Russia was indeed retreating from the city, but Ukraine’s military forces have advanced over 22 miles and retaken 41 villages and towns in the region since the beginning of October, including 12 settlements on Wednesday. US officials announced on Thursday that they would be sending an additional USD 400 million in military aid to Ukraine. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan said: “This increased air defence will be critical for Ukraine as Russia continues to use cruise missiles and Iranian-made drones to attack critical civilian infrastructure.”",14,2.8095514440804017,3.2996253486742306,-0.49007390459382894,8

It comes after the announcement that Ukrainian forces were entering the city, hailing an ""important victory"" after Russia said its troops had retreated from the only regional capital it had captured in nearly nine months of fighting Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu approved the withdrawal of troops from Kherson in Ukraine on Wednesday. In a televised announcement, Shoigu, ordered his troops to withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson. War commander General Sergei Surovikin called it a “very difficult decision”, but the MoD said Russia claimed the withdrawal was due to ""re-supply issues"". It added: ""Russia's ability to sustain its forces on the west bank of the Dnipro river had been placed under pressure by Ukrainian strikes on Russia's resupply routes. Russia on Friday said more than 30,000 troops had been withdrawn in the region. However, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that Russian troops have ""destroyed multiple bridges and likely laid mines"" to delay advancing Ukrainian forces upon their retreat. A senior Ukrainian official has also warned that Russia is booby-trapping the city of Kherson, accusing them of trying to turn it into a “city of death”. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Zelensky, tweeted that the Russian military “mines everything they can: apartments, sewers” and that “artillery on the left bank” of the Dnipro river “plans to turn the city into ruins.” He suggested that the Russian forces “came, robbed, celebrated, killed ‘witnesses’, left ruins and left” Kherson city. He earlier warned that Russia's public declaration of a retreat could be a ruse designed to up Kyiv's forces for a street battle. Earlier on Friday the Mirror reported that Ukrainians had discovered ""cannon fodder"" Russian conscript soldiers left behind as they liberate their city of Kherson from invaders. Months ago it was the site of a fierce fight between Kremlin and Ukrainian forces before the Russians retreated in mid-March. Russia's move away from Kherson likely means it will send its weapons elsewhere, as Ukraine has issued a stark warning that the staged TV statement is likely a ruse.

It came after Russia released its final foothold on the major city on Friday and paved the way for victorious Ukrainian forces to reclaim the its only Russian-held provincial capital. The abandonment of the city by Russian troops also could act as a springboard for further advances into occupied territory. Russia's Defense Ministry said its troops finished withdrawing from the western bank of the river dividing Ukraine's Kherson region at 5am. The area they left included the city of Kherson, the only provincial capital Russia had captured during its nearly nine-month invasion of Ukraine. Videos and photos on social media showed residents jubilantly taking to the streets and a Ukrainian flag flying over a monument in a central Kherson square after the city was seized by Russian forces in early March. Some footage showed crowds cheering on men in military uniform. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed the city is back in Ukrainian hands. A spokesperson for Ukraine's military intelligence agency said ""an operation to liberate Kherson"" and the surrounding region of the same name was underway. Andriy Yusov said. ""It will be possible to talk about establishing Ukrainian control over the city only after an official report by the General Staff"" of the Ukrainian army. Ukrainian intelligence urged Russian soldiers still be in the city to surrender in anticipation of Ukrainian forces arriving. It said: ""Your command left you to the mercy of fate. ""Your commanders urge you to change into civilian clothes and try to escape from Kherson on your own. Obviously, you won't be able to."" Ukrainian regional official, Serhii Khlan, disputed the Russian Defense Ministry's claim that 30,000 retreating troops took all 5,000 pieces of equipment with them, saying ""a lot"" of hardware was left behind. The final Russian withdrawal came six weeks after Vladimir Putin illegally annexed the region and three other Ukrainian provinces, vowing they would remain Russian forever. Moscow's forces still control about 70% of the Kherson region following the pullback ordered amid a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The Kremlin insisted the withdrawal in no way represented an embarrassment for Putin. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Moscow continued to view the entire Kherson region as part of Russia. The Kremlin he said doesn't regret holding festivities just over a month ago to celebrate the annexation of occupied or partially occupied regions of Ukraine. Before the Russian announcement, Volodymyr Zelensky's office described the situation in the province as ""difficult."" It reported shelling of some villages and towns which Ukraine had reclaimed during their counteroffensive in the Kherson region. The General Staff of Ukraine's army said Russian forces looted homes, damaged power lines and mined roads in their wake. Mykhailo Podolyak, Ukrainian presidential adviser, predicted Russians would try to turn Kherson into a ""city of death"" and continue to shell it after relocating across the Dnieper River. Ukrainian officials were wary of the Russian pullback, fearing their soldiers could get drawn into an ambush in Kherson city, which had a prewar population of 280,000. It also predicted Russia's military would take at least a week to complete the troop withdrawal. Zelensky thanked US military personnel on Veterans Day and said in a video message ""victory will be ours."" He said: ""Your example inspires Ukrainians today to fight back against Russian tyranny. ""Special thanks to the many American veterans who have volunteered to fight in Ukraine and to the American people for the amazing support you have given Ukraine. ""With your help, we have stunned the world and are pushing Russian forces back."" But some quarters of the Ukrainian government barely disguised their glee at the pace of the Russian withdrawal. ""The Russian army leaves the battlefields in a triathlon mode: steeplechase, broad jumping, swimming,"" Andriy Yermak, a senior presidential adviser, tweeted. Social media videos showed villagers hugging Ukrainian troops across the region. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general of US. Army forces in Europe, described the retreat from Kherson as a ""colossal failure"" for Russia, and said he expects Ukrainian commanders will keep the pressure on Russia's forces ahead of a possibl push for Crimea next year. ""It's too early to be planning the victory parade, for sure. ""But I would expect by the end of this year - so in the next, let's say, eight weeks - the Ukrainians are going to be in place to start setting the conditions for the decisive phase of this campaign, which is the liberation of Crimea, which I think will happen by the summer.""",14,1.923940146470054,2.3211477285309075,-0.3972075820608534,1

A senior Ukrainian official has also warned that Russia is booby-trapping the city of Kherson, accusing them of trying to turn it into a “city of death”. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Zelensky, tweeted that the Russian military “mines everything they can: apartments, sewers” and that “artillery on the left bank” of the Dnipro river “plans to turn the city into ruins.” He suggested that the Russian forces “came, robbed, celebrated, killed ‘witnesses’, left ruins and left” Kherson city.

We see no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight. A part of the ru-group is preserved in the city, and additional reserves are charged to the region. Ukraine is liberating territories based on intelligence data, not staged TV statements."" There have also been reports of Russian troops dressing as civilians and taking up positions in people's homes. Officials in Kyiv said earlier that the battle to retake Kherson would be one of the heaviest of the conflict. Despite this, Professor David Lewis, from the University of Exeter said the withdrawal was a ""major humiliation"" for Russia's military and a ""significant boost"" for Ukraine's counteroffensive. He continued: ""It is particularly humiliating because Putin claimed that it had formally annexed this territory only six weeks ago. But it was always likely to be difficult to defend Kherson once Ukraine was able to attack its supply lines across the Dnipro river."" Putin has not commented on the apparent surrender of the city. Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said the retreat was Russia’s “biggest geopolitical defeat” since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He said it would trigger huge political consequences within Russia. Ukraine said the withdrawal of Russian forces from Kherson is premature, some Russian forces remain in the town and additional Russian manpower was being pulled into the region. The announcement came shortly after Russian media said the deputy leader of Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, was killed in a car crash.

On Wednesday, Putin's puppets announced that the time has come to withdraw their forces from Kherson in southern Ukraine. General Sergei Surovikin, the war commander of Russia ’s forces in Ukraine previously dubbed 'butcher of Syria', said the lives of Russian soldiers will be saved by the retreat. Speaking calmly but with his brow deeply furrowed, Russia's Defence Minister General Sergei Shoigu said: ""The decision on the defence on the eastern bank of the Dnipro is not easy. ""We will preserve the lives of our soldiers and the combat capability of military formations."" But one key player is noticeably absent and still has failed to speak out on the news of the supposed retreat. That is Russian President Vladimir Putin. In what appears to be a profound humiliation to his top brass, Putin wheeled out his two senior military men who seemed upset at reading the news. This is not the first time the Russian president has deflected criticism of the war towards his generals. It was only a few weeks ago that Putin announced that Kherson had become part of Russia following sham referendums. So many say it would severely damage his pride to have to then announce the huge defeat of departing from Kherson. Putin was seen the same day on television during a state tour of a hospital with no mention of the war just across the border or the retreat. Shoigu claimed that Ukraine had lost 9,500 soldiers in the battles for Kherson, whilst Russia’s losses were apparently 7-8 times less. “Actions speak louder than words. Ukraine sees no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight. A significant part of the Russian troops remain in the city, and additional reserves are being sent into the region,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky, said in a social media post warning about the supposed retreat. On Thursday Podolyak claimed that Russia is booby-trapping the city of Kherson, accusing them of trying to turn it into a “city of death”. He said that the Russian military “mines everything they can: apartments, sewers” and that “artillery on the left bank” of the Dnipro river “plans to turn the city into ruins”. Russia’s loss of Kherson’s west bank will likely prevent its forces from achieving their strategic aspiration of a land bridge reaching Odesa, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. “With limited crossing points, Russian forces will be vulnerable in crossing the Dnipro River,” the latest British intelligence report reads.

Kirill Stremousov, the highly-visible deputy head of the occupying regime, has died as Russia retreats from the city and Ukraine is expected to launch a major counteroffensive in the region. The death of the pro-Russian Ukrainian was confirmed by numerous sources, including TASS. Stremousov was killed in an accident near Henichesk, his personal driver told the military project WarGonzo. Earlier today, he had accused the West of being behind the Ukrainian advance in Kherson. Many English and Polish speaking mercenaries were among the advancing forces, he alleged, offering no proof. He told how there was an evacuation from Kherson. ”Many have left. About 80,000 people were evacuated. We help everyone who wants to leave Kherson. I am now in Kherson myself,” he said. The place he was killed is Russian controlled and 130 miles from Kherson city. Ukrainian blogger and politician Anatoly Shariy said: “Several sources confirmed the death of Stremousov. “If this is true, then I understand what kind of ‘traffic accident’ this was right now when the surrender of Kherson is obvious.” He appeared to imply that Stremousov had many enemies for supporting the Russian occupation forces which are now pulling back. He added: ""And the main thing - if he was killed, and exactly in the way I was told it happened, then it was no Ukrainian Army spies killing him."" “ Russia is in Kherson forever,” Stremousov - who had worked as a handyman in the US - had boasted, ahead of losses which mean Putin’s forces are on the retreat. But the official also had enemies among Russians after blasting Putin’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu for alleged incompetence in defending Kherson region. “There is no need to cast a shadow over the entire Russian Defence Ministry at the moment because of some, I am not saying traitors,” he said last month. Shoigu’s “untalented military commanders” have “not really bothered to answer for all the processes and holes that now exist”. He declared: “Indeed many say, if I were the defence minister who allowed this state of affairs to happen, as an officer I could have just shot myself.” He then suggested that the word “officer” was “incomprehensible” to Shoigu. Stremousov, a Ukrainian pro-Russian politician wanted in Kyiv for treason, lumped Shoigu and his generals together with “corrupt marauders and other scum” in the Russian defence ministry. Political analyst Sergey Markov said: “Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Kherson region, was killed. It's all very strange. “He kept saying that Kherson could not be handed over and it would not be handed over. “He died on the day when they began to actively talk about the surrender of Kherson. “He died not from a terrorist attack, but in an accident. Not in Kherson, but in Genichesk “With him in the car was a military commander Kotz, he did not die. “All this is very strange.” Stremousov was wanted in Kyiv for treason. Putin’s puppet governor of Kherson expressed distress and dismay over Stremousov’s death, as the Kremlin placeman in Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev called his demise “an irreparable loss”. On a video Kherson “governor” Vladimir Saldo, said: “It is very hard for me to say that “viceroy” Kirill Stremousov died today. The metadata on the video recorded by “stooge governor” Saldo suggests it was recorded two hours before the first announcement of Kherson “viceroy” Stremousov’s death. “He died in Kherson region, in a car that got into an accident… “It will also be difficult to talk about the tragedy to his family and friends… “He has five children and a sixth is due soon. “Of course, we will take care of all of them, but unfortunately, Kirill will not be returned.” However Ukrainian sources queried whether the announcement of his death could be a Kremlin trick. Independent We Can Explain media reported: “Against the backdrop of a lack of details about the accident and the circumstances of his death, Ukrainian officials started saying the accident could be staged, and rumours about it in pro-Kremlin channels could be disinformation.”",14,2.3787164596204633,3.003520383280926,-0.6248039236604628,1

Afghan War veteran Simon Lingard, known as “Grimmy” to his friends, was killed on Monday, his family has confirmed. The dad of two was a former member of the Special Forces Support Group and had previously served with the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment. It is believed he had spent months on the frontline fighting alongside Ukrainian troops after the Russian invasion started on February 24. One of the ex-soldier’s two children, revealed that he had been killed fighting in Ukraine and urged friends to donate money to help with funeral costs. One of his children wrote: “As most people are aware my Dad Simon Lingard, (Grimmy) sadly lost his life in Ukraine on Monday 7th November. “ My Dad was an inspiration to all who knew him, a real life hero who died fighting for what he believed in. ""He was loved and adored by so many a true representation of what a soldier should be. Me and Keane are absolutely heartbroken “The Ukrainian Military have offered to bring him home to England but we need help to show him the respect and adoration he deserves by giving him the greatest well- deserved send off. “Could you all please find it in your heart to donate anything no matter how small so we can honour our Dad and allow him to finally Rest in Peace.” The page for Simon ""Grimmy"" Lingard had raised more than £6,000, just four hours after it was created on Wednesday afternoon. Those who knew Mr Lingard were expressing their grief over his death on social media. A former colleague wrote on Facebook: “Absolutely gutted to be posting this, Si “Grimmy” Lingard was an awesome soldier with a great, sometimes questionable sense of humour. “He is a guy I'm proud to have served with in 2 Para before he moved to SFSG and served in Afghanistan on multiple tours. “After the Russian invasion of Ukraine he did not hesitate to go and fight on their behalf and I’m sure his expertise, experience and mentoring capabilities have helped the Ukrainian army push the Russians back to their current point. “ I'm also sure what he will have taught those fighting with him will help them win this war. “Simon has left two children behind and although I have not met you, my thoughts are truly with you and your family at this time, your father was a God among men.” Another ex-colleague wrote: “RIP Si Grimmy Lingard can’t describe how I feel right now - what a warrior. “A real man I’ll miss you mate & although you aren’t here, you have my word I’ll finish off what we started.” News of Mr Lingard's death comes as Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has this afternoon approved the withdrawal of troops from Kherson in Ukraine, according to Russian military command. War commander General Sergei Surovikin said the decision to withdraw was not easy but will save the lives of Russian military personnel and Russia's combat capability in the area.

Rather, he called it a ""tactical withdrawal"" to allow Russia to consolidate its positions on the left bank of the Dnipro and ensure it can hold its land bridge to Crimea against further Ukrainian offensives. Despite this, Professor Lewis said the withdrawal was a ""major humiliation"" for Russia's military and a ""significant boost"" for Ukraine's counteroffensive. ""It’s the latest setback for Russia’s military campaign after a major defeat in Kharkiv province in September,"" he said. ""It is particularly humiliating because Putin claimed that it had formally annexed this territory only six weeks ago.

Kherson is the only provincial capital captured during the invasion, seized in the opening days of the conflict as Russian troops pushed their attack north from Crimea. Wednesday's announcement therefore comes as a huge setback for the Kremlin and a potential turning point in the war. Ukrainian forces had zeroed in on the industrial city during the summer, launching relentless attacks to reclaim parts of the larger province. Moscow-appointed officials claimed that more than 70,000 residents were evacuated in late October, something disputed by Ukrainian officials.

From hospital cancer equipment, antiques from the city museum and statues from the town square, to food, medicine and household goods - even a fairground train has been stolen, according to reports from inside the city. Journalists inside Kherson, which has been occupied since March, have accused Vladimir Putin ’s people of “barbaric” mass theft. “These bastards stole a children’s train,” wrote Kherson-based reporter Konstantin Ryzhenko. “Do you hear me? A children's train.” The video shows the tiny fairground ride in a line of traffic heading out of the city amid claims that pro-Russians have stolen anything that moves and are taking it with them as they retreat. The news comes amid reports of ‘anarchy and criminal lawlessness’ in Kherson as authorities installed by the Russian occupiers grab what they can and flee. The looting frenzy comes ahead of an expected major battle over the city between Russians - who have urged civilians to evacuate - and advancing Ukrainians seeking to reclaim the strategic city. Another Kherson journalist Ivan Antypenko mocked the Russian claim that they were “here forever” when Putin annexed Kherson ahead of a major retreat from the Ukrainian region. He claimed they had taken statues with them to annexed Crimea or Russia. “Russians: Russia is here forever,” he posted. “The same Russians stole monuments, ambulances, firefighting vehicles, property of banks, hospitals, equipment and escaped from Kherson. “A photo shows that Suvorov's bust has disappeared.” He claimed that Kherson Regional Museum had been pillaged, citing a video showing a truck outside it, while reports say tractors have been taken by Russians. Ukrainian news channel UATV.UA reported a major operation was underway to loot goods as the Russians fell back. This included “food products, medicines, personal hygiene products, and household appliances,” according to reports. “In addition, looters take equipment from industrial enterprises and state institutions, confiscate utility equipment, including ambulances, buses and special equipment.” The station also reported that equipment used to treat cancer patients has been stolen from medical facilities. Ukrainian MP Mykyta Poturaev said: ""You and I think that stealing equipment from cancer patients is something terrible. “And for them there is no difference - steal a curling iron, steal an iron, steal combine harvesters. “They started by stealing combine harvesters and other agricultural machinery from the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. “Now they stole the equipment from [cancer centre]. Well, what can you call it? Is this human behaviour? “No, this is absolutely barbaric behaviour. Savages are more civilised.” Russian blogger Roman Saponkov wrote of “anarchy and criminal lawlessness” in Kherson city. “There are no authorities in the city, including self-defence or territorial defence.""

The Kremlin's troops attacked the “incompetent” generals for treating them as “meat” and demanded in a letter that Putin is personally told of the alleged massacre. The letter comes during growing reports of Russian forces staging mutinies in multiple locations over his increasingly unpopular and costly war. A pro-Kremlin war reporter highlighted the bloodbath in Pavlivka - known as Pavlovka in Russia - because he fears the marines are becoming “meat mixed with earth and boards”. Marines of the 155th Marine Brigade wrote to their regional governor Oleg Kozhemyako in Primorsky in a bid to get their message to Putin. They stated in the leaked communique: ""Yet again we were thrown into an incomprehensible attack by Generals [Rustam] Muradov and [Zurab] Akhmedov so that Muradov could get bonuses from [chief of the general staff Valery] Gerasimov, and his promised Hero of Russia [medal]. “As a result of the ‘carefully planned’ attack by these ‘great commanders’, we lost about 300 people in four days, killed, wounded and missing. “We lost 50 per cent of our military equipment, and this was just our brigade.” The commanders “are hiding” the mayhem in the Donetsk region and “playing down the number of losses for fear of being held responsible”, they claimed. The marines continued: “They don't care about anything but themselves, they call people cannon fodder. “We ask you to get in touch with the supreme [commander Putin] so that a commission is sent to investigate what happened. “How much longer should we be standing it for!” The governor claimed the letter could be a fake, however, multiple Russian sources indicate the letter from the marines is genuine. After claims that the letter may have been the work of Ukrainian special forces, he hit back on Monday and denied his account had been hacked, stating: “The goal is to save [Russian forces]. Let them become heroes, not meat mixed with earth and boards.” Another pro-Russian war reporter called the Pavlikva, Semyon Pegov, said the slaughter of the marines was “extremely depressing news”. One more pro-Kremlin war reporter Alexey Sukonkin said “terrible bloodshed was taking place in Pavlivka, as soon as the first battalion came under distribution on the outskirts of the village”. The regional governor “will have to answer for the mediocrity of a commander who organised this bloody holiday. He will have to look into the eyes of widows and orphaned children. An unenviable fate.” Read more",14,3.8437415790479514,3.877491588655827,-0.033750009607875775,11

Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces made the claim on Monday after revealing 71,200 of Vladimir Putin 's soldiers were estimated have died since the invasion started in February. A total of 950 of these had been killed on Sunday alone, they said, as Volodymyr Zelensky ’s forces continue to advance on the key southern city of Kherson. The latest count brought the number of Russian soldiers taken out by Ukrainian forces in October up to 12,730, an average of 400 day. It came as the UK Ministry of Defence reported that many reservists sent by Moscow from the recent mass mobilisation were suffering from a lack of equipment and preparation for combat. A tweet on the MoD's official Twitter account @DefenceHQ on Monday said: “ Russia has deployed several thousand newly mobilised reservists to the front line in Ukraine since mid-October. In many cases they are poorly equipped. “In September, Russian officers were concerned that some recently mobilised reservists were arriving in Ukraine without weapons.” Open-source images purportedly showed Russian soldiers had been equipped with AKM rifles - an outdated weapon first introduced in 1959. Many of these were likely given to them in ""barely usable condition following poor storage"", the ministry added. It comes after a series of explosions struck Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine yesterday morning as Russian forces restarted missile barrages on civilian areas following recent setbacks. Smoke could be seen rising above Kyiv after about 10 explosions, witnesses said. New leaked footage taken back in Russia meanwhile shows a bloody fight between ""drunk"" Russian soldiers and high-ranking military intelligence officers. The conscripts are from the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, based in Yurga, Siberia, who are undergoing training ahead of deployment to the frontline in Ukraine.

Russia has increased strikes in recent weeks after blaming its former Soviet ally for the explosion that damaged the Crimean bridge. Smoke could be seen rising above Kyiv after about 10 explosions, witnesses said. Ukrainians have been warned to remain in shelters. Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's chief of staff, wrote in messaging app Telegram: ""Russian losers continue waging war on civilian facilities.""

Major General Kyrylo Budanov has claimed Putin, 70, is unlikely to last until the end of the war and that discussions are already taking place for him to be removed from power. The claim comes as Russian forces continue to suffer major setbacks with Ukrainian forces pushing them back into the east of the country. Major General Budanov even claimed that Ukraine is aiming to recapture Kherson by the end of November. In a claim which would have been unthinkable at the start of the war, he then told The War Zone that Ukraine would even attempt to take back the Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukrainian successes — or Russian failures — have since made this a possibility, though the war is far from over despite Ukraine's counteroffensive. Major General Budanov outlined what Ukraine could potentially consider to be an endgame to the war. He said that the restoration of Ukraine's borders in 1991, when it first became independent, could be a good position from which they would look to end the war. For Putin however things may not turn out quite so rosy, with 'active discussions' about his replacement now said to be in full swing. Major General Budanov said: ""It's unlikely that he survives it. And currently, there's active discussions happening in Russia about who'd be there to replace him."" Ukraine recently launched a counteroffensive eastwards which is now seeing Russian forces retreating as Ukraine looks to recapture the city of Kherson. With the Russian army in open retreat in many areas, Putin has already had to resort to conscripting male civilians, a move which has seen an exodus of men of fighting age attempting to flee the country. Putin has even made thinly veiled threats of nuclear retaliation if NATO escalates its involvement in the conflict.

While any threat of this magnitude is grave, it could also be an act of desperation amid growing unrest within Russia, though Putin's media campaign within Russian-controlled territory remains relentless. However, the war is far from over and while Ukraine has made massive gains there is still no guarantee of victory. Putin's threats of nuclear escalation remain, as well as the question of who would replace him if he were toppled and how their approach to the war might differ.

Russia said on Friday it had finished calling up reservists to fight in Ukraine, having drafted hundreds of thousands in a month and sent more than a quarter of them already to the battlefield after a divisive mobilisation campaign that was its first since World War Two. But despite the conscription, Russian forces are still unable to make a notable breakthrough on military lines in the east of Ukraine. British intelligence has said that Russian troops have taken up a “defensive posture on most areas of the front line in Ukraine” with units being largely undermanned. And Zelensky has said that Russian forces are trying to turn the Kherson region into an uninhabited area with mass theft of medical equipment and ambulances. Ukrainian troops are gathered in force near Kherson, in the south of the country, prompting Russian-installed officials to evacuate many residents. Kherson is one of the four regions Moscow claims as part of Russia. ""The occupiers have decided to close down medical institutions in towns, take away medical equipment, ambulances, everything. They are putting pressure on doctors who still remain... to move to the territory of Russia,"" Zelensky said. ""Russia is trying to make the Kherson region a no man's land,"" he added, saying pro-Moscow forces realised they could not hold onto the city and were therefore taking what they could. Ukrainian officials have regularly accused retreating Russian troops of widespread looting. It comes as the Ministry of Defence has stated that Russian units are badly undermanned with as few as six men in some companies where there should be 100. It tweeted: ""Russia has likely augmented some of its units west of the Dnipro River with mobilised reservists. However, this is from an extremely low level of manning. ""In September 2022, Russian officers described companies in the Kherson sector as consisting of between six and eight men each. Companies should deploy with around 100 personnel. ""In the last six weeks there has been a clear move from Russian ground forces to transition to a long-term, defensive posture on most areas of the front line in Ukraine. This is likely due to a more realistic assessment that the severely undermanned, poorly trained force in Ukraine is currently only capable of defensive operations. ""Even if Russia succeeds in consolidating long-term defensive lines in Ukraine, its operational design will remain vulnerable. To regain the initiative, it will need to regenerate higher quality, mobile forces which are capable of dynamically countering Ukrainian breakthroughs and conducting their own large-scale offensive operations.""

The attack on the holy building in the Russian-controlled Donetsk region comes as Russia continues its bombardment of the country's energy grid. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of targeting civilian infrastructure to down a third of the country's supply, leaving around 1.5million houses without electricity and others without access to water for the coming winter. Local media reported that on Sunday, when the monastery was destroyed, six civilians were killed and another five injured in the Donestk region. Elsewhere, Russia fired missiles and drones into the Ukrainian-held southern town of Mykolaiv, destroying an apartment block, and said the war was trending towards ""uncontrolled escalation"" in a flurry of telephone calls to Western defence ministers. The strike on the shipbuilding town about 35 km (22 miles) northwest of the front line in Kherson came as Russia ordered 60,000 people to flee the region ""to save your lives"" in the face of a Ukrainian counter offensive. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu discussed the ""rapidly deteriorating situation"" in phone calls with British, French and Turkish counterparts, the ministry said. He also spoke by phone with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for the second time in three days. The Pentagon said Austin told Shoigu he ""rejected any pretext for Russian escalation."" Without providing evidence, Shoigu said Ukraine could escalate by using a ""dirty bomb"", or conventional explosives laced with radioactive material. Ukraine does not possess nuclear weapons, while Russia has said it could protect its territory with its nuclear arsenal. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba rejected the accusation as ""absurd"" and ""dangerous"", adding: ""Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves."" In a joint statement after the talks, Britain, France and the United States said they were committed to supporting Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"" and rejected Russia's warning about a ""dirty bomb"". ""Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia's transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory,"" they said. ""The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation."" Sunday's missile strike in Mykolaiv wiped out the top floor of the apartment block, sending shrapnel and debris across a plaza and into neighbouring buildings, Reuters witnessed. No fatalities were recorded. ""After the first blast, I tried to get out, but the door was stuck,"" said Oleksandr Mezinov, 50, who was woken from his bed by the blasts. ""After a minute or two, there was a second loud blast. Our door was blown into the corridor."" On Sunday, Ukraine's General Staff said anti-aircraft defences had shot down 12 of Russia's Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones in the past 24 hours. Tehran denies supplying the weapons to Russia. Britain's defence ministry said Russia was using the Iranian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) to substitute for increasingly scarce Russian-made long-range precision weapons. But Ukraine's efforts to contain the UAVs have been successful, the ministry added on Monday in its Twitter update. Ukraine's advances in recent weeks around Kherson and in the country's northeast have been met with intensifying Russian missile and drone attacks on civilian infrastructure, which have destroyed about 40% of Ukraine's power system ahead of winter. Russian troops have withdrawn from parts of the front and occupation authorities are evacuating civilians deeper into Russian-held territory before an expected battle for Kherson, the regional capital on the west bank of the Dnipro river. Kherson is a gateway to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. ""The situation today is difficult. It's vital to save your lives,"" Russian Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said in a video message. ""It won't be for long. You will definitely return."" Russia-installed authorities there reported insufficient vessels to ferry people across the river at one point on Sunday, blaming a ""sharp increase in the number of people wishing to leave"". About 25,000 people have been evacuated since Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said. Ukraine's military said it was making gains in the south, taking over at least two villages it said Russia had abandoned. Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday its forces had kept up attacks on Ukraine's energy and military infrastructure, destroyed a large ammunition depot in the central Cherkasy region, and repelled Ukrainian counter-offensives in the south and east. Reuters could not independently verify the accounts. President Zelensky said the Russian attacks on energy infrastructure had struck on a ""very wide"" scale. With the war about to start its ninth month and winter approaching, the potential for freezing misery loomed. Volodymyr Kudritskiy, head of Ukraine's national energy company, Ukrenergo, said power had been restored to more than 1.5 million customers after mass weekend attacks on energy targets.

RT's Director of Broadcasting Anton Krasovsky suggested that any child who believes their country is being occupied by Russia needs to be thrown into a fast river and drowned alive. His other suggestion was to put the children into wooden houses, nail the doors shut and burn them alive. ""They should have been drowned in the Tysyna River, right there where the ducklings swim,"" he says with a smirk on his face. ""Just drown those children. Drown them. ""Shove them right in those huts and burn them up."" He also makes monstrous comments about the rapes by Russian soldiers, saying Ukraine should not exist and Ukrainians who resist Russia should be shot. He justifies his remarks by saying: ""That's not your [Ukrainian] method, because they are intelligent people. But that's our method."" One commentator pointed out that Mr Krasovsky could be prosecuted for incitement of genocide. Two weeks ago, Mr Krasovsky posted a video of himself dancing on a balcony in his pyjamas and wearing a cap bearing a Z, the symbol that Russian forces painted on military vehicles while invading Ukraine. In a Telegram post, he said the damage to Ukraine’s power lines was “not enough! Not enough!” He previously said Ukraine should not exist and Russia will do everything in its power to make it disappear. On Sunday, day 242 of the war, hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up to power outages and periodic bursts of gunfire, as Ukrainian air defence tried to shoot down drones and incoming missiles. Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, said 1.5 million people were without electricity after Russian strikes against power stations on Saturday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Russian attacks had struck on a ""very wide"" scale and he pledged his military would improve on its already good record of downing missiles with help from its allies. Russia said on Sunday it had destroyed a large ammunition depot in Ukraine's central Cherkasy region and had repelled Ukrainian counter-offensives along the frontlines in southern and eastern Ukraine.

Hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up this weekend to the sound of artillery and power outages, as air defence shot down incoming Russian drones. Ukraine's air force command reported that 33 missiles pounded the country on Saturday morning and that 18 of those had been shot down by air defence systems. It said it was a ""massive missile attack” targeting “critical infrastructure."" Presidential advisor Kyrylo Tymoshenko said that as of Saturday afternoon, more than a million people across the country were without power, with 672,000 of those in the western region of Khmelnytskyi alone. The city council in Khmelnytskyi urged residents to store water ""in case it's also gone within an hour"". In the city of Lutsk in western Ukraine, a missile hit a power plant, causing a blackout in part of the city, the mayor, Ihor Polishchuk, said on Telegram. The blast wave damaged a private home and injured at least one person, he said. Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state grid operator, warned that the “scale of damage is comparable or may exceed the consequences of the attack on October 10 - 12”, which left 30 per cent of the country without power. It said it would begin to limit the supply of electricity to homes in the capital and four regions of the country due to the recent attacks, to lower the pressure on the grid and give workers time to repair the damage. With winter fast approaching, Russian forces have been targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in a bid to leave millions cold and in the dark in a country that can plunge to colds of -20. The United Nations has said that under international humanitarian law, attacks on civilian infrastructure are prohibited. ""Combined with soaring gas and coal prices, they expose millions of civilians to extreme hardship and even life-endangering conditions this winter"", it continued. Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to the Ukrainian president, has accused Moscow of trying to “provoke new refugees” to flee to Europe by targeting the energy supplies. While foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the attacks constituted genocide.

Moscow would then pin the blame on Kyiv in a ""false flag"" attack that would provide a distraction from Moscow's recent battlefield humiliation. Colonel General Sergei Surovikin, Russia's new war commander in Ukraine, spoke to Russian media this week about plans for a ""devastating strike"" on the Nova Kakhovka dam which he said was being plotted by Putin's troops. He alleged it would cause destructive flooding in Kherson. Volodymyr Saldo, the Russian-appointed puppet governor of the city, also accused Ukrainian forces of planning to destroy a major dam at the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric power station - without citing evidence. ""The Ukrainian side is building up forces for a large-scale offensive,"" he said. ""There is an immediate danger of flooding... due to the planned destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the release of water from a cascade of power plants further up the Dnipro."" Analysts from the Institute for the Study of War have raised the alarm and concluded this is likely preparation for a false-flag attack that would cover Russia's retreat and prove a distraction from its latest battlefield humiliation. Breaching the dam would be another blow to Ukraine's struggling energy grid, as civilians are preparing for four-hour blackouts starting on Thursday after a third of the country's power plants were blown up in a little over a week. The Institute Study of War said: ""Russian authorities are likely urging a warning about purported Ukrainian strikes on Kakhovka to set information conditions for Russian forces to damage the dam. ""Then [they will] blame Ukraine for the subsequent damage and loss of life, all while using the resulting floods to cover their own retreat further south into Kherson Oblast."" It also says this could be another way that the Kremlin are covering up its humiliating defeat. A false-flag attack will overshadow the news of a third humiliating retreat for Russian forces from western Kherson. ""Such an attack would also further the false Russian information operation portraying Ukraine as a terrorist state that deliberately targets civilians"", the think tank continued. When in reality Russia has been raining a barrage of missiles and suicide drones to attack Ukraine's vital civilian infrastructure and commit war crimes, under international law. In an evening address, Ukrainian President Voldomyr Zelensky warned that ""Russian terror will be directed at energy facilities."" He said that the government was ""working on the creation of mobile power supply points for critical infrastructure in cities and villages.""

One Russian soldier - who was one of the 400 former inmates recruited from Russia's prisons - has told Ukrainian media how their Wagner Group commander sent them forward to ""scout"" ahead as the experienced troops waited in the wings. He said: ""We are being used as cannon fodder. Our commander sent us forward, at first we were walking alongside, but when we looked back, they were very far behind. ""Usual cannon fodder: They wanted us to scout their positions, to see who’s where... We’re like cannon fodder..."" The man claimed they were given a ""completely different story"" when they were personally recruited from Russia's prisons by Wagner's chief, Yevgney Prigozhin. Prigozhin told the recruits they would be fighting alongside the more ""experienced"" and established soldiers, who would train them, he claimed. They were also told they wouldn't be headed to the front lines. It comes as Ukrainian officials accuse the Kremlin of targeting 408 infrastructure facilities since October 10. Minister of Communities and Territories Development Oleksiy Chernyshov said in a statement through his ministry: ""The enemy attacked and destroyed 408 infrastructure facilities, including more than 45 energy infrastructure objects, by launching missile and kamikaze drone attacks on the regions of Ukraine from October 10 to 18."" In addition to the infrastructure attacks, which Ukraine has branded an attempt to wipe out the Ukrainian people as the cutting winter approaches, there were an additional 180 residential buildings damaged by Russian missile fire. For example in Kharkiv, industrial complexes were targeted as downed missile fragments landed outside a high-rise building. Warehouses containing food supplies and private cars were also hit, according to the city's prosecutor's office. Ukrainians conserved electricity and some went without running water on Thursday to ease pressure on the grid and allow the repair of infrastructure destroyed by Russian air strikes as Kyiv's forces advanced towards the city of Kherson. Although Ukraine is successfully prosecuting counter-offensives against Russian forces in the east and the south, it is struggling to protect power generating facilities and other utilities from Russian missile and drone strikes which appear designed to disrupt and demoralise as winter approaches. People across Ukraine tried to use less power on Thursday after the government placed restrictions on electricity usage nationwide for the first time since Russia's February 24 invasion following a barrage of attacks which President Volodymr Zelenskiy said had struck a third of all power plants. Under the new energy-saving regime, power supply across Ukraine was on Thursday restricted between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. ""Russians have invaded our country, there is much anger against Russian leaders and Russian people,"" Mikhaylo Holovnenko, a Kyiv resident, said. ""But we are ready for outages. We have candles, charged power banks. Ukraine is charged to win."" Some grocery stories in Kyiv said they had noticed people starting to buy more 5 litre bottles of mineral water to prepare for possible water shortages. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of using energy and hunger as weapons. ""Scorched earth tactics will not help Russia win the war. They will only strengthen the unity and resolve of Ukraine and its partners,"" Scholz told the German parliament. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said Scholz was the last person who should be making such accusations. ""The German chancellor has clearly forgotten the Nazi past of his country and the 30 million Soviet people who were killed or died of hunger and cold during the war,"" Medvedev said. Russia's defence ministry confirmed it was again targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure, a strategy it has stepped up since the appointment this month of Sergei Surovikin - nicknamed ""General Armageddon"" by the Russian media because of his alleged toughness - as commander of what Moscow called its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Bordering Georgia, the Chechen Republic is governed by Putin's close friend Ramzan Kadyrov, who is known for his brutality and has been accused of countless human rights violations. Kadyrov, a vocal supporter of the war in Ukraine, has even sent thousands of his private militia, dubbed 'Kadytovites', to fight on the frontlines. But rebels were forced to act after Putin's close ally vowed to send 70,000 more Chechen troops to fight in the war-torn nation,the Daily Star reports. Local reports suggest that 10 Chechen 'refuseniks', or protesters, became embroiled in a massive shootout with members of Kadyrov's army on Saturday. The protesters reportedly opened fire with automatic weapons and grenade launchers before legging it from the site of the attack, a forest near the village of Samashki on the border of another Russian republic, Ingushetia. Local sources now claim that a ""large-scale targeted cleansing"" aimed at finding the 10 rebels has been launched by Kadyrov's henchmen. Speaking about his decision to send his own people to Ukraine, Kadyrov told local TV: ""We always want to live in peace and agreement with all countries - but some countries don't want that."" He continued: ""We will demonstrate that you can't joke like that with us. ""We're either friends, or we'll send them off with a one-way ticket."" This isn't the first time Samashki has witnessed historical military events. During the first Chechen war, which had the country in a vice grip throughout much of the 90s, the village witnessed a massacre at the hands of Russian soldiers from April 7-8, 1995. The slaughtering claimed the lives of more than 100 civilians, according to a report by United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) published the next year. The authors of the report wrote: ""According to the accounts of 128 eye-witnesses, Federal soldiers deliberately and arbitrarily attacked civilians and their dwellings in Samashki by shooting residents and burning houses with flame-throwers. ""The majority of the witnesses reported that many OMON [a branch of the National Guard of Russia often used to quash protests] troops were drunk or under the influence of drugs. ""They opened fire or threw grenades into basements where residents, mostly women, elderly persons and children, had been hiding."" Have you got a story to share? We want to hear all about it.

2022-10-19,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-army-vows-fight-death-28277381,Russian army vows to 'fight to death' as thousands are evacuated from Kherson,"The Russian army has vowed to ""fight to the death"" as tens of thousands are evacuated from Kherson in Ukraine. Civilians and Russian -appointed officials are fleeing from Ukraine's southern Kherson region and Vladimir Saldo, the Moscow-installed head of the Kherson region, said 50-60,000 civilians would leave four towns on the west bank of the Dnieper river in an ""organised, gradual displacement"". Russians are trying to cling to the captured city before a Ukrainian counteroffensive and Mr Saldo said the movement of civilians would be tied to a decision “to build sizeable defensive fortifications to repulse any attack”. Kherson was the first major city to fall to the Russians at the start of the war and remains the only regional capital under Moscow’s control, so retaking it would be a huge victory for Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official has accused Russia of staging a “propaganda show” in occupied Kherson after Russian-installed officials said they were preparing to defend the city from imminent Ukrainian attack and urged civilians to evacuate. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, wrote: ""The Russians are trying to scare the people of Kherson with fake newsletters about the shelling of the city by our army, and also arrange a propaganda show with evacuation. Propaganda will not work."" A Kherson retreat would have both positives and negatives for Putin's troops. It would allow the Russian military to pull back across the Dnipro River on their terms, thus preserving its equipment and saving the lives of soldiers. But such a retreat would be another humiliating defeat in the war and would hand a second major victory to Ukraine in one month. It would test his stated commitment to defend what he claims as Russian lands with all available means including nuclear weapons. Russia said on Tuesday that four Ukrainian regions, including Kherson, are under the protection of its nuclear arsenal. General Sergei Surovikin, the new commander of Russian troops in Ukraine, made a rare admission that the situation in Kherson was “not easy”. “Further actions and plans regarding the city of Kherson will depend on the developing military-tactical situation, which is not easy. We will act consciously, in a timely manner, without ruling out difficult decisions,” he added. Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to President Zelensky, mocked the Kremlin, saying it was only a month ago that Putin had declared that Kherson would be part of Russia forever. “Reality can hurt if you live in a fictional fantasy world,” he wrote on Twitter. Since Surovikin’s appointment 11 days ago, Putin's forces have unleashed a storm of missiles and Iranian “kamikaze” drones targeting Ukrainian infrastructure and the civilian population. Kyiv recently introduced a news blackout in the south of the country, causing many to speculate over whether it was preparing a new major offensive on Kherson. “When the Ukrainians have a news blackout it means something is going on. They have always done this before when there is a big offensive push on,” Michael Clarke, a former director general of the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, flew to Washington DC on Tuesday to discuss how to respond to Iran’s intervention. As the British Ministry of Defence said in its latest briefing that Russia’s military leadership in Ukraine was “increasingly dysfunctional”. It continued: “Poor lower-level leadership is likely worsening the low morale and poor unit cohesion in many parts of the Russian force.” Read more",14,3.9960235382811424,5.571033216306757,-1.5750096780256149,1
2022-10-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/fresh-explosions-cause-power-cuts-28266746,One third of Ukraine's power stations destroyed by Russia amid blackout fears,"Fresh explosions have rocked Ukraine today as Russia is accused of trying to wipe out the Ukrainian people by targeting energy infrastructure to deprive them of heat and water through the raw winter. Cities across Ukraine once again woke up to the sound of shelling as power and water supplies were knocked out in at least four cities on Tuesday. The 263,000 residents of Zhytomyr have been left without water and electricity after a series of missile strikes, the city's mayor said this morning and officials in Dnipro said a facility had been seriously damaged. Since October 10, Ukrainian officials estimate around 30 per cent of the country's energy infrastructure has been destroyed, causing mass blackouts. In the southern Ukrainian port of Mykolaiv, a missile slammed into an apartment building killing at least one man, a Reuters witness said, and blasts were heard and smoke seen rising in Kyiv, the capital. There were also reports of power facilities being targeted in the city of Kharkiv, a city with a pre-war population of 1.43 million people, close to the Russian border. Smoke was seen rising from the nation's capital of Kyiv as a building was hit in the north of the city, officials said. An advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks prove Russia's genocidal intentions for the Ukrainian people. In a Tweet, Mykhaïlo Podoliak wrote: ""Civilian infrastructure attacks, mass executions and raping, forced deportation, families separation, literature destruction in schools, 'dismantling of Ukraine ' official statements."" Tagging US lawmaker Steve Cohen he added: ""@RepCohen is right: Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine. This must be officially recognized."" Zelensky also accused Russia of terrorising and killing civilians with the aerial bombardment today. The fresh bombings came a day after drone strikes killed at least four people in cities including the capital, Kyiv. ""Ukraine is under fire by the occupiers. They continue to do what they do best - terrorise and kill civilians,"" Zelensky wrote on the Telegram messaging app. There was no immediate word on how many people had been killed in the strikes. Russia carried out its latest strikes on Tuesday after the United States warned it would hold Moscow accountable for any war crimes. Moscow denies targeting civilians. Its defence ministry has said it is carrying out attacks on military targets and energy infrastructure across Ukraine using high-precision weapons. In the port city of Mykolaiv, a Reuters witness said they had heard three explosions in the early hours of Tuesday. A missile had completely destroyed one wing of a building in the downtown area, leaving a massive crater, they said. A fire crew was seen pulling the dead body of a man from the rubble. ""In Mykolaiv, the enemy destroyed a residential building with S-300 missiles. A person died. There was also a strike at the flower market, the chestnut park. I wonder what the Russian terrorists were fighting against at these absolutely peaceful facilities?"" Zelensky said. The Russian strikes are said to be retaliation for a blast at the start of October on a bridge linking mainland Russia to Crimea - the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the explosion that damaged the Kerch Bridge, but Ukrainian officials celebrated the blast on social media.

2022-10-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russias-general-armageddon-who-masterminded-28269112,Russia's 'General Armageddon' who masterminded deadly attacks on Ukraine,"The Kremlin’s brutal “General Armageddon” armed forces commander has doubled down on Russia’s cruel campaign against Ukraine ’s civilian population with horrific missile attacks. Chechnya war veteran General Sergei Suvorikin’s troops have stepped up attacks on Ukraine’s power and war supplies whilst smashing missiles and kamikaze drones into residential areas. Suvorikin’s appetite for unleashing banned weapons on residential areas in war-zones has heightened fears he may carry out Putin’s threat of using weapons of mass destruction. An early morning blitz on a Kyiv power plant and water and energy supplies throughout Ukraine left hundreds of thousands stranded and huddled in air-raid shelters. Similar blasts in Dnipro, Mykolaiv and Zhytomyr left the threat of blackouts throughout Ukraine, lack of heating and water facing already terrified residents. One security source said: “There is a change in the type of attacks now as the Russian step up even further their attempt to dismantle infrastructure. “As winter sets in this will have serious consequences for the civilian population and Russia obviously feels Suvorikin is the man to carry out this campaign. “Strategically the aim is to terrorise the entire country as militarily Russia is failing in the east and southern frontlines.” Three people were killed in Kyiv and several others elsewhere in Ukraine amid fears of a mounting death toll from waves of Iran-supplied Kamikaze drones. It is believed Russian President Vladimir Putin installed violence-obsessed Suvorikin in a desperate bid to cower the country’s civilian population. The 55 year-old - who also served in Afghanistan and Syria- is also suspected of launching chemical attacks in Syria and is a Putin appointee. And it is believed he was recently installed as in charge of the Ukraine campaign because of his ruthless reputation for targeting civilians. Russian forces carried out fresh air strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities on Tuesday, causing several explosions in an area of northern Kyiv, possibly on a thermal power station. City mayor Vitali Klitschko said the attack was on ""critical infrastructure"" in northern Kyiv. President Zelensky said: ""Ukraine is under fire by the occupiers. They continue to do what they do best - terrorise and kill civilians. ""The terrorist state will not change anything for itself with such actions. “It will only confirm its destructive and murderous essence, for which it will certainly be held to account."" Two air strikes hit an energy facility in the southeastern city of Dnipro, leaving a raging fire. An air strike left the northern city of Zhytomyr without water and electricity supplies, its mayor said, and a Russian missile struck an apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv. The missile completely destroyed one wing of the building in the downtown area, leaving a large crater, killing one person so far. Zelensky added: ""In Mykolaiv, the enemy destroyed a residential building with C-300 missiles. “A person died. There was also a strike at the flower market, the chestnut park. “I wonder what the Russian terrorists were fighting against at these absolutely peaceful places.”",17,3.338243967806969,3.3140325521675713,0.02421141563939777,27

The Kremlin has killed more than 70 people in the past fortnight after ordering rocket and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities. President Volodymyr Zelensky said 30% of Ukraine's power stations have been knocked out in the blitz. Sections of Kyiv have been left without water and power following further blasts today. Speaking at a briefing in the capital on Tuesday, an emergency spokesperson said: ""In the period from October 7 to 18, as a result of shelling of energy facilities, about 4,000 settlements in 11 regions [of Ukraine] were cut off. ""Currently, according to the energy ministry, 1,162 settlements remain without power."" Power and water have been cut off in the city of Zhytomyr. Meanwhile, a Russian missile sparked a fire at an energy facility in the city of Dnipro. Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said the body of an elderly woman had been found under the rubble of a building destroyed by a Russian ""Kamikaze"" drone yesterday. It is believed Moscow has ordered more than 2,000 of the Iranian-made Kamikaze drones. Fears are mounting that Russia will deploy them in “swarms” in a bid to beat Ukraine’s air defences. The Kremlin also took delivery of Fateh-100 and Zolfaghar ballistic missiles from Tehran, delivered in a heavy transport II-76 Iranian cargo plane. Explosive-tipped Shahed-136 drones smashed into Kyiv on Monday, setting buildings alight, killing three and sending residents dashing into shelters. The port of Mykolaiv was also attacked by drones as Russia launched airstrikes on Odesa and up to 16 cruise missiles were fired from the Black Sea. One drone that piled into Kyiv was marked “For Belgorod” - indicating it was in revenge for attacks on facilities in the town at the weekend It marked the second horror barrage in as many weeks - after months during which air attacks had become a rarity in central Kyiv. By midday a swarm of at least 28 drones had been sent against the capital, many of them shot down in what Kyiv's Mayor Mr Klitschko dubbed: “Terrorism.” Energy facilities were struck, and one drone slammed into a residential building, killing three people, authorities in Kyiv said. Intense, sustained bursts of gunfire rang out as the aircraft buzzed overhead, as soldiers tried to shoot them down. Five drones plunged into Kyiv itself, said Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. Three bodies were recovered from the rubble, including those of a woman who was six months pregnant and her husband, said Mr Klitschko. The other person killed there was an older woman. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “The whole night, and the whole morning, the enemy terrorises the civilian population. “Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine. The enemy can attack our cities, but it won’t be able to break us.” A photo of debris from one of Monday’s strikes, posted by Mr Klitschko, showed the word Geran-2 marked on a mangled tail-fin. The 11-foot-long monsters, costing £17,000 each are fired vertically by rockets and then scream toward their targets at great speed.",17,3.60496600977596,4.738834630393572,-1.1338686206176116,27
2022-10-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-three-explosions-hit-central-28198108,Multiple explosions hit Kyiv as Ukraine targeted by Russian kamikaze drones,"Russia launched another brutal attack on Kyiv on Monday morning with multiple explosions using Iranian drones hitting residential buildings, for the second time in a week during the city's busy morning hours. Blasts could be heard in the Shevchenkivskiy district at around 7 am local time (5 am UK time) on Monday morning, with one of them coming near a train station. A further two loud explosions were reported after 8 am. The explosions are believed to have resulted from a hit by Iranian 'kamikaze' drones. Writing on social media, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said several residential properties had been damaged in the blasts and rescue teams had been deployed. He wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “The explosion in the Shevchenkiv district - in the centre of the capital. All services follow in place. Details later. The air alert continues. Stay in shelters!” Officials in Kyiv say that by 9 am local time a total of four strikes had hit the city, with the potential for more strikes to hit. Power outages were reported in the surrounding area shortly after and a high-rise residential building was also reported to have suffered damage from a Shahed-136 drone hit. Ukraine's first deputy minister of foreign affairs, Emine Dzheppar, shared an image of the debris from one of the Shahed-136 drones that hit Kyiv today. The blasts were followed around an hour later by what was thought to be Ukrainian defence trying to shoot down more incoming drones or missiles with surface-to-air defences. “At the scene of the first attack. Could hear the incoming roar and then an explosion. Ukrainian air defence was firing on it. Incredibly tense moment, sending police scattering and people running for shelter,” Christopher Miller, a correspondent for the Financial Times, wrote on Twitter from Kyiv. The Shevchenkivskiy district, a popular student area, was also damaged last week in the most intense bombings of the Ukrainian capital since the early days of the war. Russia ordered a huge aerial offensive against cities across Ukraine in retaliation for a blast on a bridge linking mainland Russia to Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A total of 19 people were reported to have died following the explosions. Ukraine has reported a number of Russian attacks with Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks. The drones are 11ft-long, can travel at speeds of 100mph and carry an explosive warhead in the nose which can inflict devastating damage on settlements. Reports of a deal with Russia have been denied by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who said his country “has not and will not” supply weapons for either side in the Ukraine conflict. The topic is due to be discussed by European Union foreign ministers in a meeting in Luxembourg today. Elsewhere, Russian and Ukrainian forces continued to fight heavily around Ukraine's eastern Donbas region over the weekend. Donetsk and Luhansk, which are now claimed by Russia following their annexation claim last month, saw scenes of gunfire as enemy forces faced off.",17,2.160479883630109,5.742660091510365,-3.5821802078802563,27
2022-10-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-threatens-equip-belarusian-warplanes-28254767,Russia threatens to equip Belarusian warplanes with nuclear missile capability,"Vladimir Putin will equip warplanes in Belarus with nuclear missile capability in his latest escalation of the war in Ukraine. The bold proposal comes as the Russian President hopes to respond to a string of military setbacks and a chaotic mobilisation programme with new 'defensive' measures aimed at projecting strength against the West. Belarus has moved closer into the war effort over recent days after President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, suggested without evidence that Ukraine had been planning military strikes against his nation. And on Saturday, the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed Belarusian Su-25 planes would soon be equipped with nuclear-capable missiles - although said this had not yet taken place. If delivered it would mark a major step for Belarus's air force and military, which is small by the standards of most nuclear powers. Belarus's defence ministry meanwhile confirmed on Sunday that around 9,000 Russian troops would be stationed in Belarus as part of a ""regional grouping"" of forces. Valeriy Revenko, head of the defence ministry's international military cooperation department, wrote on Twitter : ""The first troop trains with Russian servicemen who are part of the (regional grouping) began to arrive in Belarus. ""The relocation will take several days. The total number will be a little less than 9,000 people."" Lukashenko earlier confirmed he would be deploying troops from his own country to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and Western backers. It raises the prospect of a joint Russian-Belarus offensive in the north of Ukraine, with some in the country now fearing the imposition of a Russian-style draft of fighting-age men. The autocrat leader suggested Belarusian involvement was justified due to supposed threats from the Ukrainian military, saying: ""Strikes on the territory of Belarus are not just being discussed in Ukraine today, but are also being planned. ""Their owners are pushing them to start a war against Belarus to drag us there."" He added that Belarus had ""been preparing for this for decades"" and ""if necessary, we will respond"". Belarus's army contains approximately 60,000 people and earlier this year, Belarus deployed six battalion-tactical groups, totalling several thousand people, to the border areas.",14,6.592498426442723,4.34877731025318,2.243721116189543,15

About 65,000 of Putin 's soldiers have died so far according to estimates from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The latest estimate from Kyiv was shared on a Facebook post which included a tally of Russia's supposed casualties. As of today (October 16) ""about 65,000 (+300) persons liquidated"", said the statement. The sum is reported to be around 10,000 more than officials from Ukraine estimated last month on September 21, reports the Star. If the unverified figure is accurate, it means that Russia's death count after eight months would be beyond what the US's was during their battle in Vietnam. The shocking figure would equate to what was more than a decade of fighting, reports Newsweek. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund listed that, 58,281 Americans died while battling in the war. However, it is hard to know the exact number for sure as the Kremlin rarely addresses the figures in the public domain. Putin's country has before questioned Ukraine's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu about their supposed figures. It comes after it was alleged last month that 5,937 soldiers had been pronounced dead since Russia declared war on Ukraine. It has been reported that the US has made few observations on the number of casualties in Zelensky's country. At the start of August, the US approximated that 70,000 to 80,000 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded during the bloodshed. Professor Michael Clarke, from the Department of War Studies at King's College London, disputed Moscow and Kyiv's estimations. He explained: ""[The] Russian '5,000+' number is completely unrealistic. The Ukrainian number is probably too high, but may not be too far off the mark when all the evidence gets sifted."" He believed around 30,000 to 40,000 people had been killed under the Russian flag in Ukraine. The visiting professor stated that many of Russia's wounded die ""because they get no proper treatment and tend to be left to die on the battlefield unless the Ukrainians get to them early."" It has been reported that the amount of Ukrainian troops that are dead also remains unclear. According to the head of Ukraine's armed forces, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, almost 9,000 military personnel had died by August 22. Furthermore, the UN has confirmed 6,221 civilian deaths in Ukraine as of October 9.",14,6.0412178267483085,6.020858748012493,0.020359078735815217,3

The tyrant made the grave threat while speaking at a news conference in the Kazakh capital Astana today. He added: ""I hope that those who are saying this are smart enough not to take such steps."" Questioned on whether he had any regrets about the war, he answered ""no"", as he vowed there would be no further mobilisation of Russian civilians. He also suggested that the mobilisation of reservists, an order issued at the end of September which saw 300,000 drafted into battle, would be coming to an end soon. It comes after the tyrant was warned his entire army will be ""annihilated"" if he follows through with nuclear attack threats. The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has hit back at the Russian President's suggestion he could use tactical nukes on Ukraine. The former Soviet despot chillingly warned last month he wouldn't hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction if his country's territory is threatened. He told the West ""I am not bluffing"" but top diplomat Borrell has now retaliated saying ""neither"" is the EU or NATO, reports the Daily Express. Putin's national address on September 21 also saw him announce a partial mobilisation of civilians into his armed forces to help turn the tide in his stuttering invasion. That was followed by the sham annexation of four occupied regions as Russia continues to lose an estimated 500 soldiers a day to death or injury. Borrell has hit back over Putin's threats, warning him any nuclear attack on Ukraine will see his forces wiped out. The EU's top diplomat said at the opening of a Diplomatic Academy in Brussels: ""Putin is saying he is not bluffing. ""Well, he cannot afford bluffing, and it has to be clear that the people supporting Ukraine and the European Union and the Member States, and the United States and NATO are not bluffing neither. ""Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian Army will be annihilated."" This is the second huge warning directed at Putin in a matter of hours as fears continue to swirl over a possible Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the circumstances in which the defence alliance might have to use nuclear weapons are ""extremely remote"" but warned there would be ""severe consequences"" if Russia made such a move. He told a news conference after a meeting of NATO defence ministers: ""There would be severe consequences if Russia used nuclear weapons, any kind of nuclear weapon against Ukraine.

Heartbreaking images show the team rescuing injured 12-year-old Artem from the debris before he is put on a stretcher and carried to an ambulance. Ukrainian emergency services said that seven people could still be trapped in the debris almost 24 hours after the blast on Wednesday night. Footage shows the crew ushering others to safety while they worked to free little Artem who became trapped after his home was hit by a Russian missile. Workers inflated a device to ease the pressure from some of the debris on top of the boy and propping up a collapsed part of the building with various tools before the boy was freed. An aerial view of the building shows how the missile almost cut it in two. The images were obtained from the State Emergency Service (SES) of Ukraine for the Mykolaiv region on Thursday. A spokesperson said: ""Footage of the rescue of twelve-year-old Artem, who was buried under rubble as a result of an enemy rocket hitting a five-story residential building in one of the city's districts. ""The guy was under the rubble for more than 6 hours.

""At 7.50am, units of the State Emergency Service unblocked Artem. He is currently hospitalised in a medical institution. ""Doctors are conducting examinations and providing assistance. We believe that everything will be fine with Artem."" In a separate statement, the SES of Ukraine told of enemy shelling in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine near the Black Sea. ""A five-story residential building was destroyed. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, a child was rescued,"" they said. ""On October 13, around 1.25am, the Russian occupiers once again launched rocket attacks on the city of Mykolaiv, previously with S300 air defence missiles. ""One of the rockets hit a five-story residential building in one of the districts of the city. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest - under rubble."" The 12-year-old boy was rescued and handed over to doctors by 8am, the organisation said.

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"". Today marks the 232nd day of the war. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that between February 24 and October 13, Russia had lost around 63,800 personnel, 2,511 tanks, 5,167 armoured combat vehicles and 1,556 artillery units. Some 357 multiple launch rocket systems, 183 air defence systems, 268 warplanes, 240 helicopters, 1,182 drones, 316 cruise missiles, and 16 warships have also been reported lost. Russia has claimed that its casualties have been much lower but provides infrequent updates on its latest figures. The General Assembly of the United Nations has overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine, with 35 countries abstaining, including Pakistan, South Africa, India and China. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine” and Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s “attempted illegal annexation”, which he announced last month. Ukrainian military has announced that it has recaptured more territory near the southern city of Kherson. It is understood that five settlements in the Beryslav district of the north-eastern part of the Kherson region have been recaptured including Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, and Chervone. NATO allies have delivered new air defence systems to Ukraine after Russia launched a wave of missile attacks across the country, targeting civilian areas.

2022-10-13,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-ukraines-plan-use-crowdfunded-28231018,Ukraine's revenge plan using crowdfunded kamikaze drones after Russia bombings,"Ukraine has launched an ingenious campaign to get revenge after brutal Russian attacks across the country this week. Kyiv and a number of other cities were subject to devastating attacks this week that saw dozens left dead. But in response, one Ukrainian politician launched a crowdfunding campaign that has seen them raise almost £9million to buy up kamikaze drones to inflict damage on Russian forces. These drones are similar to Iranian-built drones that Russia used to bomb Ukraine ’s cities and inflict severe death and destruction just this week. The fundraiser raised a massive £8.7million, which meant they could buy an initial 50 Ram II drones which each carry a 3kg explosive payload. Serhiy Prytula, who organised the initiative, said further munitions would be bought over the coming days as well. He said: “They wanted to scare us but we united even more. Remember: never infuriate Ukrainians. Never. The people have donated for the revenge, so we will ensure the revenge happens.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, told G7 leaders on Tuesday that Russia had used a variety of munitions to strike Ukrainian cities over the previous two days, killing 20 people. He said: “The enemy has used more than 100 cruise missiles, dozens of different drones, including Iranian Shaheds. “And every 10 minutes I receive a message about the enemy’s use of Iranian Shaheds.” The Shahed-136 drones are similar to the Ram II in that they are not designed for a return trip. Whilst some have questioned their effectiveness, they have been deployed against Ukraine in recent days, causing particular damage in Zaporizhzhia . Regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said the drones had been used to target infrastructure within the city as a part of a wider strike that left 11 dead. The Ram II drones have already proven effective during Ukraine’s ongoing efforts to repel the brutal Russian invasion. Footage shared on social media shows one destroying a Russian 9k33 Osa surface-to-air missile system reportedly worth £634,000. Serhii Sternenko, an activist who co-founded the crowdfunding exercise, which was closed after 26 hours, said £24,507 had been donated in the first seven minutes of the appeal. He said: “Crowdfunding campaigns make our defence stronger; we, the people, help the Ukrainian army. But we still need more weapons from our allies to stop this terror and the crime of genocide Russia commits daily in this European country.” The news comes after a bloody week of fighting in Ukraine. The weekend first saw the bombing of a bridge in Crimea that linked it to Russia. The attack was considered a blow to Putin and in response Monday began with a number of Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, waking up to heavy bombings. More hellish footage emerged from the Ukrainian capital of wounded civilians and burning cars and buildings. Read more",17,4.596150019640465,3.556443468936093,1.0397065507043721,27
2022-10-13,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-soldier-drives-armoured-vehicle-28227508,Russian soldier drives armoured vehicle over landmines - and survives explosion,"Footage of the moment a Russian soldier drives over land mines and survives an explosion which wrecks his vehicle have emerged. The video shows what appears to be a Russian armoured personnel carrier advancing towards two rows of mines. As soon as it rolls over the first row, the mines detonate, seriously damaging his vehicle, which can be seen with a white 'Z' symbol on its side. The 'Z' is one of the symbols, as well as the letters 'V' and 'O' that can be seen painted on Russian military vehicles taking part in the invasion of Ukraine. Images then cut to a Russian soldier who appears to have been the one driving the vehicle, crouching in the road behind the remains of the armoured personnel carrier, apparently in shock. Smoke can be seen pouring from the vehicle as the footage ends. The images were obtained from the Office of Strategic Communications (StratCom) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Thursday. It also issued a statement which read: ""A morning is not a morning without a dead Russian. Have a great day everyone. Glory to Ukraine!"" Ukrainian media, however, has reported that the soldier survived the incident. It is unclear if there were other troops inside the armoured personnel carrier. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"". And today marks the 232nd day of the war. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that between 24th February and 13th October, Russia had lost about 63,800 personnel. It also published a list of military vehicles which it had destroyed. They included 2,511 tanks, 5,167 armoured combat vehicles, 1,556 artillery units, 357 multiple launch rocket systems, 183 air defence systems, 268 warplanes, 240 helicopters, 1,182 drones, 316 cruise missiles, 16 warships, 3,935 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 140 units of special equipment.

It comes as a UN General Assembly resolution called Moscow's annexation of Ukrainian territory ""illegal"" and Ukraine's allies committed more military aid. Russia repeated its position that the West, by helping Ukraine, indicated that ""they are a direct party to the conflict"" and warned the admission of Ukraine to NATO could trigger World War Three. ""Kyiv is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to a World War Three,"" deputy secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Alexander Venediktov, told state news agency TASS on Thursday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced a surprise bid for fast-track membership of the NATO military alliance at the end of September, after Russian President Vladimir Putin held a ceremony in Moscow to proclaim four partially occupied regions as annexed Russian land. In the past 24 hours, Russian missiles hit more than 40 settlements, while Ukraine's air force carried out 32 strikes on 25 Russian targets, Ukraine's Armed Forces General Staff said. Mayor of the port city of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Senkevich, said in a social media post that the southern city was ""massively shelled"". ""A five-storey residential building was hit, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest - under rubble. Rescuers are working on the site,'' he said. A shipbuilding centre and a port on the Southern Bug river off the Black Sea, Mykolaiv has suffered heavy Russian bombardments throughout the war. Russia also targeted a settlement in the region of Ukraine's capital Kyiv using explosive drones early on Thursday, the region's administration said on the Telegram messaging app. Governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said based on preliminary information the strikes were caused by Iranian-made loitering munitions. These are often known as ""kamikaze drones"". Critical infrastructure facilities were hit by the drones, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Zelenskiy's office. Missiles struck more than 30 multi-storey and private houses, gas pipelines and power lines in the city of Nikopol in the Dnipropetrovsk region, and more than 2,000 families were left without electricity, Dnipropetrovsk Governor Valentyn Reznichenko wrote on Telegram. Reuters was not able to immediately verify the report. NATO's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russia's missile attacks were a sign of weakness. ""Russia is actually losing on the battlefield,"" Stoltenberg said. Putin has intensified the conflict as his forces continue to lose ground, ordering the call-up of hundreds of thousands of reservists, proclaiming the annexation of occupied Ukrainian territory and repeatedly threatening to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia. Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons to protect Russian soil, which he says includes the four regions he declared annexed last month. US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he doubted Putin would resort to nuclear weapons. A senior NATO official said a Russian nuclear strike would almost certainly trigger a ""physical response"" from Ukraine's allies and potentially NATO.

Oksana Leontieva got her five-year-old son Gregory dressed, took him to school and then got in her car and headed to work before she was brutally killed by one of the 84 missiles that Russia fired. Ohmatdyt Hospital, the pediatric medical centre where she worked, confirmed the details of her death in a statement on Tuesday. “This young woman was a true professional and supporter of her patients and colleagues,” the hospital wrote. “She was a selfless and responsible person and doctor.” They said her car burned to the ground in the centre of Kyiv and Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said Gregory's father had also died six months ago, but did not say how. Gregory has now been left orphaned and in the care of his grandfather. Ms Leontieva had worked in Okhmatdyt’s bone marrow transplant unit for 11 years, saving the lives of children with blood cancer. “Every day, Oksana saved children with cancer, gave happiness to parents and life to children. Her life was cut short by terrorists who daily destroy our country and kill civilians,” Kateryna Zahorna, her colleague, wrote on Facebook. She continued: ""There are no words or strength to express the depth of sadness and the strength of hatred for these inhumans."" The strike that killed the doctor was part of a barrage of missiles fired by Russian forces which caused brutal death and destruction in cities across Ukraine. It was one of the biggest attacks since the war broke out in February, killing at least 19 and injuring around 90. At least five people, including Ms Leontieva, were killed in Kyiv on Monday, and the 14 others elsewhere. Yurii Zaskoka, the head of the Kyiv police force’s cybersecurity department, was another one of the victims who also died while driving to work, said Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry. A crowdfunding appeal was launched after the attacks and has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. Serhii Sternenko, an activist who co-founded the crowdfunding exercise, said: “Crowdfunding campaigns make our defence stronger; we, the people, help the Ukrainian army. But we still need more weapons from our allies to stop this terror and the crime of genocide Russia commits daily in this European country.” Out of 83 Russian (and Iranian imported) missiles fired, 45 were shot down but if Ukraine had more and better air defence systems then the deaths would have been avoided. Ukraine is seeking more advanced air defence and anti-missile systems from western nations to counter any repeat of Monday's brutal attack.

Yevhen Zhukov, head of the patrol department of Ukraine's National Police, said a mass grave ""in which 180 were buried"" had been discovered in ""freed Lyman,"" adding that ""whole families lie in mass graves."" ""The youngest is only one year old,"" the prosecutor general's office said in a statement on its website. ""She is buried next to the whole family"", it continued. Some mass graves were marked with names and dates of birth. One with a doll resting on a cross read ""Yelena Kisil, born Oct. 18, 2019."" Another, Lyudmila Kisil, was born on March 27, 2021. Both baby girls died on May 24, 2022, during the period when Russian forces were battling to seize Lyman. Russian troops withdrew from Lyman at the start of October after Ukrainian troops recaptured the area just two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that the region was one of four that were annexed for Russia last week. Preliminary results indicated that the deaths resulted from “explosive and projectile injuries, bullet injuries"", they did not say whether there were any signs of torture but did not exclude it. The Ukrainian governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko said officials had begun investigating both burial sites, so he asked people not to speculate on the details until the investigation was completed. A Ukrainian official also said last week that the bodies of at least 530 people have been discovered in recaptured areas of the Kharkiv region since September 7. Yevhen Yenin, Ukraine's First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, said the bodies included 225 women, 257 men and 19 children, while 29 bodies haven't yet been identified. Some bodies, Mr Yenin said, had ""a rope around their neck, hands tied behind their back, bullet wounds to their knees, and broken ribs."" Last month the bodies of 436 people were exhumed from a burial site in the northeastern town of Izyum after it was liberated. Most appeared to have died violent deaths, local officials said. The news comes as Pope Francis condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop.

Ukraine ’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said a wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities by Russian forces had targeted energy supplies in a move chosen to inflict cause as much damage to civilians as possible. Russia fiercely shelled central Kyiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Lviv in some of the most intense blasts to hit Ukraine since the early days of the war. Preliminary reports suggest that at least 19 people died and around 90 were injured, as children on their way to school were sent running for shelter. In a statement, Zelensky said: ""The morning is difficult. We are dealing with terrorists. Dozens of missiles, Iranian 'Shahids.' They have two targets. Energy facilities – throughout the country. Kyiv region and Khmelnytsky region, Lviv and Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Frankiv region, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy region, Kharkiv region, Zhytomyr region, Kirovohrad region, the south. They want to panic and chaos, they want to destroy our energy system."" Despite Russia’s claims it has attacked strategic military targets, blasts around four key cities left large parts of Ukraine with blackouts and water shortages. Authorities in Kyiv reported damage to facilities and power lines in 12 regions of the country, out of 27 in total. Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesman for the UN Human Rights Office, warned the recent strikes ""amount to a war crime."" She continued: ""Damage to key power stations and lines ahead of the upcoming winter raises further concerns for the protection of civilians and in particular the impact on vulnerable populations."" Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said: ""These are war crimes planned well in advance and aimed at creating unbearable conditions for civilians."" He said it was part of a ""deliberate strategy"" by Moscow as winter approaches. UK Security Minister Tom Tugendhat branded the strikes on Ukrainian cities ""war crimes"" while Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said they were ""unacceptable"". Shevchenko Park in central Kyiv, one of the city’s busiest parks usually packed with people and street musicians, was obliterated in the blasts. Journalist Olga Tokariuk tweeted: ""This is the park we used to go to often with my child. She would play on the playground, and then we'll go for crêpes at a kiosk nearby.

The alleged incident in the annexed Crimea peninsula is said to have seen a young girl taken to hospital. A video shows a pile of rubble behind a broken area of fencing off a rural road. Russian Telegram channel Baza reports the house is on Sadovaya Street, in Dzhankoy. It says the girl was an 11-year-old called Diana who suffered a laceration to her forearm. Describing the incident, the military insider channel said: ""In Crimea, a tank was being repaired and accidentally fired – the shell flew eight kilometres and hit the wall of a private house. ""A girl was injured. The tank was being repaired in the village of Novostepnoye. ""During repair works there was an unintentional shot. ""The shell hit the house located on Sadovaya Street in Dzhankoy. ""At that moment, 11-year-old Diana was there - the girl received a laceration to her forearm and was hospitalised."" Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of civilian troops last month in an effort to turn the tide of his stuttering Ukraine invasion. US estimates suggest Moscow is losing around 500 soldiers per day to injury or death. The new recruits are said to be being sent to the frontlines ill-equipped and without proper training, only to be met with plucky defending troops armed with NATO weapons and intelligence. It comes after the Kerch Bridge, connecting Russia to Crimea, was damaged in an explosion on Saturday. In retaliation, Putin ordered the relentless bombing of multiple Ukrainian cities, including capital Kyiv, killing at least 26 people. It is Moscow's biggest aerial offensive since the start of the invasion in February. Putin described the bombing as a ""terrorist act"". Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has today detained five Russians and three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia over the explosion. The FSB said the attack was orchestrated by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, and its director Kyrylo Budanov. Crimea, on the northern coast of the Black Sea, had been gifted to Ukraine by Soviet Russia. In 2014 Russians seized control, before organising an illegal referendum supporting Russian annexation, but most countries recognise Crimea as Ukrainian. Last month despot Putin also illegally annexed four further Ukrainian regions and vowed to use ""all the power and all the means"" at his disposal to defend them. Hastily staged referendums saw Moscow's proxies in the occupied regions claim majorities of up to 99% in favour of joining Russia. These were Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south. Ukraine and Western governments described those votes as bogus, illegitimate and conducted at gunpoint.",17,3.808470967754764,3.9856602840992714,-0.1771893163445073,20

Irina Tsybaneva, 60, faces up to five years in jail after allegedly writing in the note that she wished for the Russian president to die. It is the second time a note has appeared at the grave in Serafimov cemetery, St Petersburg to protest the war. The pensioner’s son Maksim Tsybanev, general director of a construction company, told local news outlet Mediazona that his mother had been detained over a note left at the grave. The 37-year-old said: “What was in the note is not known for certain. But she said that there was a wish [for Putin] to die."" Putin’s mother Maria died aged 87 in 1998, and his father Vladimir 1999 the following year aged 88. Tsybaneva at first refused to open her apartment when police came, only doing so when they threatened to smash their way in. Her lawyer Sergey Trusov said a case had been opened under “desecration of the dead and their burial places, committed on the grounds of political, ideological, and racial, national or religious hatred or enmity”. She appeared before Primorsky District Court in St. Petersburg, where investigators want her to be held in detention pending trial. In a separate incident last month, anti-war protesters posted a note saying: “Dear parents! Your son is behaving disgracefully! “He skips history lessons, fights with classmates, threatens to blow up the whole school. Take action!” The stunt was from a group of Russian art activists known as The Party of the Dead. The earlier protest also wished for Putin’s death. The group expressed the hope that the dead parents would “take him to themselves someday”. The messages on the tomb of Putin's parents come as his unpopular ""partial mobilisation"" has triggered an upsurge in protests. Last month, the Russian president called on 300,000 men to fight in the war in Ukraine. Seven months ago he launched his 'special military operation' and expected to conquer Ukraine capital Kyiv within a matter of days. However, they have been pushed back at almost every turn by Ukrainian fighters, armed with NATO weaponry and intel. US officials have estimated that Russia is losing 500 soldiers a day as the defending forces barge them out of the eastern regions. There are also reports of the new conscripts being given no training before being sent to the frontlines with rusty guns. Britain's Ministry of Defence said last month that ""many tens of thousands"" of draftees had already received papers. They were expected to be sent swiftly to the frontline where they were ""likely to suffer a high attrition rate"", it said. ""The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilisation, suggests that many of the drafted troops will deploy to the front line with minimal relevant preparation.""",14,4.49655246134642,6.295954839596037,-1.7994023782496171,12

Repeated threats from within Russia that nuclear weapons could be used has stoked fears in the West. The number of NATO warships in the North Sea has been doubled to 30 with a focus around key infrastructure after recent suspected attacks on vital gas pipelines. It remains unclear who was behind explosions last month affecting gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. Moscow has denied any involvement and pointed the finger at the United States. Thankfully NATO has not noticed any change in Russia's nuclear posture following the threats, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday. Stoltenberg also said NATO allies would meet any attacks on critical infrastructure with a ""united and determined response"". The alliance will proceed with its annual nuclear preparedness exercise ""Steadfast Noon"" next week - in which NATO air forces practise the use of US nuclear bombs based in Europe with training flights - without live weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to leaders of the Group of Seven nations for more air defence capabilities after a string of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. On Monday, dozens of strikes killed 19 people, wounded more than 100 and knocked out power supplies across the country in Moscow's biggest aerial offensive since the start of its invasion on February 24. The strikes came days the partial destruction of the Kerch bridge, which connects Crimea to mainland Russia. The bridge became a symbol of Russia's commitment to the annexed territory. Ruling out peace talks with Putin, Zelensjy told G7 leaders: ""When Ukraine receives a sufficient quantity of modern and effective air defence systems, the key element of Russia's terror, rocket strikes, will cease to work"". On Tuesday the first of four IRIS-T air defence systems sent by Germany arrived in Ukraine and the White House later said it was speeding up the shipment of sophisticated NASAMS air defenses.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, who also served as a NATO commander, called the tyrannical leader a ""cornered rat"" as he advised a series of steps for how the West could protect the besieged nation. He said to prevent further bloodshed, the alliance needs to bring an immediate halt to the possibility of Putin using tactical nuclear weapons on Ukrainian cities. It comes as Russia continues its bombardment of its neighbour for the second day, hitting key civilian infrastructure targets in a number of Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv. It is a direct response to a suspected truck bomb which killed at least three and took with it a huge chunk of the Kerch bridge on Saturday. The Kerch bridge - which connects the Russian mainland to Crimea - is a symbolic and tactical link between Moscow and its annexed territory. Speaking on BBC radio this morning, Col de Bretton-Gordon said: ""At the moment we've been reacting to incidents, we need to be proactive. ""He might be a cornered rat and that is a very good analogy but we cannot just let him go on firing 80 odd missiles a day at schools and hospitals in Kyiv and other cities around Ukraine and stand back. ""We cannot hold the coats for too much longer, we must get in there. ""All these other dreadful things we are facing like the cost of living and people worrying about climate chance unless we get this right in Ukraine they will all become horrifically irrelevant."" He added: ""He's a desperate person, an irrational tyrant is up against the ropes and hanging on by his fingertips. ""In my opinion tactical nuclear weapons are an option. NATO must be proactive to make sure he can't use them."" This morning Ukraine's emergency services announced at least 19 people were killed and another 105 wounded during yesterday's assault. One pro-Putin military expert warned Russia's bombing of Ukraine could go on all winter and plunge the country ""back into he 19th century"". Kyiv and other cities across the country are being fiercely shelled in the most intense blasts to hit the Ukrainian capital since the early days of the war. Britain's top cyber spy said today that Britain would expect to see indicators if Russia was starting to consider dyploying its nuclear arsenal in its war with Ukraine amid clears and claims the despot could press the button. After more than seven months of war, Jeremy Fleming, director of the GCHQ spy agency, told BBC Radio that Russia was running short of munitions, friends and troops. Putin has so far stayed within established military doctrine of not using nuclear weapons, Fleming said, but his agency would be looking out for signs that this could change. ""I would hope that we will see indicators if they started to go down that path,"" he said, without saying what those indicators could be. ""But let's be really clear about that, if they are considering that, that would be a catastrophe in the way that many people have talked about"".

2022-10-11,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/putin-accused-war-crimes-indiscriminate-28214176,Putin accused of war crimes as 'indiscriminate attacks on civilians' kill 23,"Russian missiles slammed into cities in Ukraine today, leaving thousands without electricity and water in a second day of attacks that have killed at least 23 people. The air strikes by cruise missiles and explosive drones also wounded over 100 people as the West accused Vladimir Putin of targeting civilians. In Lviv, 30% of the city was affected by power cuts and thousands were left with no water after three explosions. Ukraine ’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said today's bomb strikes on power and water infrastructure were “war crimes” which aimed to create “unbearable conditions for civilians”. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg accused Russia of “horrific and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and critical infrastructure”. Military expert Professor Michael Clarke told Sky News: “The Russians are condemning the Ukrainians to a pretty miserable existence in the winter.” The West is scrambling to supply more air defence systems to Ukraine with Germany and the US promising weapons within hours of the Lviv attack. Streets in Kyiv were largely deserted as air-raid sirens blared at the start of rush hour today, and thousands took shelter in underground bunkers. Kyiv resident Viktoriya Moshkivski, 35, and her family were among hundreds waiting for the all-clear in the Zoloti Vorota station, near a park bombed on Monday. She said: “Putin thinks if he scares the population, he can ask for concessions, but he is not scaring us. He is p***ing us off.” In Zaporizhzhia, missiles have struck apartment blocks overnight at least three times in the past week, killing civilians as they slept. A missile also hit Vinnytsia in central Ukraine, injuring three people and seriously damaging critical infrastructure. Ukraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Yevheniy Yenin said: “They’ve hit many [targets] yesterday and they hit the same and new ones today.” He said hundreds of settlements around Kyiv, Lviv and elsewhere were without power. But as many as 20 Russian cruise missiles and 13 explosive drones were blown out of the sky. Iranian-made Shahed drones have been sent from Russia to Belarus, which is forming a joint military brigade with Russia, but its 50,000 troops are badly trained and equipped. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine would fight on. He said: “We will make the battlefield more painful for the enemy.” The air strikes, seen as revenge for an explosion on Kerch Bridge linking Russia to Crimea, come as Russian troops are being beaten back in the east and south. Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of the UK’s listening station GCHQ, said his organisation was “very proud” of the role the UK had played in Ukraine’s defence. He told the BBC that Russia was running short of munitions and troops and GCHQ would expect to see indicators if Putin was considering deploying its nuclear arsenal in the war. Ukraine today called on Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi to take “all possible measures” to free the deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after he was kidnapped by Russian forces. Putin today met United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Saint Petersburg. The Sheikh said he had “affirmed” the UEA’s aim to “reduce tensions and find diplomatic solutions to crises” in situations such as the war in Ukraine. Russia faces a UN vote condemning its annexation of four Ukraine regions this week. Western officials believe they will win to leave Moscow “very bruised and isolated” on the international stage.",17,3.426987100494477,2.120077392234927,1.3069097082595502,27
2022-10-11,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/top-academic-calls-putin-continue-28208521,Professor calls for Putin to continue bombing Ukraine so 'it no longer exists',"A leading academic backing Vladimir Putin has called for the relentless bombing of Ukraine this winter so it ""no longer exists as a nation"". Associate professor Andrei Sidorov, dean of the Faculty of World Politics at Moscow State University, wants to trigger a new surge of war victims fleeing into the EU and Britain. Further missile attacks aimed at civilian infrastructure, as Putin ordered this week, could lead to a new exodus from Ukraine - similar to that of the start of the war in February. Dr Sidorov is suggesting using it as a weapon of war, tantamount to genocide. He told state TV: “Why do we need hungry, cold, dirty, poor Europe? We can cut off all ties with them. “What’s more, if we cut them off, we will put Europe on the brink of survival. The Americans won’t help them."" Dr Sidorov continued: “We should wait for the right moment, and cause a migration crisis for Europe with a new influx of Ukrainians."" He suggested doing so ""after the new year, towards spring"", saying it would exploit ""economic and social tensions in Europe"" due to rising energy prices. He then urged Putin: “The situation we’re living through right now should be handled rationally. Not emotionally - and the rationale is Ukraine as a nation should not exist. “We don’t need Europe. We can cut it off right now starting with the Baltic states."" The comments came as a Russian missile strike hit critical infrastructure in a city just 40 miles from NATO country Poland today. Witnesses reported three explosions in the city shortly after noon local time (0900 GMT). The blasts left 30 per cent of the town temporarily without electricity, according to the city's mayor Andriy Sadovyi who announced the news on Telegram. He added that the water supply had also been disrupted in two of the city's districts. Russia is staging a huge military response to the bombing of the Kerch Bridge on Saturday, when a truck bomb exploded taking with it a huge chunk of the 12-mile road and rail link between Russia and its annexed territory, Crimea. The bombings began at around 8am yesterday, during the rush hour, as schoolchildren and other civilians dodged the raining missiles to find shelter. This morning Ukraine's emergency services announced at least 19 people were killed and another 105 wounded during yesterday's assault. Britain's top cyber spy said today that Britain would expect to see indicators if Russia was starting to consider deploying its nuclear arsenal in its war with Ukraine amid clears and claims the despot could press the button.

2022-10-11,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/poland-tells-citizens-flee-belarus-28207627,Poland urges citizens to flee Belarus now as bomb shelters checked for readiness,"Poland has advised its citizens to immediately flee Belarus after President Alexander Lukashenko announced a 'joint military task force' with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday fired 83 missiles at what he claimed were military, energy and communications networks in Ukraine for the first time in months. However, Kyiv said that the missiles actually hit civilian areas, large power plants, and tragically killed at least 19 - wounding many more. Blasts were also heard in the cities of Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and in the western city of Lviv, and the strikes in Kyiv were the most central to hit the capital. Putin's blitz on Ukraine comes as the largest barrage since the opening day of the war - the 24 February 2022. Now in a shock to his country, dictator Lukashenko, 68, has announced that his own units will combine with Russian forces and deploy to the Ukrainian border. The tyrant also accused Kyiv of planning to attack, with help from allies Poland and Lithuania. Warsaw then went on to urge its Polish citizens in Belarus - a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Ukraine to the south and Poland to the west - to flee the country as relations have become increasingly tense. The Polish government wrote on its website: ""We recommend that Polish citizens staying on the territory of the Republic of Belarus leave its territory with available commercial and private means."" In 2021, relations between Warsaw and Minsk deteriorated after Poland accused its eastern neighbour of orchestrating a migrant crisis on its border. Relations have become even more strained since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lukashenko's decision comes after one of Putin's staunchest allies warned that the huge missile barrage unleashed on Ukraine is only the 'first episode' of Russia's revenge for the Kerch Strait Bridge - also known as the Crimea Bridge - over the weekend. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, has warned that Ukraine poses 'a constant, direct and clear' threat. He went on to add that the Kremlin should aim to ""completely dismantle the political regime of Ukraine"" which he described as 'Nazi'-like. Despot Lukashenko now appears to be laying out the groundwork to join the war following yesterday's attacks, despite his country only acting as a staging ground for Russian attacks on Ukraine. He announced that Putin's troops would combine with his own, and would deploy to the Ukraine border. Reportedly, in June this year, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus announced that it is planning to increase its army to a stronghold of 80,000 people and will be equipped with military equipment that is 'currently in storage', according to Pravda. In fear over what this may mean to its citizens, Polish interior minister Maciej Wasik responded on Monday that his government is now checking the condition of its bomb shelters to make sure they are fit for purpose. Wasik went on to say that this move is merely 'routine' and is not a response to Russia's bombardment - although, according to Reuters, the process of checking the shelters will last for up to two months. The minister told private broadcaster Polsat News: ""We have 62,000 such facilities across the country. ""Firefighters are checking their condition, whether they are equipped, and whether they are fit for use. If not, we will take steps to adapt them."" However, he shockingly added that Warsaw is preparing for the 'darkest scenarios' - even if there is only a 'small probability that they will occur'. NATO member Poland has however reassured its citizens that its place in the alliance guarantees their safety from Russian attack, but they need to be prepared for the possibility of a missile strike. Meanwhile, US President Biden has condemned the widespread missile attacks in Ukraine in a statement. He said that the strikes targeted innocent civilians and served no military purpose, saying: ""The United States strongly condemns Russia's missile strikes today across Ukraine, including in Kyiv. These attacks killed and injured civilians and destroyed targets with no military purpose. ""They once again demonstrate the utter brutality of Mr. Putin's illegal war on the Ukrainian people."" Since the invasion of Ukraine began, the United States has provided more than $16.8 billion (£14 billion) worth of U.S. security assistance, with Biden stating that his country are committed to stand behind the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. In his statement, Biden continued to say: ""These attacks only further reinforce our commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. ""Alongside our allies and partners, we will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression, hold Putin and Russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes, and provide the support necessary for Ukrainian forces to defend their country and their freedom.""",17,2.3058088668959837,3.2675403143818746,-0.9617314474858909,29

He added that the water supply had also been disrupted in two of the city's districts. The head of the Lviv Regional Military Administration, Maksym Kozytsky, noted on Telegram that an attack was carried out on a power facility in the Lviv region. “Lviv and the Lviv region: possible power outages. Once the alarm is over, we will engage all services to quickly resume network operation. Stay in shelters, the threat is still ongoing,"" Kozytsky said. Similar strikes had hit the same electricity supply centre on Monday. City authorities said late on Monday that power had been largely restored in the region, but Ukrainian Deputy InteriorMinister Yevheniy Yenin said some settlements in the region were still without electricity on Tuesday morning.

Fleming also said he was sure Putin was worried about the dangers of escalation and that might be a sign of why ""he hasnot reached for these other forms of waging war"". In a speech due to be delivered later on Tuesday, Fleming will also say that Russians were beginning to understand thedesperate situation Moscow is in over the conflict. ""They're seeing just how badly Putin has misjudged the situation,"" he will say, according to excerpts from his speech. ""They're fleeing the draft, realising they can no longer travel. They know their access to modern technologies andexternal influences will be drastically restricted. And they are feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war ofchoice."" But pro-Kremlin pundits have hit back at Western claims that Moscow is running low on missiles. Kindergartens in Russia's Maria El republic are reportedly open round the clock so parents can work night shifts at secret defence plants to supplying weapons' manufacturers. Speaking on state-owned Channel 1 TV, military expert Yuri Podolyaka said: ""We can certainly easily, without a particular strain on the stockpile, sustain [Monday's] level of intensity.

2022-10-10,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putins-brutal-new-right-28198454,Putin's 'brutal' new right-hand man with bloody past linked to Ukraine bombings,"Vladimir Putin ’s “brutal” new war commander Sergei Surovikin is believed to be responsible for today’s horrific bombing of Ukrainian cities. General Surovikin, 55, is a “totally ruthless” military commander with a history of indiscriminate bombing and little regard for civilian casualties, according to experts. The British Defence Ministry said the General's career “has been dogged with allegations of corruption and brutality."" Some say his appointment on Saturday is part of the reason why the attacks in Ukraine on Monday were so brutal. At least 10 people have died, but the true toll is believed to be higher, in the horrific attacks which were some of the worst in the seven months since the war began. In televised remarks, Russian President Putin said Moscow had launched long-range missile attacks against Ukraine's energy, military and communications infrastructure on Monday in retaliation for an attack on the bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula over the weekend. Mr Surovikin has previously been found guilty of stealing and selling weapons and was also sentenced to prison but then let off following allegations that he was framed. The general, born in 1966 in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, has twice been in jail after soldiers under his command killed three demonstrators in Moscow during the August 1991 coup that preceded the end of the Soviet Union and its repression. He was later released without trial. In 1995, he received a sentence – later overturned – for the illegal arms trade. Commanding troops in Chechnya say he was remembered for stating his intent to kill three insurgents for each of his soldiers who they killed “During his service in the Urals region Surovikin was involved in numerous scandals,” said a 2012 report in Nova Region. He also commanded Putin’s troops in Syria culminating in his award of the Kremlin’s highest medal - Hero of Russia. The general was accused of overseeing a brutal bombardment that destroyed much of the city of Aleppo in Syria and a report by Human Rights Watch listed him as one of the commanders “who may bear command responsibility for violations” during the 2019-2020 offensive in Syria’s Idlib. Surovikin’s command in Syria also coincided with the Khan Sheikhoun Sarin nerve agent attack, which killed 90 civilians and injured over 500 people. The appointment on Saturday came after two Russian senior military commanders were sacked as Kyiv has made impressive gains in clawing back territories lost to Russia in the northeast and south of Ukraine. “Surovikin knows how to fight with bombers and missiles — that’s what he does,” Gen. Kyrylo O. Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service, said in June. But one expert said the appointment will not solve the Russian army's problems. Frederick B. Hodges, a former top U.S. Army commander in Europe, told the New York Times: “All the problems are institutional, deeply rooted flaws — corruption, lack of readiness.” Read more",14,4.827896828057514,3.5276050125208736,1.3002918155366405,3

Through the night and into this morning, cities across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, were targeted by relentless bombings that lasted hours. So far eight people have died and 24 have been injured. The death toll is expected to rise. Videos and pictures emerged from capital city Kyiv showing widespread devastation and damage. Cars were pictured burning as debris was scattered across the city, and a playground - once popular with young children - was turned into a crater. But, even though this was the first attack on the capital in months, Ukrainians remained defiant in the face of the bombings. Social media was flooded with videos showing acts of resistance, small and large. Some groups of people were filmed sheltering in bomb shelters and Kyiv subway network singing the national anthem and other patriotic songs. Social media networks were flooded with videos of resistance in the wake of the attacks, as people in bomb shelters and in the Kyiv subway network sung the national anthem and other patriotic anthems - even as bombs fell. The country’s defence ministry also tweeted: “So, russkies, you really think you can compensate for your impotence on the battlefield with missile strikes on peaceful cities? “You just don’t get it do you - your terrorist strikes only make us stronger. We are coming after you.” Inna Sovsun, a member of Ukraine's parliament, shared a video on Monday morning from a Metro station in Kyiv showing defiant Ukrainians sitting on the steps, waiting out the attack. She wrote: “Metro station in Kyiv where I am with my son now. Very crowded, lots of kids. People are calm, no panic.” The camera showed crowds of people sheltering down the long tunnel and the same crowd was later shown singing in a second clip. Footage from another shelter showed children gathered around tables, doing their primary school work as they sung the Ukrainian national anthem. Other clips echoed the defiant spirit seen across the capital. The missiles hit Kyiv around 8am this morning, as the city commuted to work and school. Blasts were heard loudest in the Shevchenk district, in the centre of the city, and at least 83 rockets were fired at Ukraine, their military said. General Valeriy Zaluzhny said: “The terrorist country, Russia, has carried out massive missile and air strikes on the territory of Ukraine, also using attack drones. “In the morning, the aggressor launched 75 missiles. 41 of them were shot down by our air defence.” The brutal attack was seen as being in retaliation for the bombing of the Kerch bridge, a vital artery that links Crimea and Russia. Moscow pinned the blame on Kyiv, calling the incident a terrorist act. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Read more",17,3.4130208249701592,2.17688870077851,1.2361321241916494,17

Widespread attacks on seven cities including Kyiv killed at least 11 and wounded at least 87 as parts of the capital were left in flames during one terrifying rush-hour salvo. Among those killed in Kyiv were the head of the police cyber force Colonel Yuri Zaskov as the death toll from attacks was expected to rise. The US embassy ordered all citizens to take to bunkers and then flee Ukraine as soon as the all-clear was issued but the Red Cross vowed to “remain in Ukraine.” Explosions were reported in Lviv, Ternopil and Zhytomyr in western Ukraine, Dnipro and Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia in the south and Kharkiv in the east. Missiles continued to fall on Ukraine late into the afternoon and swathes of the country were left without power as residents fled to bunkers throughout the day. Dozens of cruise missiles fired from air, land and sea marked the biggest wave of strikes to hit locations away from the front line, at least since the Feb. 24 invasion started. Suspected Iran-made explosive drones were also launched, with 13 of them shot down and more than 40 missiles hit by Ukraine’s ground-to-air defences. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested in a TV address it was a revenge attack for Kyiv blowing up his Kerch bridge, linking annexed Crimea to Russia. In a deluded rant he said: “The Kyiv regime, with its actions, has put itself on the same level as international terrorist organisations. With the most odious groups. “To leave such acts without a response is simply impossible.” He confirmed he had ordered “massive” long range strikes and warned of more strikes in future if Ukraine hits Russian territory. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the attacks were deliberately timed to kill people, as well as to knock out Ukraine’s power grid. His prime minister said 11 major infrastructure targets were hit in eight regions, leaving swaths of the country with no electricity, water or heat. Zelensky said: “They are trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth.” In Kyiv there were horrific scenes - the dead body of a man lying in the street, flaming cars and destruction and women lying bleeding nearby. The Kremlin was humiliated two days ago when a blast damaged Europe’s longest bridge, which it had built after it seized and annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014. But the escalation drew widespread condemnation with the UK Prime Minister calling for the “further isolation of Russia”. Downing Street condemned the “needless and senseless violence” in Ukraine. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss ”strongly condemned Putin’s appalling attacks on civilian area in Kyiv and elsewhere.” Her spokesman said: “We are keeping a close eye on these increasingly reckless tactics being used by Russia in response to Ukraine’s advance.” By mid-morning, Ukraine’s defence ministry said Russia had fired 81 cruise missiles, and Ukraine’s air defences had shot down 43 of them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky filmed a video message on a mobile phone on an empty central Kyiv street. He said the strikes had two main targets: energy infrastructure and people. “Such a time and such targets were specially chosen to cause as much damage as possible,” he said. Later he added: “The world once again saw the true face of a terrorist state that is killing our people.” His Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted: “Putin is a terrorist who talks with missiles.” Olena Somyk, 41, sheltered with her 6-year-old daughter, Daria, in an underground garage where hundreds of other people waited for the all-clear. She said: ““Really, I think they did this because they are b******s. “Putin is a small angry man, so we don’t know what more to expect.” British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly offered the UK’s “ongoing moral and practical support” to his counterpart in Kyiv, Kuleba. He said: “Russia’s firing of missiles into civilian areas of Ukraine is unacceptable. “This is a demonstration of weakness by Putin, not strength.” UK Security minister Tom Tugendhat added: “Targeting civilians is a vile act. “Russian war crimes start as a record of failure and disgrace.” The UK’s ambassador to Ukraine Melinda Simmons said British staff in Kyiv were safe and said her thoughts are with those hurt in the city. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has ordered troops to deploy jointly with Russian forces near Ukraine It was also claimed more than 1,000 Iranian-made drone missiles have been transported from Russia to Belarus. Russia has faced major setbacks on the battlefield since the start of September, with Ukrainian forces bursting through front lines and recapturing territory. Putin responded to the losses by ordering a mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists, proclaiming the annexation of occupied territory and threatening repeatedly to use nuclear weapons. But tens of thousands of Russians have fled the country to avoid the draft, fearing death in the Ukrainian killing fields. And there have been widespread protests against the threat of being press-ganged into war by Putin, with draft offices being torched and protest marches throughout Russian cities.",17,2.2153192340583323,2.4982476955058908,-0.28292846144755845,27

Sunday night into this morning saw the country rocked by a series of relentless attacks across a number of cities. Kyiv was attacked for the first time in months and at least eight people died in the capital, with 24 known to be injured - but the death toll is expected to rise. In light of the escalation, the US embassy in Kyiv sent out an urgent email to all Americans in the country, The Financial Times reported. It read: ""The U.S. Embassy urges US citizens to shelter in place and depart Ukraine now using privately available ground transportation options when it is safe to do so."" The recent attack was said to pose a “direct threat” to US citizens in the country and in the communication they also listed a number of tips for people. This included warning that the security situation in Ukraine remains “highly volatile” and could worsen at any moment. It also advised people on how to act during missile attacks and how to seek safety. Today’s vicious attack came in retaliation after the Kerch Bridge, a vital artery connecting Crimea and Russia, was bombed over the weekend. UK Security Minister Tom Tugendhat branded the strikes on Ukrainian cities ""war crimes"" while Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said they were ""unacceptable"". The missiles launched overnight struck Kyiv, Dnipro, Lviv and a number of other cities in an hours-long attack. Videos and pictures captured the horrifying aftermath of the attacks with parts of Kyiv were left burning. BBC presenter Hugo Bachega was reporting on Ukraine’s latest counter-attack when he was interrupted by the bombing. The programme cut back to the studio as the journalist ducked off his chair and out of shot. CCTV images from across the city also captured the destructive impact of the attack and in the aftermath cars were pictured burning as sirens rang across the city. Officials confirmed that energy infrastructure was targeted in Lviv and Kharkiv in the attacks. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky posted on Telegram, he said: ""They are trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth...destroy our people who are sleeping at home in Zaporizhzhia. Kill people who go to work in Dnipro and Kyiv. ""The air raid sirens do not subside throughout Ukraine. There are missiles hitting. Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded."" This all comes as Russia scrambles to respond to Saturday’s bombing of the Kerch Bridge - an embarrassing blow to the Kremlin’s ongoing invasion. The bridge was a key artery linking Crimea and Russia, built since the illegal annexation in 2014. The last few months of the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine have been marked by a number of successful Ukraine counterattacks. But Putin’s forces have kept up the pressure in a number of hotspots, particularly in their efforts to break into Bakhmut. In fighting here, the Ministry of Defence said Russia was utilising members of the Wagner privacy military and criminals recently sprung from their own prisons.

Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has condemned the attack on the Kerch Bridge as “an act of terrorism”. And Ukraine has now braced itself for huge new attacks by the tyrant, in alleged revenge for the carnage ensued on the £3.3 billion bridge Putin commissioned and opened on the 15 May, 2018. On the Kremlin Telegram channel, the despot has also gone on to claim that: “There is no doubt. This is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critically important civilian infrastructure,” adding that this attack was “devised, carried out and ordered by the Ukrainian special services”. He has already rained down missiles on Zaporizhzhia as a 'welcome message' from brutal new war commander general Sergei Surovikin - causing civilian deaths. Heavy new attacks were also reported early today in Kyiv and Dnipro. And ex-Kremlin president Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia ’s security council, has even gone as far as to vow to kill unspecified Ukrainian “terrorists”, saying: “The failed state of Ukraine is the mastermind and perpetrator of the crime. “This is a terrorist act and sabotage carried out by the criminal regime in Kiev. “There is no doubt, and there never was."" He continued: “All reports and conclusions have been drawn. Russia's response to this crime can only be the direct destruction of the terrorists. In the way that is accepted in the world. “That is what the citizens of Russia are waiting for.” Meanwhile, it has been revealed that Eduard Chuchakin, 53, and his wife Zoya Sofronova, 33, well known tourist guides and documentary-makers in St Petersburg, died on the spot in the bridge blast. The couple were both history graduates of Putin’s alma mater St Petersburg State University where Eduard was a specialist in the tsarist architecture of St Petersburg, and Zoya had been a journalist. Reportedly, the pair had been travelling in their Cadillac car en route to film in Crimea for their YouTube channel. Tragically, their vehicle plunged into the waters of the Kerch Strait when several sections of the bridge horrifyingly collapsed from the blast. The vehicle was close to a truck which was reported to have contained a huge quantity of explosives. A report stated that: “Zoya and Eduard were travelling with their Moscow friend to shoot a sequel to a documentary about the Romanov [Russian royal] family"". The bodies of the pair were pulled from the water below the bridge, the report added. Additionally, it has been reported that the driver of the truck carrying the ammunition, Makhir Yusubov, 52, was also believed to have been killed in the blast. Russia is now gearing up to blame the West for the bridge attack. This is because Putin's close ally, Alexander Bastrykin, head of the Russian Investigative Committee, said the red-coloured truck had been to NATO country Bulgaria as well as Georgia, Armenia, North Ossetia, the Russian region of Krasnodar ahead of the explosion. His claims have been backed up by Russian war reporter Alexander Kots, who said that two trucks were involved in the operation. A cargo - with 22 loads of polyethylene film, with nine rolls - arrived by sea in the Georgian port of Poti from Bulgaria after crossing the Black Sea. The receiving customer was a ""citizen of Ukraine"", who organised for the goods to be loaded onto the truck with “foreign number plates”. From Poti, the large vehicle travelled to Armenia, where the cargo was cleared under custom union rules applying to some ex-USSR countries, it was claimed. It then travelled up to Russia, where it entered from Georgia via the Upper Lars checkpoint - which is currently being used by men fleeing Putin’s mobilisation call-up. At some point in the journey, the rolls of polythene with explosives rolled into them were transferred to the truck which exploded on the bridge, it was claimed. Kots believes this was done in Bulgaria, saying: “The explosives had somehow been placed in the [polythene] film rolls. “And this was done in Bulgaria… “So, apart from Ukraine, foreign special services could have been involved in the organisation of this terrorist act."" The journalist went on to add: “The driver of the first truck is already giving evidence. “Most likely, like the driver of the second truck was used blindly and was unaware of what he was carrying.”",17,2.1999509041085883,3.679469620658597,-1.4795187165500088,27

In televised remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow had launched long-range missile attacks against Ukraine's energy, military and communications infrastructure on Monday in retaliation for an attack on the bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula over the weekend. This is a significant uptick in response, as President Putin made it very clear that if there were further attacks on Russia then the Kremlin's response would be very harsh. On Sunday night and Monday morning, Russia fiercely shelled Ukraine's capital Kyiv and other cities across the country in some of the most intense blasts since February. Preliminary reports suggest that at least eight people died and 24 were injured in the strike in Kyiv as of 08:45 am local time, as children on their way to school were sent running for shelter. The true toll is believed to be remarkably higher. As well as Kyiv, the cities of Lviv, Ternopil, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro were also hit by shelling amid calls for revenge from Russian hardliners to retaliate for hitting a bridge in Crimea. Russia accused Ukrainians of carrying out ""terrorist attacks"" and Putin appeared to say in his address that the Kremlin's strikes on civilian infrastructure were a like-for-like response to Ukraine hitting the Kerch Bridge — a key artery between occupied and mainland Ukraine. Putin is implying in his speech that if there are more attacks like the one on the bridge, then the Russians will avenge more fiercely. He said that Russia will match the ""intensity"" of the attacks against it, ""have no doubt about that"". Ukrainian officials were triumphant after the bridge blast but Kyiv has not explicitly claimed responsibility. Putin referenced the recurrent shelling of the nuclear power station in Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia and said a Russian nuclear power station in the region bordering Ukraine has also been targeted three times in recent months. “The Kyiv regime has been using terrorist methods for a long time,” he said. Ukraine's Defence Ministry has vowed revenge for Monday's strikes on the country, as it said Russia used Iranian drones in missile strikes on Kyiv. ""If attempts continue to carry out terrorist acts on our territory, Russia's responses will be harsh and in their scale will correspond to the level of threats created for the Russian Federation. No one should have any doubt about that,"" Putin continued. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader, praised Russia's airstrikes across Ukraine on Monday and said everything before was Russia ""not even really getting started."" Mr Kadyrov said he is ""100% happy with the conduct"" of the invasion. Read more",17,2.297864364310823,2.2156445551061967,0.08221980920462624,27

President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said he agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the deployment of a joint regional group of troops, in response to what he called an aggravation of tension on the country's western borders, the state-run Belta news agency reported on Monday. Lukashenko and Putin warned about a strike on Belarus from the territory of Ukraine. “Due to the aggravation on the western borders of the Union State, we have agreed to deploy a regional grouping of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus"", he said. He continued: ""This is all in accordance with our documents. If the threat level reaches the current level, as it is now, we start deploying the Union State grouping. “The backbone – I have always talked about this – of this grouping is the army, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus. ""I have to inform you that the formation of this grouping has begun. It has been underway for, I think, two days already. My order was given to us to start forming this group."" The news comes as Russia is fiercely shelling Ukraine's capital Kyiv and other cities across the country in the most intense blasts to hit the Ukrainian capital since the early days of the war. As for warnings about strikes from Ukraine, Mr Lukashenko said his answer was simple, to tell the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky and ""other insane people"" that the Crimean bridge ""will seem like flowers to them if they touch at least one meter of our territory with their dirty hands."" The Belarusian President previously said he received assurances from the Russian warmonger that Russia would regard an attack against Belarus as an attack against Russia. ""Strikes on the territory of Belarus are not just being discussed in Ukraine today, but are also being planned,"" Lukashenko said at a meeting on security, without providing evidence for the assertion. ""Their owners are pushing them to start a war against Belarus to drag us there."" Belarus's army has about 60,000 people and earlier this year, Belarus deployed six battalion-tactical groups, totalling several thousand people, to the border areas. On Sunday, the head of Belarus's border guards accused Ukraine of provocations at the border. Russian forces used Belarus as a staging post for their invasion of Ukraine at the start of February, sending troops and equipment into northern Ukraine from bases in Belarus.

At least eight people have died in the horrific attacks as Russia struck across the country and videos revealed the extent of the devastation. A BBC presenter was mid-broadcast when the terrifying moment the programme was interrupted by Russian explosions that rocked Kyiv was caught on camera. A Ukrainian girl was walking down the street, filming herself when the rockets could be heard raining down on the city - the blast nearly engulfing her. Others across the city caught the harrowing moment and its aftermath on video. The city hadn't come under siege for months until this morning's attacks, thought to be an attempt at revenge after the Kerch bridge, connecting Russia to Crimea, was bombed over the weekend. In the aftermath of the brutal bombing, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky released a short video address saying Iranian missiles had been fired at cities including Kyiv, Dnipro and Lviv and that they wanted ""panic and chaos"". One particularly distressing video shows a young Ukrainian girl filming herself as she walked down the street. But she was interrupted by the missile strike and viewers can see her terrified expression as she first turns towards the noise of the bombing above Kyiv. The video then erupts in the light of the explosion as debris is blown across the camera and she can be seen being knocked back by the force of the blow. She screams and begins running for shelter. The same attack was captured from a different angle on the BBC this morning, as it reported from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Presenter Hugo Bachega was reporting on the destruction of the Kerch bridge - a shocking counter-attack that was a hammer blow to Vladimir Putin ’s stuttering invasion. Behind the reporter, the iconic golden domes of St. Michael's Monastery could be seen when he stopped talking and glanced over his shoulder. He first attempted to continue the broadcast before looking back again as loud noises could be heard across the Kyiv sky before they were followed by an explosion. The reporter then ducked off their chair as the broadcast cut back to the studio. It unwittingly captured the shocking strike on the Ukraine capital city which many have viewed as revenge for the attack on the Crimea bridge. UK Security Minister Tom Tugendhat branded the strikes on Ukrainian cities ""war crimes"" while Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said they were ""unacceptable"". According to early reports the blasts, believed to be caused by missile strikes, have caused deaths and injuries. Another video showing the blast, shows a man walking along a bridge in the sun as he goes about his morning. A huge explosion shakes the scene from the left as fire and smoke billow across the screen, sending him running for cover. Other images filtering out from the aftermath of the attack show what remains of a children's playground in the centre of Kyiv. The colourful playsets sit beside a huge crater in the ground where the explosion struck. Footage taken from someone leaving Kyiv by car that morning shows a huge black smoke mushroom cloud rising above the city, reflecting the scale of the attack. Videos shared on social media shows a black mushroom cloud of smoke rising into the sky above the city, whilst cars have also been pictured burning. Other videos taken by those in the city centre show the destroyed remains of cars and debris littering the streets. Further explosions have also been heard in Lviv and Ternopil, in Ukraine’s west, and Dnipro, in the centre of the country. Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported multiple blasts this morning, less than two days after Russia's Kerch Bridge was partially destroyed in what Putin bemoaned was ""a terrorist act"". ""Several explosions in the Shevchenskivskyi district - in the centre of the capital"", former heavyweight boxing champion Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. Air defences have been activated above the city, and a spokesperson for the State Emergency Services told the Suspilne public broadcaster the explosions have caused deaths. ""The details are being confirmed,"" the spokesperson said. Resident Rita Armstrong tweeted: ""4 explosions in #Kyiv right now. Russians are shelling my home city….The air raid siren has been on since yesterday evening."" Kyiv Post news editor Jay Beecher said he was woken up by two loud blasts. He tweeted: ""Hasn’t happened here in the capital for a little while, but sadly we were expecting it."" Mr Zelensky said in a video address. “(The Russians) chose such a time and such targets on purpose to inflict the most damage.” Amid the onslaught, the Ukrainian leader said on his Telegram account that Russia is “trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth. “Please do not leave (bomb) shelters,” he wrote. “Let’s hold on and be strong.” In the aftermath of the attack, Putin spoke out today in a meeting with Russia's security council to claim his country's response to Ukraine's so-called aggressions will be ""very harsh"". In televised remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow had launched long-range missile attacks against Ukraine's energy, military and communications infrastructure on Monday in retaliation for an attack on the bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula over the weekend.

A senior aide to the Ukrainian president said Russian rocket strikes on cities across Ukraine on Monday were a signal to the civilised world that “the Russia question” must be solved with force. “Cowards fighting playgrounds, children and people,” Andriy Yermak wrote. Continuing: “This is another signal to the civilised world that the Russian question must be solved by force.” Shevchenko Park in central Kyiv, one of the city’s busiest parks usually packed with people and street musicians, was obliterated in the blasts. Journalist Olga Tokariuk tweeted: ""This is the park we used to go to often with my child. She would play on the playground, and then we'll go for crêpes at a kiosk nearby. There was always a queue because they were so good. It's so painful to watch."" Footage posted on social media shows one of the first strikes in Kyiv struck a glass pedestrian bridge, known as the Klitschko bridge. It opened in 2019 and connects St. Volodymyr Hill and Khreshchaty Park on the riverbank and the arc in the back used to commemorate Ukraine and Russia’s so-called friendship. Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine, wrote a statement on Telegram saying: “On the 229th day [of the war], they are trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth.

Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded. Please do not leave shelters. Take care of yourself and your loved ones. Let's hold on and be strong."" Head of the Mykolaiv regional military administration said that a new load of Kalibr missiles have been launched from the Black Sea and so residents should brace for more imminent attacks. Aleksandr Lukashenko, President of Belarus and Putin have agreed on the deployment of a joint Russia-Belarus regional group of troops, a potentially significant development. “My answer was simple: 'Tell the president of Ukraine and other insane people that the Crimean bridge will seem like flowers to them if they touch at least one meter of our territory with their dirty hands',” he said. Lukashenko. The backdrop to all of this was what happened on Saturday when an explosion resulted in the partial destruction of the Kerch Bridge, a key crossing between Russia and Crimea - and a pivotal symbol of Moscow's annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of terrorism after the attack. In a video released by the Kremlin on Sunday, Putin accused “Ukrainian secret services” of carrying out a “terrorist attack aimed at destroying critical Russian civilian infrastructure”. The attack - which saw a truck driving from the Russian side blow up - killed three people, Kremlin investigators said. Officials said work to fix the damaged sections would begin immediately. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin ordered the destroyed parts of the bridge to be taken down. Ukraine has not taken responsibility for the explosion but has given thinly veiled approval for it. President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the incident in his nightly address on Saturday, saying: ""Today was not a bad day and mostly sunny on our state's territory. ""Unfortunately, it was cloudy in Crimea. Although it was also warm,"" he added. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen fighting focused on the regions north of Crimea most recently. Six missiles were launched overnight on Saturday from Russian-occupied areas. Zelensky also said on Saturday that Ukrainian troops were involved in very tough fighting near Bakhmut. Russian troops are coming closer to the strategically important eastern town of Bakhmut, having advanced up to 2 km (1.24 miles) towards the town over the last week, a British intelligence update said today.

Intelligence officials said the elite ODON unit of the Russian National Guard is bolstering security around the Russian capital and that all military units are on ""high alert"". The briefing came hours after the Kerch bridge linking Russia to Russian-annexed Crimea was partially destroyed in a suspected Ukranian attack. Ukraine has not claimed official responsibility for the strike, with some officials suggesting that it was a result of Russian infighting. ODON troops - formally named the Separate Operational Purpose Division - are a rapid deployment internal security division of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Ukrainian intelligence sources claim the 18,000-strong military unit commanded by Major General Nikolai Kuznetsov have started setting up blockades in the capital and arresting soldiers deemed a threat to Russian security, reports The Sun. It comes as Putin is planning to hold an operational meeting of his Security Council on Monday two days after the Kerch bridge explosion, which he has called an ""act of terrorism"". Speaking at a meeting alongside the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin, Putin also formally accused Ukraine of being behind the attack. ""There is no doubt, this is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying Russia's critical civilian infrastructure,"" he said, according to the BBC. ""Its authors, perpetrators and beneficiaries are the security services of Ukraine."" Mr Bastrykin said that the truck they say blew up on the bridge had travelled through Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, North Ossetia and Krasnodar Territory.

""Information about victims is being confirmed, but it is already known about dozens of dead or injured."" Earlier, city official Anatoliy Kurtev had said at least 17 people were killed in shelling when missiles hit a high-rise apartment complex and buildings. Reuters could not independently verify the report. The city is about 125 km (80 miles) from a Russian-held nuclear power plant that is Europe's largest. Kyiv and Moscow have blamed each other for shelling at the Ukrainian-operated facility, which has damaged buildings and threatens a catastrophic nuclear accident. Local Ukrainian news sites claimed 49 people had been hospitalised, including six children, as the rockets targeted residential high-rises and private houses. Zolochiv.net said: ""A 9-story building was partially destroyed. Five private houses were destroyed. ""Affected infrastructure objects. 20 cars were damaged."" It added that a rescue operation was underway as some people are still suspected to be trapped underneath the rubble, after eight people were pulled from the wreckage. However, Ukraine has been celebrating advances after a huge explosion ripped through a Crimea bridge, in the Kerch strait, which links Russia and with the region. Locals reported hearing powerful explosions at around 6am on Saturday morning while footage shared on social media shows the moment an enormous fireball ripped through the middle of the bridge. With the Russian army being forced to retreat further on a daily basis recently, a US officer has reportedly said that ""the recapture of Crimea by Ukraine is now a distinct possibility and can no longer be discounted."" Speaking to the Telegraph the official continued: ""It is clear that Russia no longer has the ability or willpower to defend key positions, and if the Ukrainians succeed in their goal of recapturing Kherson, then there is a very real possibility that it will ultimately be able to recapture Crimea."" Russian news agency, TASS, reported the cause of the blast was a train on the bridge which caught fire. Oleg Kryuchkov, adviser to the head of Crimea, said that a fuel tank has caught fire on one of the sections of the Crimean bridge and that the shipping arches are not damaged. “Preliminarily, a fuel tank is on fire in one of the sections.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""Tomorrow the president has a planned meeting with the permanent members of the Security Council"" The Council comprises of 12 of some of the most powerful people in Russia, including top state officials and heads of defence and security agencies such as the director of the FSB, Aleksandr Bortnikov. This comes just days after a blast destroyed a section of the Kerch Bridge, a vital piece of Russian infrastructure that connects Crimea with mainland Russia. General Lord Richard Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said he would expect Russia to escalate with indiscriminate shelling of Ukrainian civilian targets and that there was also the threat that Mr Putin “might go nuclear”. Ukainian media has reported a dozen fatalities with scores injured when the suspected truck bomb exploded, taking with it a large portion of the 12-mile bridge. Western powers fear the tyrant will be enraged and want revenge for the destruction of the bridge, which he personally opened in a ceremony in 2018. Warning of dire consequences, the Kremlin leader has previously said any attack on the Kerch Strait would spark ""judgment day"". The bridge, which at 19km is the longest in Europe, was hailed by Russian state media as ""the construction of the century"". Costing £2.7bn, Russia claimed it was protected from threats from air, land and water using a range of defences even including specially trained dolphins. As the conflict drags on, many fear Putin will unleash more deadly weaponry such as chemical weapons or tactical nuclear strikes. The US has splashed out $290m in buying up a drug used to treat radiation sickness. President Biden has described as the highest nuclear risk since 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. But, the government said that the purchase of Nplate pills was nothing to do with it. A spokesperson for the Human Services Department (HSS) in Washington, who announced the decision, told The Daily Telegraph: ""This is part of our ongoing work for preparedness and radiological security. It has not been accelerated by the situation in Ukraine."" Nplate pills are used to treat acute radiation syndrome (ARS), one of the most dangerous threats caused by nuclear blasts. Vladimir Putin indicated he is prepared to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia, and the tension has been ramped up by his annexation of four regions of Ukraine where heavy fighting is taking place. Another of Putin's close allies, propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, called for Ukraine to be battered back to ""dark times"" for blowing up Putin's precious bridge - by bringing back a nefarious Soviet-era intelligence agency infamous for killing innocent civilians. He said: ""It's time to remember Soviet military training and act decisively and creatively. ""Not responding to the enemy's actions, but breaking their plans, striking unexpected blows in directions where the enemy is not expecting them. ""Ukraine should be plunged into dark times. Bridges, dams, railways, thermal power plants and other infrastructure facilities should be destroyed throughout Ukraine. ""The country should switch to a military mode - entirely. This should include SMERSH making a return."" ""Everything for the front, everything for victory,"" he adds. SMERSH - which translates to ""Death to Spies"" - was the umbrella organisation of three intelligence agencies that was controlled and answered directly to the Red Army and Stalin himself. In the wake of the bridge bombing, Russian missiles hit the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killing dozens of people. ""Overnight, the Russian occupiers cynically struck the residential buildings and civil infrastructure,"" Ukraine's military central command said on its Facebook page.

The footage increases the likelihood that Putin's key crossing was targeted by a Ukrainian attack in the hours after his 70th birthday. The videos seem to suggest a truck explodes while on the road section of the bridge as it drives towards Kerch in Crimea. Three people were killed in the blast, which may have been caused by a suicide bomb in a truck. So far there have been no reports of sightings of incoming missiles. But some witnesses claimed there were two explosions . Earlier today, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence inferred that their forces may be responsible for detonating t.he bomb. The government department wrote: ""The guided missile cruiser Moskva and the Kerch Bridge – two notorious symbols of russian power in Ukrainian Crimea – have gone down. What’s next in line, russkies? On one of the videos, a man can be heard sayinfPdeo is heard saying: ""It seems to me there were two explosions, no? -- If it was a missile, it would hit the second [rail] bridge too in any case.” There were suggestions Putin may address the nation on the bridge explosion amid fears he will unleash havoc on Ukraine. He has already hinted that he could use nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. Videos showed extensive damage to the structure after the flames had been extinguished. Russia launched a criminal case into the damage to the bridge, said the country’s Investigation Committee. It comes days after a US official claimed that Ukraine could retake the region as Russia continues to flounder in its war. Widespread images on social media show the bridge in the Kerch strait linking Russia with Crimea ferociously ablaze. One video shows that a road section of the bridge has completely given way and collapsed into the sea while a freight train appears to be stationary and ablaze on the rail part of the key link between Russia and the Crimea that was opened in 2018. Residents in the area have reported hearing powerful explosions at around 6am local time on Saturday morning. A train on the bridge has caught fire, according to a Crimean official, reported the TASS agency. Oleg Kryuchkov, adviser to the head of Crimea, said that a fuel tank has caught fire on one of the sections of the Crimean bridge and that the shipping arches are not damaged. “Preliminarily, a fuel tank is on fire in one of the sections. The shipping arches are not damaged. It’s too early to talk about the causes and consequences. Work is underway to extinguish the fire,” Kryuchkov wrote in his Telegram channel. Traffic over the Crimean bridge was stopped by the Russian authorities, TASS added. Vladimir Putin's forces have failed to make the swift progress through Ukraine that was expected by many at the start of the invasion and recently they have been forced to retreat in the south and east of the country. In a video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his forces' latest offensive had liberated 940 square miles and 96 settlements in the country's east.

2022-10-07,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-behind-car-bomb-killed-28175727,"Ukraine behind bomb that killed daughter of Vladimir Putin's guru, US spooks say","The daughter of a Putin propagandist was killed in a car bomb authorised by the Ukrainian government, the United States intelligence agencies have said. Intelligence agencies believe parts of the Ukrainian government authorised the car bomb attack near Moscow in August that killed Daria Dugina. Ms Dugin was a prominent supporter of the Kremlin's war in Ukraine and the daughter of Alexsandr Dugin, a far-right proponent of Russian imperialism sometimes referred to as ""Putin's brain."" The US has condemned Ukrainian officials as they are concerned such attacks, while high in symbolic value, could provoke the Kremlin to expand the conflict further. She was killed in a car bomb attack near Moscow in August and officials in Washington had not been made aware of the operation ahead of time. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine ’s president, insisted that Ukrainian officials were not involved. “I’ll underline that any murder during wartime in some country or another must carry with it some kind of practical significance,” he told The New York Times. Ms Dugina was driving her father's car and American and Russian officials think he may have been the original target of the attack. Mr Dugin was supposed to drive into Moscow with his daughter but decided at the last minute to travel back in another car. “An explosive device allegedly installed in a Toyota Land Cruiser car went off at full speed on a public highway, and then the car caught fire "", the state investigative committee said in a report. It continued: “The female driver died on the spot. The identity of the deceased has been established: it is the journalist and political scientist Darya Dugina.” US officials declined to disclose who in the Ukrainian government was believed to have authorised the mission, who carried out the attack, or whether President Volodymyr Zelensky had signed off on the mission. But one anonymous senior Ukrainian military official revealed that Ukrainian forces, with the help of local fighters, had carried out assassinations and attacks on accused Ukrainian collaborators and Russian officials in occupied Ukrainian territories. They said that included the Kremlin-installed head of the Kherson region who was poisoned in August. CNN ratified the New York Times' claims and published a report on US officials' belief that ""elements"" in Ukraine's government approved the attack. “We have nothing to do with the murder of this lady – this is the work of the Russian special services,” Oleksii Danylov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security Council, said in August. Both Dugin and Dugina were sanctioned by the United States after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February. The US accused them of spreading propaganda and acting to destabilise Ukraine. Russia is yet to avenge Ukraine in a specific way to Dugina's assassination, but Washington is thought to be concerned that the wheels are in motion for a retaliation.

President Vladimir Putin last month began mobilising civilian recruits to help his stuttering invasion of Ukraine in which 500 Moscow troops are estimated to be being killed or wounded per day. And the new soldiers - many of whom are desperately trying to dodge the draft - are ordered to provide their own gear and then foot the bill, it has been claimed. A checklist allegedly sent out to Army personnel on signing up includes many items used for a camping trip - including a torch, spare batteries and a mug. A rough translation sees the list even described as a ""minimal requisite equipment for military business trip"". But it also specifies an ""Armoured helmet (ATLAS , OMNITEC, 6647)"" and ""bullet proof vest"". Have you been conscripted into the Russian army? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk Due to thousands of conscripts attempting to buy the items at once, it has opened the door for a lucrative black market. Military history author and researcher Chris Owen - who shared the list on Twitter - said: ""If anyone's wondering where civilians get body armour, tactical gear, and helmets, a lot of it is being sold on Avito (Russia's eBay). ""It's not just military surplus, it's often current kit being resold by corrupt military logistics staff who've stolen it from army depots."" In one of his photos from Avito, a helmet and body armour combo was costing ₽25,000 (£368) in the middle of last month. But in another screen grab from the site on September 29, it shows body armour on its own had rocketed to ₽135,000 (£1,960). Before the huge hike in price, Mr Owen had predicted: ""The sellers are going to be gouging the buyers for every ruble they can get."" The author goes on to suggest loan sharks appear to be taking full advantage, offering microcredit to families whose loved ones can't afford the equipment. According to Telegram channel Baza, newly mobilised troops have then found themselves fighting off attempts by existing contract soldiers to rob them of their sought after gear once on base. Mr Owen described it as a ""dog-eat-dog world"" in the Russian army. Translating from claims in the Telegram channel, he wrote: ""In a military unit near Moscow, contract servicemen wanted to take away some of the mobilised men's equipment and telephones. ""This did not work: the newcomers simply beat up the 'oldtimers'."" It is believed the incident took place in Alabino - which houses a military training ground where mobilised troops are being taken. Continuing his translation, Mr Owen said: ""Soldiers who were attached to the unit started demanding clothes and mobile phones from the newcomers. ""The newcomers did not tolerate such an attitude and responded to the extortion with brute force."" According to Baza, a ""mass brawl broke out"" and around 20 ""grandads"" - the nickname for older soldiers - were beaten up. ""The situation really got out of hand: the beaten men managed to escape only by locking themselves in one of the unit's rooms. From there they called the police,"" it adds. From there officers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs were reportedly called in before an ""agreement"" was reached and no police report was filed.",14,6.285523130550855,3.3324903857417674,2.9530327448090876,12

Rookie soldiers have moaned that they been ""no training"" as they travel to the frontline. A video shows the men publicly complaining about their treatment in “brutal, absolutely appalling conditions” after they were mobilised by Vladimir Putin. The shocking footage is the latest evidence of the total chaos over the Russian call-up of reservists that has led even Kremlin cheerleaders in despair. But it also highlights the rising dissent by the reluctant fighters who have been forced by Putin into battle against Ukraine. The desperate recruits risk punishment by venting their fury over their plight after arriving by train in Belgorod region which borders Ukraine. One of the soldiers acting as a spokesman for the miserable men said: “There are about 500 of us, all armed. Yet we are not registered to any military unit. “We spent a week in brutal, absolutely appalling conditions. We had no provisions, no money - nothing at all. “We have no clue who is going where, which military unit. Our weapons are not registered to us. “Not a single machine gun is registered with a military ID….[against the Russian criminal code] “The attitude from the officers is to treat us as cattle. No-one needs us, there is zero training. We eat what we buy ourselves. “We spent an awful amount of money just to get food.” The soldier continued to mock the weapons which the forces have been given and the ammunition which they had been issued with. He added: “And don’t even start us about the ammunition. This is the ammunition they’ve given us. It was found lying on the ground of the military unit.” A military source quoted by state media RIA Novosti claimed the men were not moving directly to the war, but to training, and denied there were any problems. He said: “The issued small arms are assigned to the personnel and accounted for. “The soldiers are provided with individual rations en-route to the training area, and medical personnel are part of the team.” The Mirror reported on Tuesday how thousands of Russian troops fled eastern and southern frontlines in Ukraine, leaving dead comrades lying in the streets of one key city. Horrific evidence of the battle for Lyman, in the east, was left as Moscow’s forces were driven back by dozens of miles by Kyiv’s counter-offensive. Victories along the front have liberated Ukrainian communities and President Zelensky declared negotiations with Russian despot Vladimir Putin “impossible”. There have been calls for UN-regulated polls on the future of four annexed Ukrainian territories were branded “moral idiocy.” Even as their troops retreated, with 25,000 under threat of being cut-off, Russian officials rubber-stamped the annexation of Ukrainian regions.",14,4.388284471570787,3.302280864580505,1.0860036069902823,12
2022-10-06,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/top-vladimir-putin-general-rips-28168815,Top Putin general rips into military chiefs as Russia descends into infighting,"A top Vladimir Putin general and ex-deputy defence minister has demanded an end to the “lies” over the Kremlin leader’s war with Ukraine as Russia descends into infighting. General Andrei Kartapolov lambasted the Moscow military chiefs for their performance over the war. Now an MP in charge of the parliamentary defence committee, his outburst is the latest example of a vicious blame game over Russian losses in the war. He ripped into the defence ministry headed by close Putin friend and vacation buddy Sergei Shoigu. The Kremlin leader is now under fierce pressure to sack Shoigu and replace him with a hardliner, even though the critics are ignoring the fact that many of the Russian problems stem from Putin’s inept invasion plan and his constant insistence on micromanaging the war. ""First of all, you have to stop lying,” said Kartapolov, who has commanded Russia ’s western military district - whose forces are central to the Ukraine campaign - and Putin’s army in Syria. The daily military communiques boast of phantom successes, said the reservist colonel-general on the SolvyovLive show with Putin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov. Even in World War Two, the Soviet people were better informed, he said in his withering attack. “[People need to] understand [like during WW2 from military communiques] that the situation is dire and our Motherland is in danger because the enemy is on our land,” he said. He accused the defence ministry of lying over Ukraine’s successes. “Now we also have an enemy on our land,” he said. “And I am not even talking about the newly acquired [invaded territory in Ukraine]. ""Almost all the border villages of [Russia’s] Belgorod region have been destroyed. We have the Russian city of Valuyki - a fortress city, by the way - being constantly shelled. “But we learn about this from the [regional] governor, from …Telegram channels, from military correspondents, and no-one else.” He mocked: “The Defence Ministry reports practically do not change their content. “‘Ten shells have been shot down, 50 target sites have been hit, hundreds of Nazis have been killed'. And that's it.” But he warned: “People know [what is really going on].” The Kursk governor Roman Starovoyt - a former Putin deputy transport minister - also hit out at the “just awful” mobilisation of Russian troops. ""I cannot understand how an active training unit of the Ministry of Defence can be in such condition,” he said. “A rundown canteen, broken and rusty showers, a lack of beds … “There is a shortage of uniforms, the parade ground looks like it has been bombed.” Respected independent journalist Alexei Venediktov said: “This mobilisation is not going in the right way. “It should not, just like the special [military] operation, but it is happening. ""People who should not be mobilised in line even with this law, are being [conscripted]. “This must be addressed.” Kremlin propagandists were up in arms because “this mobilisation wave hit part of Putin's own supporters who are outraged”, he said. There is a crescendo of criticism from until-now loyal Putinites and military experts over the war and mobilisation shambles. Kartapolov’s blitzkrieg matches another military commander and normally loyalist MP Andrey Gurulev, who said recently over the loss of the Lyman stronghold in Ukraine: “I cannot explain this surrender in military terms. “It is probably a milestone not only militarily, but also politically, especially now.… “The problem is a system of lies, reports of a good situation [when the reality is bad]. “This rot comes from the top down.” Among the vultures circling is Putin crony Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Chechnya, who is seen as eyeing Shoigu’s job or a senior war commander’s role. A father of 14 with three polygamous wives, Putin yesterday promoted him to Colonel-General in the national guard. The move was apparently a 46th birthday present. “The president personally congratulated me,” he boasted, calling himself a loyal Putin “foot soldier”. “I give my word I will honour this trust. “This is an advance for me.” A picture from earlier in the war shows him in Shoigu’s office advising him how to carry out the war. He evidently believes Putin is now listening to him and other war strategy critics and Kremlin kudos by personally recruiting tens of thousands of ""volunteers"" to fight in Putin's war. “We will do everything to quickly finish the special operation,” he vowed. “There is no war without casualties. This is war. “What are men born for….?”",14,4.6630687543044536,4.713148947833038,-0.050080193528584616,11
2022-10-05,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/zelensky-says-ukraine-troops-driving-28156283,Zelensky says Ukraine troops driving back Russians and Putin talks 'impossible',"President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine's military had won back dozens of towns in the past week as he ruled out holding peace talks with Vladimir Putin. In his nightly address, the Ukrainian leader said that the army had made major and rapid advances against Russian forces in the south and east which Putin had declared annexed. ""This week alone, since the Russian pseudo-referendum, dozens of population centres have been liberated. These are in Kherson, Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions all together,"" he said. ""Our soldiers do not stop. And it's only a matter of time before we expel the occupier from all of our land."" In a decree on Tuesday, Zelensky also said that any talks with Putin were ""impossible"" but left the door open to discussions with a new Russian leader. At the same time the Kremlin has said that it ""takes two sides to negotiate"" over the possibility of talks taking place. Russia held a lavish ceremony to say it had annexed the four regions of Kherson, Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk after referendums which were widely derided as being shams with people coerced into voting. Putin has indicated that he would use nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory and the fear has been that having claimed these regions to now be under the Russian flag, whether he would use this as an excuse to use the weapons. But it has not stopped Ukrainian forces fighting to win back ground and Zelensky named eight small towns in Kherson in the south as recently having been recaptured. A video released by the Ukraine defence ministry appeared to show the Ukrainian flag being raised over one of those communities, Davydiv Brid, in Kherson. Ukrainian forces retook several villages in an advance along the strategic Dnipro River on Monday, Ukrainian officials and a Russian-backed leader in the area said. In the east, Ukrainian forces have been expanding an offensive after capturing the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk, the town of Lyman. Russian forces in the Donetsk and Kherson regions have been forced to retreat in recent days and appear to be struggling to halt an increasingly Western-equipped Ukrainian army. ""In some areas of the front line it was possible to extend the area we hold from between 10 to 20 km,"" the southern Operational Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) said. Russian forces were destroying their reserves of ammunition and trying to destroy bridges and crossings in order to slow the Ukrainian advance, the UAF said in its daily report. In the past 24 hours, Russia had lost 31 servicemen, more than 40 pieces of equipment, including eight tanks, 26 armoured vehicles, and a large calibre howitzer, it said. Moscow hopes a ""partial mobilisation"" it announced weeks ago can help reverse a series of battlefield setbacks. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was cited by the RIA news agency on Tuesday as saying that Russia had so far called up more than 200,000 reservists out of a planned 300,000 men. Many Russian men have fled the country rather than fight in Ukraine, however, and Russian lawyers say they are working to advise men who want to avoid being drafted.

The chemical compound can help prevent the body absorbing radiation if taken before or immediately after exposure caused by such a blast. The city council said in a statement, the tablets will be given to residents if there is a need to flee. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will ""use all the means at our disposal"" to turn his disastrous invasion into a success for the Kremlin. Moscow's hapless troops are suffering monumental daily losses as determined Ukrainian forces push them out of multiple regions via counterattacking tactics. As a result, it is feared despot Putin will lose his nerve and resort to a catastrophic nuclear strike. It comes following reports NATO has warned member nations the war-mongering leader would carry out nuclear testing on Ukraine's border. The intergovernmental military alliance - which has 30 member states - claimed Russia's K-329 Belgorod sub, which became active in July, could be about to test the Poseidon underwater drone in the Kara Sea. The weapon is said to be able to cause a 1,600ft nuclear tsunami. Italian news outlet La Repubblica reported over the weekend that NATO has sent an intelligence report to members regarding the Belgorod's movements. It is also reported Russia has moved a train possibly linked to a unit of the defence ministry responsible for nuclear munitions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has responded to claims by saying Russia doesn't want to discuss Western ""nuclear rhetoric"". ""The Western media, Western politicians and heads of state are engaging in a lot of exercises in nuclear rhetoric right now,"" Peskov said. ""We do not want to take part in this."" An unnamed Western official downplayed any such activity. They told the Daily Mail yesterday: ""We have not seen any indicators or activities that we would think are out of the norm.

A freight train reportedly owned by the Ministry of Defence's 12th Main Directorate - Moscow's nefarious and secretive nuclear division - was stacked with armoured personnel carriers and other deadly equipment as it was seen travelling through central Russia this weekend. Footage of the convoy - which is thought to have been en route to the front line in Ukraine - was shared on the pro-Putin Rybar Telegram channel. Konrad Muzyka, an independent defence analyst specialising in Ukraine, said the directorate is responsible for ""nuclear munitions"" and their ""storage, maintenance, transport and issuance to units"". The Poland-based expert told The Telegraph the transport could be ""signalling to the West that Moscow is escalating"". But, he said the footage didn't show ""preparations for a nuclear release"". It comes after NATO shared an intelligence report claiming Moscow plans to test its Poseidon torpedo drone, which travels through water at a speed of 114mph and is thought to have a yield of several tens of megatons. The underwater killer has been branded the ""weapon of the apocalypse"" and would likely be tested in the Black Sea. As Putin announced the mobilisation of 300,000 Russians amid embarrassing defeats at the hand of Kyiv's troops, the warlord issued a direct nuclear threat against the West, claiming he is ""not bluffing"" when it comes to Moscow's arsenal. And now the Pentagon is considering whether the Kremlin could make the world-ending decision to launch a tactical nuclear weapon. Putin's nuclear rhetoric was repeated on Friday at a ceremony where he annexed four Ukrainian regions, making them members of the Russian Federation ""forever"". He said the Kremlin would use ""all available means"" to defend its claim to the districts, suggesting nuclear weapons were also on the cards. By making these areas Russian territories, an attack would be an assault against the homeland and pave the way for nuclear weapons to enter the fray. Following Russia’s withdrawal from the key city of Lyman in the east of Ukraine on Saturday, Chechen leader and Putin ally, Ramzan Kadyrov, suggested the use of low-yield nuclear weapons. But that was dismissed as a possibility on Monday by the Kremlin. Ukrainian forces have broken through Russia's defences in the south of the country while expanding their rapid offensive in the east, seizing back more territory in areas annexed by Moscow and threatening supply lines for Russian troops. Making their biggest breakthrough in the south since the war began, Ukrainian forces recaptured several villages in an advance along the strategic Dnipro River on Monday, Ukrainian officials and a Russian-installed leader in the area said.

Vladimir Putin has indicated that he is prepared to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia and the tension has been ramped up by his annexation of four regions of Ukraine where heavy fighting is taking place. The fear is that he could claim an attack on these areas in the east and south of Ukraine would be an assault on Russian territory and so pave the way to using nuclear weapons. And now a convoy of BPM-97 armoured personnel carriers and other military vehicles have been seen heading through central Russia which have been posted on Telegram by pro-Russian channel Rybar.

""This is actually carrying kit belonging to the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian MoD,"" defence analyst Konrad Muzyka. “The directorate is responsible for nuclear munitions, their storage, maintenance, transport, and issuance to units."" It could mean that nuclear arms are being taken to the front or it could be an attempt by Putin to threaten and intimidate the West. Mr Muzyka tweeted about the train images: “Does that mean that this video shows preparations for a nuclear release? Not really. There are other more likely explanations.” He then went on to explain that it could be a message to the West or the military equipment could be used for training purposes.

""They turned a blind eye to this [injury] and gave me the highest category of fitness,"" he explained. Last month President Putin announced the mobilisation of 300,000 Russian troops in a desperate bid to ignite his stuttering invasion of the former Soviet ally. Seven months ago he launched his 'special military operation' and expected his lacklustre forces to conquer Ukraine capital Kyiv within a matter of days. However, they have been pushed back at almost every turn by Ukrainian fighters, armed with more advanced NATO weaponry and intel. US officials estimate Russia is losing 500 soldiers a day as the defending forces barge them out of the eastern regions. There are reports of the new conscripts being given no training before being sent to the frontlines with rusty guns. Footage showed conscripts setting fire to enlistment offices to avoid the draft. Brave Russian citizens are also protesting in the streets against the war. Vadim says his mum has told him to go and register to fight because she is scared he will be jailed if he doesn't. He said troops have been sweeping through car parks to hand out draft letters. Last week Putin announced the annexation of fallen regions Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, and vowed to ""defend our land with all means"". Vadim added: ""As soon as the cannon fodder on the front line runs out, they will call us, those who have no training.""",14,4.018256652381426,4.771821097804789,-0.753564445423363,2

Ramzan Kadyrov, head of Russia's region of Chechnya, said on Saturday that Moscow should consider using a low-yield nuclear weapon in Ukraine after its loss of the stronghold of Lyman. Kadyrov slammed top commanders for their failings and wrote on Telegram: ""In my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons."" He was speaking a day after President Putin proclaimed the annexation of four Ukrainian regions - including Donetsk, where Lyman is located. They were placed under Russia's nuclear umbrella, saying Moscow would defend the lands it had seized ""with all our strength and all our means"". Russia has the world's largest atomic arsenal, including low-yield tactical nuclear weapons that are designed to be deployed against opposing armies. Other top Putin allies, including former president Dmitry Medvedev, have suggested that Russia may need to resort to nuclear weapons, but Kadyrov's call was the most urgent and explicit. The influential ruler of the Caucasus region of Chechnya has been a vocal champion of the war in Ukraine. Chechen forces forming part of the vanguard of the Russian army there. Kadyrov is widely believed to be personally close to Putin, who appointed him to govern restive Chechnya in 2007. In his message, Kadyrov described Colonel-General Alexander Lapin, commander of the Russian forces fighting at Lyman, as a ""mediocrity"", and suggested that he should be demoted to private and stripped of his medals. ""Due to a lack of elementary military logistics, today we have abandoned several settlements and a large piece of territory,"" he said. Kadyrov said that two weeks before he had raised the possibility of a defeat at Lyman with Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia's general staff, but that Gerasimov had dismissed the idea. Russia's Defence Ministry on Saturday announced a withdrawal from Lyman, a major stronghold and logistical hub for Russian forces in Ukraine's Donetsk region saying that a Ukrainian advance had threatened its units with encirclement. It was the latest in a series of battlefield humiliations for Russia, after its forces were routed from Kharkiv region by a lightning Ukrainian counteroffensive last month. After Russia's defeat in Kharkiv, Kadyrov said he would be ""forced to go to the country's leadership to explain to them the situation on the ground"" unless urgent changes were made in the conduct of the war. Putin said last week he was not bluffing when he said he was prepared to defend Russia's ""territorial integrity"" with all available means. Washington says it would respond decisively to any use of nuclear weapons and has spelled out to Moscow the ""catastrophic consequences"" it would face.

At least 20 people have been killed including 10 children after shelling struck an evacuation convoy in north-east Ukraine, officials said. Kharkiv region governor Oleh Syniehubov denounced the Russian attack on people who were trying to flee the area to avoid being shelled “cruelty that can’t be justified”. The attack, in the Kupiansky district of Kharkiv, comes as Russian forces have retreated from much of the region after a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive last month. But they continue to shell the city and its surroundings. Ukraine's SBU security service confirmed on Saturday that 20 civilians had been killed in the ""grey zone"" between Russian-controlled and Ukrainian-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine in late September. In a statement, it said that seven vehicles had been hit in the shelling between occupied Svatove in Luhansk region and Ukrainian-held Kupiansk which Kyiv recaptured in the Kharkiv region last month. Russian-installed officials in Ukraine's east accused Kyiv on Thursday of shelling a convoy of refugees being evacuated from the Kharkiv region and killing around 30 civilians, Russian state media reported. This comes as Ukrainian forces reached the entrance of the eastern bastion of Lyman on Saturday after encircling thousands of Russian troops. It's a battlefield rebuttal to the Kremlin a day after President Vladimir Putin proclaimed a swathe of territory to be part of Russia. The capture of Lyman would be a major setback for Russia after Putin announced the annexation of the Donetsk region, along with three other regions, at a ceremony in Moscow on Friday condemned by Kyiv and the West as a farce. Two grinning Ukrainian soldiers taped the yellow-and-blue national flag onto the ""Lyman"" welcome board at the entrance to the town in the north of Donetsk region. ""Oct. 1. We are unfurling our state flag and establishing it on our land. Lyman will be Ukraine,"" one of the soldiers said, standing on the bonnet of a military vehicle. A spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern forces said Russia had 5,000 to 5,500 troops at Lyman but that the number of encircled troops could be lower because of casualties. ""The Russian grouping in the area of Lyman is surrounded,"" the spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi said on television. Russia's last operational update was on Friday evening. On Saturday, the ministry's Telegram channel published a series of congratulatory messages, including one from Putin, to mark an army holiday, Ground Forces Day.

They are rushing to reproductive clinics before heading for the war zone. Professor Igor Vinogradov, chief physician of the Scientific and Practical Centre for Reproduction in Moscow, said there had been a surge of new requests to store sperm by conscripted men. Dmitry Mazurov, head of reproductive at UMMC-Health medical centre in Yekaterinburg, said the same trend was true outside the capital. There were half a dozen clients a day compared with two or three a month in normal times, he said. “They call us and ask if it is possible to get emergency conservation in two hours, without preparation and examinations,” he said. “We have already developed a system [for the mobilised men]. “A man comes to the clinic, takes tests, and we freeze the material. “Then when the results come and it becomes clear whether we can use this material in the future"" A spokesman at St. Petersburg medical centre ICLINIC said they introduced a ten per cent discount for mobilised men. ""We have introduced a promotion in connection with recent events,” he said. Ukraine said on Saturday it had encircled thousands of Russian troops around the eastern town of Lyman, in a battlefield rebuttal to the Kremlin a day after it proclaimed the region to be part of Russia. The capture of Lyman would be a major setback for Russia after President Putin proclaimed the annexation of the Donetsk region, along with three others, at a ceremony in Moscow on Friday condemned by Kyiv and the West as a farce. Russia has 5,000 to 5,500 troops at Lyman but their numbers may be lower because of casualties and troops trying unsuccessfully to break out, a spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern forces said. ""The Russian grouping in the area of Lyman is surrounded,"" the spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi said on television. Russia has used Lyman as a logistics and transport hub for its operations in the north of the Donetsk region. Its fall would be Ukraine's biggest battlefield gain since a lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region last month. The Ukrainian military spokersperson said the capture of Lyman would allow Kyiv to advance into the Luhansk region, whose full capture Moscow announced at the beginning of July after weeks of slow, grinding advances. ""Lyman is important because it is the next step towards the liberation of the Ukrainian Donbas. It is an opportunity to go further to Kreminna and Sievierodonetsk, and it is psychologically very important,"" he said. The operation around Lyman is still under way and Russian troops are mounting unsuccessful attempts to break out of the encirclement, Cherevatyi said. ""Some are surrendering, they have a lot of killed and wounded, but the operation is not yet over,"" he said. Ukraine's exiled governor of Luhansk said Russian forces had sought safe passage out of the encirclement, but Ukraine rejected the request. The Ukrainian General Staff told Reuters it had no such information. Putin proclaimed the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia to be Russian land in Friday's ceremony - a swathe of territory equal to about 18% of Ukraine's total surface land area. Ukraine and its Western allies branded Russia's move as illegal. Kyiv vowed to continue liberating its land of Russian forces and said it would not hold peace talks with Moscow while Putin remained as president.

At least 23 people were killed and 28 wounded in a Russian missile strike that hit a convoy of civilian vehicles near the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday, the regional governor said. ""So far, 23 dead and 28 wounded. All civilians,"" Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional governor, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. A witness saw bodies lying on the ground or still in vehicles at the city's sprawling Orekhovo car market. A missile had left a crater in the ground near two lines of vehicles. Police and emergency workers had rushed to the scene of the missile strike, the impact of which threw chunks of dirt into the air and sprayed the vehicles with shrapnel. The windows of the vehicles - mostly cars and three vans - were blown out. The vehicles were packed with the occupants' belongings, blankets and suitcases. A body leaned from the driver's seat into the passenger seat of a yellow car, his left hand still clutching the steering wheel. Plastic sheets were draped over the bodies of a woman and young man in a green car in the next car in front. A dead cat lay next to the young man in the rear seat. Two bodies lay in a white mini-van in front of that car, its windows blown and the sides pitted with shrapnel. A woman who gave her name as Nataliya said she and her husband had been visiting their children in Zaporizhzhia. ""We were returning to my mother who is 90 years old. We have been spared. It's a miracle,"" she said, standing with her husband beside their car. Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it calls a special military operation, denies deliberately targeting civilians though its attacks have devastated Ukrainian towns and cities. It comes just hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to sign treaties that will annexe four regions of Ukraine, effectively forcing them to become part of the Russian Federation. Local media announced the despot will sign accession treaties for parts of the country currently held by the Kremlin's troops at 3pm Moscow time on Friday (12pm BST). Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a signing ceremony would take place ""on agreements on the accession of new territories into the Russian Federation."" Agreements will be signed ""with all four territories that held refererndums and made corresponding requests to the Russian side,"" Peskov said. The votes were cast in the West as illegal and illegitimate. Putin's decision to incorporate the regions into Russia means Moscow will annex vast areas across eastern and southern Ukraine, representing around 15% of Ukraine's total territory. Russian-backed officials in four regions of Ukraine controlled by Russian forces said referendums showed overwhelming majorities of their populations had voted to join Russia in votes slammed by Ukraine and the West as ""shams"". Following the signing ceremonies in the Kremlin, Putin will give a major speech and will meet with Moscow-appointed administrators of the Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin said. The Prime Minister, Liz Truss, said: “Vladimir Putin has, once again, acted in violation of international law with clear disregard for the lives of the Ukrainian people he claims to represent. “The UK will never ignore the sovereign will of those people and we will never accept the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as anything other than Ukrainian territory. “Putin cannot be allowed to alter international borders using brute force. We will ensure he loses this illegal war.” Read more",17,3.641015410366425,3.8828288091238887,-0.24181339875746355,1

The same source suggests he is ready to mobilise two million or more reservists out of a potential pool of 25 million - much larger than the initial 300,000 suggested. “The number of corpses of Russian soldiers, in these plans of Putin, does not play a role,” said the General SVR Telegram channel, which says it has inside Kremlin knowledge. Russian President Putin believes he has a mobilisation manpower reserve of 25 million people so, “he does not care about 500,000 corpses. For him, this is two per cent of the reserve”. The worrying post from the channel says: “Putin and the leadership of the military bloc are well aware that by transferring untrained and unprepared, and in many cases, poorly equipped people, to the front, they doom them to death."" He aimed to seize the strategic initiative by flooding eastern and southern Ukraine with his “untrained and poorly armed” mobilised forces. The channel claims that the mobilisation “is proceeding successfully"", despite widespread protest across Russia against the order and a mass exodus to neighbouring countries. One Russian deserter said: “We queued up by the Russian side with the border with Kazakhstan for about 15 hours, and will wait just as long to cross to the other side of it. A friend says there is chaos, panic and even fights.” Many neighbouring countries have welcomed men escaping Russia. Cinemas and unused Covid hospitals have been deployed in Kazakhstan to give shelter to Russian refuseniks. Only around 10,000 of the first tranche of deployed reservists will be trained, it is claimed, reinforcing the claim that they are seen as cannon fodder in Putin’s war. Russian reservist Sergey Surkov, 29, from Moscow, has exposed the official lie that Putin's conscripts will be trained for up to three months before they are sent to the war zone. He posted a video to his friends saying: “Hello [this is] the First Tank Regiment speaking. We were officially told that there will be no preparation before sending [us] to the war zone.” He continued: “We will be sent to Kherson on September 29. There's no retraining or preparation. If I don’t return, think kindly of me, or don’t remember me at all - it won’t matter.” Read more",14,4.677949076601429,3.1248183020199685,1.5531307745814606,12

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilisation amid huge losses in the war and fears Russia may lose the battle to Ukraine. In Krasnoslobodsk, Volgograd region, a 63-year-old man with diabetes and risk of strokes was drafted as part of the mobilisation. Before his retirement, he was deputy commander of a military unit in charge of logistics, he was drafted into the war with the promise that he would solely be “assisting the military enlistment office."" But then the man was later told by a doctor that he was “fit to go to the front” despite his ailments. Pictures from Nakhimov Square, Sevastopol, in the Republic of Crimea show a ceremony of sending mobilised citizens to the frontlines. While some are armed not all are, but they are sent off with a sprinkling of holy water to wish them good luck. Footage from Wednesday shows a commander admitting there is not enough equipment and urging recruits to bring sleeping bags as well as medical equipment. While Kremlin officials promised that only those with military experience would be called up, there is a loophole in the decree that means they can ignore that norm and essentially call up whoever they want. Many have said they will only have two weeks of training before being ""thrown into the meat grinder."" For comparison, Americans who volunteer to join the Army have 10 weeks of basic training and then go to a different location for further training in an assigned speciality. To avoid their death, tonnes of Russias fled the country as soon as there were whisperings of mobilisation. Kazakhstan, according to the country’s Interior Ministry, said nearly 100,000 Russians had entered the country since Putin announced the call-up and at least 10,000 have crossed into Georgia each day. Satellite images showed a traffic jam at Russia’s border with Georgia that stretched for nearly 10 miles. Mark Hertling, who commanded the US Army Europe, said on Twitter that he has personally witnessed how the Russian army is ""poorly led and poorly trained."" He continued: ""Mobilising 300k 'reservists' (after failing with depleted conventional forces, rag-tag militias.. recruiting prisoners & using paramilitaries like the Wagner group) will be extremely difficult.""

An independent Russian media watchdog claims there have been at least 17 arson incidents targeting recruitment centres and other official buildings following the announcement on Wednesday. The 300,000-man draft was rolled out after Ukraine conducted a lightning counteroffensive that sent Putin 's boys packing from the northeastern region of Kharkiv. Within hours of Putin's national address, Russia's borders were gridlocked with young men desperately trying to dodge the draft. The Russo-Ukraine war, which started in February, has already claimed between 70 to 80,000 Russian lives, according to US estimates. But as fathers and sons are torn away from their families by Putin's executive order, the cracks are starting to show in Russia as protests rip through the country and enraged residents firebomb enlistment offices . Russians have been attacking the offices as a protest against the war since the start of the conflict, but the rate of attacks has stepped up dramatically over the past week. A fire was reported at a recruitment centre in St Petersburg earlier this week, with a similar incident at an enlistment office in Nizhny Novgorod blamed on a person using a Molotov cocktail. But in the most terrifying incident yesterday, arson was not to blame. An unemployed local man was filmed as he stormed a recruitment office in Siberia and shot the chief recruiter at close range - leaving him in critical condition. The attacker said ""no one is going to fight"" before opening fire, according to local Russian media. The gunman was reportedly angry that his friend had been drafted even though he did not have previous military experience. Another man appears to set himself on fire in Ryazan, around 130 miles southwest of Moscow, in a video shared to social media. He reportedly shouted: ""I don’t want to go to war."" Widespread protests have occurred across Russia, particularly in Moscow and St Petersburg, and thousands of Russians have been arrested. Some of them were reportedly given military papers upon arrest, the Express reports. Many men who can afford to flee Russia have booked flights out of the country or headed to the border - Finland said that 17,000 Russians crossed over the weekend. Unverified videos shared to social media show large crowds of young men, said to be in Dagestan, punching and beating police officers as they attempt to find men to fight. US based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said the conditions were ripe to create an ""incapable"" reserve force. It said in an update: ""Russian partial mobilization efforts are suffering from serious and systemic problems in their first days, generating popular resentment and setting conditions to produce a mobilised reserve force incapable of accomplishing the tasks Russian President Vladimir Putin has set for it. ""Protests, attacks against recruiting centres, and vandalism have occurred across Russia in the first 48 hours after the announcement of partial mobilisation.""

In a later tweet he added: ""A heads up, The reason I’m highlighting the abuse I suffered is because I won’t share details on those who are still in jail I know others suffered much worse abuse then what I did, for their own security until they are freed & safe I won’t mention anything that could hurt them."" Aslin, from Newark in Nottinghamshire, was captured by Russian soldiers in April while fighting as a Ukrainian marine. He has been active on Twitter under the handle Cossackgundi since his release on September 21, and took to the site yesterday to reveal his treatment at the hands of Vladimir Putin's twisted troops. He tweeted: ""The first photo is a still from an hour before I surrendered to Russian forces on the 12th of April, the second photo is from 48 hours later.

A Russian officer at an enlistment assembly point told the conscripts that they can be used to soak up the blood in bullet wounds. This is due to a dire shortage of medical supplies for the army recruits. The woman officer told the reservists in military fatigues: ""Guys, don't laugh. Ask your wives, girlfriends, and mothers for feminine pads. The cheapest ones, plus the cheapest tampons. “Do you know what tampons are for? You will insert them into bullet wounds and they will swell there. Guys, I know that from [the Chechen War].” The cheap pads are used in military boots as insoles. “Pads are necessary, cheap ones,” she tells them. “This is first-hand information from the front, from my friend,” the officer explained. She urged them: “Guys, please take care of yourselves.” They are also told to source their own sleeping bags and travel mats at their own expense, as well as diarrhoea medicine and tourniquets. “I don't have tourniquets for all of us,” she said. “Сheck your car first aid kit, and take out the tourniquets,” she told them. A soldier then asked: ""So no one's going to give us any of that?"" She replied: ""This must all be yours, boys! You were given a uniform, armour, and everything that is related to the military. Everything else, no. We were equipping our men ourselves."" The US estimated last month that 70,000 to 80,000 of that force had been killed or wounded since the beginning of the invasion on February 24. Russia has been rapidly losing ground to the Ukrainian counteroffensive in recent weeks, particularly in the Kharkiv area which has also cost Russia critical equipment that will be difficult to replace. Jakub Janovsky, a military analyst, says Russia lost 40 tanks, 50 infantry vehicles, 35 armoured vehicles and two jets. The Russian open-source military analysis group Conflict Intelligence Team, also says losses of equipment and personnel are so awful that it has downgraded the Russian military’s fighting ability in Ukraine from “capable of attacking” to “capable of limited defence.” Read more",14,3.4056235182459407,4.728244170764473,-1.3226206525185322,12

The incident took place on Sunday, September 25, at a bus stop in the city of Ryazan in the western Russian region of the same name. The man was believed to have shouted “I don’t want to go to the frontline!” before setting himself on fire in front of stunned onlookers, local reports on Monday said. He was also seen laughing and “behaving inappropriately” before the shocking incident. The man suffered severe burn injuries to around 90 per cent of his body before police officers managed to extinguish the flames. He was then taken to a nearby hospital, but there have been no further updates on his current condition. In the video footage, the man is seen walking in front of a small crowd of onlookers while pouring flammable liquid over his upper body. He then appears to set himself alight with his other hand and his body erupts in a large fireball. At the end of the clip, he is seen running away while completely engulfed in flames. The incident followed Putin’s announcement to partially mobilise army reserves in the ongoing war in Ukraine, with plans to send an additional 30,000 recruits into battle. Explaining that the Russian military is operating across a frontline of over 1,000 kilometres as well as fighting “the entire military machine of the collective West.” Putin said: “I consider it necessary to make the following decision, which is fully appropriate to threats we face."" Russian human rights activists have reported that hundreds, possibly thousands, of recruits are resisting orders to serve on the Ukrainian frontline. Since Putin’s partial mobilisation announcement, thousands of military age men have attempted to flee the country to avoid being sent to fight in Ukraine. Within hours, Russia's borders were gridlocked with young men desperately trying to dodge the draft. According to US estimates, the Russo-Ukraine war, which began back in February, has already claimed roughly 70 to 80,000 Russian lives. More than 1,000 people were seized as police and protesters clashed in Moscow. Outrage over the recruitment drive has resulted in some sinister protests, with some citizens committing arson, and even resorting to shooting officers. With only a handful of destinations available to fly to due to sanctions, prices from Moscow to approved countries have skyrocketed - with a one-way flight to Peru costing as much as £14,900.

He was later convicted of 'taking action towards violent seizure of power' at a DPR court in what was widely described as a show trial, leaving family and friends back home devastated. Shaun is now in Riyadh following his release, having been flown over to the Saudi Arabian capital on Wednesday along with nine other prisoners from across the globe. His sister Cassandra Pinner said the family would now be celebrating following Shaun's escape to safety. She told Mail Online : ""I am just so relieved that my brother and the others will be home tomorrow. ""It has been hell for everybody but at last the worrying can stop for us. ""We must not forget all that is still happening in Ukraine, but for now our families can celebrate that our boys are home!"" It came as Russia and Ukraine took part in a surprise prisoner swap on Wednesday brokered by Turkey and Saudi Arabia which involved almost 300 people. The biggest exchange of its kind since the beginning of the current conflict, it involved the release of 215 Ukrainians alongside foreign fighters, with Ukraine also sending back 55 Russians and pro-Moscow troops. Reacting to the release of British nationals as part of the deal, UK Prime Minister Liz Truss said: ""Hugely welcome news that five British nationals held by Russian-backed proxies in eastern Ukraine are being safely returned, ending months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families.""",13,5.717323712590323,6.856845400578692,-1.1395216879883687,23
2022-09-20,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-russian-torture-chamber-discovered-28036615,Russian torture chamber discovered as Ukrainians found with genitals hacked off,"Among the tortured victims recovered from a mass burial site in Izyum were Ukrainians who had their genitals hacked off by barbaric Russian troops, it has emerged. Ukraine ’s Ministry of Internal Affairs said the majority of the 440 victims discovered in makeshift graves after the liberation of Kharkiv last week were found with horrific signs of trauma and abuse. First Deputy Minister Yevheny Yenin said investigators found men with bound hands and “severed genitalia” after 146 corpses were unearthed from a single site on Monday. He added: “We continue to find bodies with signs of violent death - there are many of them. “These include broken ribs and cracked skulls, men with bound hands, broken jaws, and severed genitalia.” The full extent of the horrors of Russian occupation have been revealed in the days after thousands of Vladimir Putin's troops retreated from the Kharkiv region after Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive. At the local police station, investigators discovered makeshift electric chairs and other instruments of cruelty suggesting the site was turned into a torture centre where Ukrainians were interrogated and abused. A series of chilling images show dining room chairs rigged up to the mains with a crude wooden platform and a metal pole holding it all in place. The wooden stand was in place so interrogators could avoid electrocution while threatening their victims. Images of the torture device were shared by Taras Berezovets, a member of Ukraine's special forces. He said the enemy “used electric shocks to torture prisoners of war and civilians”. “The wires with which the prisoners were interrogated are visible on the left in the wall,” he added. Kharkiv Governor Oleg Synehubov wrote on Telegram that two of the bodies recovered were children. He said: “Some of the dead have signs of a violent death. There are bodies with tied hands and traces of torture. The deceased were also found to have explosive, shrapnel and stab wounds.” Izyum’s police chief Sergey Bolvinov shared images and clips of the eerie cells on social media. The alleged Russian war criminals kept meticulous records of the site, jotting down a list of those detained and “instruments of torture”. He added: “People were kept in dark basement cells from several weeks to months, not even always understanding what exactly the occupiers wanted from them.” The vast majority of the bodies found in the mass grave site were civilians, Bolvinov adds. The police station chamber was just one of 10 similar facilities found in the recently liberated area. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “More than 10 torture chambers have already been found in the Kharkiv region, in cities and towns. “Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territories. “That’s what the Nazis did – this is what the Russians do. They will answer in the same way – both on the battlefield and in courtrooms.” The European Union presidency, currently held by the Czech Republic, called yesterday for an international tribunal over Russia ’s invasion. “We stand for the punishment of all war criminals,” Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said. “In the 21st Century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent. “We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals.” At the mass grave near Izyum, Volodymyr Kolesnyk searched for remains of loved ones killed in an airstrike on an apartment block in April. He paused before a cross marked number 199 after checking the list a local funeral firm gave him. A small sign on it had the name Yurii Yakovenko – his cousin. Cross number 164 was his cousin’s wife. At 174 lay his cousin’s mother. Read more",13,4.89334649882415,5.3844384744020095,-0.49109197557785933,12

The terrifying cascade hit the village of Ozerne in the Donetsk region just days after it was recaptured amid Kyiv's counter-offensive, according to Ukraine. Shells were seen striking buildings and lighting up the streets of the small village in a video shared by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). ""Russian 9М22S incendiary shells falling on the recently liberated village of Ozerne in the Donetsk region,"" a spokesperson said. The weapon is typically used by vehicles including the BM-21 Grad multiple launch rocket systems and is designed to be used against flammable targets and personnel. It comes as two Russian controlled areas of eastern Ukraine revealed plans to hold referendums on joining Russia later this week. The self proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) and the nearby Donetsk People's Republic (DRR) announced the supposed referendums would take place from September 23 to 27. It marks an escalation of Moscow's standoff with the West after Russia's battlefield reversal in the north east of Ukraine. Addressing Putin on social media, DPR chief Denis Pushilin said: ""I ask you as soon as possible, in the event of a positive decision in the referendum which we have no doubt about, to consider the DPR becoming a part of Russia."" Officials in Kherson, a region in southern Ukraine where 95 per cent is controlled by Russian forces, also confirmed plans to hold a referendum. The announcement was made earlier on Tuesday, with pro-Russian authorities in part of the Zaporizhia region expected to follow suit. Ukraine and the United States consider such referendums to be an illegal sham if they were to go ahead. The countries have clearly expressed this view and say they and many other nations would not recognise the outcome. More devastating attacks on civilians are expected by Vladimir Putin's forces as Ukraine continues to try and push forward its advance. The Kremlin leader threatened a ""more serious"" response by his military if the Ukrainian counteroffensive continues. The main aim of his campaign, he claimed, is the ""liberation of the entire territory of Donbas"".",14,5.434510339786401,3.585343409279788,1.8491669305066134,1

The Ukraine Ministry of Defence shared the video of the attack on Donetsk’s Ozerne, which was liberated in a stunning counter-offensive. The footage shows countless shells hitting buildings and lighting up the streets of the village, which had a population of just over 5,000 before the war. Yet Ukrainian forces are reportedly advancing east into territory recently abandoned by Russia. Officials hope this push will pave the way for a potential assault on Russian troops in the Donbas region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “The ­occupiers are clearly in a panic.” He stressed he is focused on the pace of the counter-attack: “The speed at which our troops are moving. The speed in restoring normal life.” Ozerne is a village in the Bakhmut Raion in Donetsk Oblast in eastern Ukraine. The 9M22S shell, typically used by vehicles such as the BM-21 ‘Grad’ multiple launch rocket systems, is designed to be used against flammable targets and personnel. He may use a video address to the United Nations General Assembly today to urge countries to accelerate weapons and aid delivery. He said: “We are doing everything to ensure Ukraine’s needs are met at all levels – defence, financial, economic, diplomatic.” Ukraine has regained control of the village of Bilohorivka and is preparing to retake all of Luhansk province from Russian occupiers, Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said. The village is just six miles west of Lysychansk city, which fell to the Russians after weeks of battles in July. But Mr Gaidai warned: “There will be fighting for every centimetre. The enemy is preparing their defence. So we will not simply march in.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had extensive talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at a summit in Uzbekistan last week The Turkish leader told US broadcaster PBS that Mr Putin is seeking a swift end to the war and that a “significant step” will be made. Mr Erdogan said: “He is actually showing me he’s willing to end this as soon as possible. That was my impression, as the way things are going right now are quite problematic.”",14,3.9511023827641534,3.66640234635617,0.28470003640798325,1

It says it has pushed Moscow’s forces away from the Oskil River in the Kharkiv region where it has recaptured large areas of land in recent weeks. The river is strategically important because it flows south through Luhansk province, part of the heavily contested eastern Donbas area. Jubilant Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said: “De-occupation is not far away” and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky promised “no lull” in the battle to reclaim territory. Meanwhile, Russian forces struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine ’s southern Mykolaiv region but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company said. A “powerful explosion” just 300 yards from the reactors broke more than 100 windows in the complex. The attack also damaged power plant ­buildings, a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. The complex on the Bug River 190 miles south of Kyiv is Ukraine’s second-largest nuclear power plant. Europe’s largest plant at Zaporizhzhia, 155 miles east of the Mykolaiv site, was shut down earlier this month due to Russian shelling. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russia has probably lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking the total number destroyed in the war to around 55. A spokesman said it was likely Russian pilots were being forced to take greater risks supporting ground forces in Ukrainian territory. The Russian army, seeking contract soldiers for what it calls its “special military operation”, is using recruiting trucks to attract volunteers, offering nearly £3,000 a month as an incentive.

Putin pledged a ""more serious"" response by his military if the Ukrainian counteroffensive continues and claimed the main aim of the campaign is ""the liberation of the entire territory of Donbas"". On Friday he added: ""We are really quite restrained in our response to this for the time being. If the situation continues to develop in this way, the response will be more serious."" In its intelligence update for September 18, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that over the last seven days, Russia ""has increased its targeting of civilian infrastructure even where it probably perceives no immediate military effect"". Overnight shelling is reported to have hit a hospital in the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv, according to regional governor Vitaliy Kim. In Kharkiv, where Ukraine made major gains last week, three are believed to have died in a rocket attack and one victim was an 11-year-old girl. The MoD added: ""As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government."" Putin's bombs have wreaked havoc on civilian life in Ukraine and The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has so far verified a total of 5,827 deaths as of September 11. Of that total, 349 were children. In liberated Izium, a mass grave was uncovered where the bodies of the dead show signs of torture and some have ropes tied around their necks and hands. An estimated 400 shallow graves were found. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), meanwhile, believes a total of 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes to escape the invading Russian troops and their artillery shells. Concerns remain that a continues Russian retreat could cause Putin to resort to even more vicious and irresponsible bombing tacts, even the possibility of tactical nuclear weapons. In a preview for an upcoming episode of 60 Minutes on CBS news, US President Joe Biden warned against Russia employing such tactics. Explaining that the US would be forced to act if nukes were used, Biden said: ""Don't. Don't. Don't. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II. ""It'll be consequential [ Russia ] will become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur."" It is unclear how likely the Ukrainian advance may continue in the coming days and the MoD report from September 17 expected a ""stubborn"" defence from Russia as they try to hold on to key areas. Explaining, the MoD said Ukraine is continuing offensive operations in the northeast of the country and Russian troops have established a line of defence in the Luhansk Oblast town of Svatove. ""Russia likely sees maintaining control of this zone as important because it is transited by one of the few main resupply routes Russia still controls from the Belgorod region of Russia,"" said the defence ministry. ""This line sits along the border of Luhansk Oblast, part of the Donbas, which Russia aims to ‘liberate’ as one of its immediate war aims. Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy. ""Russia will likely attempt to conduct a stubborn defence of this area, but it is unclear whether Russia’s front line forces have sufficient reserves or adequate morale to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault.""

The grim discoveries came after around 450 graves were identified in Izyum, one of more than 20 towns retaken in a lightning counter-offensive by Kyiv that is routing Kremlin forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “More than 10 torture chambers have already been found in the Kharkiv region, in cities and towns. “Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territories. “That’s what the Nazis did – this is what the Russians do.

He paused before a cross marked number 199 after checking the list a local funeral firm gave him. A small sign on it had the name Yurii Yakovenko – his cousin. Cross number 164 was his cousin’s wife. At 174 lay his cousin’s mother. He said: “They buried the bodies in bags, without coffins, without anything. I was not allowed here at first. The Russians said it was mined. “There were a lot of them in the woods, so it was scary to come here.” The first body that was recovered had a rope around its neck and showed signs of having suffered a “violent death”. Regional prosecutor Olexander Ilyenkov said there was no doubt war crimes had been committed. “In the first grave, there is a civilian who has a rope over her neck. So we see the traces of torture,” he said. “Some were killed, some were tortured, and some died in Russian Federation air and ­artillery strikes.” Serhii Cherniak, 61, who lived close to the scene, said: “They didn’t even cover them with sacks. They were just dumped as if they were dogs. “It’s not even a grave, it was a ditch the Russians used to park one of their vehicles. They came up, threw them down and sprinkled sand.” Around 100 Ukrainian emergency service workers are digging up the makeshift graves, trying to establish the cause of death of hundreds of people buried in the forest at the edge of the city.

The Russian President has not managed to take control of Ukraine, including its capital Kyiv, weaken NATO or break international resolve and lacks the manpower to win the war, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme. Sir Tony, the current Chief of Defence, said: ""At the very outset, we said that this was a strategic error by President Putin and strategic errors lead to strategic consequences. ""And in this instance, it's strategic failure. Putin is failing on all of his military strategic objectives, he wanted to subjugate Ukraine, that's not going to happen. Sir Tony said Putin had wanted to take control of the capital Kyiv, but was defeated early on, while his mission to weaken NATO also failed, with the union now looking stronger as Finland and Sweden plan to join. He continued: ""[Putin] wants to break the international resolve. Well, actually that strengthened over this period, and he's under pressure, his problems are mounting. ""He's always had a problem in terms of crewing the equipment that he's got. He hasn't got sufficient manpower. His forces are thin on the ground. ""And we're also seeing a magnificent Ukrainian armed forces who have been courageous, they're fighting for their country, and they've embraced the international support that all of us are providing."" With Putin struggling with manpower, the President has resorted to signing up four hundred hardened criminals, according to video footage. As reported by The Mirror, a video shows the tough prisoners from penal colonies in Tambov region who have signed up as fighters reportedly taken by a dozen jail vans to a “training camp” in the south of Russia. After perfunctory military instruction the murderers, sex offenders, burglars and other convicts will be despatched to the frontline following the mass jail release.

2022-09-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-soldiers-weaponised-rape-liberated-28006125,Russian soldiers weaponised rape in liberated town with 400 buried in mass grave,"Evidence of Russian soldiers carrying out torture and weaponising rape had been piling up for months before the town of Izyum was liberated last week. Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive reclaimed huge swathes of territory in the northeastern region of Kharkiv and freed around 150,000 Ukrainians living under Russian occupation. Vladimir Putin's forces took control of the city and its surrounds on March 27. One of those satellite towns was Izyum, where local officials today confirmed the 400 bodies found in makeshift graves in a mass burial site were mostly civilians. While some of the victims were killed in airstrikes or by landmines, others were shot dead. Some officials said the corpses showed signs of torture, The Guardian reported earlier this week. The hideous discovery comes after months of witness testimonies accusing Russian troops of horrific sexual violence and widespread killings which left families unable to bury their dead. One resident of the recently de-occupied town told The Guardian in April how the Russian forces drew up a list of ""dangerous"" residents to ""hunt"" down. Among those who became the soldier's targets were businessmen, soldiers and their families, and activists. The father, whose real name was not used due to fears of reprisals, recalled how he gave up his bed amid a months-long aerial bombardment - preferring instead to sleep in a corner of the room where he was better protected by the walls. Ukrainian officials at the time had already drawn up their own list, detailing alleged war crimes that mirror those seen in the tragic town of Bucha in April. Putin's troops were accused of ransacking the city and going on a rape and murder rampage through its streets. Witnesses claimed to see similar sites in Izyum, where the fatal victims couldn't even be buried due to the sheer number of corpses packing the morgue. The father explained: ""Some corpses are buried in the central park or near to the people’s houses and in gardens. ""The situation is like what it was in 1942. The morgue doesn’t work. Bodies were taken there at first but now it is too full."" Those killed included Russian soldiers, who were abandoned by their comrades, with the man claiming to have seen their bodies crammed into armoured vehicles as he passed them in the street. “I have seen three armed vehicles full of corpses. There were bodies even lying on the roofs,” he said. A month earlier in another part of Kharkiv, Olha, 31, told Human Rights Watch how she was repeatedly raped by a Russian soldier just upstairs from her young daughter. Olha, her five-year-old girl, mother, sister, 13, and brother, 24, and other terrified locals were taking shelter in the basement of an abandoned school in the village of Malaya Rohan, when a soldier forced himself into the building. After the other hostages bedded down for the night, the soldier dragged her away to a classroom on the second floor, where he made her undress before sexually assaulting her. She said: “He told me to give him [oral sex]. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. ""Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more ‘motivation.’” He raped her twice, once with a knife to her throat after she refused to collect her things and stay with him in the classroom. The vile soldier cut her neck, cheek and some of her hair before repeatedly hitting her in the face with a book. The following day, the soldier left. The burial site found today is just the tip of the iceberg of the horrors of Izyum, according to local chief police investigator Serhii Bolvinov, who has warned there are countless more graves. He said every single body is set to be exhumed and be taken for forensic examination. The discovery was all part of a major Ukrainian effort, with police working alongside prosecutors and other investigators to gather evidence of alleged Russian war crimes. They have come to light since the investigations into Russian war crimes began amid swathes of horror accusations in the Kharkiv region in the months it’s been under Russian control, Mr Bolvinov said. He said: ""I can say that there is one of the biggest burials in one liberated city, which contains more than 440 graves. ""Some 440 bodies were buried in one place.""

Prigozhin also indicated to loyalist Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper that recent territorial gains by Ukraine meant “disgrace” to Russia which his prison-soldiers could counter. “They are patriots and cannot allow the disgrace of their Motherland,” he said. “Secondly, they are professionals of the highest level and many of them….have gone through dozens of wars, preparing themselves for the greatest day when their beloved Motherland will have to be defended.” Nor were they “complete f ** ” on the battlefield, he said, defending a drive which has seen an emptying of jails to send thousands of convicts to the war in Ukraine. They were not warriors who never leave their plush cars like many Kremlin critics, he said. They would “not use Chanel perfume and drive in Nappa leather cars, but climb basements and trenches to keep the situation under control”. Prigozhin said: “Of course, if I were a prisoner, I would dream of joining this friendly team in order to be able not only to redeem my debt to the Motherland but also to repay it with vengeance. Prigozhin was seen this week in a remarkable video recruiting inmates as soldiers in a Russian jail. The footage highlights the Kremlin’s desperation to find fighters for the Ukraine frontline as his regular army suffers humiliating defeats and catastrophic losses in Kharkiv region. His sales pitch to hundreds of inmates under grey skies was at a high security penal colony in Mordovia.

The city of Kryvyi Rih is around 90 miles southwest of the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro and was hit with eight cruise missiles late on Wednesday, September 14. The water system was damaged in the attacks and streets in the city were flooded as the Inhulets river rose by around 2.5 metres. Zelensky claimed the dam ""had no military value"" and that the Russian attacks were done by ""scoundrels"" who ""escaped from the battlefield"". The president addressed Russia directly in his address on Wednesday, switching from speaking Ukrainian. He said: ""Your missile attacks today, Russian missiles targeting Kryvyi Rih, the dam of the Karachunivske reservoir, the objects that have no military value at all, in fact hitting hundreds of thousands of ordinary civilians, is another reason why Russia will lose. ""You are weaklings waging a war against civilians; scoundrels who, having fled the battlefield, are trying to do harm from somewhere far away."" The address was released after news broke he had been in a car accident in Kyiv in which he was not seriously hurt. Spokesperson Sergii Nikiforov said: ""The president was examined by a doctor, no serious injuries were found."" Authorities in Kryvyi Rih are working to try and repair the damage caused by the missiles and the flooding. Prominent Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun said: ""The water pumping station was destroyed. The river broke through the dam and overflowed its banks. Residential buildings are just a few meters away from the river."" Before the war, Kryvyi Rih was a city home to around 650,000 people and the largest in central Ukraine. As an angered Zelensky called the cruise missile attacks brazen and senseless, the Institue for the Study of War explained they may have been a tactical attempt by Russia to ""damage Ukrainian pontoon bridges further downstream"" as Ukraine mounts a counteroffensive in Kherson. The successful and swift counteroffensive has seen Russian troops on the back foot in what they say is an attempt to ""regroup"". Key strategic towns like Izium and Kupiansk have been retaken as almost the entire region of Kharkiv was liberated along with around 400 settlements, Visiting Izium, Zelensky added: ""Ukrainians once again managed to do what many considered impossible. ""The 150,000 Ukrainians who remained in this territory feel again now what an ordinary, safe, normal life is like."" Ukraine claims to have retaken around 3,088 sq miles of territory in the Kharkiv region, an area larger than Lincolnshire. Read more",17,5.091600743931801,3.0361797282089613,2.05542101572284,1

After his country's troops made a major advance in their bid to liberate land from the invading Russian forces, Zelensky went to the town of Izium. Much of it has been destroyed including the entire centre of one residential building, despite Russian troops appearing to be on the back foot and using equipment from North Korea and Iran. In Izium, Zelsnky said: The view is very shocking but it is not shocking for me."" The president pointed to recent alleged war crimes and atrocities in Ukrainian neighbourhoods like Bucha, where bodies were found in mass graves. Some of them were found with gunshot wounds to the head and their hands tied behind their back. ""Because we began to see the same pictures from Bucha, from the first de-occupied territories,"" Zelensky added. ""So the same destroyed buildings, killed people."" Izium was a key strategic town for Russia, which used it as a launch pad for its attack on the south of the country and the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. The town was retaken as part of a sweeping counteroffensive by Ukraine last week, which saw an estimated 2,300 square miles recovered by the defenders, an area larger than Norfolk. The claims by Ukraine could not be independently verified, but it is clear Russian troops appear to be on the back foot in the war. Their Defence Ministry recently said the retreat was a part of an effort to ""regroup"" and focus their efforts elsewhere. Ukraine claims its troops have been met with a positive response from residents in the liberated towns. ""Our soldiers are here. That’s a very important thing. It supports people,” Zelensky said. ""I see how people meet them, in what a sensitive moment. It means that with our army, the life comes back."" Hailed by the defending country as a turning point in the war, the counteroffensive has a new front as Ukraine successfully secured the region of Kharkiv. Kherson is believed to be the next target of liberation for the Ukrainian force and is both strategically and symbolically important. It is the only major Ukrainian city currently held by Russia and it is near the Crimean peninsula, canned by Russian in 2014. Military analyst Professor Michael Clarke told Sky News that taking the city could mean Russia would find it ""impossible for the Russians to operate"" from Crimea in a military sense. He said: ""The Ukrainians have got momentum on their side and in battle, momentum matters hugely. ""The Russians seem to be out of food and everything. Once they run out of ammunition, they've got no choice but to surrender or run. ""And they can't run because they can't get across the Dnipro River."" On Instagram, Zelensky added: ""Before, when we looked up, we always looked for the blue sky. Today, when we look up, we are looking for only one thing - the flag of Ukraine. ""Our blue-yellow is already flying in the de-occupied Raisin. And so it will be in every Ukrainian city and village. We move in only one direction - forward and to victory.""

2022-09-14,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-ukraine-whats-next-after-27987037,Russia-Ukraine: Future analysis after Putin's forces beaten in counter-offensive,"Russian soldiers have been driven out of strongholds in Ukraine after Kyiv's forces liberated an area seven times the size of London. In a swift and decisive counter-offensive, Vladimir Putin's troops were dislodged from 8,000 square km (3,088 miles) of Ukrainian territory in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. Addressing the country last night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy declared ""stabilisation measures"" have already been carried out in half of the territory as the same measures continue in the other section. Ukraine turned the tides of the war on Saturday when it recaptured Moscow's main military supply centre in the northeast, setting the stage for a series of pummelling victories in which they captured dozens of towns. Here's what happened and what lies in store... After almost five months in Russian hands, the Kharkiv region has been freed from the Kremlin's grasp after the Ukrainian armed forces dealt an irreparable blow to Moscow's war in a sweeping counteroffensive. Experts had predicted a counter-attack was looming in the autumn and winter months after Ukraine lost key areas of the eastern Donbas region earlier this year. The Ukrainian forces were welcomed as heroes after freeing an estimated 150,000 of their fellow citizens forced to live under Russian occupation. The game-changer came on Saturday when a lightning offensive saw thousands of Russian troops flee from Izyum, leaving battlefields full of armoured vehicles, ammunition and other military equipment. It was the worst battlefield defeat since Russia was driven from the capital of Kyiv in early April. The town was an essential outpost for Moscow as it was close to a motorway that connected Kharkiv to Sloviansk in the east - a gateway to the current front lines in the Donbas. With the majority of Russia's forces focused in the Donbas the liberation of Izyum is a major strategic win for Ukraine. The Kremlin still holds around a fifth of Ukraine's entire territory, mainly in the south and east - all areas where Kyiv is fighting back. In response to the crushing defeat, it's likely that Moscow will step up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure through the biting winter. The major blows to the country's energy infrastructure has already lead to rolling blackouts nationwide. Referring to Sunday’s strike on a major coal power and water heating plant in the city of Kharkiv, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said “we expect the quantity of such attacks to grow, and are ready for various scenarios.” Podolyak added that Ukrainians should expect problems with power and heat this winter. It has also emerged that Russia has likely used Iranian-made uncrewed aerial vehicles in Ukraine for the first time, according to British defence intelligence, which could signal a change in tactics as its military arsenal ""dwindles"". It comes after Kyiv reported downing one of the UAVs on Tuesday. ""Russia is almost certainly increasingly sourcing weaponry from other heavily sanctioned states like Iran and North Korea mas its own stocks dwindle,"" it said in a regular update. On top of the setbacks in Ukraine, pressure is piling up on Russian authorities as they face challenges in other former Soviet republics, including the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia which saw 100 people killed this week. One former NATO chief believes the losses could provoke a bitter response from the Russian leader, who might order devastating nuclear strikes over the Black Sea or on key military targets to save face. Speaking with the BBC, Rose Gottemoeller said she feared ""they [ Russia ] will strike back now in really unpredictable ways that may even involve weapons of mass destruction."" The host quetioned whether she meant a ""nuclear strike of some kind"", and Gottemoeller said she did. ""We've been concerned from the outset of this crisis with Putin rattling the nuclear saber that he might put in play for a nuclear demonstration strike,"" she added. While avoiding the use of Moscow's flagship Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, like the world-ending Sarmat ""Satan II"", she said the Kremlin would likely order a ""single strike over the Black Sea"" or a ""strike at a Ukrainian military facility"". Such a strike would terrorise the Ukrainian population and make Kyiv's allies more wary of involving themselves in the conflict. ""The goal would be to try to get the Ukrainians in their terror to capitulate,"" Gottemoeller said. ""I do worry about that kind of scenario at the moment. I think the Ukrainians seem well prepared to stay the course but we will all have to be ready to stay the course, come what may."" After clearing the region of Russian troops, officials are now interviewing residents to help them find burial sites, posing the question of whether Russia has carried out atrocities similar to those seen after the freeing of Bucha. Growing evidence points to barbarism in Bucha with local women and children raped and shot and demands have grown for those responsible to be held accountable. But even shortly after those crimes were made public, Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that more harrowing reports would undoubtedly surface as the Russian forces marched eastwards to the Donbas. Oleh Syehubov, the regional governor of Kharkiv, said yesterday officials were trying to log evidence of potential crimes, including the location of bodies. He said: ""We're asking everyone around about all the places of burial which can be found."" Moscow has denied Russian involvement in atrocities in the area.

Sanctions on Russian industries including the defence sector may have impacted the Kremlin's decision to bring in technology from the rogue states. Ukraine is also on the advance. Reports emerged earlier this month that Putin had turned to them for help. The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that claims by Ukraine that they had shot down an Iranian-made drone as evidence that Moscow is ""increasingly sourcing weaponry from other heavily sanctioned states"". The device was supposed to detonate on impact but didn't. The MoD said: "" Russia is almost certainly increasingly sourcing weaponry from other heavily sanctioned states like Iran and North Korea as its own stocks dwindle."" In early September, a US official said that Russia buying from North Korea was a sure sign of ""severe supply shortages"". In August, Russia vowed to expand its relations with North Korea and hoped for ""strategic and tactical co-operation, support and solidarity"" between the two. Ukraine has gained significant ground in the fight for its survival over the past week and is estimated to have taken back well over 900 square miles of territory. Of the reports of the shot-down drone, the ministry said: ""Russia has highly likely deployed Iranian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) in Ukraine for the first time. ""On September 13 2022, Ukrainian officials reported that their forces had shot down a Shahed-136 UAV near Kupiansk, in the area of Ukraine's successful ongoing offensive. ""The Shahed-136 is a one-way attack UAV with a claimed range of 2,500 kilometres."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said of sanctions on Russia's defence industry: ""The Russian military is taking chips from dishwashers and refrigerators to fix their military hardware, because they ran out of semiconductors. ""Russia's industry is in tatters."" It is not known how many troops and how much equipment has been lost by Russia in its war in Ukraine, but the recent advance by defending troops and estimates of soldiers killed is not good news for the Kremlin. Ukraine believes - such claims are likely exaggerated - that Russia has lost over 50,000 troops since the February invasion. This also includes claims of 2,180 lost tanks and 215 helicopters. The Kremlin has not updated its death tally since March when it said it had seen 1,351 killed and 3,825 wounded. Read more",14,4.250479766071692,3.7068455258092747,0.543634240262417,8

Presenter Alexander Sladkov was on TV channel Rossiya 1 when he let slip that a ""huge number of people"" have died, following a swift and effective Ukrainian counteroffensive. Sladkov then corrected himself and said Vladimir Putin's forces were having ""great successes"". He said: ""People here [in the Donbas] are waiting for us to get started. For us to hit them so hard that they end up on their backsides. That's to say, a knockout! It's very difficult to win on points."" ""We're losing a huge number of people, we have wounded... we're having... great successes!"" Putin's Kremlin has kept things quiet regarding the number of casualties suffered since their barbaric invasion in February. What Russia deems as 'misinformation' about the war in the country is now punishable by up to 15 years behind bars. Russia has not published its own losses since March when it claimed it had seen 1,351 killed and 3,825 wounded, though independent Russian media outlet iStories verified the deaths of over 5,000. Ukraine claimed it has killed over 50,000 Russians since February, though its reports are likely to be inflated. In early August, CIA director William Burns said there were ""in the vicinity of 15,000 killed and maybe three times that wounded"". Sladkov added: ""We're having great successes but we're not... well now we've used long-range aviation, we've dealt serious damage to their energy system, but again we didn't finish it off. ""Again, what are the people saying? They're saying: 'We're winning on points. But we'd like a knockout'."" After a successful advance into previously Russia-held territory - around 965 square miles were estimated to have been recovered over the weekend - the Ukrainian advance continues on Tuesday. Ukraine claims around 150,000 people have been liberated so far and the goal is to press on to Kharkiv. US President Joe Biden said there was likely still a long fight ahead: ""It’s clear the Ukrainians have made significant progress. But I think it’s going to be a long haul."" Analysts believe Ukraine has a choice to try and press home its advantage with further advances, but doing so may risk the country overstretching and facing a counterattack.

As the counter attack continued, freeing village after village amid reports of Russian troops abandoning their positions, Ukraine ’s President Volodymyr Zelensky declared: “The world is amazed by our warriors. ""The enemy is in a panic. “They will call it a gesture of goodwill. We will call it victory.” The Ukraine army claimed that in one region it pushed the invaders right back to the Russian border. Regional governor of the north-east Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, said: “In some areas of the front, our defenders reached the state border with the Russian Federation.” After Russia attacked power stations and other civilian infrastructure on Sunday, knocking out electricity in many places across Ukraine, the Kyiv authorities said power and water had been restored to 80 per cent of the Kharkiv region. But there were further missile strikes on Kharkiv yesterday aimed at disrupting power and water supplies. Ukraine’s Defence Minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said the priority now was to secure the territorial gains made in a week of rapid advances in Kharkiv. There were reports that the Russian army had abandoned equipment and ammunition as it withdrew from areas held since the first weeks of the war. There were also claims that retreating Russian troops had been looting. Following the Ukraine losses, Vladimir Putin was said to have sacked Lieutenant General Roman Berdnikov, who had been in the job for just 16 days. And there were reports that municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and Saint Petersburg signed a public statement demanding that Putin resign. President Zelensky had a direct message for the Russian president. He said: “Do you still think you can intimidate, break us, force us to make concessions? “Did you really not understand anything? Don’t you understand who we are? What we stand for? What we are talking about? “Read my lips – cold, hunger, darkness and thirst for us are not as scary and deadly as your ‘friendship’ and ‘brotherhood’.

Putin’s forces have suffered a crushing defeat in eastern Ukraine, losing vast swathes of the country to a surprise Ukrainian counter-offensive. The Russian president is thought to have relieved Lieutenant General Roman Berdnikov of his duties amid reports that panicked Russian troops have been abandoning tanks, weapons and supplies. Advancing Ukrainian soldiers report finding discarded military uniforms left by fleeing Russian soldiers attempting to disguise themselves as civilians as they flee the combat zone in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv oblast region. Ukrainian soldiers have taken more than 1,000 square miles of territory in a matter of days in a lightning offensive that has seen troops push to within 30 miles of the Russian border. The main advance began six days ago and followed a months-long disinformation campaign tricking Russia into deploying troops further to the south, leaving the Kharkiv oblast region lightly defended. Putin appointed Lt General Berdnikov as commander of the Western Armed Forces on August 26, 2022, according to the Ukrainian military intelligence service. But Ukrainian spooks now say that the ramshackle Russian retreat at Kharkiv has seen Berdnikov sacked by Putin. But it could have been worse, Berdnikov was declared dead back in June, with unconfirmed reports at the time saying he had been killed during fighting in the Donbas. But it seems he lived to be sacked another day. A Ukrainian unit fighting in the recent Kharkov offensive reported that the Russian chain of command in the region had completely collapsed, with soldiers throwing down their weapons and fleeing from the Ukrainian advance without offering any resistance. A source told the Telegraph : 'They were really afraid, their chain of command was in chaos. Officers left the area before the fighting began. 'There were a lot of uniforms lying around. We caught some of these guys trying to escape in civilian clothes, they were telling some incredible bull***t trying to save themselves.' The news comes as president Zelensky mocked the Russian retreat in a video address to the nation, saying that ‘the Russian army in these days is demonstrating the best that it can do – showing its back’. Yesterday he posted a video of Ukrainian soldiers hoisting the national flag once again over the town of Chkalovske. More crucially, they entered the Russian-held supply towns of Izyum, Kupiansk and Balakliya in what could be a turning point for the conflict. Ukraine’s military chief, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said yesterday his forces had liberated about 1,160 square miles since the beginning of September – triple the amount of regained territory claimed by Mr Zelensky just two days previously.",14,3.4174337859903803,1.84108545365584,1.5763483323345402,25

The blitz was in revenge for the military humiliation Russian forces have suffered in Kharkiv region where his troops are in retreat. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said the strikes aimed to ""deprive people of light and heat"" and he accused Putin of ""terrorist acts"" which hit civilian, not military targets. Videos show strikes which plunged almost one third of Ukraine into darkness from power cuts. Footage highlighted a strike on a key power plant in Kharkiv region, and more showed the city’s underground train system at standstill. Flames were seen at a power plant in Vilnohirsk, Dnipropetrovsk region. Russia released footage of combat missions by Su-35S fighter crews which it claimed were involved in destroying “military infrastructure facilities”. The attacks struck the largest thermal power plants in eastern and central Ukraine - Kharkovskaya and Zmievskaya in Kharkiv region, leading to a lack of generating capacity, according to Russian sources. The plants provide central heading to Ukrainian homes, meaning the attack was aimed at harming civilians. US ambassador to Kyiv Bridget Brink, denounced the overnight strikes calling them Putin’s “apparent response to Ukraine liberating cities and villages in the east”. “Even through the impenetrable darkness, Ukraine and the civilised world clearly see these terrorist acts,” said Zelensky. “Deliberate and cynical missile strikes on civilian critical infrastructure. No military facilities. Kharkiv and Donetsk regions were cut off. “In Zaporizhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Sumy there are partial problems with power supply.” He bluntly taunted Putin: “Do you still think that [Ukrainians and Russians] are ‘one people’? “Do you still think that you can scare us, break us, make us make concessions? “You really did not understand anything? Don't you understand who we are? What are we for? What are we talking about? “Lip reading: Without gas or without you? Without you. “Without light or without you?

Troops are said to have regained control of 1,158 square miles of land in a rapid counter-offensive in the east taking a little more than 48 hours. An aide to president Volodymyr Zelensky said: “Russian Spring? No… A fantastic Ukrainian autumn, the beginning of the end of the Russian barbaric empire.” And the leader’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak added: “The Russian army is claiming the title of fastest army in the world, keep running.” In the biggest counter offensive since the Second World War, Ukrainian troops entered the vital supply towns of Izyum and Kupiansk, the Russian army’s main base in the northeast. The capture has cut ­thousands of Russian troops off from supplies. Moscow’s defence ministry confirmed its forces have retreated from the towns. But it claimed it would allow them “to regroup” in territory held by ­Moscow-backed separatists. The advance also marks the first time since the Second World War that whole Russian units have been lost. Towns and villages that took weeks for the Russians to capture fell in a matter of hours. Fleeing soldiers left behind ammunition and equipment. Jubilant Ukrainian troops were pictured at the entrance to Vasylenkove in the Kharkiv region. And the military shared a video showing a soldier hoisting the ­country’s flag above a settlement which it says was taken back from Russian forces. Kyiv’s forces established full control over the city of Balakliya. The ­Moscow-installed chief ­administrator of Russian-controlled parts of Kharkiv recommended all its inhabitants evacuate “to save lives”, Witnesses described traffic jams of cars with people fleeing. Footage appeared to show long queues building up at border crossings. The governor of the Belgorod border region in Russia, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said “thousands” of people had crossed into the country. If the reported gains are held, it would be a huge blow for Russia, which Western ­intelligence services claim has suffered huge casualties. Mr Zelensky hailed Ukraine ’s advance as a potential ­breakthrough on the 200th day of the war, claiming this winter could bring more rapid gains of ­territory if Kyiv can get more powerful weapons. But Russia claims its forces were hitting Ukrainian army positions with “airborne troops, missiles and artillery” in the area. Moscow still controls around a fifth of the country and few believe there will be a swift end to the conflict. The Russian-held ­Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was yesterday shut down after a “complete blackout” sparked fears of a radiation disaster.

Their reinvigorated forces kept pushing north in the Kharkiv region and advancing to its south and east, Ukraine's army chief has said - a day after their rapid gains forced Russia to abandon its main bastion in the area. It comes after the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the ""entire Donetsk region will be liberated"" and that ""about 2,000 kilometres of our territory have already been liberated"" in just 48 hours, around 770 square miles in the Kharkiv region. The disinformation campaign appears to have successfully distracted Russia, experts say. Zelensky, 44, hailed Ukraine's offensive as a potential breakthrough in the six-month-old war, saying this winter could bring more rapid gains of territory if Kyiv can get more powerful weapons. Russia had already suffered around 60,000 casualties, it was announced last month. Ukraine's chief commander, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Sunday that the armed forces had regained control of more than 3,000 square km (1,158 square miles) since the start of this month. ""In the Kharkiv direction, we began to advance not only to the south and east, but also to the north. There are 50 km to go to the state border (with Russia),"" he said on Telegram. In Moscow, Russia's defence ministry said Russian forces were hitting Ukrainian army positions in the Kharkiv region with precision strikes by airborne troops, missiles and artillery. The retreat from the city of Izium, an important logistics hub for Russian forces, was their worst defeat since they were repelled from the capital Kyiv in March, as thousands of Russian soldiers left behind ammunition and equipment as they fled. Moscow's almost total silence on the defeat - or any explanation for what had taken place in northeastern Ukraine - provoked significant anger among some pro-war commentators and Russian nationalists on social media. Some of them called on Sunday for President Vladimir Putin to make immediate changes to ensure ultimate victory in the war. Ukraine's gains are important politically for Zelenskiy as he seeks to keep Europe united behind Ukraine - supplying weapons and money - even as an energy crisis looms this winter following cuts in Russian gas supplies to European customers. ""I believe that this winter is a turning point, and it can lead to the rapid de-occupation of Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy told a political forum. ""If we were a little stronger with weapons, we would de-occupy faster,"" he said in remarks published on his website late on Saturday. Ukrainian officials stopped short of confirming they had recaptured Izium, but Zelenskiy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak posted a photo of troops on its outskirts and tweeted an emoji of grapes. The city's name means ""raisin."" Defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said Ukraine needed to secure retaken territory against a possible Russian counterattack on stretched Ukrainian supply lines. He told the Financial Times that Ukrainian forces could be encircled by fresh Russian troops if they advanced too far. But he said the offensive had gone far ""better than expected"", describing it as a ""snowball rolling down a hill"". ""It's a sign that Russia can be defeated,"" he said. Kyiv-based military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the gains could bring a further push into Luhansk region, whose capture Russia claimed at the beginning of July. ""If you look at the map, it is logical to assume that the offensive will develop in the direction of Svatove - Starobelsk, and Sievierodonetsk - Lysychansk,"" he said. Britain's defence ministry said on Sunday Ukrainian forces had made gains in the Kharkiv region over the past 24 hours. But fighting continued around Izium and the city of Kupiansk, the sole rail hub supplying Russia's front line across northeastern Ukraine, which has been retaken by Ukraine's forces. As the war entered its 200th day, Ukraine reported more Russian missile and air strikes overnight and regional officials reported heavy Russian shelling in the east and south.",14,1.9154001542524421,1.5326959587560351,0.382704195496407,25

The country's President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the ""entire Donetsk region will be liberated"" and that ""about 2,000 kilometres of our territory have already been liberated"" in just 48 hours, around 770 square miles in the Kharkiv region. Think-tank the Institute for the Study of War believe the actual area recovered could be around 965 square miles, an area roughly the size of Northamptonshire or Dorset. Among the towns and cities retaken by defenders are important strategic points like the railway junction of Kupiansk. This is a vital area for Russian logistics, aiding things like the reinforcement of troops and supplies. For Russian troops in the north of Ukraine, this will be more difficult as Ukraine now controls the city. Fighting around Kupiansk and the city of Izium - used by Russia as an important military launchpad for attacks on Donetsk - continues. On Sunday, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its intelligence update that ""significant gains"" had been made by Ukraine. They said: ""Over the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have continued to make significant gains in the Kharkiv region. Russia has likely withdrawn units from the area, but fighting continues around the strategically important cities of Kupiansk and Izium."" Russia claims their rapid retreat is a bid to allow them to ""regroup"" and concentrate on ""the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate the Donbas"". The advance in the Northeast appears to have caught invading Russian troops off guard, who military experts say may have been expecting an attempted counteroffensive in the south of the country towards Kherson. Kherson is of vital strategic importance to both sides in the fight for control of Ukraine and the area of Crimea in particular, annexed by Russia in 2014. One analyst told Newsweek that Ukraine has set out plans to retake its full territory. Retired General Ben Hodges, the former commanding general of the United States Army Europe, said before the recent developments: ""They've set the conditions where they can restore full sovereignty, to include Crimea, I think, within the next year. ""Here we are, half a year after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, and the supposed second-best army in the world is now the second-best army in Ukraine. ""After all this time, Russia still controls less than 20% of Ukraine's territory, and their ability to conduct further offensive operations has been all but exhausted."" Taking Kherson would allow Ukraine to retake a major canal important for supplying Crimea and providing a platform to cross the Dnieper river and retake the country's south, while also making Russia's occupation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant increasingly difficult. Zelensky has called for the area around the plant to be demilitarised as shelling around the plant causes major fears for its safety. Essentially, the strategic importance of Kherson may have meant Russia did not expect Ukraine to focus its efforts in the north and attacks by Ukraine look to have been a feint. In its northern offensive, Ukraine now expects to retake the town of Lyman, another important railway town. Zelensky said: ""Lyman in Donetsk region is still waiting for our flag, and this is inevitable – Ukraine always returns."" Despite this, further fighting is expected to be difficult for Ukraine as it attempts to continue the advance. Read more",14,1.6440208349863672,1.9941691663015813,-0.35014833131521406,1

2022-09-08,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/direct-threat-russia-could-use-27936292,'Direct threat' that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine war,"A chilling warning has been issued by Ukraine about Russia sparking nuclear conflict during the war between the two countries. Ukraine 's military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has claimed that there is a direct risk of Russian troops using tactical nuclear weapons in 'certain circumstances'. The army 's commander in chief said that - with the war being in its sixth month now - the possibility of a 'limited' nuclear conflict means that the prospect of World War 3 cannot be completely ruled. In article published by state news agency Ukrinform, Zaluzhnyi said: ""There is a direct threat of the use, under certain circumstances, of tactical nuclear weapons by the Russian Armed Forces. ""Battles on the territory of Ukraine have already demonstrated how much the Russian Federation neglects the issues of global nuclear security even in a conventional war. ""In particular, since July 2022, Russian troops have set up a military base at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, deploying heavy artillery, including BM-30 Smerch multiple rocket launchers, on its premises."" He continued: ""It is hard to imagine that even nuclear strikes will allow Russia to break Ukraine's will to resist. But the threat that will emerge for the whole of Europe cannot be ignored. ""The possibility of direct involvement of the world's leading powers in a 'limited' nuclear conflict, bringing closer the prospect of World War 3, cannot be completely ruled out either."" The military chief went on to add that any such provocation would unleash utter chaos all around the world, saying: ""Any Russian attempts at practical steps in the use of tactical nuclear weapons must be pre-empted by employing the entire arsenal of means at the disposal of world powers. ""After all, starting from this moment, the Russian Federation will become not only a threat to the peaceful coexistence of Ukraine, its neighbours, and a number of European countries but also a truly global-scale terrorist state."" In other developments, Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has today warned that he may threaten to halt all energy shipments to Europe. The European Commission said it would propose a price cap on Russian gas to deprive Moscow of revenue and hold down energy costs as Europe fears hardship this winter. In response, Putin is threatening to halt all supplies if it took such a step, adding: ""We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil - we will not supply anything"" if that occurs, he said. Europe usually imports about 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia. Furthermore the tyrant also suggested restricting a U.N.-brokered deal for Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea. In a speech at the economic forum in Russia's Far East region yesterday, Putin said the accord was delivering grain, fertiliser and other food to the European Union and Turkey rather than to poor countries - which he said was its original goal. ""It may be worth considering how to limit the export of grain and other food along this route,"" the tyrant said. Meanwhile, yesterday heavy fighting was reported on three fronts of Ukraine: in the north, near the city of Kharkiv; in the east, in the industrial Donbas region of mines and factories; and in the south, in the Kherson region. In the south particularly, Ukraine mounted a counteroffensive to try to retake formerly-seized territory by the Russians - which happened early on in the war. In a video address last night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported ""good news"" from the Kharkiv region east of Kyiv. He said that some settlements had been recaptured from Russian forces, citing ""the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated"", and said Ukrainian artillery had made successful strikes against Russian forces in the south. Additionally, The Pentagon said Ukraine's forces were making ""slow but meaningful progress"" on the battlefield and were doing better in the south than Russia. Ukraine's military command for the southern district said its forces killed 108 Russian soldiers, and destroyed 37 pieces of military hardware on Wednesday amid Russian shelling and air strikes.",14,2.7796126012960993,3.4166293829612173,-0.637016781665118,29

In an appearance at an economic forum in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok on Wednesday, the despot struck a defiant tone saying he has recognised his country's future lies with The Middle East and Asia. The 69-year-old said that Russia has not lost anything from its war with Ukraine, hitting out that Western sanctions imposed are simply a futile attempt to hold Russia in check. In fact, Putin said that all of Russia's actions were designed to strengthen the country's sovereignty, and were aimed at ""helping people"" living in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. ""We have not lost anything and will not lose anything,"" Putin said. ""In terms of what we have gained, I can say that the main gain has been the strengthening of our sovereignty."" Casting the US and its allies as aggressors, he said: “I am speaking of the West’s sanctions fever, with its brazen, aggressive attempt to impose models of behaviour on other countries, to deprive them of their sovereignty and subordinate them to their will.” The autocrat also went on to say that sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine are a “danger” to the world, saying: “The pandemic has been replaced by new challenges of a global nature, carrying a threat to the whole world. ""I’m talking about the sanctions rush in the West and the West’s blatantly aggressive attempts to impose their modus vivendi on other countries, to take away their sovereignty, to submit them to their will.” The Russian president added that the world’s future lies with Asia - and that the West is being reluctant to recognise that the Asia-Pacific region has become a magnet for human resources, capital and production capacities. He said: “Irreversible and even tectonic changes have taken place throughout international relations. “The role of dynamic, promising countries and regions of the world, primarily the Asia-Pacific region, has significantly increased.” Meanwhile, during the economic forum, Putin went on to claim that the developing world is being 'cheated on' by a Ukraine grain deal, which was designed to alleviate a looming food crisis. Putin took an aim at the deal - brokered by Turkey and the United Nations - and claimed that Ukrainian grain exports were not going to the world's poorest countries. The tyrant said: ""Once again, they simply deceived developing countries and continue to deceive them. With this approach, the scale of food (supply) issues in the world will only increase, unfortunately. ""To our great regret, this can lead to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe."" He also shockingly added that some restrictions on Russia's fertiliser exports had been eased, but problems remained as he said he would look to revise the deal to ensure it reaches its original goals. Ukraine appears to have launched a counterattack in the Kharkiv region in the northeast of the country, the second-largest city in the country, with several reports of fighting in the region. Overnight and early this morning, the head of the Kharkiv regional state administration, Oleg Synegubov, posted on Telegram that Russian forces were shelling various parts of Kharkiv. Britain’s Ministry of Defense confirmed earlier reports from officials in Ukraine that the armed forces there have been counterattacking Russian positions. Most of the fighting has been taking place in the northeastern and eastern parts of the country, as well the south. In its intelligence update today, the ministry said: ""Over the last 24 hours, heavy fighting has taken place on three fronts: in the north, near Kharkiv; in the east in the Donbas; and in the south in Kherson Oblast. “Russia’s planned main effort is probably an advance on Bakhmut in the Donbas, but commanders face a dilemma of whether to deploy operational reserves to support this offensive, or to defend against continued Ukrainian advances in the south.""",14,3.182624816711357,3.9804568113336094,-0.7978319946222525,7

Ivan Neparatov, 34, was convicted of five separate murders and reportedly took pleasure in killing them. The murderer was a gang leader who ""strangled his victims personally and experienced great pleasure from doing so"". One of his victims was a female strangled in a robbery, another a man stabbed 88 times. Exiled Russian law enforcement expert Sergey Kanev said Neparatov ""loved to strangle and torture animals, for which he received the nickname 'Maniac'"". After he died fighting in Ukraine, he was ordered the Order of Courage, an award established in 1994 by Russia to ""recognise selfless acts of courage and valour"" and replace a similar Soviet award. The killer died in August in Ukraine, suffering a ""gunshot explosive shrapnel penetrating wound to the head"" according to his birth certificate. Neparatov is reported to have joined the Wagner private army, which posts mercenaries to the front line, allowed to do so thanks to a system brought in by Russia to use prisoners to bolster its ranks. His murderous exploits had earned him a 25-year sentence in a penal colony, of which he had served around half before he enrolled in Putin's fighting prisoner scheme. Had he survived the war in Ukraine, his sentence would have been commuted. “He was one of the first [prisoners] to sign a contract with Wagner, and went to Ukraine,” said Kanev. Olga Romanova, of Russia Behind Bars, said in some prisons up to 20% of the jail populations have been recruited. She said: ""Approximately 20% of the prison population is recruited - if there are 1,300 people in prison, 300 are recruited. They are not taken out all at once."" Romanova said squads of around 50 to 60 people were taken out at a time and prisoners are given two weeks' training before being sent to the front line in Ukraine. One prisoner in Russia told CNN: ""They will accept murderers, but not rapists, paedophiles, extremists, or terrorists. Amnesty or a pardon in six months is on offer. ""Somebody talks about 100,000 rubles a month, another 200,000. Everything is different."" The money the prisoner highlighted is between around £1,300 and £2,600 every month. In prison for drug offences, the man said: ""In my case, if it's real, then I'm all for it. ""It can make a real difference for me: be imprisoned for nearly a decade, or get out in six months if you're lucky. ""But that's if you're lucky. I just want to go home to the children as soon as possible. If this option is possible, then why not?"" Read more",13,6.455032982001906,4.273592207885285,2.181440774116621,12

These spies are claimed to be similar to Olga Kolobova, also known a Maria Adela, who tried to infiltrate NATO’s naval HQ posing as a jet-set jewellery designer based in Naples and sleeping with officers there. Kolobova also sought to befriend members of one of Britain's richest families, the wealthy McAlpines, in order to gain access to establishment circles. The team that exposed the Russian agent, who fled to Italy and returned home amid GRU military intelligence, feared her cover was blown. They say there are many more agents still at large. Russian expert Christo Grozev has stated in the last two months alone we realise the GRU has lost two of its spies. A colleague of Olga Kolobova was arrested two months ago when the Dutch services tracked him down. He said: ""Our estimate is there were approximately 20 agents like this in Europe so now 18.” Such agents that live under a false identity in the West, such as Anna Chapman, an SVR foreign intelligence service asset exposed by the FBI in 2010 are “extremely important during war time”. It is now harder to infiltrate agents posing as for example as tourists into the West, as with the GRU hit squad that attempted to kill defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in 2018. Grozev indicated the Bellingcat team will expose more GRU undercover agents like Kolobova. He added: “As for how much she managed to achieve, I think she is one of the successful GRU projects, unlike many others. ""Unlike even the SVR’s project who is usually in charge of illegal programmes ""Their biggest post-Soviet project failed in 2010 when America arrested and sent out at least 10 deeply-hidden agents.” This was a group that included the glamorous flame-haired Chapman, who had been married to a British man, and whose UK passport was cancelled by then Home Secretary Theresa May. She is known to have cultivated a senior business figure close to the government, and a member of the House of Lords, although the extent of any espionage damage in the UK is unclear. Kolobova “managed to live quite long under her legend, and she met quite a number of officers, as well as NATO’s legal consultants and photographers”. She likely was able to describe to the GRU the “financial problems” and “weaknesses” of NATO personnel she befriended and bedded. “This is very valuable information because this is precisely how intelligence services profile their future recruits,” he said. “We know what she actually did, but we know that she was in the position which was incredibly useful for the GRU.” She was exposed because of a GRU blunder, which meant that the church mentioned in her “birth certificate” where she was “born” did not exist at the time. It was built nine years later. Chapman, now 40, was unmasked as a Russian spy by the FBI in New York, and later exchanged in a spy swap that saw Skripal come to Britain. She is now a TV presenter, influencer and owns her own clothing line in Moscow.",3,4.859377034032704,3.9956068414644674,0.8637701925682366,3

The unverified claims come from an update provided by The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine's Facebook page on Monday, September 5. The post read: ""In Donetsk, the Russian invaders found a 'new source' of replenishment of losses in manpower. ""So, recently, representatives of the Russian occupation army began to arrive at local hospitals in the city and forcefully 'discharge' patients. ""Men of military age with various diseases or injuries, including those wounded during hostilities who are undergoing treatment, fall under such an extract."" The unconfirmed statement comes amid further claims that Russia has lost around 50,000 troops in its war campaign in the country that escalated in February. Further reports say the country is struggling to expand the size of its military and replace those already killed in the war. A senior US defence official said at the end of August that the US government does not believe Russia can successfully increase the size of its military by 130,000, the number planned by Putin. The official told reported that Russia is “unlikely to succeed, as Russia has historically not met personnel end strength targets."" They added: ""Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill trained. ""So what this all suggests to us is that any additional personnel Russia is able to muster by the end of the year may not, in fact, increase overall Russian combat power."" Ukraine claims it has killed at least 50,150, along with 2,077 tanks and 4,484 armoured combat vehicles, though their estimates tend to be much higher than those released by Russia and Western countries. Estimates vary, but CIA Director William Burns put an estimate of 15,000 troops killed by the end of July and ""maybe three times that wounded."" Russia has not published its own losses since March when it claimed it had seen 1,351 killed and 3,825 wounded. Revealing the true number in Russia is considered a breach of state secrets and could see someone sentenced to up to seven years in prison. The UK Ministry of Defence's most recent update on the fighting in Ukraine said: ""In the face of combat losses, it is likely that Russia is struggling to maintain socks of [unmanned aerial vehicles] (UAVs), exacerbated by component shortages resulting from international sanctions. ""The limited availability of reconnaissance UAVs is likely degrading commanders' tactical situational awareness and increasingly hampering Russian operations.""

As the war shows no signs of abating, but Russia continues to lose manpower, Russian President Vladimir Putin is scrambling to replace the dead troops with fresh power for its army. He has already raised the minimum age for recruits and turned to Russia's prison population in a bid to mobilise troops. Now, the Nochlezhka charity has said, officials are targetting its homeless shelters in a central district of St Petersburg on the Baltic sea. An unnamed source from charity Nochlezhka told the Rotunda news service: “[A recruiter] offered to hand out leaflets explaining that men were to be called to serve under contracts. ""The duty officer [at the shelter] did not allow the leaflets to be handed out.” Rotunda said that officials at the city administration had confirmed that a recruiter had been trying to enlist from the city’s homeless population. Charity spokeswoman Tatyana Bazhenova said that Nochlezhka will not help Putin's recruiters bolster their ranks with people from her shelters, she told the Bumaga news channel. The Russian Defence Ministry has previously denied that any “mobilisation activities” are taking place but after losing around 70,000 troops in the conflict, Putin recently signed a decree to increase the Russian armed forces' military personnel to more than 1.15 million. This came as the British Ministry of Defence said in its defence update on Sunday that the decree is unlikely to ""make substantive progress towards increasing Russia's combat power in Ukraine."" They are now offering signing-on bonuses of around £5,000 and relying on the Wagner mercenary group to fill huge gaps in its frontline. Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of Putin, has reportedly recruited almost 1,000 inmates and promised them early release if they fight in Moscow's war against Ukraine. The Vot Tak television channel quoted inmates at a penal colony in the city of Bataisk, in Rostov Oblast, on September 1 as saying that Mr Prigozhin recently arrived by helicopter and promised that anyone who joined the Russian armed forces in Ukraine will get an early release. He also said inmates ""can do anything they want with the Ukrainians.""

Yandex Taxi, a Russian app that works in a similar way to Uber, had hundreds of its cars directed to Kutuzovsky Prospekt - a major road that runs east to west leading into the centre of the Russian capital. The major road is rarely jammed, with vehicles being able to drive in any of the eight to ten lanes. However, yesterday, drivers spent about 40 minutes in traffic due to the fake pick-up orders. Speaking out about the incident, the company said its security department 'immediately stopped attempts to artificially' order the taxis. However, their attempts were not enough to stop the gridlock. The company said: ""The security service promptly stopped attempts to artificially accumulate cars. Drivers spent about 40 minutes in traffic due to fake orders. The issue of compensation will be resolved in the very near future."" The company later confirmed the incident in a statement, and noted it had addressed the vulnerability that enabled the hack to happen, stressing that in order to exclude such incidents in the future, ""the algorithm for detecting and preventing such attacks has already been improved."" According to Forbes.ru, the statement read: ""On the morning of September 1, Yandex Taxi encountered an attempt by attackers to disrupt the service — several dozen drivers received bulk orders to the Fili region."" Footage of the gridlock was also shared plentifully on social media. One video from inside the cab shows dozens of other yellow cars barely moving - but all traveling in the same direction. The person who recorded the footage then shows the taxi drivers navigational system display an address on the Kutuzovsky Prospekt. Police were also recorded on the road, trying to control the vehicles. Sharing the clip on Twitter, they captioned it: ""Someone hacked #YandexTaxi and ordered all available taxis to Kutuzov Prospect in Moscow Now there is a huge traffic jam with taxis. It‘s like James Bond movie."" Currently, no one is taking responsibility for the hack. Vladimir Putin's invasion on Ukraine continues, both on the ground and online; engaged in cyber warfare. Furthermore, Russia has been behind a series of cyber attacks since the start of the renewed invasion of Ukraine. In the days leading up to the war, Mykhailo Fedorov - Ukraine's digital minister and President Volodymyr Zelensky's right hand man on tech - called on volunteers to create an 'IT Army' of hackers to help in his country's struggle against Russia. Russian state media has also been targeted, with sensitive information being leaked.

Western sources today said that credible evidence is being uncovered by governments and NGOs of horrendous treatment meted out by Valdimir Putin 's forces, six months after the invasion started. Sources are understood to be ""particularly concerned"" about filtration camps amid chilling reports of torture and murder, with a report by Human Rights Watch highlighting sickening treatment of people in Donetsk. Russian occupiers are desperate to impose referendums on the population in an effort to convince the world that Ukrainians want to be assimilated into a larger Russia - but results should be viewed as having no credibility at all, sources said. Meanwhile, there is optimism that Ukraine is making progress in reclaiming territory around the port city of Kherson, with many Russian units lacking combat effectiveness due to depleted numbers. Putin, whose movements are limited due to fears around his security, has embarked on propaganda visits to try and tackle waning enthusiasm for his war in recent days, sources say. It comes as the British national security advisor, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, vowed that UK support for Ukraine would not waver. He said in a statement released today: ""It’s been more than six months since Putin launched his unprovoked, illegal war bringing untold suffering to the innocent people of Ukraine and there is increasing evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces. Putin's invasion has hurt people across the globe, causing price rises and food insecurity, including for many who were already vulnerable, as well as the desperate bloodshed. ""Ukraine’s resistance has inspired the world and shown huge courage in the face of brutality. Now that courageous resistance has stalled the Russian advance and demonstrated the determination of the Ukrainian people and Armed Forces to retake their sovereign territory. ""The risks around this terrible conflict continue as Putin finds he can’t make progress, his forces suffer heavy losses, and sanctions continue to degrade his war machine and take money out of the pockets of Russia's richest people. At the same time Russia is trying and failing to impose a veneer of legitimacy on the areas it temporarily controls, including through plans for staged sham referenda. It will not succeed. ""The UK and our allies will continue to provide humanitarian, economic and military assistance. Our support for Ukraine and its people will not waver.""",14,3.80120621751979,3.9546492486473293,-0.15344303112753943,29

The troops, who had been posted in Mariupol, reportedly headed to a home on the outskirts of the battleground city after they received a call saying that members of Ukraine's Azov Regiment were stationed there. A Telegram post by the city's mayor said they then bolted inside expecting to find them — only to be blown up by munitions laid down earlier by Russian forces. The morale-boosting war message claimed one of the troops was killed in the blast, while another was hospitalised after losing part of his legs. The Mariupol mayor's office claimed one of the Russians was killed while another lost his leg remains in a hospital in Donetsk. The Azov Regiment, also known as the Azov Battalion, is a controversial group of soldiers who were officially incorporated into the National Guard of Ukraine in 2014 after recapturing Mariupol from pro-Russian separatists in June that year. A number of troops have been accused of ties to Neo-Nazism after they were photographed wearing SS and Swastika symbols. In a separate development on Monday, Russian troops were warned flee Ukraine by president Volodymyr Zelensky as his forces launched a major offensive. The Ukrainian military is currently attempting to reclaim invaded territory near the southern city of Kherson after losing the area earlier the year. Russia responded to the attack by claiming the assault had failed, although it is thought to have seriously disrupted their supply chain. The ongoing war has claimed thousands of lives and displaced millions but recent weeks have seen intense fighting result in something of a stalemate, with Russia struggling to make further gains. There have been rumours of Russian troops deliberately injuring themselves in order to avoid battle, while 1,000 refused to return from duties in Kazakhstan.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky told Moscow’s soldiers the new mission by Kyiv will drive them all the way back to the Russian border. Zelensky said: “If they want to survive - it’s time for the Russian military to run away. Go home. “Ukraine is taking back its own land.” Heavy fighting has broken out around occupied Kherson in the south, with Ukraine’s troops breaking through Russian defences in several sectors. Russia captured the key region early in the invasion but Ukraine is launching devastating strikes with Western-supplied missiles to batter Russian positions. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, said Russian defences in the Kherson region had been “broken through in a few hours.” Ukrainian troops were also calling in artillery strikes on ferries that were being used to resupply Russian forces across the Dnipro River, threatening to cut them off. The attack comes after weeks of Ukrainian operations which have destroyed more than 20 huge ammunition and weapons dumps used by the Russians, Battles raged across the entire southern front and Ukraine was stepping up its artillery barrages after weeks of preparation Vitaly Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region, told Ukrainian TV: “Heavy fighting is going on. Our military is working around the clock. Liberation of the Kherson region is coming soon.” Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 to wage what it said was a “special military operation” to rid the country of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and its allies, including Britain hold this to be a false narrative as it is an unprovoked war of aggression. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in central southern Ukraine, captured by Russian troops in March but still manned by Ukrainian staff, has been a hotspot in the conflict, with both sides trading blame for shelling in the vicinity. A mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is heading to the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, and is due later this week to inspect and assess any damage. - Analysis, by Chris Hughes One of Russia’s biggest vulnerabilities has been its supply lines and the possibility of being cut off without reinforcements. For weeks, Ukraine has been dismantling these lines, obliterating ammo stores, even deep inside Crimea. In one week, 10 big dumps were blown up. This, coupled with the assassinations of collaborators and Russian-installed officials in guerilla attacks, has dented the morale of Moscow’s forces. British and German-supplied rocket systems and US-donated artillery have targeted four bridges which could be used to reinforce troops in Kherson. Denting Russian morale, weakening supply lines and blowing up bridges have all been preparation for this offensive. We may be seeing the tide turn as Ukraine has timed the counter-offensive to retake swathes of the south and protect access to the Black Sea. In the weeks before the invasion we visited Ukrainian troops in the trenches in Donbas and they made no secret of their intention. One officer said: “We will fight, maybe have to let them in, flank them, destroy their supply lines and then kill them.” It is early in the counter-offensive but Kyiv’s military has proved repeatedly it has tactical superiority and its troops are motivated.",14,3.0253982300357953,2.8883784093900458,0.13701982064574958,25

Shot in the back, he struggled away from the scene, but died mere hours later in his own home in Borodianka, in the now infamous Bucha district. Ukrainian officials along with the International Criminal Court (ICC) are looking into war crimes since the invasion began. Over 14,000 separate alleged incidents were recorded in the country by the Ukrainian prosecutor's office as early as late May. Now, the estimated tally stands at around 25,000. Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Calllamard said: ""It is vital that all those responsible, including up the chain of command, are brought to justice."" Devastated mum Tasia said to Reuters: ""That's it. I've lost my child. They have to try them in court."" Her son was shot on March 17, less than a month into the war. In Bucha, authorities found mass graves and claimed them to be evidence of murder and torture. Roman's body was found to be in a grave containing around 250 people on April 30. Borodianka police chief Viacheslav Tsyliuryk said: ""We can establish an army unit, but at the moment it is not possible to hold a specific individual responsible."" Russia continues to deny incidents of war crimes in Ukraine despite the mounting allegations and evidence against them. The country insists they are only in Ukraine conducting a ""special operation"" to remove the threat of a Nazi government on their borders. A false claim that has no basis in reality, Putin's invasion is a war. British attorney Nigel Povoas works as the lead prosecutor for the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, based in the US. He told Reuters that areas of Borodianka with apartment blocks were allegedly destroyed by Russian warplanes ""On the face of it, and at this stage it's very early, this would seem to be an obvious war crime for priority investigation."" Elsewhere the NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Ukraine of torture, unlawful detentions and forced disappearances in the regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Senior Ukraine researcher at Human Rights Watch Yulia Gorbunova said: ""Russian forces have turned occupied areas of southern Ukraine into an abyss of fear and wild lawlessness. ""Torture, inhumane treatment, as well as arbitrary detention and unlawful confinement of civilians, are among the apparent war crimes we have documented, and Russian authorities need to end such abuses immediately and understand that they can, and will, be held accountable.""",13,4.339824156658695,5.168599996365566,-0.8287758397068714,22

Oleksiy Kovalyov, 33, was shot dead along with his 38-year-old wife who was stabbed and later passed away in hospital. In April, Kovalyov had switched sides to ally himself with the Vladimir Putin regime when they invaded his home country in February this year, causing thousands of deaths and left large parts of major cities completely destroyed. Ukrainian official Serhiy Khlan said: ""Former MP and traitor Oleksiy Kovalyov has been killed."" He was eventually appointed the Deputy Head of Agriculture in the important grain region, a significant role considering Ukraine's reputation as the ""breadbasket of the world"". The former MP with the ruling Servant of the People party - the same as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - in Kyiv was found and killed by saboteurs located in the Kherson region, currently occupied by Russia but facing a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Ukrainian forces claim they have broken through ""in several places"" in the attempt to re-take the south of the country, while Zelenksy warned Russian troops to flee if they want to survive. Journalist Andrei Tsaplienko added on his Telegram channel: ""The traitor, collaborator and former People's Deputy Oleksiy Kovalyov was shot dead in his own house. ""The occupiers have begun intensive searches and document checks. Be careful, Ukrainians."" Those identified as traitors to Ukraine continue to be targeted by saboteurs, often identified as those who have taken up administrative positions. Five are reported to have been killed in the Kherson region, while the mayor of Kherson city, Vladimir Saldo, was left in a coma in Moscow after a suspected poisoning. The shotgun assassination attempt was not the first made against Kovalyov who was left in hospital in June and blamed the Ukrainian secret service (SBU) for a car bombing. He said during his recovery: ""I am alive, I am healthy. I am aiming to be back to work on Monday. They didn’t scare me and I am aiming to keep working. ""To be with my people and work on my constituency until my duties expire in 2023. To my enemies and to those who planned this sabotage - you won’t stop me.""

The strange and alarming remarks were made by Andrey Gurulyov, a retired commander in the Russian military and current member of the Russian State Duma. On Russian TV, the lieutenant general who served as a Russian tank commander said: ""To serious things - London understands there is no defence against [Russian] hypersonic missiles. ""They understand, too, that the main target isn’t Germany or France - but the British Isles."" Hypersonic missiles are incredibly hard to stop as they fly five times faster than the speed of sound and on a different trajectory than other missiles. Capable of reaching the UK in three minutes, they are also deadly with the potential to deliver nuclear strikes. Around 50, he warned, would wipe out all of the UK's power stations and stop Western support for Ukraine, making it far easier for Vladimir Putin's regime to carry out its invasion plans, which are currently faltering as a counteroffensive is now underway in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson. Gurulyov continued: ""It is the closest target, it’s a nice target, which would allow [us] to change the outcome of this conflict [in Ukraine ]. ""So by completely wiping out the British Isles, I think we’ll finish this story."" The term ""British Isles"" is a geographical term referring to Great Britain and its surrounding islands including the island of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland has been neutral since the 1930s. The wild claims also said that Wales and Scotland would be moved to leave the UK, which would see the ""end of the British Crown."" An attack on the UK would likely cause a world war due to its position in NATO, where an attack on one member state is considered an attack on all of them. Gurulyov appeared to think the strike would stop the West from supporting Ukraine if such a devastating attack, in which millions could be killed, actually occurred. He said: ""The hypersonic weapon has an extraordinary destructive power, near-equivalent to a nuclear weapon - and is precise, too."" The UK made the ideal target, according to the member of the Russian parliament’s defence committee, due to its support for Ukraine since the war broke out in February and that it is preparing for war. ""They realise the number of currently deployed missiles allows destruction of the UK’s entire aviation grouping... Yes - they are preparing for the war with us. The whole situation is not about Ukraine. ""We are not fighting Ukraine, we are fighting our British ‘friends’ and [the US]."" Regular TV threats by Putin’s propagandists to strike Britain are seen as a sign of frustration, especially in military circles, over the Kremlin’s leader’s tactics which have seen an estimated 75,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded in six months, while making relatively small territorial gains. Moscow holds Britain responsible for galvanising the West to stand solidly with Ukraine, and also to provide arms to President Volodymyr Zelensky.",14,3.972672537408099,4.183010190483181,-0.21033765307508157,29

The Russian despot's troops would then number 1.15million, 15 times the size of the British Army. The bloody invasion of Moscow's former Soviet ally is entering its seventh month and shows no signs of coming to an end. The Kremlin had previously tried to persuade volunteers, private military contractors and prisoners through amnesty agreements in an effort to swell its ranks. Commanders are now offering £4,000 signing-up bonuses, while the upper age limit has been raised. Former KGB intelligence officer Putin - who is widely reported to have seen his health decline in recent months - has always referred to the invasion as a “special operation” since beginning shell attacks in February. Dara Massicot, senior policy researcher at US think tank Rand Corporation, told the Daily Telegraph: “An expansion like this is a move you make when strategic forecasts for the future inside the General Staff are gloomy, or you have a longer term conflict or project in mind."" Putin has not publicly pinpointed which areas of his army he plans to strengthen but analysts suggest he needs to replace around 75,000 frontline soldiers that have been killed or injured. But because he refuses to identify the invasion as a war, many commanders say he cannot order the full mobilisation he needs. Moscow had expected to capture Ukrainian capital Kyiv within three days, but an unexpectedly resilient defence, bolstered by modern NATO weapons and intel left the invaders bogged down. They pulled out of the original plan to take the centre of the country, and shifted to the Donbas. However, Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said that the Kremlin’s plan was on track at a meeting in Uzbekistan of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

Analysts in the west claim the recruitment drive is focused on poorer border regions to avoid raising eyebrows in Russia's main power centres.

The national holiday commemorates Ukraine's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Wednesday also marked six months since Russian forces invaded Ukraine, commencing what would become Europe's most devastating conflict since World War Two. Hours before the strike on the station, a rocket also hit a house in the same area and killed an 11-year-old child, according to the official in the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko.

Ukraine's ongoing resistance comes as insiders claim that Vladimir Putin will “no longer attend meetings” due to his “sharply deteriorating” health. The Russian president's health has been the subject of speculation for months, with rumours circulating that he may have used a body double to attend some events. With the tyrant's war not going to plan, there have been suggestions that Putin is wavering between resorting to nuclear weapons or conceding defeat. As concerns over the despot's health intensify – speculation has suggested he could be dealing with cancer or Parkinson's - insiders claim that his security officials have delivered the news to Putin that he has run out of “good” options. With Ukraine officials claiming to have killed more than 44,000 Russian troops and at least 1,800 tanks obliterated, Putin's invasion has endured a calamitous first six months. Kremlin hopes of a speedy victory have been dealt a series of blows, with Crimea coming under fire from kamikaze drone strikes in recent days. Russia annexed the region in 2014.",14,3.3920118904351044,5.285317541512179,-1.8933056510770747,29
2022-08-22,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/hundreds-tortured-killed-russian-forces-27805193,Hundreds tortured and killed by Russia ahead of sham Ukraine referendums,"Hundreds of Ukrainians are believed to have been tortured and killed as Russian invaders try to tighten their grip on seized territories ahead of sham votes next month, Western intelligence sources say. Alarmed officials have received reports of extrajudicial killings in the strategically-important southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in a brutal wave of systematic repression by Vladimir Putin's forces. Those who oppose the occupiers, and people with previous links to the Ukrainian state or military, have been rounded up and face indefinite detention - with some transported to camps outside of Ukraine. This widespread intimidation is being carried out to pave the way for referendums which will see the population polled on whether they favour joining Russia, a source said. There is no doubt that the votes will be fixed in Russia's favour, and the world should not be fooled, the insider stated. If given a free vote, there would be no interest whatsoever in being swallowed up by Russia, with the regions previously voting strongly in favour of Ukrainian independence, they continued. It is estimated that around half the populations of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia have fled since the start of the invasion nearly six months ago, with those who remain enduring chilling repression and intimidation. Russia is highly unlikely to relinquish the regions without military defeat, the source stated. It is believed that the polls have been delayed until Russia is confident it has sufficient control over the affected areas with dissent brutally suppressed. Schools are currently being forced to teach Russian history after a sweeping curriculum shakeup, while families are being bombarded with relentless propaganda after Ukrainian TV networks and internet providers were shut down. The Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia, is being replaced by the rouble, with workers forced to take out Russian bank accounts in order to collect their pay, a source said. Depleted Russian forces are not expected to make any major territorial gains in the coming weeks, and so have set their sights on consolidating in the strategically-important land link to Crimea. Although Putin's forces believe that the longer the war goes on, the more likely they are to prevail, Western intelligence officials are optimistic that the opposite could be true as Ukraine becomes better armed and receives firmer support from international powers.",14,2.960750263056961,4.02961606741726,-1.068865804360299,29
2022-08-22,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/woman-accused-killing-daughter-putins-27803256,Woman accused of daughter of Putin's 'Rasputin's' car bomb is mum with young kid,"Pictures emerged of the woman the Russian FSB claimed was the killer of Darya Dugina, 29. The suspect was named as Natalia Shaban-Vovk, 43, mother of a 12-year-old girl. They are from Mariupol, and the mother is accused of being a member of Ukrainian Azov battalion. She was allegedly aiming to kill the daughter rather than the father, according to the Russian media. If Estonia does not extradite Dugina to Russia, there are grounds for tough action against Tallinn, said Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov. The FSB claimed that Shaban-Vovk had rented an apartment in the same building where Dugina lived, and planned the operation over a number of weeks from her arrival in Russia on July 23. To monitor Dugina, she used a Mini Cooper, while entering the Russian Federation, DPR number plates were used. In Moscow, Kazakh plates were used, and when leaving for Estonian, a Ukrainian plate was used. Russian propagandist Margarita Simonyan, head of RT, urged Putin’s undercover agents to track her down in Estonia. ‘Dasha’s [Darya’s] killers are already in Estonia,” she said. “Estonia will not - of course - extradite. “I think we have enough professionals who would want to admire spires around Tallinn.” Her post included an admission that GRU military intelligence agents operated in Salisbury against Sergei Skripal, who was poisoned with novichok. The agents were said by Russia - which has always denied an operation to kill Skripal - to be tourists who went to see the beauty of Salisbury Cathedral. She suggested a killer squad should admire the spires in the Estonian capital. In his first comment since his daughter’s death, Putin’s ‘Rasputin’ Alexander Dugin, 60, demanded “more than than just revenge or retribution” for her death. He insisted on victory against Ukraine in the war. “As a result of a terrorist attack carried out by the Nazi Ukrainian regime, on August 20, when returning from the festival near Moscow, my daughter Darya Dugina was brutally killed by an explosion in front of my eyes. “She was a beautiful Orthodox girl, a patriot, a military correspondent, an expert on the central channels, and a philosopher. “Her speeches and reporting have always been profound, grounded and restrained. “She never called for violence and war. “She was a rising star at the beginning of her journey. The enemies of Russia meanly, surreptitiously killed her ... “But we, and our people cannot be broken even by such unbearable blows. “They wanted to suppress will with bloody terror against the best and most vulnerable of us. ""But they will not succeed. “Our hearts yearn for more than just revenge or retribution. “It's too petty, it’s not Russian style. “We need only our Victory. My daughter laid her life on its altar - so please win! “We wanted to raise her to be smart, and to be a hero. “Let this (her tragic death) inspire the sons of our Fatherland to the feat even now.”",3,4.566941849632352,3.725946277615569,0.8409955720167828,9

Daria Dugina - the daughter of Putin's ""Rasputin"" - died after 400g of TNT attached to her SUV was set off by a remote-detonated device, the state-run TASS news agency revealed, citing police sources. ""It has now been established that the bomb on Dugina's car was triggered remotely. ""Presumably, the car was monitored and its movement was controlled,"" the source said. Earlier it was reported that unknown suspects followed Dugina from the party she'd attended with her dad, before using untraceable phones to set off the device. Horrifying footage showed Dugin holding his head in his hands as he watched his daughter being engulfed by the inferno in a village near Moscow on Saturday night. Investigators said the prominent right-wing TV pundit was on her way back from the Zakharovo estate - where she and her father had been attending the Tradition family festival. A source for the TASS news agency said that 400g of TNT - enough to kill her on the spot - was placed in the vehicle while in the car park of the event. It's understood that Dugina's father may have been the intended target and that he decided to switch cars at the last minute. Investigators suggested that Dugin and his daughter might have been targeted by Ukrainian nationalists in recent weeks, though there's currently no proof that the war-battered nation is involved in any way. A police source told Komsomolskaya Pravda : ""According to Alexander Dugin, he and his daughter have recently received a lot of threats from Ukrainian nationalists via social networks, but did not attach any importance to them."" The vehicle carrying his daughter exploded ""before his eyes"" after the pair ""left the festival in different cars"", the source added. Dugin - who has also been described as a “Russian fascist”- was a guest of honour with his daughter at the Tradition family festival at the Zakharovo estate - and apparently switched cars at the last minute. Vladimir Putin ’s closest supporters are demanding vengeance on Ukraine over the ""assassination"" of the daughter of the Russian leader's spiritual guru. Evidence indicated that Alexander Dugin was the intended victim of the car bombing. Darya Dugina, a prominent TV pundit, was blown up in the huge explosion and died at the scene. However, her 60-year-old father was in a different vehicle and only got to the scene of the explosion a few minutes later. An upsetting video from Baza media showed the grieving father at the scene of the explosion.",3,3.5752909904949064,4.780802080785704,-1.2055110902907975,16

In April, dad-of-four Andrew Hill, from Plymouth, was captured and then paraded on Russian TV with a head bandage and his left arm covered in a sling. New information has now been revealed that the reason Mr Hill was captured was that he was ordered to defend a position that had already been abandoned by another unit, due to intense Russian fire. The Kyiv Independent newspaper has exposed the poor military strategies and corruption in Ukraine’s International Legion and revealed why the Brit may have been captured. One American soldier described missions that took place near the southern city of Mykolaiv, where Russian troops discovered their squad’s position and started to shell it heavily. Most troops retreated from the second position behind them, leaving the squad to hold the front line alone, leading to the death of his fellow soldier. “We were literally left (behind) and they didn't want to evacuate us,” the soldier said. Shortly after the squad escaped the shelling, another group from the same unit was ordered to take the same position again to try and take down the Russians despite the huge risk. “We told the commander those positions were discovered by Russians… If we go back there, we are all dead,” the American soldier told the Kyiv Independent. The commander did not want to hear it and sent a second group back to the same position. Once again, the second position retreated and those on the frontlines were at huge risk. Four were killed, multiple were injured, and one was taken captive. The captive soldier was Mr Hill. This week Mr Hill was marched in a cage with two other British men, a Swede and a Croatian, at a show trial in a proxy court in Russian-held Donetsk. John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy are among five European men who appeared in a court on a so-called trial at a court that is not internationally recognised. They face possible execution under the laws of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, on accusations of being a mercenary. Russian state media says the men's next hearing is scheduled for October. The three captured men all denied they are mercenaries fighting with Ukrainian forces in a Russian proxy court. Former British special forces soldiers who quit the International Legion not long after arriving said it was because they felt they were being lined up as cannon fodder. Major Taras Vashuk, Vashuk’s uncle, also named Taras and Sasha Kuchynsky who run the squad have been accused by legionnaires interviewed for the report of a number of wrongdoings, including concern over sending soldiers on suicide missions.

Alexander Dugin, a fascist political strategist who has been dubbed 'Putin's Philosopher', was allegedly the intended target of the attack on the outskirts of Moscow. Instead his daughter Darya Dugin, a sanctioned Russian national, is thought to have died in the explosion on a main road near the village of Bolshiye Vyazyomy on Saturday. Her father is believed to be one of the key architects of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Video from the scene shows a Land Cruiser Prado engulfed in flames with a fire truck in attendance . The motives and intended target of the attack have not been confirmed. However, the Daily Mail reported one of Putin's stooges accusing Ukrainian “terrorists” of being behind the incident. Denis Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic – a pro-Kremlin separatist region in eastern Ukraine, said on Telegram: “The terrorists of the Ukrainian regime, trying to eliminate Alexander Dugin, blew up his daughter... In a car. Blessed memory of Daria, she is a real Russian girl.” Alexander Dugin, who once wrote that a totalitarian Russian state should control Europe as far west as Dublin in order to challenge America, does not have a formal government role. However, he is thought to be behind the 'New Russia ' slogan that was used by Putin to justify annexing Crimea in 2014. He has said that Russia not regaining control of Ukraine would be “an enormous danger for all of Eurasia” and was sanctioned by the United States in 2015 after being accused of trying to recruit pro-Russia forces in the country. In another suspected Ukrainian attack, a drone strike hit Russia's naval headquarters in Crimea, causing a large explosion. Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhaev confirmed the attack on Telegram, writing: “Unfortunately, [the drone] was not shot down, although they worked on the bay with small arms. [It] went low. There were no victims.” Last week Ukraine hit back at Russia by attacking their airbase in Crimea - with three people injured by the explosions. Among the three wounded was a 13-year-old boy with a cut on his forearm and a pensioner with a shrapnel wound - following an attack on Novofedorivka. There were 15 explosions reported in 30 minutes in the annexed peninsula - which until then had avoided major assaults. The area was filled with smoke and dust which saw 30 people evacuated from houses adjacent to the airfield - with detonations continuing.",17,3.697887480411418,3.790439036092627,-0.09255155568120887,16

Six months since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, attacks on Crimea — the peninsula Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014 but still recognised as Ukrainian by western nations — have been ramping up. More than half of the Russian navy’s Black Sea Fleet combat jets were put out of action last week following a string of blasts at the Saky military airfield in western Crimea. On Saturday, Russian targets were reportedly attacked in Sebastopol, the home of Russia's Black Sea fleet and more drone attacks were reported overnight in Crimea, including one at an airbase. The attacks have also sabotaged Putin’s attempts to hide the true horrors of the conflict from the public because thousands of Russian tourists holidaying in Crimea fled the peninsula when they witnessed explosions. One official said: ""Ukraine is now consistently achieving kinetic effects deep behind Russia ’s lines. “We’ve seen this in at least three instances in occupied Crimea, an area which Russia has previously considered a secure base area with a major role in enabling the occupation. ""The incidents have been having a material effect on Russia’s logistics support, but as importantly, there’s a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership."" Russia always thought Crimea would be untouchable during the war and safe from Ukrainian attack, hence reams of people holidaying there. But the unnamed Western officials said that Russia's Black Sea fleet has now been diminished to little more than a coastal flotilla and satellite images from the aftermath of the Ukrainians hitting the Russian airbase revealed severe damage. Russia is facing an increasingly critical shortage of stocks, even of basic munition, as well as manpower issues, the Western official stressed. They said: ""There was a point when there was constant shelling, there was a real high point, particularly around the battle for the Donbas. ""We aren't at that high point anymore. ""The whole tempo of the campaign has slowed down, partly because both sides have become more conscious that this is a marathon, not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important."" In April, the fleet's flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine and in June the fleet suffered a huge blow when it was forced to abandon the strategic Snake Island after coming under sustained Ukrainian bombardment.",14,4.835828658274129,5.192813189890004,-0.3569845316158755,20

One video shows fighters from the puppet Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) staging a mutiny and refusing to defend the unrecognised Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). They complain of “threats, blackmail, intimidation and deception” to force them to slaughter Ukrainians. The other video parades recruited jail inmates at the frontline in the pro-Putin Wagner private army, after being signed up with a promise of their sentences being wiped. They deny they are “cannon fodder” even though reports suggest hundreds of newly signed up convicts have perished already on the battlefield. Both cases highlight how Putin is desperately short of troops ready to fight in his bloody war in Ukraine after catastrophic losses in his regular forces. A statement read by one of the LPR fighters said: “We, servicemen from mobilisation reserve battalion 2740, refuse to go and fight in the Donetsk People's Republic [DPR]. “We have fulfilled our duty for the defence of the Luhansk People's Republic [LPR]. “Victory day was announced by the head of the republic on July 3, 2022. “With threats, blackmail, intimidation and lies they are now trying to force us to the territory of the DPR.” A source told Mozhem Obyasnit [We Can Explain] Telegram channel: “Employees of military enlistment offices walk the streets and literally take young people by force, although they do not want to fight. “Naturally, this does not add joy to the population, on the contrary, it causes strong irritation and discontent.” The prisoners video shows a group from several penal colonies apparently ordered to tell the camera that they are not “cannon fodder” in the Wagner private army which fights alongside Putin’s regular forces. Putin has raided his own jails to find men willing to be put on the frontline, and the video appears intended to encourage others to agree to bolster his stretched forces facing Ukrainian fightback in several regions. “Hi there - this is Penal Colony number 7, Velikiy Novgorod,” said one. “There are rumours we’ve all been killed, that we’ve been used as cannon fodder - don’t believe it. “Everything is good, everything is fine. We are moving forward, striking Ukrainians and will continue to do so. We will live."" One says: “Everything is fine. Pity you didn’t come too. “And the main thing- don’t believe those who say we are used as cannon fodder.” The released inmates - promised good money and no return to their cells if they survive - claimed they were “not clearing minefields with our feet….” Another prisoner is from Penal Colony number 9, also in Velikiy Novgorod. Their message back to other inmates goes on: “Everything is fine, guys. We are all healthy and fine. We are moving forward, killing Ukrainians. We are with you, everything is good!” A week ago Olga Romanova, German-based head of NGO Russia Behind Bars, said: “The first fight with the participation of jail inmates was on 12 July in Luhansk region. “It was the first batch of the recruited inmates from colony number 7. From those 42, five were killed instantly, 12 got wounded. “This was just the first fight, and then they stopped reporting on losses.” Romanova later said nearly 200 of the recruited inmates had been killed, according to messages Russia Behind Bars was receiving from relatives. Lawyer Leonid Krikun said the wounded were in hospital under fake names. He added: “This likely means the dead will also be buried under nicknames. The question is how would the relatives get the money then. Quite likely they won’t be paid.”",14,4.985950221368984,2.8491130209747126,2.1368372003942717,12

The Wagner Group fighters are understood to have been targeted by a devastating rocket attack after photos were published online inadvertently pinpointing their base. Oligarch and mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin - nicknamed 'Putin's chef' - was initially said to be among around 100 dead in the Ukrainian onslaught in which a US-supplied missile system was deployed. It comes after The Mirror revealed a highly placed Kremlin official has secretly approached the West to help end the Ukraine invasion. A Kyiv official confirmed the attack on the Wagner base in Popasna, eastern Ukraine, in response to reports from Russia. Kremlin propagandist Sergei Sreda had shared pictures following a visit to the hidden site, with one showing him by a street sign alongside Russian mercenaries. He said: ""I arrived in Popsana. Went to Wagner's HQ. They greeted me like family, told me a few funny stories."" In another snap he is seen shaking hands with Prigozhin. The 61-year-old close confidante of Putin's, whose mercenary group is accused of war crimes in Africa, Syria and Ukraine, later boasted he had ""cheated death"", suggesting the strike was intended to kill him but he had survived. Pro-Russia Telegram channel HS Kharkiv shared photos and footage showing a bombed out building believed to the headquarters. A man was seen being carried on a stretcher amid the rubble, with the video captioned: ""We're digging out our guys in Popasna."" Ukraine's governor in Luhansk Serhiy Gaiday said of the attack: ""The news is definitely going to be good, with the figure around 100."" Pro-Kremlin Telegram channel Voenny Osvedomitel wrote: ""It's sad that this missile strike that the enemy was able to launch thanks to a thoughtless publication of the current military positions was not the first time it happened. ""There's a long list I can already publish."" It comes after a secret member of Putin’s elite is said to have revealed Moscow is in panic and desperate for the bloody war to end. Astonishing claims about the move were made in a report circulated to Western intelligence agencies. It is believed senior officers and officials close to Putin are alarmed by biting Western sanctions and the failing economy caused by war. Some Kremlin figures are also concerned about the increasingly alarming risks being taken such as fighting at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine.

'Putin's chef' Yevgeny Prigozhin, 61, was visiting the frontline base in Popasna at the time. However, reports that he was killed in the audacious strike have not yet been confirmed. One account has recalled that the tycoon was wounded on the frontline, and was immediately evacuated to Burdenko hospital in Moscow. However, allies of Prigozhin have hit back at these claims, and denied he was injured by a long-range missile. “He is alive, even swearing,"" a source from Popasna - not related to the Wagner group - told the VCHK-OGPU Telegram channel. Another source close to Wagner has also denied Prigozhin had been killed, saying: ""This is not the first time they have buried him,” noting earlier Ukrainian reports had wrongly reported his death in a previous incidents. “So there will probably be no official denials this time either. They are simply not needed,” added the account. However, there has been a claim of “mild panic”, as Prigozhin has not been seen since the wake of the strike. Although, there have been confirmations that the base of the shadowy Wagner private army frontline HQ was targeted. Video footage and pictures show the scene after the missile strike in Popasna, in Russian-occupied Luhansk region. One grainy clip from a top of a building shows one of the men leaving a building. While another, filmed in between some shrubs, shows three Wagner mercenaries convened around a truck. They are then seen crouching to the ground, but it is unclear whether they are picking something up. Reports have indicated that there were dead and wounded from the hit where Putin's billionaire pal was present. It appears the base in Popasna was deliberately targeted by a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) missile - with knowledge that Prigozhin was visiting. 'Putin's chef' came about his nickname and prominence after his restaurants and catering businesses arranging lavish Kremlin functions for the Russian president. He was also heavily linked to pro-Putin troll factories, which pumped out supportive propaganda in Russia and the West - and to the Wagner private army which is still active in Ukraine, Syria and Africa. However, the tyrant's so-called chef has had to dispute any links to the Wagner Group. There have been claims he has been seen personally recruiting prisoners - including convicted murderers - to fight in the war in Ukraine. He reportedly told inmates: “I was jailed, too. “Now I am a Hero of Russia. We need your skills.” And the Russian despot last month awarded him the country’s top honour, despite being jailed for robbery, fraud, and involving teenagers in crime during Soviet times. The Wagner Group - often described as a private military company (PMC) - is a network of mercenaries, or a de facto private army of Russian President Putin. Wagner has recently recruited prison inmates and civilian ‘mercenaries’ to bolster Russian forces at the front. The private army is seen as crucial to Putin’s war effort on the frontlines amid claims over the failings of his regular forces. However, they have recently been accused of supplying a 'cannon fodder' to Putin’s war effort.

Even salaries six to eight times higher than normal levels are failing to persuade counter-intelligence officers to move to invaded areas. Putin urgently needs both regular and military intelligence operatives to enforce his rule in the two “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk, but also in Kherson, Zaporozhzhia and Kharkiv regions. But FSB agents are avoiding such postings, resorting to obtaining medical certificates from complaint doctors for themselves or family members, allowing them to remain in their home locations, says ‘We Can Explain’ independent media. Putin’s “siloviki” secret services chiefs are even trying to woo back retired or fired agents for war zone roles. But there is little or no interest, an FSB source told the Telegram channel. The source said: “We called 200 [retired] people and only three said they would think about it. “This is despite the promises of huge payments and benefits.” Officers have been offered around £5,000 a month to service in occupied zones, it is claimed. This is up to eight times their normal pay, and far more than payments to soldiers fighting in the war. “Personnel departments are actively calling former employees, even those dismissed on discrediting grounds,” stated the report. The lack of loyalty to Putin from the rank and file intelligence operatives mirrors a reluctance from troops to be posted to the war zone, which has resulted in the Kremlin desperately recruiting untrained prisoners and “Dad’s Army” civilians for frontline deployment. Some officers report that they are “exhausted” by almost six months of intensive duties with holidays cancelled during the war. Many are seeking to quit the service, it was claimed. The FSB - Russia's Federal Security Service - was once headed by Putin. The current head is close Putin ally Alexander Bortnikov. The report says there had been open dissent in the ranks with some FSB officers sent to remote postings in eastern Siberia as demonstrative punishments intended to warn others to toe the line. “The shortage of personnel in the special service is also confirmed by a draft decree submitted by the FSB itself,” said ‘We Can Explain’. “This will allow the signing of contracts with [recruits] with only secondary education, not higher, as was required before, and with those who do not have experience of military service.”",14,3.1002254000688474,3.346354429114258,-0.24612902904541079,3

John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy will be tried in a secret Russian court next week. The trio are currently being held by pro-Russian separatists in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic while they await the trial, alongside face terrorism charges. Harding and Hill were both fighting in the Ukrainian armed forces, while Healy was an aid worker. Interfax news agency was the first to break news of their trial, stating: ""The court hearing is scheduled for August 15, it will be held behind closed doors"". A representative of the DPR Supreme Court also said that - according DPR law - if the defendants are found guilty, they face severe punishments, meaning the tree individuals could face the death penalty. In April, dad-of-four Hill, from Plymouth, was paraded on Russian TV after apparently suffering gunshot wounds. Footage showed him wounded with a head bandage and his left arm covered in a sling. Sitting on the floor, the worried dad glanced up at the camera occasionally to ask if would ever come back to England. Meanwhile, Harding - originally from Sunderland - was captured by Russians as he defended the Azovstal steelworks. And in July, he appeared in a chilling propaganda video where he was forced to record his 'last word' to his heartbroken daughter. The clip was shared on Telegram, and shows Harding - in his fifties - being interviewed by a Russian TV presenter. Dylan Healy, 22, was captured along with another Brit, Paul Urey, 45, near the town of Zaporizhzhia. The two men were on a rescue mission in the city of Dniprorudne, saving a woman and two children while they were working for a non-profit organisation called Presidium Network. The co-founder and chief operating officer of the charity, Dominik Byrne, said that the men who were working independently as humanitarian aid volunteers. Sadly, Paul died in July, and his family have accused the Russians of failing to provide proper medical care for him, given that he was diabetic. He had reportedly been charged with ""mercenary activities"" by the Donetsk People's Republic. The news comes after two Brits - Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48 - were sentenced to death after being put on trial in the DPR. The pair were both serving members of Ukraine's army, and were sentenced to death by a kangaroo court after reportedly being tricked to admit they are terrorists.",13,3.987947817531998,4.930116839304961,-0.9421690217729628,23
2022-08-11,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mystery-fire-hits-vladimir-putins-27715042,Mystery fire hits Vladimir Putin's military base as suspicion of sabotage rises,"A major fire swept through a Russian military unit near Moscow overnight and around 50 conscripts and soldiers had to be evacuated, it has been reported. The fire reportedly happened in Dolgoprudny, 20 kilometres north of Moscow city centre, at the 4th Air Defence Division base according to Russian State Media TASS, citing the Ministry of Emergencies. There were apparently no casualties but the video shows a large fire, instilling fear among pro-Putin Russians that there is a rising number of incidents of sabotage linked to the war in Ukraine. Widespread damage was also reportedly inflicted on a Russian military base in annexed Crimea on Tuesday, satellite pictures show. Kyiv didn’t take responsibility for the blasts at the Novofedorivka air force base on the Crimean Peninsula along the Black Sea coast. But officials and ordinary citizens celebrated, mocking Russian claims that it was a minor incident caused by an ammunition explosion. There are suspicions that the damage to warplanes and loss of life at Novofedorivka is far higher than Putin’s officials have admitted, amid a virtual news blackout on the incident in Russia. Early footage from the scene showed the confused reactions among tourists at Novofedorivka beach. The area usually enjoyed by revellers for swimming was soon taken over by plumes of thick black smoke rising from a nearby Saki air base. Many now think it was to do with the conflict and not just a freak explosion as Russia has claimed. A Ukrainian government official told The Washington Post on Wednesday that Ukrainian special forces had carried out the attack. Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of state-funded broadcaster RT and a fierce supporter of the Kremlin, referred to the peninsula as a “red line” on Twitter. Russia invaded the peninsula in March 2014, seizing it from Ukraine and formally annexing it just weeks later, despite this it is officially still a part of Ukraine in the eyes of the world despite Russia largely having control. Zelensky did not specifically mention the blasts in an evening video address but said it was right that people were focusing on Crimea. ""The Black Sea region cannot be safe while Crimea is occupied,"" he said, reiterating Kyiv's position that Crimea would have to be returned to Ukraine. Asked whether Ukraine was taking responsibility for the blasts at Dolgoprudny, presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Dozhd online television channel: ""Of course not. What do we have to do with this?"" The base is close to the border with Ukraine and the incident followed the arrival of Russian Il-76s yesterday which may have brought air defence equipment. The military base at Dolgoprudny is used to disperse new recruits including draftees, but it is unclear what role it plays in the supply of manpower to Putin’s war effort. The blaze reportedly engulfed 1,200 square metres, destroying wooden barracks.",17,3.967542542908994,4.295754060241549,-0.32821151733255505,20

The so-called Mayor, Vladimir Saldo, Russia installed at the head of the occupation regime in Kherson, had to be evacuated to Moscow after the incident, Russian opposition media has reported. It was reported that, on August 3, Mr Saldo became ill after eating food prepared by the chef. Reportedly his mind began to cloud and his fingertips went numb, with Mash news media writing on Telegram that Saldo was diagnosed with poisoning by an ""unknown substance"". He was urgently rushed to a hospital in Crimea, 170 miles south of Kherson city, where doctors induced a coma and flew him to Moscow. The deputy head of the Kherson administration, Kirill Stremousov, is refusing to accept that it was poisoning, saying: ""Five months non-stop under bullets and Grads. The man was simply overtired. The diagnosis is fatigue.” He said the reports were ""part of Ukraine's information war against Russia "" and said that Saldo was ill and is ""resting"". While another Russian media channel, Baza, wrote on Telegram: ""The head of the provisional administration of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, was placed in the intensive care unit of the toxicological department of the Research Institute. Sklifosofsky - the condition of the official remains difficult. Around a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade Ukraine, the southern port city of Kherson was captured. Now, Ukrainian partisans appear to have launched a campaign of assassinations of pro-Russian officials in the area as they steam ahead with their plan to recapture the region. Last week, Vitaly Gur, the Russia-claimed deputy head of the town of Nova Kakhovka, near Kherson, was shot as he stepped out of his home. In June, car bombs assassinated a senior pro-Russian official in the civilian government and another car bomb in July hit two policemen inside, reportedly killing one. The British Ministry of Defence's latest update says Russia's commanders are struggling with ""competing operational priorities"" of offensive operations in the Donbas and defending against Ukraine's looming counter-offensive in Kherson. It said fighting efforts had shifted to the south, where the war was entering a “new phase” along a 225-mile frontline. Ukrainian forces have battered bridges over the River Dnipro, which is a vital route for Russian supply lines to the city of Kherson. Mr Saldo is now on a ventilator in the Sklifosovsky Emergency Research Institute. In Italy Anatoly Chubais, a Kremlin insider who fled Moscow after the invasion has just been discharged from hospital after being admitted for suspected poisoning. Saldo's deputy was also shot dead in his home on 6 August by the resistance.",14,3.4077063515143036,5.388168181571253,-1.9804618300569499,1

Among the three wounded was a 13-year-old boy with a cut wound on his forearm and a pensioner with a shrapnel wound - following an attack on Novofedorivka. There were 15 explosions reported in 30 minutes in the annexed peninsula - which until now has avoided major assaults. The area was filled with smoke and dust which saw 30 people evacuated from houses adjacent to the airfield - with detonations continuing. Head of the pro-Putin Crimean government in the annexed peninsula Sergey Aksyonov announced an evacuation and a 5km safety zone around the explosions. He confirmed the explosions were at a military airfield. “Ambulance crews and medical aviation are working on the spot, there are enough of them,” he said. ""It is too early to talk about the victims. “Among the civilian population, no one has yet applied to medical institutions for help. “I earnestly ask you to trust only official information.” He said: “All necessary measures have been strengthened to ensure the safety of infrastructure and the population Three explosions were particularly loud, triggering sparks and smoke and around 30 minutes later, one more blast, described by witnesses as the loudest of all, triggered two more plumes of smoke and dust. One local said: ""It slammed so loudly that we were deafened."" Another said: ""Something is burning in Novofyodorovka. “There are some explosions as it burns.” Oleg Kryuchkov, advisor to the pro-Putin government in annexed Crimea, said: ""So far I can only confirm the fact of several explosions in the Novofedorivka area. “I ask everyone to wait for official reports and not to invent new versions.” In the nearby town of Saky, sirens blared as the Russian governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said in a post on his Telegram channel that he had gone to the area and that the ""circumstances are being clarified"". Emergency services were deployed, the TASS news agency reported, citing the regional health ministry. Locals reported congestion on roads leading away from the coast. The head of the pro-Moscow regime Sergey Aksyonov, said that he was on his way there to the scene. Ambulances and air ambulances were sent to the site of the explosions in Crimea. However, Russian emergency ministry officers were kept away from the explosions on a defence ministry site in the annexed peninsula, according to reports. It was unclear why they were being prevented from seeking to put out fires, their normal role in an emergency Information about any victims was being established, the Ministry of Health of the region reports. Russia for decades leased the naval port of Sevastopol, home of its Black Sea Fleet, from Kyiv, but annexed the entire peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. The 43rd Fighter Aviation Regiment of the PKS of Russia is currently based at the airfield, which mainly consists of Su-30SM, Su-33 aircraft and Su-24M bombers. A Russian defence source denied incoming missile fire, claiming: ”At around 3.20pm, aircraft ammunition detonated at the 'Saki' airfield near the village of Novofedorovka at a rubble storage site. ""No one was injured as a result of the explosion. No aviation equipment at the airfield was damaged. ""Measures are being taken to extinguish the resulting fire and investigate the cause of the explosion. “According to the report from the site, there was no fire impact on the collapsed ammunition storage area at the airfield.” It remains under Russian control, but has not seen the intense bombardment and artillery combat that have taken place in other areas of eastern.

The figures came from the Russian ministry of defence without names or clear evidence of how the numbers were calculated. Britain is seen as third among European countries in the number of deaths among foreign fighters. Some 436 mercenaries arrived from the UK since the war started on 24 February, and 141 died, claimed the ministry headed by close Vladimir Putin ally Sergei Shoigu. A total of 1,837 came from Poland with 643 allegedly killed. Some 505 “mercenaries” came from Romania, with 156 killed, say the Russians. This compares with 608 fighters from Canada, with 213 killed, and 565 from the US with 241 killed. This comes as two British fighters Sean Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28, are appealing a “court” verdict in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic which sentenced them to death for allegedly fighting as “mercenaries” in eastern Ukraine and killing civilians. Both were employed by the Ukrainian armed forces. Three more John Harding, 59, Dylan Healy, 22, and Andrew Hill, 35, are to face trial at the same “court” of fighting as “mercenaries” and can also face the death penalty in the rogue pro-Putin state. Healy, 22, was seeking to evacuate a woman and her children from the war zone when he was seized by the Russians. He was held with British man Paul Urey, 45, who died in July in detention from “illness and stress” but amid claims he had suffered torture from secret services interrogators. Hill was a military volunteer from Plymouth, held near Mykolaiv, and Harding is an ex-military man from Sunderland who was fighting with the Ukrainian military for four years. The Foreign Office has accused Russian and its proxies in Donetsk of ""exploitation of prisoners of war and civilians for political purposes”. Russia and the DPR have claimed Britain has failed to help the detained men. Multiple threats have been made to carry out the death sentence from a court that is not recognised as legitimate in the West. Last month, the pro-Russian separatists said they're ""preparing a place for the execution"" of Aslin and Pinner. A statement from officials in the breakaway region of Ukraine reportedly said that they were “preparing a place for their execution” which would be by firing squad and without any prior warning. DPR spokesman Denys Pushilin added: ""Everything is ready. It won’t be public.""",13,4.410917121669108,3.3179988131968856,1.0929183084722225,23

Recently emerged footage of the grief-stricken family of Lieutenant Colonel Vitaly Tsikul at his funeral. Tsikul, 36, is believed to have been the 100th colonel killed when serving as part of the Russian 90th Tank Division. A soldier at the funeral, named Viktor, said: “He was our commander. I did not hear a single bad word from him. He was an officer who rallied his troops."" His funeral passed with full military honours at an Orthodox Church in Chebarkul in the Urals. Tsikul's death comes as speculation on the true numbers of Russian troops killed since Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine continues. It appears the war has not gone as well as Putin expected and the UK Ministry of Defence said he is ""highly likely"" to have sacked six of his generals for poor performance. Other recent deaths include Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Gorban, 36, a senior commander in Russia's elite special forces. A US Pentagon official said on Monday that around 70,000 to 80,000 troops have been killed or wounded since the invasion began. Current Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl explained their assessment of the situation put 42,200 of those troops as killed. He said: ""After all, more than 40 million Ukrainians are fighting. The stakes are existential for them. ""They are fighting for the survival of their country. I'll also say the Russians are taking a tremendous number of casualties on the other side of the equation."" ""There's a lot of fog in war but, you know, I think it's safe to suggest that the Russians have probably taken 70 [thousand] or 80,000 casualties in less than six months."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in April that Russia was indeed suffering ""significant"" losses in the campaign. Kahl added: ""That [Russian casualty] number might be a little lower, a little higher, but I think that's kind of in the ballpark, which is pretty remarkable considering that the Russians have achieved none of Vladimir Putin's objectives at the beginning of the war."" Russian officials are believed to understate the number of troops killed and have cracked down on what they see as the reporting of 'misinformation' in the country. Putin signed into law legislation that means people can get up to 15 years in jail for spreading 'fake' information. Some believe that the true number of troops killed may cause unrest, though support for the war within Russia remains high as the Kremlin continues to brand it a 'special operation. It falsely claims Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is in charge of a 'Nazi' state and that Russia is simply protecting its own brders.",14,4.368351027024334,4.291927833532358,0.07642319349197635,4

Lt Col Nikolay Gorban, 36, is the 99th known colonel or lieutenant-colonel to be killed in the devastating conflict. It comes as the latest blow to the Russian President, after a missile took out his first female colonel, Olga ‘Kursa’ Kachura just last week. According to InfoNapalm journalist Andrey Pavlushko, Gorban was a commander in the elite FSB Spetsnaz special forces troops. He died “somewhere in Ukraine on August 2,” Mr Pavlushko said. Gorban was believed to be the most senior operative from the feared FSB - once headed by Putin - to die in the five month conflict. An official online citation mourning his loss said he “participated in the conduct of combat activities and special operations both in Russia and abroad"". “In the course of carrying out combat missions, he proved himself to be a courageous and decisive officer,"" it added. “He was proud of his service in the Russian FSB.” In another blow to the Kremlin, Colonel Vasily Kleshchenko, an army aviation commander, was also listed as killed. He was deputy head of the 344th combat use and retraining centre for elite helicopter pilots and snipers. Before the war he ran the world's only aerobatic team based on Berkut combat helicopters based in Russia’s Tver region. He was the 98th known colonel or lieutenant colonel to die. The latest deaths show how Putin’s war is haemorrhaging commanders in his armed forces and security services. Russia has also seen a dozen generals slain in the war. Last week Kremlin forces lost Olga ‘Korsa’ Kachura, 52, Putin’s first woman colonel to die in the Ukraine war. She was a colonel in the forces of Russian puppet state Donetsk People’s Republic, where she commanded a rocket artillery division deployed against Ukraine. Putin posthumously awarded her the Hero of Russia honour “for courage and heroism shown in the performance of military duty”. Kachura recently featured in a documentary on the Russia Today TV channel - which has been banned in the UK for spouting Putin's propaganda - in which she alluded to herself being like a ""she-wolf"".

He said western allies must prepare to keep sending arms to Ukraine ’s military for a long time and vowed they will go to war if Russia encroaches into NATO territory. Stoltenberg, speaking in Norway said: ""It's in our interest that this type of aggressive policy does not succeed. ""What happens in Ukraine is terrible but it would be much worse if there was a war between Russia and NATO.” He warned: ""This is the most dangerous situation in Europe since World War Two. ""If President Putin even thinks of doing something similar to a NATO country as he has done to Georgia, Moldova or Ukraine, then all of NATO will be involved immediately. “This is not just an attack on Ukraine, an independent democratic nation with more than 40 million people, it's also an attack on our values and the world order we want.” The war has led Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership, with the request so far ratified by 23 of the 30 member states, including the US. Stoltenberg added: ""This is not just an attack on Ukraine, an independent democratic nation with more than 40 million people, it's also an attack on our values and the world order we want.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the pressure his troops are under in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine as ""hell"". He spoke of fierce fighting around the town of Avdiivka and the fortified village of Pisky. Frontline Avdivka is the site of astonishing resistance by Ukrainian troops, as witnessed by the Daily Mirror in the months preceding the invasion. Kyiv’s troops there, many of them paratroopers, have held the line in the strategic village, fighting in horrific conditions for five months. Even before the invasion, they were coming under daily fire and mortar bombing daily. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that Russian forces had mounted at least two assaults on Pisky but that its troops repelled them. Ukraine has spent the last eight years fortifying defensive positions in Pisky, viewing it as a buffer zone against Russian-backed forces. Kyiv’s troops have been using western-supplied missile systems to attack Russian forces there in recent weeks. Footage on social media showed bodies, some blown apart, lying beside a road in central Donetsk. Blood stained the pavement close to a bus stop. Eight people were killed and four wounded by the Russian artillery shelling in the town of Toretsk in Donetsk. British sources claimed estimates of Russian deaths in five months of fighting were less than half those from Ukraine officials. They said up to 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war in Ukraine, whilst Kyiv’s official figures suggest Moscow has lost 41,170. UK intelligence assessments say over 50,000 Russian troops are thought to have been wounded since the February invasion. But one official said: “Because the battle has slowed down, the statistics have slowed down as well.” Experts still fear Putin is hellbent on taking over the whole of Ukraine - despite his troops “making slow, incremental gains”. An official said: “We think that Russia has not given up on its maximalist objectives for Ukraine. “Militarily we question how they can achieve those objectives in the near term. “But then what we need to understand better is that Russia is prepared to operate over a much longer time frame than we think in, typically.”",14,5.355681945949868,5.389528604670177,-0.03384665872030901,19

These are our common heroes.” A Ukrainian strike hit a car in which she was travelling, according to reports. She died instantly in the strike. More Ukrainian strikes hit the Drama Theatre in Donetsk early today where the funeral was being held, part of a series of attacks that caused several fatalities, said reports. Videos showed the damage which led to a postponement of the farewell ceremony, which was held later. Simonyan claimed that a hotel where the RT film crew were based had been hit. “By some miracle no one was seriously injured,” she said. Kachura was a career police investigator rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel before switching to the forces of Putin-backed separatists. She served in the 3rd separate motorised rifle brigade Berkut of the 1st Army Corps of the DPR, and commanded a Grad MLRS division in Horlivka. There were 140 gunners under her command. The mother of two had been wounded several times in previous attacks. She had held the rank of colonel in the DPR forces since 2015. Last year Ukraine sentenced her to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property for “participation in a terrorist group or terrorist organisation”.

Maryana Chechelyuk, 22, is believed to have been in the Olenivka detention centre where dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs) were massacred last week. Just two months into her dream job in Mariupol, she was held by Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s forces for being a law enforcement member of her country. Ms Chechelyuk has not been heard from since the massacre in Olenivka, Donetsk Oblast, eastern Ukraine, which each side blames on the other. A total of at least 53 Ukrainian PoWs were killed and around 74 wounded. The young officer had been in the Azovstal steel plant when defenders surrendered to Putin’s forces. On May 1, hundreds of women and children, including Mariana and her sister, were taken out of the factory through a “humanitarian corridor”, which worked for the first time since the beginning of the invasion. They were taken to the village of Bezymyannoye, where the Russians set up a “filtration camp” in a school. Chechelyuk was detained and taken to occupied Donetsk where he was placed in a pre-trial detention centre and later moved to the penal facility at Olenivka. Both sides blame each other for the massacre at the detention centre, with Ukraine flatly denying Russian claims that it hit the facility with HIMAR missiles. Kyiv has claimed Russia launched the attack to destroy evidence of torture on inmates including those with law enforcement or state security links. A delay in allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) permission to visit the site following the Friday attack is seen as suspicious by the Ukrainians. Olga Romanova, head of Russia Behind Bars human rights group, said: “Maryana Chechelyuk, from Mariupol, was put into a filtration camp in May. “After that, she was first sent to a cell in a detention facility in Donetsk, and later to penal colony n.120 in Olenivka.” She said: “It is unknown what has happened to her now.” Romanova said she had found ""testimonies of people who she was helping until she was taken [prisoner]"". The policewoman’s father Vitaly Chechelyuk said he did not understand why the Russians had held his daughter. “Before the war, she worked in the police for only two months as an investigator,” he said. “Why was she detained?” Her younger sister was held separately from her, it is believed.",13,5.558079749412142,3.8036185228998214,1.754461226512321,2

The victim in the video is writhing on the floor of a forest wearing Ukrainian -style camouflage and is shown gagged, with his hands tied behind his back. As he lies on the floor a Russian uniformed soldier with a “Z” patch - the pro-war symbol of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine - uses a box cutter to cut off his clothes and then appears to castrate him while hurling derogatory insults at the victim. While it is unclear when the video was filmed, some have geo-located the video Severodonetsk. The video may be a few weeks old as fighting in that city has not been so heavy in recent weeks. Some have said the man wearing a distinct black fringed hat also appeared in a June broadcast by the Russian state-backed media outlet RT. According to Russian state media featuring him, he is from the ""Akhmat"" unit, named after Chechen warlord Kadyrov's father But legal counsel Natalia Krapiva says that while the crime needs to be investigated and those responsible held fully accountable, ""the risk is that by identifying the wrong person we prevent justice from being served."" Others have said they are sure the video is genuine as and there is no evidence that the video has been manipulated. One of the testicles appears to be placed in a black hat. Some Russian near-military communities have been saying the video came “just on time” for Ukraine to ask for more weapons in the West. To which Ukrainian journalist Illia Ponomarenko said: ""That is just your own insane bloodlust and barbarity digging your own grave, one shovel at a time."" Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun tweeted the footage, saying: ""Russia has to pay for it. Give Ukraine the weapons we need to stop this nightmare once and for all. The world can't pretend like this isn't happening."" The video is another piece of grave evidence of war crimes being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. Prosecutors are doing all they can to hold Russia legally accountable for atrocities and Ukrainian prosecutors have registered over 20,100 potential war crimes.

2022-07-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/blow-vladimir-putin-russias-two-27566988,Blow for Putin as Russia's two top fighter pilots killed in missile strike,"Two of Vladimir Putin's top military pilots have been killed after their motorcade was struck in Ukraine by missiles, it has emerged. Both colonels, the two fighter pilots were reportedly taken down in a missile attack in the Donetsk region aided by Western intelligence. Both were among Russia's most decorated military. Lt-Col Maksim Potyomin, 41, and 54-year-old Colonel Anatoly Stasyukevich were struck by a precision US-supplied HIMARS missile in a strike which is believed to have been targeted. HIMARS is a US rocket launch system loaned to Ukraine which is reportedly causing huge problems for war lord Putin. The recent attack takes the death toll of Russian colonels in the war to 82. The men - both of whom were from pilot dynasties and from the same unit in Krymsk, Krasnodor region, died on July 8 - although the news of the attack was only revealed now. Stasyukevich, chief of staff of the 1st Guards Baranovichi Red Banner mixed aviation division, was a third generation military pilot. News of the two deaths will come as a major blow to Putin, whose losses are believed to be surging once again. Lt-Col Potyomin's death was confirmed by his family - he was married with a daughter, 15, and son, eight. His godmother Natalya Duddinka told Russian press of her ""huge, huge grief"", saying, ""there are no words to express this pain”. Potyomin’s father Alexey Potyomin, chairman of the Volgograd Regional Parachuting Federation, said: “My son’s car was hit by a HIMARS missile, which we have been hearing so much about lately... “His injuries were incompatible with life."" Potyomin has reportedly been posthumously awarded the order of courage by a Putin decree. It comes after Russia claimed their troops had destroyed four HIMARS missile launchers last week - a claim which was rebuked by Ukraine and US defence headquarters the Pentagon. Warmonger Putin meanwhile has been told he has lost a total of 56,572 troops, national guards and fighters from private military companies in the war, according to new toll breakdown, the highest yet. General SVR channel puts Russian losses at a staggering 43,018 in Putin’s armed forces plus 11,437 in private military companies like Wagner, and 2,117 national guards. The total is 56,572, it claimed. The head of the British Armed Forces, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, recently claimed Russia has lost 30 percent of its forces with 50,000 soldiers dead or injured. The new figure relates only to the dead.",14,5.112070710838488,3.669108126766316,1.4429625840721716,3
2022-07-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/brit-plot-entice-russian-pilots-27569110,"Brit plot to entice Russian pilots to turn against Putin foiled, Kremlin claims","Putin's secret services have allegedly foiled an audacious British plot to pay off Russian soldiers and cajole them into defecting and become EU citizens. The FSB, once headed by Vladimir Putin and which now gathers intelligence on behalf of the Russian war lord, claims the plot was hatched by British and Ukrainian intelligence aimed at embarrassing the Kremlin. According to them, Kyiv military intelligence officers “tried to recruit Russian military pilots for a monetary reward and guarantees of obtaining citizenship of one of the EU countries"". Russian pilots hijacking and flying military aircraft into Ukraine and defecting could reportedly make $2million (£1.6m). Putin’s security apparatchiks claimed to have intercepted text and voice communications between “an employee of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry” and “a Russian pilot"". Pictures show $4,000 (£3,300) in cash which reportedly were advance payments in a bid to persuade a Russian pilot to fly his Su-24, Su-34 or nuclear bomber Tu-22MZ to Ukraine, giving a huge propaganda coup to Kyiv. Money was transferred by female couriers who were allegedly detained in Russian city Kazan, it was alleged. Passports from Romania and Slovenia were prepared for the wife of one pilot, guaranteeing them a future in Europe, it is claimed. There were no reports that any Russian pilot had been detained on suspicion of treason, despite claims that they had spoken to a Ukrainian military intelligence officer. Russia appears to claim that one or more pilots colluded to explore the Ukrainian-British plot. “Ukrainian intelligence tried to stimulate Russian pilots with promises to send their wives to EU countries and provide citizenship or a residence permit,” said the FSB. Under the alleged plot, the defecting plane’s navigator would have been poisoned with clonidine. A pilot took a picture of himself in front of a warplane to prove to the Ukrainians he was genuine, it is alleged. The FSB claimed that “British intelligence agencies provided the main support to Ukrainian military intelligence in its operation to hijack Russian military aircraft”. A source was reported as saying: ”It is obvious that the operation itself was carried out with the support of Western, primarily British, intelligence services."" The FSB claimed that chief investigator of the Bellingcat investigative journalism bureau - Christo Grozev - was also involved in the scheme. He has as yet not responded to the allegation, and Bellingcat has denied any links to intelligence organisations. Grozev - an expert on Russia - recently warned that if Putin was toppled “someone who is even more bent on war” could replace him. It was unclear if the FSB account is true or an elaborate staged operation to scare Russian pilots from contemplating defection. The Ukrainian intelligence officer allegedly told a potential defecting pilot: ""I gave you a route. So that you would fly outside populated areas, because populated areas have the highest concentration of MANPADS.” The Russians say this gave them useful information about Ukrainian defences. “Among the secrets revealed were air defence zones in south-eastern Ukraine, charts of airfields in Khmelnytskyi and Chernihiv regions, altitude maps and locations of the largest concentration of units with portable anti-aircraft missile systems,” reported Zvezda TV channel, controlled by the Russian defence ministry. “All this data was provided to the allegedly hijack-ready Russian pilot so that he could fly safely over Ukraine. “A certain Ukrainian air force officer named Oleg called him.”",3,4.366579594852344,4.295171222510909,0.07140837234143493,3

Ruslan Miroshnichenko, the foreign fighters’ commander, confirmed the tragic deaths to Politico and named the victims. Americans killed were Luke 'Skywalker' Lucyszyn and Bryan Young. Miroshnichenko said they were killed alongside Emile-Antoine Roy-Sirois of Canada and Edvard Selander Patrignani of Sweden on July 18. A former US soldier who served with the two Americans told Good Morning America that the team of soldiers faced overwhelming Russian firepower, with 24/7 artillery. ""They could shoot at us but we couldn't even see them"", he said. The soldier's unit was based near Siversk, a town in eastern Donetsk oblast the area where the Kremlin's forces have recently redoubled efforts. Ukrainian forces are still attempting to defend this pocket of territory but are being attacked from two sides as the Russians try to close in and carry out intense shelling and air attacks on front-line settlements. In an attempt to delay Russia ’s advance, the foreign fighters were deployed to the village of Hryhorivka. Miroshnichenko said they were tasked to take their firing positions and clear a ravine where Russian forces were attempting to cross a river. “They did it successfully. But at the end of the mission they were ambushed by Russian tanks,” he said. The commander said the first shell injured Luke and the other three ran to his aid to evacuate him, which is when the second shell hit and killed them all. The State Department spokesperson confirmed the deaths of the two Americans on Friday but did not name them and Luke Lucyszyn's mother, Kathy Lucyszyn, confirmed the death to ABC News.

Tragic Dmytro was waiting at a bus stop with his sister Ksenia on Wednesday when Putin's missile struck. The huge blast severely struck a mosque, a medical facility and a shopping area, according to officials and witnesses at the scene. Dmytro's sister, 15-year-old Ksenia, was seriously injured in the shelling and was rushed to hospital in a grave condition, local authorities reported. Oleh Synehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region, said Dmytro was one of three people killed in Kharkiv on Wednesday. An elderly man and a woman also lost their lives in the blast, but it was not clear whether all three died at the bus stop. Ksenia is now in hospital “seriously wounded” and “fighting for her life”, said Ukrainian chess player Natalia Zhukova, a family friend. Their bereft father Vyacheslav Kubata knelt for two hours by his son’s body. Zhukova said: “His father read prayers for two hours, all this time holding his son's hand. “And at this time Russian and Belarusian chess players are calmly playing chess. Because this is not their war?” The father’s raw pain as he prayed by his dead son was one of the most heart-wrenching images of the almost five months of war. The boy’s mother is Viktoria Kubata, an international women's chess master and chess coach at the Pishak club in Kharkiv. Dmytro studied at the 17th school in Kharkiv, which was destroyed in an earlier Russian attack on 1 June. ""These wonderful kids used to go to the same dance club with my daughter. How scary...

They are among thousands of mutineers flouting orders to fight in Vladimir Putin ’s war in Ukraine. “I am afraid to imagine what will happen next,” said Ilya Kaminsky, 20, a corporal serving with the 11th airborne assault brigade, one of those incarcerated for refusing to fight who has gone public with his demand to be released from the armed forces. The refuseniks are reportedly under strong psychological pressure to halt their protests and go back to the front. They are separated and hidden from other troops so as not to damage further the low morale in Putin’s armed forces. The new evidence of the scale of refuseniks comes as Putin’s authorities are desperately recruiting new “cannon fodder” from jails across Russia. Kaminsky’s wife Diana, 20, bravely defied the authorities releasing a video appeal for him to be set free so he can see his baby daughter Taisiya, now aged three months, for the first time. She fears he will die if he is sent back to the front. The couple have already lost the best man at their wedding Dmitry Bykov, 22, slain in April. “A lot of our close friends have died,” she said. Some 43 soldiers from his brigade have been killed, and as many as 77 from his brigade refused to fight. Lawyer Maxim Grebenyuk said commanders try to “frighten the [refusenik] servicemen and force them to participate in the special military operation”. They are isolated “so that they do not undermine the morale of the unit”. Diana told People of Baikal online media: “I still don't understand what they [the Russian military] are fighting for.” She called it “stupid and unfair” the soldiers put in harms way were mainly - like Ilya - from the east of Russia, not the regions around Moscow. Ilya confirmed to the same publication that he was held in a grim locked garage and fed once a day. Diana told journalists she had been unaware of the atrocities of Russian troops at Bucha or the air strike at Vinnytsia. She released a video in which she said her husband had now been fired from the military for refusing to fight, then locked up in proxy state Luhansk People’s Republic. “Due to his early dismissal from military service, he and others were placed in temporary detention facility No 1 near Luhansk,” she said. “My husband repeatedly wrote requests asking to provide him with parental leave, but these were never approved “Please, I beg you, help me to bring my husband back home, and this father back to his child.” Verstka independent news outlet said that a single detention centre is being formed in the Luhansk region for soldiers who refuse to fight in Ukraine. Currently, there are at least 234 people from different military units in the facility at Bryanka where they are forcibly detained. Some 1,793 Russian servicemen have refused to participate in the war, said Verstka.",14,3.748770986475679,4.630769853243361,-0.8819988667676824,12

The controversial tactic of a double-tap strike is when warplanes attack a site and then return to strike the same area again as people are being rescued from the rubble. A new report published on Thursday by the Syria Justice and Accountability Centre (SJAC) has identified 58 double-tap attacks targeting residential areas between 2013 and 2021. It says that Russian forces, the bomb-wielding ally of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, along with the Syrian regime were shelling sites where paramedics and civilians congregated to help the victims of an initial strike. The aim of the strikes is to kill or maim as many people as possible, as well as destroy civilian infrastructure and cause widespread fear among the civilians. The SJAC team trawled through hours of video footage and images, using open source intelligence to confirm the strikes and build a case of evidence. One attack on a camp in northern Idlib killed around 45 people and left 70 injured. Rescue workers were trying to extinguish a fire in the camp caused by an initial bombing when a second missile struck, killing the rescue workers and a classroom full of children. Then a third missile struck, killing more survivors and civil defence workers. “The civilians rescuing survivors had no time to run,” the report says. The specific locations and times have been uncovered in hope that one day the warmongers may be brought to trial. When Russia entered the conflict in 2015, double-tap strikes ""climbed in frequency and intensity, resulting in broadened destruction"", the report says. Laser-guided weapons, such as the Russian-made Krasnopol, caused even more devastation. The strikes are likely to have broken the Geneva Convention for targeting both medical and humanitarian workers. But Nessma Bashi, legal officer for the SJAC, told the New Arab that while Russia and Syria are state parties to the Geneva Conventions and there is strong evidence of their violations, ""international humanitarian law lacks an enforcement mechanism."" The same brutal tactics are now being used by the Kremlin army in Ukraine. The Red Cross responded to an attack in Kharkiv, administering first aid to two victims when ""several deafening roars signalled the second round of shelling"", The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Bashi told the Washington Post that Syria was the testing ground for it. She continued: “What Ukraine has shown is that double taps are being conducted on a regular basis.”",13,5.170125819302969,4.44148132032497,0.7286444989779994,0

Speaking on Wednesday to Russian state media, Lavrov said their objectives will continue expanding if the West keeps supplying Ukraine with long-range powerful weapons. In the clearest indication yet of Russia's intention to expand the battlefield after five months of the brutal invasion, Lavrov said the nation's military targets now go farther than just the so-called People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. He said the Kremlin's forces will seek to make progress in areas where Russian forces have already made gains, including the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and a “number of other territories.” ""We cannot allow the part of Ukraine controlled by [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky to possess weapons that would pose a direct threat to our territory,"" Lavrov said. The United States’ supply of HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) has allowed Ukraine to successfully attack Russian positions beyond the front lines with much higher accuracy. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu also recently visited soldiers fighting in Donbas and gave them direct orders “to prioritise the destruction” of HIMARs. The order came just after another ammunition depot in Russian-occupied Kherson was destroyed by the weapons. On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced another package of security assistance and John Kirby, the US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said at a briefing that the package would include ""more HIMARS, which the Ukrainians have been using very effectively to make a difference on the battlefield."" This came as Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said that the country was on track to seize more parts of Ukraine. Despite this, the British Military believes that Russia is struggling to sustain effective offensive combat amid heavy losses. The British defence ministry said in an intelligence update that Russia is dealing with ""severe under-manning"" and that this has maybe come to head, likely ""becoming increasingly acute."" ""As well as dealing with severe under-manning, Russian planners face a dilemma between deploying reserves to the Donbas or defending against Ukrainian counterattacks in the southwestern Kherson sector"", it continued.",14,5.933282270003625,4.574667472818412,1.3586147971852132,1

He claimed this was needed to “exclude the possibility of the Kyiv regime inflicting massive rocket and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure and residents of the Donbas and other regions,” said reports in Moscow. It followed an on-the-ground inspection by the loyalist defence minister of Russia ’s war effort and a National Security Council meeting led by Vladimir Putin.

Ksenia Denisyuk, Victoria’s friend, said: “He was a wonder child, bright and kind. Together they went to a clinic. “This was the moment when the terrorist country [Russia] hit the medical centre. Maxim could be identified only with a DNA test. “The whole world should know that Russia is a terrorist state.” Another boy Kirill Pyakhin, eight, also died in the rocket strike, as he waited in a parked car with his uncle, while his grandmother went to get cash from a nearby bank. This was the same attack in which little Liza Dmitrieva, four, was killed in her pushchair and her mother Irina, 33, left gravely wounded. Killed, too, was Alina Kisel, 35, killed as a tree fell due to the missile strike. She was in the backyard of the bank where she worked and “died instantly”. Four other bank workers were hospitalised. Shoigu presented the Gold Star Hero of the Russia medals to Colonel-General Alexander Lapin and Major-General Esedulla Abachev. The Mirror told on Thursday how Russian missiles slammed into a central Ukraine community killing at least 21, including three children and injuring 115, half of them seriously. A baby was also among those killed after three Kalibr cruise missiles smashed into Vinnytsia and several more were hit by Kyivs’ air defences. Rescuers are searching the rubble for survivors amid fears a further 46 people are missing and may also have been killed. At least 50 cars were set ablaze by the explosions, which left locals reeling in shock over Russia ’s latest missile strike. Missiles were fired from submarines in the Black Sea, escalating fears Russia is increasingly focusing on killing civilians. Vinnytsia is 430 miles from the east Ukraine frontline and the atrocity follows a string of mass casualty missile strikes.",17,3.1515264813675894,3.6623614671699602,-0.5108349858023709,24

Paul Urey, who was in captivity in the so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), died on Sunday ""due to illness and stress"", the Ombudsman of the DPR Daria Morozova claimed on her Telegram social media channel. His family also confirmed the death to Sky News, saying he passed away five days ago ""due to sickness"", according to information they received from the Foreign Office. ""Official representatives of the UK (including the Foreign Office, the embassy in the Russian Federation, and members of the British Parliament) were notified of the capture of Paul Urey. Also, at his request, the relevant information was transferred to foreign media. However, no reaction from the UK did not follow,"" she wrote. Mr Urey, 45, was charged with ""mercenary activities"" by investigators in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), recognised only by Russia and Syria, in eastern Ukraine before his death. He is believed to be from Culcheth, Lancashire, in the north of England and was captured by the Russian military along with fellow British national Dylan Healy, 22, in April. Mr Urey was questioned about his motives for being in Ukraine on Russian TV while handcuffed. He explained he previously travelled to Iraq, and Afghanistan between 2008 and 2010, as well as to Libya to ""help the revolution."" Mr Urey said he wanted to see if the refugee crisis was really as bad as the news in the UK portrays it, as he did not believe it was. He called the British Government “corrupt”. Mr Urey’s mother Linda saw the video and said: ""This is physically my son, but he is not acting in his natural way; his words are too matter of fact and his facial expressions make me not believe what he is saying. “Normally he speaks fast and to the point. “I know my son like every mother, and this is not him being natural.” Russia claims Urey had been suffering from diabetes and respiratory, kidney and cardiovascular issues but that they gave him ""appropriate medical assistance."" They continued: ""However, given the diagnoses and stress, he passed away."" It is said that Healy and Urey were detained at a Russian military checkpoint in the Zaporizhzhia region in late April while evacuating a Ukrainian woman and two children from the war zone. Founder of Presidium Network, Dominik Byrne, said: ""This is worrying news, however, this has not been verified by any authority yet and investigations are ongoing to determine the truth.""

Homes were obliterated in the blast along with an office block and a medical centre in the central city of Vinnytsia, according to national police.

Officers said 90 people sought medical attention and around 50 of them were in a serious condition. ""There are wounded and dead, among them a small child,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Telegram. ""What is this, if not an open act of terrorism?"" Grey smoke was seen rising from the twisted remains of burn-out cars and smouldering rubble in photographs released by the State Emergency Service. One image showed an abandoned, overturned pram lying on the street. ""This is the act of Russian terror, 20 people died as of now,"" Zelensky said. ""Today in the morning, Russian missiles hit our city of Vinnytsia, an ordinary, peaceful city. ""Cruise missiles hit two community facilities, houses were destroyed, a medical centre was destroyed, the cars and trams were on fire."" The Russian defence ministry did not immediately comment on the reports from Vinnytsia. Russia, which invaded Ukraine on February 24, has denied deliberately targeting civilians. Vinnytsia lies about 125 miles southwest of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and is far from the main frontlines in eastern and southern Ukraine. The missile strike hit the car park of the nine-storey ""Yuvelirniy"" office block at around 10.50 am, the State Emergency Service said. ""Unfortunately, there is probably no chance of finding anyone who survived under the rubble,"" a senior regional emergency service official told Ukrainian television. In a comment on Twitter, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia of committing ""another war crime"". ""We will put Russian war criminals on trial for every drop of Ukrainian blood and tears,"" he wrote. Russia denies its forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

Rescuers are searching the rubble for survivors amid fears a further 46 people are missing and may also have been killed.

Missiles were fired from submarines in the Black Sea, escalating fears Russia is increasingly focusing on killing civilians. Vinnytsia is 430 miles from the east Ukraine frontline and the atrocity follows a string of mass casualty missile strikes. Moscow is thought to be frustrated over a lack of gains in month five of the war and their attacks in Donetsk are faltering under a wave of Ukrainian rocket salvos. Tonight Ukraine’s furious President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a brief statement: “What is this - if not an open act of terrorism?” He added: “Cruise missiles hit two community facilities, houses were destroyed, a medical centre was destroyed, cars and trams were on fire.” Footage revealed thick black smoke pouring out of a tall building, cars burnt-out and the twisted remains of vehicles and smouldering rubble. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter : “This is terrorism. Deliberate murder of civilians to spread fear. “Russia is a terrorist state and must be legally recognised as such.” The UK MoD said Russia is making little headway in Putin’s war wish-list of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It said: “They have achieved no significant territorial advances over the last 72 hours and are in danger of losing momentum built up.” There were also reports that Russian forces are so mired in the war that in the east they are importing concrete pills boxes to dig in and defend against Ukrainian attacks. Kyiv's forces have been bolstered by the supply of multiple launch rocket systems which are proving increasingly deadly against Russian troops. Western-supplied long-range weapons and 155mm “smart” shells are hitting Russian ammo dumps and supply lines. Ukrainian General Oleksiy Gromov said the new weapons were critical to Ukrainian strikes and singled out U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) that Kyiv began receiving last month. He said: “We are decreasing the enemy’s potential, hitting his logistics supply, hitting his ammunition... The enemy is being forced to change its system for supplying ammunition and fuel. “Right now the enemy is looking at placing brigade-level ammunition dumps no closer than 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the front line, and depots at corps-level at distances of over 150 km.” Russian military trucks were spotted delivering the blockhouses to invaded areas within Ukraine. Vladimir Putin ’s army has imposed an “operational pause” on exhausted troops. At least 14 Russian Colonels have died in five months of fighting as well as a dozen of Putin’s Generals, in a staggering blow to Putin’s military. Ukraine officials say the total troop losses for Russia are edging towards the bloody milestone of 40,000, at 37,870 and counting. Other Russian losses, which soar by the day, include 1667 tanks, 219 warplanes, 188 helicopters and 678 drones. And Kyiv’s SBU spy and counter-intelligence agency has revealed it is intercepting increasing mobile phone conversations between Russian troops complaining about the war.

Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who were fighting with the Ukrainian Army, had been defending the city of Mariupol when they were captured by Vladimir Putin ’s forces in April. They, along with another defendant, Moroccan Brahim Saadoun, were sentenced last month after what Western politicians described as a show trial by the pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk People’s Republic. A statement from officials in the breakaway region of Ukraine reportedly said that they were “preparing a place for their execution” which would be by firing squad and without any prior warning. DPR spokesman Denys Pushilin added: ""Everything is ready. It won’t be public."" The breakaway state has also defended its right to impose capital punishment. DPR Foreign Minister Natalia Nikonorova said that the two Britons were sentenced to death for fighting as ""mercenaries"" when she was asked if capital punishment would harm the territory's attempt to be recognised internationally. ""We consider that mercenary activity is indeed a terrible crime because people, for a reward, come to another country to kill other people, despite having no personal goals connected to the conflict in question,"" she said. ""Yes, it is the highest measure of punishment, but it is in our legislation and it is not linked to the further process of recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic by other states."" The appeals by Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner are pending after they were given the death penalty. Their relatives say they are soldiers who were under contract to the Ukrainian army and are therefore entitled to the protection of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war. So far, only Russia and Syria have recognised the DPR as independent, but Nikonorova said it was also in discussions with the ambassador of North Korea. It has opened an embassy, in a building close to Moscow's Garden Ring artery, during a low-key affair with no senior Russian government figures present last Tuesday. DPR officials' plans for a grand ceremony had been put on hold because of the grave situation in eastern Ukraine, which is the main focus of the current fighting. ""We can't celebrate here when our countrymen are dying,"" ambassador Olga Makeyeva said.

He said this means that Putin has run out of strength to attack. Yakovina continued: ""He's going to dig in. I am sure that soon Moscow will be shouting about peace and the desire to ‘stop the terrible war that the West started’. “At the same time, Ukraine will be accused of bloodthirsty madness and senseless aggression. “I can directly hear these cries of TV propagandists and see these articles of Putin's supporters in the West: ‘It's time to force Zelensky to start negotiations’, ‘Russia wants only peace’, ‘Kyiv insists on continuing the senseless massacre’ and all that stuff.” He said that to prevent this the West must immediately increase the volume of arms supplies to Ukraine.

Corporal Anastasia Savitskaya, 35, was reported to have died on yet another day of appalling war losses of high-ranking officers in Vladimir Putin’s forces. The female soldier, a married mother-of-two said to be a “real hero”, was buried today in her native Volgograd. “The deceased became the first servicewoman who died during the special military operation,” said Alexander Strukov, the local veterans’ leader. A friend said: “She had dreamed of serving in the army since childhood, and signed a contract at the age of 18.” Going to war in Ukraine “was her choice”. Her bereft husband - a former soldier, not named - said at her funeral: “How will I carry on living now? “Why did I let you go there? “Beloved, beautiful, best.” Unlike some Western countries it remains rare for Russian servicewomen to go to war. A eulogy at her funeral said: “A female warrior has always been an exception to the rule. “But Anastasia, having mastered the ‘home’ front, went without fear to a dangerous special operation, accomplishing a double feat.” Sturkov said: “I express my condolences on the loss of the glorious daughter of Russia. “Fighting and female servicemen seem incompatible, but fate has decreed so. “We are both grieving and proud.” Her commander Major Sergey Minochkin said: “She went to collect humanitarian aid and then went to Ukraine herself. “The command of the unit expresses its deepest condolences to her relatives. “For us, she will always be a real hero.” Separately, today has seen the disclosure of multiple losses of colonels. Among the latest was Colonel Nikolai Kornelyuk, 49, an artillery commander with the Volgograd 20th Guards Motor Rifle Division. Lt-Col Anatoly Vasin was also killed.

Ukrainians today launched a massive rocket strike on a Russian cache close to the Black Sea port of Kherson, which is occupied by invaders. The defenders’ action in Nova Kakhova in the south was part of Ukraine’s counter-offensive intended to smash Moscow’s stranglehold on its Black Sea ports and free up its maritime trade. Moscow’s commanders have diverted many troops from the south to the east to join in the drive for the Donbas region of Ukraine. But repeated hits on Moscow’s ammo stores may mean Russian forces have to delay their drive to take over the area. The attack on the ammunition store was made possible by a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System sent by the US. Ukraine has recently been sent eight of the HIMARS rocket systems. Using them, Ukrainian troops can attack invaders from 70 miles away. More long-range weaponry from NATO countries is on its way. The depot attack came as the death toll from Russia ’s weekend missile strike on a Donetsk apartment block rose to 41. There was a nationwide alert that Russia is increasing attacks on civilian targets. Nine other civilians were killed and two more wounded in Donetsk, the southern half of the Donbas region. Russian rocket attacks targeted the cities of Sloviansk and Toretsk, where a nursery was hit, the Kyiv presidential office said. The British military said today that Russia was continuing to make “small, incremental gains” in Donetsk. Heavy fighting there last week led to the province’s governor urging 350,000 remaining residents to flee. In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, Russian strikes hit residential buildings, killing four civilians and wounding nine, local officials said.

Vladimir Putin's Uragan missile obliterated the residential home in the Donetsk region, leading to the building's collapsing. The regional emergency services are still working to pull survivors from the rubble. They gave the latest death toll from the strike in the town of Chasiv Yar as 15 people, with rescue work still going on. More lives are in danger as Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram that at least 30 more people could be trapped under the ruins. He said: ""The rescue operation is underway. Rescuers were able to bring out six dead and five injured. ""At least 30 others are under the rubble' of the four-storey building. The building was partially destroyed, and rescuers with a mechanical digger were clearing the area. ""The rescuers have so far been able to establish contact with two people underneath the rubble."" The Ukrainian emergency service said on Facebook that rescuers were in contact with three people alive under the bricks. ""During the rescue operation, 15 bodies were found at the scene and five people were pulled out of the rubble,' alive,"" they said. Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine's president, said in a Telegram post that the strike was ""another terrorist attack,"" and that Russia should be designated as a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" as a result. Russia, which says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine, denies targeting civilians. Ukraine also reported clashes with Russian troops on fronts in the east and south, as the United States sought to marshal international support in opposing Moscow's invasion. Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the strike on the apartment building took place on Saturday evening in the town of Chasiv Yar. Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, parts of which were held by pro-Russian separatists before the conflict began in February, comprise the eastern industrial region of the Donbas that Russia is seeking to take over. Russian forces attacked Ukrainian positions near the town of Sloviansk in Donetsk but were forced to withdraw, Ukraine's military said, adding that Russian forces had launched a cruise missile attack on the northeastern city of Kharkiv from their side of the border. It gave no details of damage or casualties. Luhansk region Governor Serhiy Gaidai said Russian forces were gathering in the area of the village of Bilohorivka, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Sloviansk. ""The enemy is ... shelling the surrounding settlements, carrying out air strikes, but it is still unable to quickly occupy the entire Luhansk region,"" he said on Telegram. ""During the last night alone, the Russians launched seven artillery barrages and four rocket strikes."" Russia claimed control over all of Luhansk province last weekend. Russia's Tass news agency, meanwhile, cited pro-Russian separatists as saying Ukrainian forces had fired an artillery barrage into residential districts of the city of Donetsk. Ukrainian military spokesman were not immediately available for comment. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday the Russian army had attacked civilians on purpose. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24 in what it called a ""special operation"" to degrade its military capabilities and root out what it calls dangerous nationalists. Kyiv and its Western allies call the invasion an unprovoked land grab. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw.

As well switching to using KH-22 anti-ship weapons to blast shopping malls they have now started redirecting ground-to-air-defence missiles. It has led to escalating fears more civilians will be hit and killed as inappropriate missiles are notoriously inaccurate. In Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, the city has been hammered with devastating blasts from Russian anti-air weapons. On Friday morning Kim Vitaly, head of Mykolaiv region, announced the new threat after investigating the new strikes. Using the term “Rashist” which Ukrainians use to reference Russia ’s ruthless expansionism he said: “As you know, the Rashists are increasingly shelling Mykolaiv and the region. “On the morning of July 8, the city was also shelled. “The rocket attacks became more frequent, we started trying to find out how it happened and why.” He said the Russians: “... are remaking S-300 missiles, there are a lot of them, they put GPS on them to shoot at the ground, it is not accurate because of that. “And they shoot 12 rockets each, they took on villages, in particular Berezneguvate.” He said that large buildings: “ . . .are being smashed, so be careful, listen to the air alarm.” It follows an attack last month on a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine’s Kremenchuk city which killed at least 20 people. That strike involved the firing of a KH-22 rocket from a Russian bomber, usually aimed at large maritime target like aircraft carriers. One UK source said: “Increasingly Russia seems to be falling back on inaccurate weaponry, simply to cause terror and mass damage. “Using redirected ground to air missiles to hit a ground target will be and is being very inacurate so there is little strategy except to kill indiscriminately. “It makes little strategic sense but does cause alarm. It seems this is a developing pattern that Russia is throwing everything it has to hand at Ukraine.” But on Friday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his troops remain strong and defiant. He said he had visited frontline troops in central Ukraine and added: “Spoke with our defenders, presented them with awards. “Their mood is determined, it’s in their eyes- confidence in our victory. “Thank you for fighting for the freedom of Ukraine.”",17,4.050971766253943,5.26328655971354,-1.2123147934595977,24

News of the unit came amid reports of plummeting moral among soldiers fighting the Kremlin's war. Some were said to have refused orders or even turned their weapons on their countrymen and gunned down Russian planes. In May, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said on its Telegram channel that commanders have been visiting captured and surrendered Russian troops ""in order to select those who wish to serve"".

Many feared Russians seizing control of the island and Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov previously told the BBC that if Putin's troops succeeded in occupying Snake Island, or Zmiinyi Island, they would end up ""controlling the sea, land and air in the north-west part of the Black Sea and in the south of Ukraine "". Fresh footage shows the destruction of infrastructure on the remote island. Earlier pictures purporting to show the Ukrainian flag on Snake Island in fact showed a scene from before the war. Russian forces fled from Snake Island on 30 June after heavy Ukrainian bombardment, but Putin’s naval forces remain in the seas around it. Ukraine portrayed the retreat as a humiliation for Russia. Moscow claimed it was a “gesture of goodwill” and ""demonstrated to the world community that the Russian Federation does not prevent the efforts of the UN to organise a humanitarian corridor for the export of agricultural products from the territory of Ukraine”.",14,3.5927213080470146,4.939208459409336,-1.3464871513623216,20

It comes as three men face the death penalty in neighbouring Belarus - the only European country to still carry out capital punishment - for ‘blowing up a train line’ used to move Russian troops and weapons. A further 57 could also be executed under draconian new Belarusian laws. A rapid rise in attacks on Russian rail links - including the Trans-Siberian line - are seen as unprecedented action by opposition groups to undermine the military operation in Ukraine. Some 63 freight trains were derailed in Russia from March to June 2022, reported The Insider independent media outlet. “This is almost one-and-a-half times more than in the same period last year,” said a report.

A map shows cases of suspected rail sabotage as well as attacks on military enlistment offices which have been rising, while it is also suspected cases have been hushed up. In one example, 19 freight carriages were derailed, causing huge delays on the Trans-Siberian line, which has been used throughout the war by Putin to move troops and weaponry. Anti-war activists took responsibility for this ""sabotage"" on 29 June. A stop the war group has also claimed responsibility for rail attacks in Pskov, Rostov, Orenburg, Chelyabinsk and Krasnoyarsk regions among others. Neighbouring Belarus has so far charged three suspected rail saboteurs under treason, terrorism and extremism laws that make it likely they will be executed if they are convicted of interrupting the movements of Putin’s war machine. These are the first pictures of “saboteurs” Denis Dikun, 29, Dmitry Ravich, 33, and Oleg Molchanov, 52, accused of setting fire to a rail installation. To opposition and anti-war groups, such people are seen as heroes for seeking to disrupt Putin’s war plans. Senior official Uladzimir Shyshko said: “The investigation established that the criminal actions of the participants in this case, including support for a foreign organisation in causing harm to the national security of the Republic of Belarus, constitute an act of betrayal of the fatherland - treason.” The law was recently changed to allow for the death penalty in such cases as Minsk dictator Alexander Lukashenko backs Putin in his invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Some 57 others“train terrorists” are under investigation by the KGB secret police as “train terrorists” and all could face execution by shooting. Belarus is the only country in Europe where the death penalty is carried out. Dikun was alleged to be a member of an extremist group who recruited the two other men to an act which caused around £15,000 worth of damage at Zherd-Ostankovichi station, Gomel region, four days after Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in February. There were claims he faced violence before confessing. Their action was aimed at “disrupting the schedule of Russian trains with equipment and weapons”, said one report. ""Committing these actions, the men may face a maximum punishment up to the death penalty,” said the committee. The trio were detained on 4 March. Dukin is the brother of co-accused Ravich’s wife Natalia. Molchanov is the father of Dukin’s girlfriend Alisa Molchanova. Both women were initially detained and then released.",13,4.8238323685321784,5.056016512513424,-0.23218414398124576,3

The Kremlin's capture of the strategic city of Lysychansk in the Donbas region has given Russia's military a platform to mount an assault on neighbouring Donetsk, the MoD predicts. But defence chiefs say the victory is unlikely to change Russia's performance in the conflict despite having given Putin control of almost all of Luhansk. The MoD said today: ""The battle for the Donbas has been characterised by slow rates of advance and Russia ’s massed employment of artillery, levelling towns and cities in the process. “The fighting in Donetsk Oblast will almost certainly continue in this manner.” The conquering of Lysychansk has allowed Putin to boast domestically of getting ever closer to what he set out as the original purpose of the war - ""liberating the Donbas"". Throughout the war the tyrant has claimed pro-Russians in eastern Ukraine were being systematically victimised and oppressed. Want the latest updates from across the globe? Sign up to receive our daily World News newsletter HERE Defence chiefs pinned co-ordination between two Russian military groups as the reason behind the victory. Mentioning Ukraine's performance, the MoD said the troops had ""likely largely withdrawn in good order"", adding that it was in line with ""existing [military] plans"". The city's capture on Sunday completed the conquest of industrialised eastern region of Luhansk, one of two regions in Donbas which has become the site of the biggest battle in Europe in generations. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties in the fight for Luhansk, particularly during the siege of the twin cities of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. Both cities have been left in ruins by relentless Russian bombardment. ""The city doesn't exist anymore,"" said Nina, a young mother who has fled Lysychansk to take refuge in the central city of Dnipro. ""It has practically been wiped off the face of the Earth. There is no humanitarian aid distribution centre, it has been hit. The building which used to house the centre does not exist any more. Just like many of our houses."" Ukrainian forces on Tuesday took up new defensive lines in Donetsk, where they still control major cities, while Putin told his troops to ""absolutely rest and recover their military preparedness"", while units in other areas keep fighting. Russian forces shelled the towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk overnight, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk. ""They are now also the main line of assault for the enemy,"" he said of the towns. ""There is no safe place without shelling in Donetsk region."" Since the outset of the conflict, Russia has demanded that Ukraine hand both Luhansk and Donetsk to pro-Moscow separatists, which have declared independent statelets. ""This is the last victory for Russia on Ukrainian territory,"" Oleksiy Arestovych, adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video posted online. ""These were medium-sized cities. And this took from 4th April until 4th July -- that's 90 days. So many losses."" Arestovych said besides the battle for Donetsk, Ukraine was hoping to launch counter offensives in the south of the country. ""Taking the cities in the east meant that 60% of Russian forces are now concentrated in the east and it is difficult for them to be redirected to the south,"" he said. ""And there are no more forces that can be brought in from Russia. They paid a big price for Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk."" Some military experts reckoned the hard fought victory had brought Russian forces little strategic gain, and the outcome of what has been dubbed the ""battle of the Donbas"" remained in the balance. ""I think it's a tactical victory for Russia but at an enormous cost,"" said Neil Melvin of the RUSI think tank in London. He compared the battle to the huge fights for meagre territorial gains that characterized World War One. ""This has taken 60 days to make very slow progress,"" he said. ""The Russians may declare some kind of victory, but the key war battle is still yet to come."" Melvin said the decisive battle for Ukraine was likely to take place not in the east, where Russia is mounting its main assault, but in the south, where Ukraine has begun a counter-offensive to recapture territory. ""This is where we see the Ukrainians are making progress around Kherson. There are counter-attacks beginning there and I think it's most likely that we'll see the momentum swing to Ukraine as it tries to then mount a large-scale counter-offensive to push the Russians back,"" he said. Early on Tuesday, Russian rockets hit Mykolaiv, a southern city on the main highway between Kherson and Odesa, the mayor, Oleksandr Senkevych, said. Zelenskiy said on Monday that despite Ukraine's withdrawal from Lysychansk, its troops continued to fight. ""The armed forces of Ukraine respond, push back and destroy the offensive potential of the occupiers day after day,"" Zelenskiy said in a nightly video message. ""We need to break them. It is a difficult task. It requires time and superhuman efforts. But we have no alternative.""",14,4.948205214618412,4.059044424054294,0.8891607905641177,25

Vladimir Solovyov cruelly suggested it would be a “gesture of goodwill” to demolish key infrastructure throughout the country. During his latest television diatribe, Solovyov appeared enraged that Russia's recent progress Ukraine is limited to completing the invasion of Luhansk region. Russian defence chiefs earlier this week called their retreat from Snake Island in the Black Sea amid sustained attack from the Ukrainians a “gesture of goodwill”. The move angered many in Putin's circle who saw it as a humiliating failure. Solovyov is normally seen as spouting Putin’s views but there is increasing anger among some hard-line hawks in Moscow at what they see as the slow pace, and limited ambitions, of the Kremlin’s land grab. “Is it possible to f***ing destroy the government district in central Kyiv - as a gesture of goodwill?” he demanded on state-owned Rossiya 1 channel. “A gesture of goodwill - in connection with the supply of a large amount of NATO equipment. “Is it possible to finally destroy the entire civilian, military, [and] transport infrastructure in the west of Ukraine? “As a gesture of goodwill, destroy all [electricity] substations, television towers.” He demands that Russian generals should “completely deprive the country of electricity, water supply, communications - as a gesture of goodwill.” His blast comes as the area around the United Kingdom’s embassy in Moscow is to be renamed Luhansk People's Republic [LPR] Square in a move intended to embarrass the British. Britain does not recognise either the LPR, or Donetsk People’s Republic. Strategic Snake Island in the Black Sea had been in dispute since early in the war when Ukrainian defenders famously told an approaching Russian warship to ""go f*** yourself”. The Russian cruiser - the Moskva - was later sunk in a Ukrainian missile strike, perhaps Vladimir Putin's biggest single humiliation of the war.

The organisation allowed the two Nordic countries to to join the nuclear-armed alliance once allied parliaments ratify the decision, the most significant expansion of the alliance since the mid-1990s. ""This is truly an historic moment,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said alongside the foreign ministers of the two countries. ""With 32 nations around the table, we will be even stronger."" The protocol means Helsinki and Stockholm can participate in NATO meetings and have greater access to intelligence but will not be protected by the NATO defence clause that an attack on one ally is an attack against all until ratification. That is likely to take up to a year. This becomes one of the biggest shifts in European security in decades, after Putin's invasion of Ukraine pushed Helsinki and Stockholm to drop their tradition of neutrality. Putin has made several veiled threats against the alliance since the start of the invasion, and some more overt to NATO countries like Lithuania and Poland. Lithuania choked off a rail corridor from Russia to its Kaliningrad Oblast exclave - reducing access to basic goods including construction materials, metal and coal. Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said the transport ""blockade"" would ""seriously affect the people of Lithuania"" and Russia would retaliate soon. He branded Lithuania's move ""hostile"" as he vowed retaliation which will have a ""serious negative impact on the Lithuanian population"". NATO's 30 ambassadors and Stoltenberg stood together for a photo in which the foreign ministers of Sweden and Finland held up their signed protocols, before breaking out into applause. ""Thank you for your support! Now the process of ratification by each of the allies begins,"" Swedish Foreign Minister AnnLinde said on Twitter. ""Look forward to working together in ensuring our collective security,"" she said. However, Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan warned last Thursday at a NATO summit in Madrid that said Finland and Sweden must first keep the promises made to Turkey in a deal or ratification will not be sent to the Turkish parliament. After weeks of diplomacy, Erdogan and his Finnish and Swedish counterparts agreed on a series of security measures to allow the two Nordic countries to overcome the Turkish veto that Ankara imposed in May due to its concerns about terrorism. According to the signed memorandum, Finland and Sweden pledged not to support the Kurdish militant PKK and YPG groups or the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, which Ankara says staged a 2016 coup attempt and which it labels a terrorist organisation with the acronym FETO. Last week a statement after the alliance's summit in Madrid announced NATO's 30 allies had made the decision after Turkey lifted its veto. There, they also agreed to formally treat Russia as the ""most significant and direct threat to the allies' security"". ""Today, we have decided to invite Finland and Sweden to become members of NATO,"" NATO leaders said in their declaration.",29,6.174843382258146,5.702091095225509,0.4727522870326375,10

Aiden Aslin, 28, was captured in the besieged city of Mariupol while defending Ukraine. After joining the Ukrainian marines in 2018, he had been fighting with his unit when they were forced to surrender to the Russians after running out of food and ammunition. Mr Aslin was handed the death penalty for ""mercenary activities"" at a court in the Russian-backed breakaway Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine But he argues he was not a mercenary but a member of Ukraine’s armed forces. The Brit, from Newark in Nottinghamshire, shared a picture of himself taking his oath to serve in the Ukrainian army on social media. A lawyer for fellow British fighter Shaun Pinner, 48, Yulia Tserkovnikova, launched his appeal last week. Both men were sentenced to the death penalty, being shot by a firing squad, in an verdict last month after a rushed trial when key witnesses did not appear. Few observers expect them to succeed at what is seen as a new stage of a show trial, leaving them only to plead for a pardon to the pro-Putin ruler of the DPR, Denis Pushilin. But Pushilin has already said he sees no grounds to grant a pardon. Their best hope is that a prisoner exchange leads to them being swapped with Russian soldiers captured in Ukraine. ""A cessation appeal against the verdict was filed today,"" said Pavel Kosovan who represented Mr Aslin on Monday. The Britons were sentenced to death along with Moroccan Brahim Saadoun for ""mercenary activities"" by fighting for Ukraine. Mr Aslin’s lawyer said the appeal concerned only some of the charges - those carrying the death penalty - such as his alleged effort to bring about ""a seizure of power by force"" in the DPR. The purpose of the appeal was to ""avoid execution”. Two more British captives in the hands of the DPR have been indicted on charges that could lead to the death penalty. Andrew Hill, 35, and Dylan Healy, 22, face an upcoming trial. Hill, a father of four from Plymouth, was allegedly a “mercenary” fighting for the Ukrainians. Healy, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was previously described as a civilian volunteer seeking to evacuate people from war-ravaged Ukraine.",13,6.562231542841327,7.707582815784765,-1.1453512729434374,23

The then President regularly slammed European members of NATO for failing to meet the alliance’s spending target to pump 2% of GDP in their armed forces. Speaking to the British think tank Policy Exchange, Mr Pompeo added: “They weren’t serious about confronting the realities that we can now see demonstrably, but that we all knew that the risk existed, and it’s very much, in my judgement, that weakness that drove what it is we are seeing play out in eastern Europe today, in the eastern Ukraine.”",29,5.258886709954668,6.27916528220822,-1.0202785722535523,28

At least ten were wounded including a child according to reports. Senior Russian senator Andrei Klishas accused Ukraine of shelling a residential area of Belgorod and demanded retaliation. ""The death of civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Belgorod are a direct act of aggression on the part of Ukraine and require the most severe - including a military - response,” he said. Videos showed the carnage in the Russian city, some 25 miles from the Ukrainian border. Supporters of Vladimir Putin and pro-Russian media called the Ukrainian attack an “act of terrorism”. “It is obvious that this act of terrorism was committed in response to the liberation of Lysychansk by Russian troops,” reported Readovka. ""It is significant that each time the attacks on Russia and the liberated territories are becoming stronger, while there are no military or critical infrastructure facilities in the vicinity of the explosions.” Ukrainian attacks were also reported on Kursk and Melitopol. Readovka claimed that US-supplied HIMARS missiles could have been used, contrary to an agreement when the weapons were supplied to Ukraine. The report stated: “The only way out of this situation is retaliatory strikes against the positions of the armed forces of Ukraine, along with command centres and warehouses with Western weapons. “The terrorist state ‘Ukraine' must be completely demilitarised.” Air defences, meanwhile, claimed to have shot down two incoming attacks, but a third got through, according reports. Russian sources said 11 apartment blocks were damaged and 39 private houses in Belgorod. Dozens of homes were damaged by blasts near the city which borders Ukraine, its regional governor claimed. Ukrainian forces are said to have attacked a Russian military base in occupied southern Ukraine. Vyacheslav Gladkov, Belgorod Governor reported a number of explosions in the city of nearly 400,000 some 40km (25 miles) north of the border with Ukraine. At least 11 apartment buildings and 39 houses were damaged, including five which destroyed, Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app. Moscow has accused Kyiv of several attacks on Belgorod and other regions bordering Ukraine since Russia's February 24 invasion. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility but described the incidents as payback and ""karma"" for Russia's actions. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine and Russian accounts could not be independently verified. The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces, however, said its air force had flown some 15 sorties ""in virtually all directions of hostilities"".

Dr Paul Maddrell, an international history and international relations lecturer at Loughborough University, has advised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to either build an arsenal or buy weapons in from other nations. It comes as the war in Ukraine rages on, with four months of fighting leading to the deaths of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers during the relentless bombardment of the country's cities. Dr Maddrell believes Vladimir Putin's actions are designed to dismember Ukraine, weaken its military and reverse the expansion of NATO. And he believes the establishment of a Ukrainian nuclear arsenal could be the best method of preventing Putin from continuing to pursue those goals, the Daily Star reports. Speaking on Loughborough University's Besieged: A podcast about Putin’s Invasion of Ukraine, Dr Maddrell said: ""If I were the president of Ukraine, I'd strongly be considering developing nuclear weapons. Ukraine had nuclear weapons in the 1990s when the Soviet Union collapsed. ""There were nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory, which became Ukraine's and Ukraine agreed to give them up to denuclearise Europe and make it a safer place. Well, if it had kept those nuclear weapons, Putin would not have invaded because he would have faced a nuclear attack on his country. ""Zelensky, if he's prevented from joining NATO, may well think that the only way forward is to develop nuclear weapons – as he may do."" The lecturer added that he felt the US might sell Ukraine nuclear weapons at a reduced price and that he felt Putin's actions in Ukraine had damaged Russia's chances of becoming a satellite state of China.

The key piece of land in the Black Sea became a symbol of Ukraine ’s resistance at the beginning of the war when a demand for surrender was met with the phrase “Go f**** yourself”. Despite Russian claims their retreat was an “act of good will” Ukraine confirmed Moscow’s troops fled quickly after being picked up by high-speed boats. An official at Ukraine’s Presidential office in Kyiv, Andriy Yermak, called the declaration a “complete fake”. He added: “The Armed Forces of Ukraine knocked out the Russians from the island.” Kremlin war-chiefs had desperately tried to install anti-aircraft protection guns on the island after a string of devastating attacks on Russian warships. The key setback for Russia may mean vital Ukraine may be closer to re-starting crucial grain exports from its coast, averting a global food shortage disaster. Ukrainians were forced to give up the island, which guards the Black Sea’s north-west corner, early on in the conflict but have pummelled occupying Russians there for four months, forcing the retreat. However, experts fear it is “early days” for the opening up of Ukraine’s ports as Russian warships still dominate the Black Sea and can attack from a stand-off position. One British former military intelligence officer said: “There are many obstacles facing Ukraine in the coming weeks before they will manage to free up access through the Black Sea. “They will become increasingly dependent on missile systems which are making their way to the frontline and have been supplied by the West.” As many as 12 of Moscow’s landing ships, carrying tanks and infantry are feared to be lined up in the Black Sea ready to strike at Ukraine’s coastline. Today the Akula, a Russian D-106 Ondatra-class landing ship, was destroyed after hitting a mine close to the now ruined port of Mariupol. And pro-Russian separatists from the Donetsk People’s Republic confirmed 144 Ukrainian prisoners had been swapped with Kyiv, many of them suffering terrible wounds including amputations. Meanwhile, the European Court of Human Rights has ordered Russia not to kill two “death penalty” Britons captured fighting for Ukraine. Earlier this month, a court in the self-proclaimed DPR sentenced Aiden Aslin, 28 and Shaun Pinner, 48, to death for “mercenary activities”. The ECHR has issued an order for interim measures, telling Russia it “should ensure that the death penalty imposed on the applicants was not carried out; ensure appropriate conditions of their detention; and provide them with any necessary medical assistance and medication”. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said “the fate of these mercenaries” was a matter for the DPR, adding: “Russia no longer complies with the prescriptions of the ECHR.” Both Aslin and Pinner had joined the Ukraine military years before the war and both have Ukrainian wives. They had been deployed to the city of Mariupol where Ukrainian soldiers in their brigade surrendered April. The UK Foreign Office said: “We are doing everything we can to support the men and are in close contact with and helping their families. “We condemn the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes and have raised this with Russia.”",14,4.035258089925181,4.531792205626957,-0.49653411570177575,20

The wives said: ""Since January 2022, the soldiers are in field conditions, many of them suffering colds. ""They require medical checks because of being in difficult military conditions. Note that many of the servicemen have not had a holiday for over a year.” The men are from military unit 46108 of the 5th Tatsin separate tank brigade from Buryatia republic, the Russian region with the single highest known death from Putin’s bloody war. Critics have claimed that it is an impoverished territory and men have been recruited as ""cannon fodder"" for the war. Known fatalities stand at 206 in the mainly Buddhist region close to Lake Baikal in Siberia. “We ask [you] to consider replacing the servicemen…with other Russian troops not engaged in the special military operation,” say the wives. “We ask to order our relatives back to their permanent location in Buryatia.” At least 30 men from their brigade are known to have died in the war in Ukraine, but Putin loyalist politician Tsydenov has not responded to the heartfelt plea from the women. The video was recorded near their husbands’ military base and appeared on the Instagram account of one of the women, Vera Partilkhaeva. She later deleted her account after the wives’ protest was noticed as the women could face prosecution and punishment for publicly denouncing the military deployment of their husbands. However, the identity of the women is unclear and the video was published by Baikal People, who has consistently revealed details of fatalities in the war. Ukraine has accused two soldiers from this brigade of war crimes during Putin’s invasion. They were named Bayaskhalan Shultumov and Pavel Aganaev by Prosecutor General of Ukraine Irina Venediktova, said The Insider. It is not clear if their wives were among those making the appeal. The Ukrainians allege “they illegally broke into a private house where several families were hiding from the atrocities of the invaders”. They “threatened” locals with “firearms and physical violence” in Buzovo village, Buchansky district and ""they beat the men with the butt of a machine gun, punching and kicking. “In addition to torture, the …marauders stole $60,000 of savings from people.”",13,6.258235889209362,5.395564294084363,0.8626715951249988,12

The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the news claiming they left as a humanitarian gesture. ""As a goodwill gesture, Russian troops have today completed the performance of tasks on Snake Island and withdrawn the garrison stationed there,"" the ministry said. Various pro-government Russian Telegram channels also confirmed the abandonment, with one saying: ""After a heroic defence, our troops left Serpent's Island."" The head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office, Andriy Yermak wrote on Twitter: ""KABOOM! No Russian troops on the Snake Island anymore. Our Armed Forces did a great job."" Snake Island was occupied by Russia on the first day of its invasion and achieved global fame when Ukrainian border guards stationed there rejected a Russian warship's demand for their surrender. Reports say the Ukrainian military heavily bombarded Snake Island overnight, forcing the Russian military forces on the island to flee on five small boats, blowing up hardware on their departure. Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov previously told the BBC that if Russian troops succeeded in occupying Snake Island, or Zmiinyi Island, that they would end up ""controlling the sea, land and air in the north-west part of the Black Sea and in the south of Ukraine"". The Russian Ministry of Defence says its so-called retreat shows the global community that ""the Russian Federation is not hampering the UN's efforts to organise a humanitarian corridor to ship farming produce out of Ukraine"". Russian military spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the decision means Ukraine can no longer claim that its inability to export grain is ""due to Russia's total control of the northwestern part of the Black Sea"". ""Now it is up to the Ukrainian side that is still not clearing the Black Sea coastline, including the harbour waters,"" the ministry said. Ukraine's Operational Southern Command reported earlier today that on June 28 Russian forces made heavy losses on the island, as a result of a successful military operation by Ukraine. They reportedly lost 40 soldiers, a Pantsir S-1 missile system, two howitzers ""Msta-B"" and a self-propelled ""Msta-S"" howitzer as well as three units of armour and other vehicles. One Pantsir is worth around $15million (£12m). The Operational Command said on Facebook today that the opponent ""hurriedly evacuated the remains of the garrison and now the island is covered in fire.""",14,3.015482684510032,6.172720389908207,-3.157237705398175,20

More US warplanes will be deployed to Britain, a new American base will be created in Poland and 260,000 extra troops, including British soldiers, will be put on high alert. The moves come after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine unleashed fresh fears for former Soviet states. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Today, NATO leaders decided a fundamental shift in our defence and deterrence to respond to a new security reality."" Heavy equipment and weapons’ caches will be deployed to alliance nations deemed at the greatest risk from Moscow. Forces will be given specific regions on the alliance’s eastern flank closest to Russia. Mr Stoltenberg said: ""This is the first time since the Cold War that we have these kinds of plans with pre-assigned forces.” The alliance will be widened to include Sweden and Finland - increasing the border with Russia and enraging the Kremlin. Speaking at the NATO Summit in Madrid, Boris Johnson said: “If Vladimir Putin was hoping that he would be getting less NATO on his Western front as a result of his unprovoked illegal invasion of Ukraine, he’s been proved completely wrong. He is getting more NATO.” US President Joe Biden announced a new base in Poland for the US Fifth Army Corps - the first permanent American station in the country. Another 3,000 soldiers will be sent to Romania with “enhanced” troop rotations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The UK is setting up a brigade headquarters in Estonia, where nearly 2,000 British troops are stationed. Sailors from Ukraine’s navy are being trained how to use Sandown-class Royal Navy minehunters off Portsmouth. Two more squadrons of US F-35 fighter jets will be deployed to the UK - another 24 Lightning II planes - along with extra air defence systems for Germany and Italy. Mr Biden said: “Together with our allies we're going to make sure that NATO is ready to meet the threats from all directions across every domain. “In a moment where Putin has shattered peace in Europe and attacked the very, very tenets of rule-based order, the United States and our allies, we're going to step up. “We're stepping up, proving that NATO is more needed now than it ever has been.” Britain will pump another £1billion into Ukraine’s war chest. Cash will help fund air defence systems, unmanned drones and “electronic warfare equipment”. Thousands of pieces of vital kit for brave Ukrainian soldiers will also be provided. Unveiling the latest UK package of support for the war-torn nation in the Spanish capital, the PM said: “Putin’s brutality continues to take Ukrainian lives and threaten peace and security across Europe. “As Putin fails to make the gains he had anticipated and hoped for and the futility of this war becomes clear to all, his attacks against the Ukrainian people are increasingly barbaric. “UK weapons, equipment and training are transforming Ukraine’s defences against this onslaught - and we will continue to stand squarely behind the Ukrainian people to ensure Putin fails in Ukraine.” NATO leaders tonight issued an official declaration blasting “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms”. They added: “It gravely undermines international security and stability. It is a blatant violation of international law. “Russia’s appalling cruelty has caused immense human suffering and massive displacements, disproportionately affecting women and children. “Russia bears full responsibility for this humanitarian catastrophe.” In a further blow to the Kremlin, alliance leaders formally backed membership bids by Finland and Sweden. The applications need to be rubber-stamped by national parliaments, which could take up to a year. No country is expected to block the bids after Turkey dropped its opposition. Moscow claimed NATO expansion will be “destabilising” for Europe. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov fumed: “It does not add security either to those who are expanding it, those joining it, or to other countries that perceive the alliance as a threat.” Ukraine has put its bid for NATO membership on hold while war rages. But, speaking to reporters on the margins of the summit, Odessa MP Alex Goncharenko said: “I believe that Ukraine’s future is in NATO and that is the only way to provide security not only to our country but to the whole continent.” Meanwhile, Mr Johnson revealed Western leaders will attend a crunch summit even if Putin goes because they would not want the Russian President and his Chinese counterpart plotting behind their backs. The Kremlin despot has been invited to the G20 in Bali in November. No10 has refused to rule out boycotting the trip, or staging a mass walkout if Putin addressed the conference. Asked about how he might react, the PM said: “The question is do we as the Western countries vacate our seats at the G20, and leave the whole argument to China, to Russia?” He added: “If you vacate something like the G20 you risk just handing the propaganda opportunity to others.” Mr Johnson said he “would be absolutely amazed” if “pariah figure” Putin “goes in person”.",29,5.746194048490972,3.6447606071872167,2.1014334413037554,10

This becomes one of the biggest shifts in European security in decades, after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine pushed Helsinki and Stockholm to drop their tradition of neutrality. According to a summit statement, NATO's 30 allies took the decision at their summit in Madrid. There, they also agreed to formally treat Russia as the ""most significant and direct threat to the allies' security"". ""Today, we have decided to invite Finland and Sweden to become members of NATO,"" NATO leaders said in their declaration, after Turkey lifted a veto on Finland and Sweden joining. After hours of talks between the leaders in Madrid on Tuesday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan agreed with his Finnish and Swedish counterparts a series of security measures to allow the two Nordic countries to overcome the Turkish veto. These were imposed by the Turkish capital of Ankara in May due to concerns about terrorism. Despite the swift decision to invite the countries, ratification in allied parliaments is likely to take up to a year. However, once it has been done, the neighbouring countries will be covered by the NATO's Article 5 collective defence clause - putting them under the United States' protective nuclear umbrella. Speaking about the decision, Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, said: ""We will make sure we are able to protect all allies, including Finland and Sweden"". The NATO secretary-general also added that Russian tyrant Vladimir Putin is now ""getting more NATO on his borders"". In the meantime, the allies are set to increase their troop presence in the Nordic region. There will be an increase in ""high readiness"" troops, Stoltenberg says. ""Together, this constitutes the biggest overhaul of our collective deterrence and defence since the Cold War,"" continued Stoltenberg. ""We will transform the NATO Response Force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000."" The general also added that the 30-member alliance is expected to consider Russia to be ""the most significant and direct threat to our security"". Echoing his words, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ""a direct threat to our Western way of life,"" as he cited the wider impact of the war, such as rising energy and food prices. At today's NATO summit, the alliance agreed a longer-term support package for Ukraine - in addition to the billions of dollars already pledged in weapons and financial support. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that arms would continue to be supplied to Kyiv, adding: ""The message is: We will continue to do so - and to do this intensively - for as long as it is necessary to enable Ukraine to defend itself."" The Western alliance also put forward an agreement that big allies such as the United States, Germany, Britain and Canada will pre-assign troops, weapons and equipment to the Baltics and intensify training exercises. Following today's decision, it is feared that Putin could lash out at NATO - particularly at Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - which were once ruled from Moscow. The NATO Response Force is currently around 40,000 soldiers, sailors and air personnel.",29,5.428559124333114,6.36303973218335,-0.9344806078502357,10
2022-06-29,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-missile-caught-cctv-strikes-27352764,Russian missile caught on CCTV as it strikes Ukrainian shopping mall killing 20,"The moment a Russian missile struck a shopping centre in Ukraine was caught on CCTV. The attack on Amstor mall in the city of Kremenchuk on Monday left at least 20 dead and dozens more injured and missing. The unnerving footage shows the first of two rockets fired appear out of nowhere and leave the target a flaming ruin. Fire chief Ivan Melekhovets said the intensity of the resultant inferno left people with ""no chance of surviving"". Having been involved in the efforts to rescue those inside he described the devastation of seeing the corpses of children as the ""hardest thing"". He added that up to 60 people remain missing. An estimated 1,000 were inside during the shelling. Previously released footage showed how the sunny sky turned dark with debris as a man dived into a lake for safety. The video was caught on what appears to be CCTV stationed at a nearby park. Panicked parents and their children were also seen watching on before abandoning their belongings to flee, with the camera itself trembling on impact. Another angle shows a mum grabbing her small child and taking cover by a tree just as a second missile hits. And a third sees a jogger collapse as the missile hits the water before lying on the floor during the second blast. More footage shows panicked children fleeing over a bridge crossing over the lake with their hands over their ears. President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it was ""impossible to imagine"" how many victims there would be in the end. He added that the incident was ""one of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history"". He claimed Russia purposefully attacked the shopping centre, also releasing some footage of the moment himself. In his nightly address, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: ""Today, I want to end this address with one such piece of evidence - so that no one dares to deceive about the missile strike at the shopping mall in Kremenchuk. ""The Russian missile hit this very object, purposefully. Obviously, that was the order. ""It is obvious that Russian assassins received such coordinates for this missile. ""They wanted to kill as many people as possible in a peaceful city, in a regular shopping mall. ""And for this act of state terrorism, as for all others, Russia will be responsible. ""On the battlefield in Ukraine, by the strengthening of sanctions and, of course, in the tribunal."" The Kremlin claims its forces had fired at a neighbouring US and European arms depot which inadvertently caused an explosion which ignited the mall. Russia's defence ministry said in a daily statement: ""In Kremenchuk, Russian forces struck a weapons depot storing arms received from the United States and Europe with high-precision air-based weapons. ""The detonation of stored ammunition for Western weapons caused a fire in a non-functioning shopping centre located next to the depot."" Electronics store worker Maksym Musienko said around 100 customers were in his shop when the attack started. The 26-year-old, who is in hospital with shrapnel wounds and concussion, said: ""We were working. ""There were a lot of people in the shop, but I don't remember anything after that. ""The shopping centre is not a place of danger for the Russians. We thought we were far away from the frontier.""",17,6.086440068026746,2.1353443968434496,3.951095671183296,16

While the video does not show immediate damage to aircraft, Ukrainian defences claim it was shot down in Zhytomyr, in the northwest of Ukraine. The aircraft is reportedly a Russian Kamov KA-52 helicopter and was attacked by soldiers from the Ukrainian 95th Air Assault Brigade, using a Martlet, known as Starstreak in the UK. Footage captures the moment the aircraft is intercepted and shot by enemy troops. The short clip has been shared widely, but there have been no details about when the missile struck or the number of deaths. The Russian single-seat attack helicopter has been dubbed the 'Black Shark' and was once described as Russia's 'deadliest helicopter' because of its battlefield management system which allows it to share data with other aircraft to coordinate attack operations. It has been reported that within 30 seconds of the Martlet being launched, it was hit. High-tech Starstreak missiles can hit targets the size of a tennis ball travelling at the speed of sound. The missiles are short-range, man-portable, air-defence systems and are optimised to provide defence against air threats. They can be configured to be used in man-portable and vehicle-mounted battlefield roles. Earlier this month, Britain vowed to join the US in sending further long-range missile systems to Ukraine to help in the fight against the Kremlin's forces. The British Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces continue to disrupt Russian command and control ""with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines."" This attack on the high-tech Russian helicopter comes after at least 18 civilians were killed when a Russian missile struck a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine's central city of Kremenchuk on Monday. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said as many as 1,000 people were shopping at the time of the attack and it is unlikely that many people will be found alive in the rubble. Firefighters and soldiers were seen in horrifying footage pulling out mangled pieces of metal and wading through rubble as they searched for survivors. Mr Zelensky said it was impossible to “expect decency and humanity” from Moscow and that the shopping mall presented “no threat to the Russian army."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the attack demonstrated “once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink.""",17,4.862452804070139,4.103942473388904,0.7585103306812346,16

The suspected double-tap missile strike on a retail complex in Kremenchuk killed at least 18, with a further 41 still missing amid fears of a mass casualty atrocity. It is believed the official list of those unaccounted may be on the rise - from 36 to 41 in just a few hours on Tuesday afternoon - amid the confusion of war. Today exhausted firefighters and troops were still desperately trying to dig out survivors from the rubble but said it was unlikely more would be found. Monday's Russian air-force attack, in the central city of Kremenchuk and far from any frontline, drew a wave of global condemnation, with Ukraine saying Moscow killed civilians deliberately. It is even believed Moscow’s long-range bomber crew unleashed missiles usually intended to destroy aircraft carriers. Russia said the missiles hit an arms depot, falsely claiming the mall was empty - whilst those who escaped the blaze contradicted the Kremlin lies. Ludmyla Mykhailets, 43, who had been shopping there with her husband when the blast threw her into the air said in a nearby hospital: ""I flew head first and splinters hit my body. The whole place was collapsing.” Her husband Mykola, 45, had blood seeping through a bandage on his head. He said: ""It was hell.” Others described a maelstrom of shrapnel and debris. Mother of three Ania Miakushka, 44, was in tears as she laid flowers, clutching her five-year-old son's hand and touching a graze on his shoulder. Her own hands are also cut up from when the windows of her home were blown out by the explosion. ""My eldest son says we should leave, but I don't have anywhere to go,"" she said. During another air-raid alert in Kremenchuk on Tuesday, Ukraine's Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi, one arm in a bandage after giving blood for the injured, sheltered in the basement of a hotel. He said Monday's missile strike was a reminder to Ukrainians to heed the raid warnings. Miraculously mall worker Yaroslav Denisenko escaped the Russian attack - because he went outside to smoke. He recalled: “I was rescued by the fact I went out to have a smoke. Ten minutes later, I could not have escaped.” He went in to help the wounded. “We were ripping out doors because they were contorted and would not open,” he said. “Glass in the door was smashed, but shards stuck out of the frame. “I saw a child all in blood. And he is followed by a woman covered in blood.” And we just silently began to rip out those doors. He saw Comfy store ablaze and his own shop EVA, which sells cosmetics, on fire. “I got off easily…” he said. “I worry about the girls most of all. “One of them... It was her very first working day in EVA and she is in the intensive care now. “Outside the cars were burning.” The EVA warehouse where he worked was an inferno. He added: “There was no way to go through. I realised I can do nothing.”. Worried relatives of the missing in Kremenchuk were lined up at a hotel across the street from the wreckage of the shopping centre, where rescuers set up a base. Weary firefighters sat on a kerb after a night battling the blaze and searching for survivors, mostly in vain. One, Oleksandr, dousing his face from a water bottle, said his team had worked all night, adding: ""We pulled out five bodies. We didn't find anybody alive.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians in ""one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history.” The Kremenchuk blast has alerted locals to the growing fear that nowhere is now safe in Ukraine. Alia Skrypka,35, believed the town, more than 100 milesfrom the nearest fighting, was a safe haven. But now she is considering whether she should move her two girls, Milla, 7 and Myroslava, 4, elsewhere - perhaps even abroad. She said: ""After this, I'm not sure we are safe.” Another 41 people were unaccounted for, Poltava regional governor Dmytro Lunin confirmed. Meanwhile Ukrainian web sleuths unmasked the Russian unit suspected of striking the central Ukraine centre on Monday. Volunteer investigators InformNapalm said it was the 52nd Guards Heavy Bomber Regiment, unit 33310, from, Shaykovka in Russia’s Kaluga region.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has already sent 8,172 men to fight for Russia in Ukraine - but says a wave of patriotism is leading to an influx of volunteers. Each new Chechen battalion will have up to 950 fighters, and he said the troops are needed to ""replenish"" the armed forces, possibly an acknowledgement of war losses. “The desire to form new battalions with fully equipped personnel stems from an extremely patriotic mood among the youth of the region,” said the Putin ally. “The number of people wishing to defend the Motherland is growing exponentially, and our task is to provide them with such an opportunity.” Kadyrov, 45, who holds the rank of lieutenant-general in the Russian national guard, said: “The military contingent will include only Chechen men. “They will replenish the composition of the troops of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation.” Kadyrov - iron-fisted ruler of oil-rich Chechnya - is part of a hardline grouping around Putin pressing him to fully invade Ukraine. Father-of-twelve Kadyrov called his recruits “the best sons of the Motherland, desperate and brave, ready at any moment to move to the ends of the world at the mere call. “They are waiting for the order, and this is their goal - to protect their native land when it needs it.” He said “there is no greater honour for a man than to live and die with the thought that you are part of a single big brotherhood, ready to eliminate any threat”.",14,5.400343896946685,6.105902652904508,-0.7055587559578225,6

With around 1,000 people inside shopping at the time of the explosions President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was ""impossible to imagine"" how many victims there would be in the end. The entire mall in Kremenchuk erupted into flames following the blast caused by two rockets. Harrowing pictures shared on social media showed huge flames billowing from the building as teams launched a massive rescue operation for those trapped inside. Senior Ukrainian officials say 16 people were killed in the atrocity along with 59 more wounded. ""This is the sixth time the city has been bombed"" since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, said Oleksandr Kovalenko, deputy director of the surgery department at Kremenchuk's public hospital. ""But never before did it hit so many people."" The hospital is treating 25 people injured in the attack, six of them in critical condition, he said. The strike drew a global outcry, with leaders of the Group of Seven major democracies, gathered for a summit in Germany, condemning it as ""abominable"". ""This is not an accidental hit, this is a calculated Russian strike,"" President Zelensky said in an evening video address. He said the death count could rise. He estimated around 1,000 people were in the mall at the time of the strike. The city had a population of 217,000 before the invasion. People lined up at a hotel near the mall to register the names of those missing. More than 40 people had been reportedmissing, Ukraine's prosecutor general's office said. Rescue workers continued to sift through the rubble to look for survivors. One patient in the hospital's general ward, Ludmyla Mykhailets, 43, said she was shopping at an electronics store with her husband, Mykola, when the blast threw her into the air. ""I flew head first and splinters hit my body. The whole place was collapsing. Then I landed on the floor and I don't know if I was conscious or unconscious,"" she said, adding she had broken her arm and split her head open. ""It was hell,"" added Mykola, 45, blood seeping through a bandage wrapped around his head. Outside the hospital, a small group of mall workers were filled with worry and grief, but also relief. Meanwhile, Russian media dismissed the attacks as a ""fake"" operation, claiming those spotted running from the scene in terror were extras. State TV war reporter Andrey Rudenko said: “These freaks are back to provocations. “The shopping mall in Kremenchuk, with allegedly thousands of people inside it. Videos show an empty car park with just a couple of cars. Was this a working shopping centre, there would have been lots of cars. ""Were there people inside the centre, and were they to be wounded or killed, then there would be no way these cars would be cleared away. ""There is a feeling of a crowd of ‘extras’, similar to football fans or something like it. ""Conclusion: there is a sense they set it up themselves, or shot it for a strong pictures but they didn’t do it properly, again.” Similar claims have been dismissed out of hand by Russian media over a number of atrocities since the outbreak of war. Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned Vladimir Putin's ""cruelty and barbarism"" following the missile attack. He added: ""This appalling attack has shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink. ""Once again our thoughts are with the families of innocent victims in Ukraine. Putin must realise his behaviour will do nothing but strengthen the resolve of the Ukraine and every other G7 country to stand by the Ukraine for as long as it takes."" It comes as it is was reported hundreds of thousands of NATO troops will be switched to high-readiness alert following Russia 's invasion of Ukraine. Alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg revealed more than 300,000 forces will be stood up to the category - a huge boost from the 40,000 in the coalition’s existing response force. The announcement came as NATO leaders prepare to descend on Madrid for a crunch summit tomorrow. Speaking at a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Mr Stoltenberg pledged a “fundamental shift in NATO’s deterrence and defence”. He said: ""We will transform the NATO response force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000.” The measure is designed at bolstering defences on the 30-member alliance’s eastern flank, where Baltic states border Russia.

The NATO response force, or quick reaction unit, will now increase its 40,000 troops sevenfold to more than 300,000. Secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the dramatic expansion of high-readiness forces will be ""transformative"" for NATO and ""strengthen our forward defences."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be among leaders in Madrid this week to discuss important issues facing the alliance. This also includes China and the ""challenges that Beijing poses to our security, interests, and values"". It comes amid a supposed growing inclination of China to flex its geopolitical muscle and coercive economic might abroad. However, Mr Stoltenberg explained that NATO will make clear that Russia is the ""most significant and direct threat"" to security. The organisation will also change its language on Russia that in the alliance's last strategy from 2010 was still described as a strategic partner. ""That will not be the case in the strategic concept that we will agree in Madrid,"" Mr Stoltenberg added. ""I expect that allies will state clearly that Russia poses a direct threat to our security, to our values, to the rules-based international order."" Both the G7 and NATO summits this week are considering the challenges of China and focusing on its ties with Russia amid Moscow's Ukraine war. The country will be marked as a concern in NATO's new strategy concept for the first time in a decade. But its members are now wrangling over how to describe the country with the world's largest military and its relationship with Russia. Diplomats said the US and Britain have pushed for more forceful language to reflect what they see as China's increasing military ambitions and growing concern that it could attack the democratically governed island of Taiwan, which Beijing regards as its own territory. Meanwhile France and Germany, given major European industrial investment in China, favour more measured references. One diplomat said a compromise was taking shape under which China would be described as a ""systemic challenge"", while including balancing language referring to a ""willingness to work on areas of common interest"" with Beijing. Mr Stoltenberg said that the plan being discussed ""constitutes the biggest overhaul of our collective deterrence and defence since the Cold War."" The alliance would decide on a new ""strategic concept for a new security reality"". This would be ""a fundamental shift in NATO's deterrence and defence"" and the leaders would pledge ""support to Ukraine now, and for the future,"" he said. Outlining further support for Volodymyr Zelensky's Ukraine, he said ""their courage and commitment are an inspiration"" and welcomed the president's attendance at the summit. The allies will agree a strengthened comprehensive assistance package for Ukraine, with deliveries of secure communications, anti-drone systems and fuel. NATO will also consider Sweden and Finland's bids to join, applications made in response to the threat posed by Russia. Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reservations about the plan, but he is due to hold talks with the leaders of the two countries in Madrid. The NATO meeting will follow the G7 summit in Germany which was also dominated by talks on Ukraine. A White House official voiced confidence on Sunday that the document would include ""strong"" language on China, but said the negotiations were continuing ahead of the NATO summit in Madrid on Wednesday and Thursday. The strategy document, which will update US-led NATO's objectives and values, will also state member states' ""awareness of the need for ""resilience"", the diplomat said. Negotiators are in addition fine-tuning how to describe the relationship between China and Russia, with the Czech Republic and Hungary strongly opposed to the phrase ""strategic convergence"" to define it, one of the diplomats said.",29,5.511131084500392,4.7974970181762595,0.7136340663241327,10

Alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg revealed more than 300,000 forces will be stood up to the category - a huge boost from the 40,000 in the coalition’s existing response force. The announcement came as NATO leaders prepare to descend on Madrid for a crunch summit tomorrow. Speaking at a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Mr Stoltenberg pledged a “fundamental shift in NATO’s deterrence and defence”. He said: ""We will transform the NATO response force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000.” The measure is designed at bolstering defences on the 30-member alliance’s eastern flank, where Baltic states border Russia. The countries fear mounting aggression from Moscow following Vladimir Putin ’s war on Russia’s neighbour. Finland and Sweden’s bids for NATO membership are due to be discussed when coalition leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, take part in negotiations in the Spanish capital. Leaders are also expected to overhaul NATO’s whole approach to the Kremlin. The alliance's last strategy from 2010 described Moscow as a strategic partner - before it annexed the Crimea in 2014, supported anti-government rebels in eastern Ukraine in the same year, and launched a full military invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Mr Stoltenberg confirmed: ""I expect that allies will state clearly that Russia poses a direct threat to our security, to our values, to the rules-based international order.” Earlier, Boris Johnson insisted the “price of freedom is worth paying” as he compared Russia with Nazi Germany. Speaking at the G7 Summit in Bavaria, the Prime Minister vowed to continue supporting Kyiv and President Volodymyr Zelensky, adding: “Strategic endurance is very important.” Hitting out at the “absolutely unbridled aggression” from the Kremlin, he told the BBC : “I think that sometimes the price of freedom is worth paying and, just remember, it took the democracies in the middle of the last century a long time to recognise that they have to resist tyranny and aggression. “It was very expensive but what it bought in the end with the defeat of the dictators, particularly of Nazi Germany, it bought decades and decades of stability, a world order that relied on a rules based national system, and that is worth protecting, that is worth defending - that delivers long term prosperity.” He said the economic impact on Britain of the war in Ukraine - which has seen fuel costs soar and food prices rocket - “will start to abate”. He added: “We'll find ways around things and some of the cost pressures will start to come down. “In terms of staying the course, imagine if we allowed Putin to get away with the violent acquisition of huge chunks of another country - sovereign independent territory. “The lessons for that would be absolutely chilling - in all of the countries of the former Soviet Union, and see what's happening in the Baltic countries already.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the G7 for more weapons to repel Russian invaders. Speaking via video link after Kremlin missiles rained down on Kyiv, He called on them to be ""partners, not observers"" and provide the military equipment his country needs.",29,3.796549406582674,5.724404947639175,-1.927855541056501,10

Paratrooper commander Colonel Andrei Vasilyev, 49, was killed in an attack on Friday night. His death is one of the first from the new 43-mile-range weapons sent to Ukraine by President Joe Biden. He was in an advanced command post of the Russian army’s airborne assault troops, but the location was not specified. Vasilyev was commander of the 137th Guards Airborne Regiment of the 106th Guards Airborne Division, based in Ryazan. Married with a daughter, he had been awarded the Russian Order of Courage on other honours. Footage shows the launch of the first HIMARS missiles in Ukraine late last week. It is unclear whether this is the strike that killed Vasilyev in the Friday attack. A separate HIMARS attack on Izyum, Kharkiv region hit a Russian base, killing or wounding 40-plus, according to Ukraine. Russian military holed up in a school in Izyum were hit by the new missile which which has a range of around 43 miles. The blast wreaked havoc at the old school site which was said to be used as a Russian command post. Smoke was seen billowing from small fires surrounding the school where windows were smashed and debris covered the floor. It was the precision-guided weapon's first hit on Russian military command position. The 55th colonel to die was Lt-Col Sergey Gundorov, 51, whose helicopter was seen crashing in an inferno near Volnovakha in the Donbas, after being hit with a portable surface-to-air missile. His stricken Mi-35 touched the ground before cartwheeling over a narrow strip of woodland and crashing in a fireball in a field. Putin has also lost at least 11 generals. Overall Russian losses are believed to be in excess of 30,000, with some estimates of nearer to 50,000. Monday marked 124 days since Putin's troops invaded Ukraine on February 24. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has called for a more modern air defence system for his country after a string of deadly attacks on the capital of Kyiv. Other regions that have been severely hit include Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Lviv. Elsewhere in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol, more than 100 bodies were found in a house, according to the mayor’s adviser Piotr Andryushchenko. On Sunday, Moscow's forces entered the city of Lysychansk from five directions and were isolating Ukrainian troops, according to a separatist official.",14,5.190081897758744,2.7150457767168565,2.4750361210418874,11

Footage shows the havoc wrought at the school which was being used as a command post by Vladimir Putin 's forces, it is claimed. Ukraine believes at least 40 Russian military personnel were struck in the attack in Izyum, in the Kharkiv region. Small fires surrounded the site where windows were smashed and debris covered the ground. It is the first hit on Russian military command position by the weapon, which is precision guided with medium range. The strike, on Izyum Lyceum No 2, involved the HIMARS High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems which have a range of around 43 miles. They were from the 20th Army of the Russian Armed Forces’ Western Military District, unit 89425, originally based in Voronezh. ""All personnel stationed at the command post were demilitarised - over 40 people,"" a spokesperson for Ukraine said. Russia acknowledged the attack was by the US-supplied HIMARS. The Kremlin claimed the strike had hit a hospital, and that the Ukrainian claim was intended “to appease a panicking Ukrainian army with illusory victories”. However, Russian military vehicles seen outside the school suggest it was being used for military purposes by the invading army. Earlier footage had been released showing what was claimed to be the first deployment of HIMARS by the Ukrainians. Footage also emerged on Monday of the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu visiting frontlines in Ukraine for the first time. Shoigu, 67, made his first visit to an undisclosed Ukrainian location to speak with troops in the war zone and seek to reassert control over the war in Ukraine. Russia did not disclose the location but there is strong speculation he was in blitzkrieg Mariupol which his forces have captured from Ukraine. Russian state TV boasted that Shoigu would be making future visits to major cities including Kyiv, Odesa and Mykolaiv once Russia’s invasion has seized Ukraine’s major cities. The defence minister is an army general seen as a likely successor to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his visit was seen as a way to send an ""I’m in control"" message on his first war zone visit.",14,4.613693991764409,3.746669812146096,0.8670241796183129,11

Mikhail Romanov, a 32-year-old Russian soldier, is accused of murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife in front of her child in the Kyiv capital region. The suspect will be tried in absentia as his whereabouts are unknown. Some say he could be still fighting in Ukraine, back in Russia or even dead. Iryna Venediktova, the prosecutor general, said: “We don’t know where he is – maybe he’s fighting still, maybe he’s on rotation in the Russian Federation, maybe he is dead. ""We don’t know but we want to prosecute him in absentia.” Romanov is believed to have been serving with the 239th regiment of the 90th Guards Tank Division at the time. After a preliminary hearing in Kyiv on Thursday, prosecutor Oksana Kalyus told reporters that the woman requested for the trial to be held behind closed doors because of concerns for her privacy. It is alleged that Romanov and another soldier shot dead the husband, named Oleksiy, at point-blank range in the village of Bohdanivka, northeast of the capital. They then raped Oleksiy's wife and then returned twice to rape her again, it is alleged. She told the Times: “[The younger soldier] told me to take my clothes off. Then they both raped me, one after the other."" “They didn’t care that my son was in the boiler room crying.” Kalyus said Ukraine would ask for his arrest if he was to leave Russia for a third country. “If he crosses the border, he will be arrested and delivered to Ukraine,” she said. The trial comes as the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission reports that allegations of conflict-related sexual violence by Russian troops in Ukraine are mounting. A prosecutor working on sexual violence cases told Reuters that up to 50 crimes were being investigated. However, the number of true cases since the invasion began on February 24 is likely to be much higher. One woman told BBC News her horrifying ordeal when she had been at home with her husband on March 7 when a foreign soldier barged in. ""At gunpoint, he took me to a house nearby. He ordered me: 'Take your clothes off or I'll shoot you.' He kept threatening to kill me if I didn't do as he said. Then he started raping me,"" she said. She continued: ""While he was raping me, four more soldiers entered. I thought that I was done for. But they took him [her husband] away. I never saw him again."" Venediktova told Reuters that even if Romanov was not in Ukrainian custody, it was important that the trial went ahead. The first war crimes trial was held last month in Ukraine and a 21-year-old Russian soldier was sentenced to life in jail for killing an unarmed civilian.",13,7.058885326083386,5.464829611604883,1.594055714478503,21

Shoigu, 67, made his first visit to an undisclosed Ukrainian location to speak with troops in the war zone and seek to reassert control over the war in Ukraine. Russia did not disclose the location but there is strong speculation he was in blitzkrieg Mariupol which his forces have captured from Ukraine. Russian state TV boasted that Shoigu would be making future visits to major cities including Kyiv, Odesa and Mykolaiv once Russia’s invasion has seized Ukraine’s major cities. The defence minister is an army general seen as a likely successor to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his visit was seen as a way to send an ""I’m in control"" message on his first war zone visit. In March, Shoigu disappeared for several weeks amid claims he had suffered a heart attack or undergone surgery. But on his frontline visit, he was shown barking out orders to aides who obediently were writing down his instructions. He handed out medals for heroism and told troops: “I am confident in you. “You have many more glorious deeds ahead of you for the benefit of our fatherland, the armed forces and the airborne troops. “Congratulations. Take care of yourselves."" The defence ministry issued a statement following his visit, saying: ""At the command posts of Russian units, Army General Sergei Shoigu heard reports from the commanders on the current situation and actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the main operational areas."" The Russian warmonger Putin has not yet visited the war zone, unlike risky trips made by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Some analysts believe this is due to his own health problems which are limiting his public appearances. However, the 69-year-old was seen at a number of engagements last week and is due this week to travel to Central Asia for meetings with leaders of ex-Soviet states. The secret Shoigu mission came amid speculation that the defence minister has lost control of war tactics to a succession of generals as Putin rotates in his favourites and then tires of them. Colonel-General Sergei Surovikin is said to have replaced Alexandr Dvornikov who was earlier ordered by Putin to rescue his failing war effort. Speaking on the changes, the British Ministry of Defence said: ""For over thirty years, Surovikin’s career has been dogged with allegations of corruption and brutality."" Chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov also appears to have been sidelined. One Western observer said: “Shoigu is seen looking far more assertive and active than we have seen during the entirety of the war.” Russian state TV played up the Shoigu visit with ‘propagandist’ Vladimir Solovyov and said the Ukrainians had failed to notice his arrival or seek to strike him with a Tochka-U missile. Solovyov told viewers: “[Russian defence minister] Sergey Shoigu has arrived in the area of the special military operation. “Just look. Calmly arrived. Here is [Shoigu] - well done, looks good. They calmly talked - [no] Tochka-U missiles hit them. “Calmly in the deNazified, demilitarised, liberated from the Nazis territories, [Shoigu] talks to people. All is fine. He easily gets there. “That is, all is good. And I think we will calmly come soon to Kyiv, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.” Shoigu flew in on a military helicopter and paid special attention to the organisation of comprehensive support for hostilities, his ministry said. It continued that he also focused on the ""necessary living conditions for Russian military personnel at temporary deployment points."" Leading Putin foe Leonid Nevzlin warned that Western weakness risks disaster for the world. He said: “If in the very near future the West does not resolve the issue with Putin by military-political means, then he will win this war and establish his own rules of the game throughout the world.”",14,3.81912496110951,4.097867779283419,-0.2787428181739089,11

The missile strikes, rained down on a kindergarten in the capital city early this morning before rescue crews pulled women and children, including a seven year old girl, from the rubble. It is the first attack by warmongerer Vladimir Putin's forces on Kyiv since June 5. Several blasts rang through the city at around 6.30am as fire crews battled flames and rescued civilians from a nine-storey apartment building in the central Shevchenkivskiy district. Debris was strewn over parked cars outside a smouldering building with a crater in its roof while a private kindergarten had smashed windows and a large blast crater by a playground about 400 metres away, Reuters said. ""They (rescuers) have pulled out a seven-year-old girl. She is alive. Now they're trying to rescue her mother,"" Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said. ""There are people under the rubble,"" Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. He added that several people had already been hospitalised. Some privately-held storage garages in the area were also completely destroyed. It comes after the people of Kyiv had experienced relative quiet during the last three weeks, while the war raged on in the east. Head of the regional military administration, Oleksiy Kuleba, said Ukraine troops had successfully shot down one missile. He branded the Russian attack as an attempt by Putin to intimidate Kyiv ahead of G7 and NATO summits this week. Russian troops had moved from Kyiv and concentrated on the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine, where a fierce battle over the strategic city of Severodonetsk has raged on. Ukrainian troops finally pulled out yesterday but despite this progress, Putin has reportedly sacked his top general leading the battle. The allegedly dismissed General Alexander Dvornikov, who is reported to be a drunk and distrusted by his officers, would be another telling sign of Putin's frustration with his war in Ukraine which he once believed he would conquer in four days. Russian high command is thought to have removed a number of high-ranking officers from key command roles in Ukraine since the start of June, according to the British Ministry of Defence. With Dvornikov the commander of Southern Group of Forces and likely acting as the overall operational commander for the Russian army in Ukraine, his removal is reported to have come along with that of Airborne Forces (VDV) General-Colonel Andrei Serdyukov, MailOnline said. But Dvornikov's rumoured replacement, Colonel-General Sergei Surovikin has been condemned by the MoD as an allegedly corrupt and brutal military man. It said: ""For over 30 years, Surovikin's career has been dogged with allegations of corruption and brutality."" In southern Ukraine along the Black Sea coast, nine missiles fired from Crimea hit the port city of Mykolaiv on Saturday, the Ukrainian military said. In the north, about 20 missiles were fired from Belarus into the Chernihiv region. Ukraine's military intelligence agency said the Russian bombers' use of Belarusian airspace for the first time during Saturday's attack was 'directly connected to attempts by the Kremlin to drag Belarus into the war'. Belarus hosts Russian military units and was used as a staging ground before Russia invaded Ukraine, but its own troops have not crossed the border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that as a war that Moscow expected to last five days moved into its fifth month, Russia 'felt compelled to stage such a missile show'. He said: ""When we know that the enemy will not succeed, when we understand that we can defend our country, but we don't know how long it will take, how many more attacks, losses and efforts there will be before we can see that victory is already on our horizon."" After their success capturing the heavily contested port city of Severodonetsk, Russian troops are now looking to secure the rest of the Donbas region in the east by blocking the city of Lysychansk from the south. Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said late on Saturday that Russian and Moscow-backed separatist forces now control Severodonetsk and the villages surrounding it. Ukrainian resistance had been blocked with troops retreating after weeks of bombardment and house to house fighting. Capturing Lysychansk would give Russian forces control of every major settlement in the province, while they already control around half of Donetsk, the second province in Donbas. The population of Severodonetsk has been decimated from 100,000 to just 10,000 during weeks of fighting, with most of the city reduced to rubble.",14,2.8191689440491543,3.185055182298356,-0.36588623824920186,24

In a chilling broadcast he said they ""can fire ballistic and cruise missiles, both conventional and nuclear types"". The Kremlin claims they are able to reach a distance of up to 500km (310 miles). Missiles have become a means of threatening the West since relations with Russia have worsened after Putin's invasion Ukraine by Russian forces on February 24. The Russian president has referenced nuclear weapons on several occasions which many have seen as a warning about getting involved in the war between Russia and Ukraine. He said Russia would assist in modifying Belarusian SU-25 warplanes to carry nuclear weapons in response Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. In a televised broadcast Putin said: ""We have made a decision: within the next few months we will hand over to Belarus the Iskander-M tactical missile systems."" Ukraine said enemy forces had ""fully occupied"" Severodonetsk, after weeks fighting between Ukraine and Russian troops. It means Russia controls most of the Luhansk region pus nearby Donetsk in the Donbas region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed to take back ""all our cities"" in a video address on Saturday night. He admitted the war had reached an emotionally difficult stage and was uncertain many more losses would be endured. A series of missiles targeted the north and west of Ukraine killing at least three, but local officials said there may be more people underneath debris in Sarny west of Kyiv. Ukraine claimed some missiles came from Belarus which has given logistical support to Russia but is not involved in the fighting, The strikes were part of Kremlin efforts to draw Belarus into the war, Ukraine claimed. Severodonetsk's capture comes ahead of a period of Western diplomacy which will see US President Joe Biden flying to Germany for a G7 summit before talks with Nato. It will involve a week of talks to try and prevent the war escalating further as it moves into a new period.

Air raid sirens have been ringing out throughout the night in major cities in Ukraine while there have also been claims that shelling has come from the direction of Russia's ally Belarus. One person said of bombings in Zhytomyr, to the west of Kyiv, that it has been the worst so far. ""Zhytomyr is being blown apart today, we have already had three or four attacks (and I am even quiet now about explosions, there are already so many of them that I don't take notice). You sit and think it has stopped and then it starts again. Never before has our city been sieged like this. I hope it is okay with you,"" she wrote on Twitter. One person in Kyiv said she had heard 11 explosions and another heard fighter jets over the Ukrainian capital. Similarly a Twitter user wrote: ""A series of powerful explosions in Kyiv, new blasts are rocking Zhytomyr. A massive missile attack was carried out on targets in the capital and we don't know what the results are. ""We can hear air defence missiles in the sky with missiles from aircraft probably from Belarus."" Some have also posted images from Kyiv which appear to show missiles in the sky. It comes as Ukraine is set to pull its troops from the ruined city of Sievierodonetsk after weeks of street fighting and bombardment, in what would be a significant gain for Russia as it grinds out its offensive in the east. Russian troops also occupied a town about six miles further south, both sides said on Friday, as Moscow closed in on the last slivers of Ukrainian-held territory in the industrial region of Luhansk. Moscow said it had encircled about 2,000 Ukrainian and what it called foreign troops in the area. At the same time Russian strikes this week on Kharkiv, near the Russian border, have been the worst for weeks in an area where normal life had been returning since Ukraine pushed Moscow's forces back last month. Volodymyr Zelensky had warned the fighting may escalate this week with the EU summit on Thursday where European leaders approved Ukraine's formal candidature to join the Union. The decision led Russia on Friday to say it would have negative consequences and amounted to the EU's ""enslaving"" neighbouring countries. Russia has long opposed closer links between Ukraine, a former Soviet state, and Western clubs like the EU and the NATO military alliance.

After weeks of the bloodiest house-to-house fighting so far in the war Kyiv’s military pulled back as a major assault by their comrades was underway on Russian-held Kherson. Apart from the city of Lysychansk the Ukraine withdrawal means Russia now controls the whole of Luhansk region - leaving just Donetsk to conquer in Donbas. The mainly Russian-speaking region is a massive priority for Russian President Vladimir Putin who imposed a weekend deadline on troops to take Luhansk. Donbas - comprising Luhanks and Donetsk - has been a target for Russian-backed separatists since the post Maidan revolution of 2014. But the latest Russian victory may be hollow as Ukraine’s military was making a massive incursion last night into the strategically important Kherson port in the south. The Black Sea port has been occupied by Russian forces since the beginning of the invasion but has been marked with civil uprisings and armed resistance. Yesterday (Fri) a senior Russian-imposed official was killed there and two of Moscow’s soldiers were shot dead and one wounded in a shooting at a cafe earlier in the week. Dmitry Savluchenko, part of the Russian Kherson administration, was killed in a car bombing yesterday and there have been other targeted car bombings. So far since the February 24 invasion almost 35,000 Russian troops have died after facing a ferocious resistance from Ukraine’s military. It is believed Putin's weekend deadline to take Luhansk has thrown attack plans out of sync for his commanders as many troops have been reassigned to the region, leaving areas like Kherson vulnerable to a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Moscow has tried desperately and failed to stop a constant influx of western-supplied weaponry and ammunition to Ukraine’s troops, the US revealed. US defence officials hope a massive supply of long-range artillery systems sent into Ukraine will be a game changer in Kyiv’s struggle against Russian in the east. One official, unnamed, claimed the pullback by Ukraine from Severodonetsk was a strategically wise move as they can build up a better defence. The source said: “In moving the Ukrainian armed forces from Severodonetsk back, what they are doing it putting themselves in a position where they can better defend themselves.” Britain is playing a key role in getting weapons to Ukraine via a hub in Germany, using land, sea and air but the many routes in are top secret. Yesterday after repeated demands to the west for more weapons Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said medium-range American rocket launchers had arrived. The High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) are hoped to be a game-changer in the war as they are precision-guided but local troops have had to get three weeks of training on their use and they have to be moved up to the front line.

After they had set the trap, an escaped goat wandered in the direction of the hospital and set off the grenades. Ukraine said the animal instigated a chain reaction, injuring multiple Russian troops. The fate of the goat, which had escaped from a nearby farm, is not known. President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, urged allies to increase heavy weapons shipments to take on Russia in the on-going battle. ""We must free our land and achieve victory, but more quickly, a lot more quickly,"" he said in a video address. He also added that Moscow's air and land attacks aim to destroy the whole Donbas region. The invading Russian forces targeted southern and eastern Ukraine after it tried to advance on Kyiv in the early in the conflict which met fierce Ukrainian resistance. The war in Donbas is most critical in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, which bridge the Siverskyi Donets River in Luhansk province. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelensky said the battle there is ""entering a sort of fearsome climax"". Civilians in their hundreds are trapped in chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk while the battle continues to control the city. Moscow says Ukrainian forces in the city are surrounded and trapped. But Luhansk Governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian Television on Wednesday that Russian forces did not have full control of Sievierodonetsk. Gaidai said all Lysychansk was within reach of Russian fire. ""In order to avoid encirclement, our command could order that the troops retreat to new positions. There may be a regrouping after last night,"" he said. Russian-backed separatists claimed Lysychansk was cut off from supplies a connecting road to Sieviersk was taken. The claims have not yet been confirmed But the defence ministry in Britain said some Ukrainian units had withdrawn to prevent forces being encircled. It said: ""Russian forces are putting the Lysychansk-Sievierodonetsk pocket under increasing pressure with this creeping advance - however, its efforts to achieve a deeper encirclement to take western Donetsk Oblast remain stalled."" Kyiv said shelling is making life ""hell"" and insisted fighters in the ground would hold on ""as long as necessary"". Sergiy Gaiday, governor of the Lugansk region, wrote on Telegram: ""The Russian army is... just destroying everything. It's just hell out there,"" ""Our boys are holding their positions and will continue to hold on as long as necessary.""",14,2.5381451312886623,4.442919605484945,-1.9047744741962824,25

Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, face being shot by a firing squad after being convicted in a “show trial” of alleged war crimes by a pro-Russian proxy court. Yulia Tserkovnikova, who has been appointed by the Donetsk People’s Republic court to represent Shaun, said: ""My colleagues and I are working on the text of the appeal in the interests of our clients. “If the appeal is rejected and the verdict comes into force, a request for pardon will be filed because it is the inalienable right of our clients based on the laws of the Donetsk People’s Republic. “It must not be violated and they strongly insist on using it.” Official Denis Pushilin, who would hear a pardon plea, has already said he sees no grounds to grant it. It is unclear why it has taken two weeks to announce an appeal, though the hopes of any change in the verdict are seen as all but non-existent. An appeal hearing is expected in around a fortnight. Earlier this month, Aiden, from Nottinghamshire, and Shaun, from Bedfordshire, were sentenced to death alongside Moroccan Sadun Brahim, 21, after the trio surrendered alongside Ukrainian forces to pro-Putin fighters in Mariupol. Another British detainee Andrew Hill, 35, from Plymouth, has also been warned to expect the death penalty when his verdict is separately handed down. Ms Tserkovnikova said that Pinner had been crushed by the death sentence verdict. She said: ""He changed just before our eyes. He instantly became 20 years older. “All three of them understood that punishment awaited them. “They understood that punishment was inevitable for the crimes they had committed, but it seems to me that they did not expect capital punishment. “Of course, it was a shock for them.” Ms Tserkovnikova also criticised the British government for not doing more to seek clemency or their release, possibly as part of a swap. She said: ""If the British authorities have such an intention [to change the verdict], I know only from the media. “This seems a very bad position for British representatives to publicly put on a show in the media and talk about protecting the rights of their citizens. “No-one prevents the British authorities from going out directly and applying to the state authorities of the DPR, in some way at least inquire about the fate of their subject officially, and not make loud statements in the air in the media.” Russian Ambassador to London, Andrey Kelin, has said that Moscow received a note from the UK government but that it was “arrogant”. He told SolovyovLive: “The [British] note is composed in... I would not say in a diplomatic way. “Not as an invitation to dialogue. It is composed quite arrogantly. It is mentioned many times that we ‘must’ [respond in a certain way]. “I can say that [with] the Americans….there was an invitation to dialogue. “Here [with the British] we do not see any invitation. We will react accordingly.” Aiden's family have told the BBC of their anguish over the news. Grandmother Pamela Hall said: “There are no words, just no words, it’s got to be everyone’s worst nightmare to have a member of your family threatened in this way. “Aiden was extremely upset when he called his mother this morning. “The bottom line is Aiden has said the DPR has told him nobody from the UK has made contact, and that he will be executed. “I have to believe what Aiden has said to us, that if the DPR don’t get some response then they will execute him. Obviously, I hope that isn’t true.”",13,7.1982561658538,5.008262501719343,2.189993664134457,23

Aiden Aslin, 28, was captured while battling Kremlin troops in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Earlier this month, he along with fellow British fighter Shaun Pinner were sentenced to death by the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), which is not internationally recognised. Aiden told his family in a phone call that his captors told him ""time is running out"". Grandmother Pamela Hall told the BBC: ""There are no words, just no words, it's got to be everyone's worst nightmare to have a member of your family threatened in this way. ""Aiden was extremely upset when he called his mother this morning. The bottom line is Aiden has said the DPR has told him nobody from the UK has made contact, and that he will be executed. ""I have to believe what Aiden has said to us, that if the DPR don't get some response then they will execute him. Obviously I hope that isn't true."" Ms Hall said she's ""cried buckets over this"" and thinks that ""contact should be made between the UK and Russia"". Aiden and Shaun both moved to Ukraine in 2018. They both had previously served as part of Ukraine's armed forces before the Russian invasion. Both men had made Ukraine their home. When they were captured they were branded ""mercenaries"" - which accused them of being sent to fight for money. Both had Ukrainian partners and had made the country their home. They were captured after spending weeks defending the besieged city of Mariupol. Their families and the UK government have insisted they should be treated as prisoners of war. Both men were charged by a Russian proxy court with crimes including the violent seizure of power, and undergoing training to carry out terrorist activities, according to Russian media. It comes after Brennan Phillips, an American former soldier who worked alongside Aiden in Ukraine, said the judgement is a “provocation”. Speaking to BBC Newsnight earlier this month, Mr Phillips said: “I think it will invigorate people more than anything. “Whatever effect they thought they would have in this provocation, I don’t think that and I don’t think it’s going to be well-received. And they did this as a provocation.” Earlier this month, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss discussed efforts to secure the release of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner with her Ukrainian counterpart, after the judgment by a Russian proxy court. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered ministers to do ""everything in their power"" to secure the release of the two Brits after they were condemned to death for fighting Russian forces.",13,5.279220851567967,7.3277833268177925,-2.0485624752498257,23
2022-06-22,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/snake-island-how-ukraine-forces-27300769,Ukraine forces hit Russians with massive Snake Island revenge attack,"Ukraine forces have hit back in a revenge attack on Snake Island - the infamous location of the border guards' retort for a Russian warship to “go f***” themselves on the opening day of the Russia-Ukraine war. The defiance of the defenders of Zmiinyi (Snake Island) on February 24 became symbolic of Kyiv’s resistance in the opening exchanges of the conflict. The island was captured by Moscow’s navy but not before Ukrainian border guards told a Russian military ship, which had demanded their surrender, where to go. And in a further show of Ukrainian spirit, President Volodymyr Zelensky ’s armed units have struck back at their invaders on the island, according to unverified Ukrainian media reports. The 13 guards defending the small island in the Black Sea were originally thought to have died after using colourful language to tell the Russian invaders to get lost. In an audio clip shared online in February by a Ukrainian official and media outlet Ukrainskaya Pravda, a soldier from a Russian military ship was heard telling the Ukrainian guards to “lay down your arms immediately to avoid bloodshed and unjustified deaths” or else face bombardment. The guards responded “Russian warship, go f*** yourself"" in a rallying cry that has become totemic of the staunch Ukrainian defence. Some have translated the response as meaning “go to hell”. Ukraine lost contact with its forces defending the island after Russia replied by firing missiles from the air and sea. The view in Kyiv was that the guards could not have survived. A Facebook statement by the Ukrainian navy four days after the initial Snake Island attack confirmed Russian media reports that the guards had been captured after miraculously surviving the shelling. On February 28, the navy said: “Regarding the marines and border guards who were taken captive by Russian occupants on the Island of Snake - we are very happy to know that our brothers are alive and well!” The force’s public relations service said the Russian invaders, as well as taking prisoners, had “completely destroyed the island's infrastructure: lighthouse, towers, antennas, etc” during their attacks. Ukraine has been looking to break Russia's hold on Snake Island, which is considered vital for protecting sea lanes out of the key port of Odesa. Ukraine’s South Defence Forces on Tuesday June 21 launched a flurry of attacks on the island, which is 20 miles from the coast, in a move they said had smashed Russian anti-aircraft guns in the Black Sea. The military, according to Ukrinform, a Kyiv press agency, is said to have “opened fire 150 times”, with 49 Russians being “eliminated” in the assault. An “e-warfare station”, an ammo depot, and other military equipment was destroyed, Ukrinform said. What the Ukrainians are saying about the Snake Island revenge hit Natalia Humeniuk, head of the joint coordination centre of Ukraine’s South Defence Forces, kept the details of the attack to a minimum but said a “massive blow” had been inflicted on President Vladimir Putin ’s occupying forces. In a statement published by Ukrinform, she said: “There indeed has been a strike. “In fact, more than just one, but all of this is part of a military operation that requires silence. “Nevertheless, we understand justified concerns of the population, including those in the Odesa region who have heard the explosions with their own ears. “The massive blow was inflicted as various forces were employed. We aren’t revealing all of them as the enemy’s also listening to and reading us."" She said the Pantsir anti-aircraft missile system was “very badly damaged, possibly completely destroyed” and that the Russian’s radar station was also targeted. According to the Daily Telegraph, Moscow has since branded the attack ""mad"" and said it had repelled a Ukraine plan to ""carry out massive air and artillery fire... before landing and capturing"" the island. The mission comes less than a week after the Ukrainian navy claimed it had struck a Russian boat carrying air defence systems, ammunition and personnel to Snake Island. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region remains under heavy bombardment as Russia continues to make attritional gains in its neighbour’s industrial heartlands.",14,4.579920705803497,3.9361334221310766,0.6437872836724203,20

The Nordic country has built up a substantial arsenal. But aside from the military hardware, General Timo Kivinen said, a crucial factor is that Finns would be motivated to fight. ""The most important line of defence is between one's ears, as the war in Ukraine proves at the moment,"" Kivinen said in an interview. Finland fought two wars in the 1940s against its eastern neighbour, with which it shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border. Once a non-aligned country, it is now applying to join the NATO military alliance over concerns that Russia could invade like it did Ukraine on February 24. Since World War Two, Helsinki has kept up a high level of military preparedness. ""We have systematically developed our military defence precisely for this type of warfare that is being waged there (in Ukraine), with a massive use of firepower, armoured forces and also airforces,"" Kivinen said. ""Ukraine has been a tough bite to chew (for Russia) and so would be Finland."" Some 100,000 Finns were killed during the two wars Finland fought against the Soviet Union and it lost a tenth of its territory. The nation of 5.5 million has a wartime troop strength of some 280,000 with 870,000 trained as reservists. It did not abolish military conscription for males as many other western nations did after the end of the Cold War. It has also built one of Europe's strongest artilleries and has stocked up on cruise missiles with a range of up to 370 km (230 miles). It spends 2% of its GDP on defence, a level higher than many NATO countries. It is ordering four new warships, as well as 64 F-35 fighter jets from U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin. It plans to order up to 2,000 drones, its own high altitude anti-aircraft equipment and is building barriers on its border with Russia. Some 82% of respondents in a May 18 poll by the defence ministry said they would be willing to participate in national defence if Finland was attacked. Still, Kivinen welcomed Finland's decision to apply to join NATO. Finland and fellow Nordic country Sweden are in talks with Turkey to discuss the latter's opposition to their applications. Ankara has been angered by what it says is Helsinki and Stockholm's support for Kurdish militants and arms embargoes on Turkey. NATO membership would allow Finland to boost its early warning capacity by being part of the alliance's joint airspace control, Kivinen said. Finland would also benefit from the deterrence of being part of an alliance in which an attack on one member is an attack on all its members, he said. Nevertheless, he said, ""the main responsibility for Finland's defence will still be borne by Finland"".",29,5.9195779386422736,2.327656446649854,3.5919214919924194,10

The alliance Secretary-General promised a crunch summit in Madrid next week will be “transformative” for the 73-year-old coalition, coming four months after Vladimir Putin ordered Kremlin troops across the border. Mr Stoltenberg added: “We are at a pivotal time for our security. “President Putin’s war against Ukraine is the most urgent threat we face, it has shattered peace in Europe.” Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox. Sign up for the free Mirror Politics newsletter Former Norwegian Prime Minister Mr Stoltenberg was speaking days before NATO leaders, including PM Boris Johnson, US President Joe Biden and French premier Emmanuel Macron, descend on the Spanish capital. Top of their agenda will be the war in Ukraine, with President Volodymyr Zelensky due to address the two-day meeting by video link. Warning of a “war of attrition”, Mr Stoltenberg feared the conflict could drag on for years - and urged NATO chiefs to commit to long-term suport for Kyiv. “It may last for weeks, months but also for years,” he said. “Regardless of how long the war lasts, we need to be prepared for (the) long haul and to be prepared to continue to provide substantial support to Ukraine.” He added: “I’m absolutely certain that the message from NATO allies will be that we should maintain support, deliver modern weapons, heavy weapons as NATO allies have now done for a long time.” Mr Stoltenberg said NATO was reacting to Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour by boosting weapons’ stockpiles, placing more troops at high readiness and bolstering “forward deployed combat formations to strengthen battle groups in the east”. Alliance leaders in Madrid will also discuss accelerating Finland and Sweden’s membership bids. The nations were spurred to apply after Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine on February 24. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to block their membership, accusing Helsinki and Stockholm of hosting Kurdish militants. Mr Stoltenberg told an event hosted by the Politico website: “My aim is to find a common way forward so that both countries can join our alliance as soon as possible. “This will make them safer, NATO stronger and the Euro/Atlantic area more secure.” But he admitted: “I cannot guarantee (their admission) but I am still saying that is my aim, and then as happened before when we’ve spoken about accession processes, we just need to take into account that not all allies have the same starting point and then find a way to reconcile and find common ground.” NATO chiefs will also discuss China and the “challenges it poses to our interests, security and values”, he said. Leaders from Western-backed Pacific countries Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea will attend an alliance summit for the first time. Beijing this month launched its third aircraft carrier, meaning its navy has the most carriers apart from the US. China has also been accused of militarising the South China Sea by building runways on contested islands. Beijing has repeatedly threatened to invade Taiwan and said it will bring it back under Chinese control by 2050, by force if necessary. Stressing NATO does not “regard China as an adversary”, Mr Stoltenberg said: “We need to realise that the rise of China - the fact that they are investing heavily in new, modern military equipment, including scaling significantly up their nuclear capabilities, investing in key technologies and trying also to control critical infrastructure in Europe, coming closer to us - makes it important for us to address that.”",29,4.508203103185465,3.492171932136764,1.0160311710487004,10

The footage reportedly shows a Russian warship in the Baltic Sea performing a military exercise. The vessel can be seen launching an antiship missile at what appears to be a mock target, with a camera mounted on board said target showing the missile hitting it with pinpoint accuracy. The Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in a statement on Monday, 20th June: ""The crew of the Soobrazitelny corvette, as part of an exercise of the Baltic Fleet, launched a missile attack on a sea target imitating a warship of a mock enemy. ""Rocket firing was carried out using the main strike weapon of the corvette - the Uran anti-ship missile system. In addition, the crew of the corvette worked out an air defense exercise at sea using the A-190 artillery system. ""After completing the fire mission, the crew of the ship conducted a series of shipboard exercises - on electronic warfare, damage control, anti-sabotage defense, organising interaction and communications between ships providing missile firing."" Lithuania announced on Friday 17th June the suspension of the transit of goods that have fallen under EU sanctions through its territory to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Kaliningrad is a Russian exclave that borders Poland and Lithuania that was captured from Nazi Germany in 1945, towards the end of World War II. Goods had until now primarily arrived there from Russia via rail, transiting through Lithuania. The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to the announcement of the suspension of the transit of goods by summoning the Lithuanian Charge d'Affaires, Virginia Umbrasene, demanding that the restrictions be lifted. Russia has said that it ""reserves the right to act to protect its national interests"", while the Governor of the Kaliningrad Oblast region, Anton Alikhanov, has announced plans for cargo vessels to begin ferrying goods between St Petersburg and the exclave. The head of the Ukrainian President’s Office Andriy Yermak said on the evening of Monday, 20th June: ""The Kremlin's attempts to threaten Lithuania are a challenge for the EU and NATO. ""Now it is important to maintain a stable position and make no concessions to Russia on sanctions and restrictions on transit of goods from Russia to Kaliningrad. Any concession will be perceived by Russia as a weakness."" And the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said at a press conference in Brussels that Lithuania is merely applying the EU's sanctions and is not taking any unilateral measures. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24th February in what the Kremlin is calling a ""special military operation"" to ""liberate the Donbass"". Today marks the 118th day of the invasion. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that between 24th February and 21st June, Russia had lost about 34,100 personnel, 1,496 tanks, 3,606 armoured combat vehicles, 752 artillery units, 239 multiple launch rocket systems, 98 air defence systems, 216 warplanes, 181 helicopters, 611 drones, 137 cruise missiles, 14 warships, 2,537 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 59 units of special equipment. The new head of the British Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, has told British forces that they need to be ready to face Russia on the battlefield and said the British Army now needs to be capable of defeating Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Ukraine's southern frontline as Ukrainian forces mount a counter attack in the region to push back Russian troops. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the war in Ukraine could last years, adding that while the costs were high, the cost of allowing Russia to achieve its military goals would be even greater. United States President Joe Biden has promised Kyiv another USD 1 billion in security assistance and weapons. And US General Mark Milley says Russia has lost around 20 to 30 per cent of its armoured force during the ongoing invasion.

The threat came as Ukrainian agents smashed a clandestine Moscow spy ring, arresting two key Ukraine figures in the capital for being on the Kremlin payroll. And in eastern Ukraine both sides took up positions in Donbas as officials warned the next few days of street to street fighting will be the “bloodiest “ yet. Each of the six Russian warships is armed with six Kalibr cruise missiles and are “most likely preparing for a massive launch of missiles on the territory of Ukraine,” said one Ukrainian official. With a range of around 1,000 miles it is possible Kyiv and western cities could be hit by the supersonic weapons. The Daily Mirror has revealed fears the Kremlin is preparing to step up missile strikes on cities throughout Ukraine including Kyiv, which remains target number one. On Tuesday governor of the Luhansk region Serhiy Gaidai said Russian forces had gained some territory in the east but said of the current situation: “It’s a calm before the storm.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had predicted Russia would step up attacks ahead of Thursday’s EU summit on Thursday which will discuss Kyiv’s wish to join the bloc and the biggest threat was to Severodonetsk. Gaidai said Russian forces controlled most of Severodonetsk, apart from the Azot chemical plant, where more than 500 civilians, including 38 children, have been sheltering for weeks. On Tuesday the first batch of German self-propelled howitzer artillery systems arrived in Ukraine in the first delivery of heavy weapons promised by Berlin. It can hit targets 25 miles away and will give Ukrainians a chance if they can beat a race against time to get them to the frontline.

It said in a statement the SBU said it had carried out a “multi-stage special operation” to neutralise the alleged spy ring.

Lieutenant-General Evgeny Buzhinsky told Russian state TV the West is playing with fire in blockading Russian exclave Kaliningrad to prevent sanctioned goods reaching the territory via NATO state Lithuania. He lashed out at British general Sir Patrick Sanders, who took command of the UK’s land forces this week with a rallying call to troops to prepare to fight and beat Russian forces in a World War 3. “He doesn’t understand that as a result of the Third World War Britain will physically cease to exist,” said Buzhinsky. “The island will vanish, so I’ve no idea where he or his descendants will live.” In his message to troops, General Sanders had said: “I am the first Chief of the General Staff since 1941 to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a continental power... “The scale of the enduring threat from Russia shows we've entered a new era of insecurity. It is my singular duty to make our Army as lethal and effective as it can be. The time is now and the opportunity is ours to seize.” Buzhinsky warned that alongside the war in Ukraine, the Kaliningrad situation is “deeply serious”, and claimed the West had ulterior motives. He urged Vladimir Putin to respond immediately by sending nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad, former the Prussian outpost of Königsberg and the country’s most westerly territory, which is wedged between Lithuania and Poland, and is also the headquarters of the Kremlin’s Baltic Fleet. “This is a long game to push us out from the Baltic Sea, an attempt to block and cut Kaliningrad off, and finally to take it away from us,” he claimed. The West intended to “block Kaliningrad economically, completely, until our people howl from destitution”. Putin should “disavow the 1991 recognition of Lithuania, disavow the agreement with the EU on Lithuania, including on their borders, then switch Lithuania off from energy"", he said. “And then finally we must take military measures."" Buzhinsky, who served in senior positions in the Russian defence ministry, urged the Kremlin to take control of the so-called Suvalkovsky corridor - the supply route across Lithuania from Russian ally Belarus. “We need to demonstratively move nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad, our Iskanders,” he told pro-Putin TV anchor Yevgeny Popov on Rossiya 1 channel. Iskander missiles are currently based in Kaliningrad but without nuclear warheads, he said. “We’ve got to do something. We’ve got to strengthen our military presence at the border with Lithuania as we did in December last year, and January this year at the border with Ukraine.” Russia should tell the Americans “first via confidential channels, that they are playing with fire"". He added: “You guys will actually play to the point that Russia won’t stop, because this is a threat to our national security, an attempt on our sovereign territory.” Buzhinsky then warned: “The world will feel it. Ukrainian grain will seem like a joke compared to our decisive steps.” He was asked: “In other words this is war with NATO?” He replied: “Yes - what else do we do? Otherwise they’ll simply strangle us. We can’t stop, otherwise they’ll deprive us of Kaliningrad.” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that all trust has now evaporated between the West and Moscow. “Relations between Russia and the West will not be back to the previous level, because Moscow will never again trust such ‘partners’,"" he told MSNBC. He warned: “It will be a lengthy crisis, but we will never trust the West again.” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the West’s action against Lithuania ""openly hostile”. “Lithuania must understand that the characterisation of Vilnius’s actions on Kaliningrad transit as ‘hostile’ means the time for talks has gone,” she told pro-Kremlin TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov. “It is them [the Lithuanian authorities] who behave aggressively. They have crossed the line of international law and towards unfriendly, rough actions. “It is them who behave provocatively, aggressively - hostile.” Lithuania had informed Kaliningrad’s railways that from June 18 the transit of some goods from Russia was limited due to EU sanctions. The Kaliningrad governor Anton Alikhanov said the move was illegal and violated the agreements that the country committed to when joining the EU. Between 2002 and 2009, Buzhinsky, 72, was head of the International Treaty Directorate and Deputy Head of the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation at the Russian Ministry of Defence.",29,3.081398656405307,4.569446978072696,-1.4880483216673888,10

Lieutenant-Colonel Sergey Gundorov, 51, was struck near Volnovakha in the Donbas. The military helicopter flew on after being hit with a portable surface-to-air missile. His stricken Mi-35 touched the ground before cartwheeling over a narrow strip of woodland and crashing in a fireball in a field. Flames and black smoke are seen emanating from the explosion. A second Russian helicopter is seen firing decoy flares and apparently escapes unscathed. Gundorov is the 55th known Russian colonel to be killed in Vladimir Putin ’s war in Ukraine. A Russian account on the death of the high-ranked pilot, first class, said: “Bright eternal memory to the Hero who left on his last flight. “Pilots don't die, they fly into the sky…The best men are leaving us.” He died after completing a “combat mission”, it was claimed. Gundorov had previously won three Orders of Courage. He died on June 16, but his loss is only now acknowledged. Among condolences to the colonel, a married father of two, was a message from his teenage younger son Ilya saying simply: “Love you Dad.” Family pictures show him with his sons and wife Anzhela. His death follows the loss of two colonels announced on the same day last week — highly decorated Colonel Sergei Krasnikov, 56, who had volunteered to re-join the forces to go to war, and Colonel Sergei Postnov - in his 40s. Putin has also lost at least 11 generals. At the start of June, Putin was dealt a fresh blow as a colonel close to Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov was seriously wounded in a gun battle. Lieutenant Colonel Mezhid Utsmigov was hit during a brutal battle - just after Kadyrov used Putin’s absence at the Kremlin to gain promises from Moscow that the war would proceed at a “faster pace”. Colonel Utsmigov is deputy commander of a special forces regiment named after Kadyrov’s father and is close to Putin. Kadyrov is a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin and has used his power to deploy troops to support the warmonger in his war in Ukraine. Colonel Utsmigov and his forces were retreating from Ukrainian shelling in the Luhansk Region when he was hit in the leg and concussed, according to Ukrainian sources. The soldier's defeat came soon after Kadyrov was boasting about winning a “faster pace” for the war following meetings in Moscow with Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu and FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov. “We’ll make Russia ’s real patriots happy and may our enemies die,” he promised. He continued: ""The measures adopted will allow for increasing the efficacy of the offensive manoeuvres, which facilitates conducting the special operation at a faster pace."" Overall Russian losses are believed to be in excess of 30,000, with some estimates of nearer to 50,000.",14,6.578160666366477,4.637901154925018,1.9402595114414591,11

Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov shared the footage on Sunday which shows heavily damaged buildings and the dead bodies of Ukrainian troops. Metiolkine village was destroyed in the fighting and is now under the control of the pro-Russian Lugansk People's Republic (LPR). Head of the Chechen Republic Kadyrov told how the LPR and Akhmat special forces cleared the village ""from the enemy."" He wrote: ""Most of the Ukrainian military voluntarily laid down their arms, and those who try to resist are destroyed on the spot. ""This settlement was of great strategic importance for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, since from here the Ukrainian Nazis had the opportunity to break into Severodonetsk and divert the forces of Russian troops from the Azot plant. ""But no such luck. The village was cleared of nationalists, mines and 'secrets'."" He added: ""I express my sincere gratitude to my dear brother, assistant to the Head of the Chechen Republic for the Apta Alaudinov security unit, to all the personnel of the Chechen special forces and the second corps of the LPR People's Militia for high-quality and productive work. ""Very little time will pass and the whole Donbass will praise your names for ridding the country of nationalist scum."" The fall of Metiolkine village was also confirmed by Ukrainian politician Serhiy Haidai on Monday. It comes amid Russia's efforts to tighten the noose around thousands of Ukrainian troops near two strategically important cities in the east. Mr Haidai, governor of Luhansk Oblast, told how ""Russian fascists"" cranked up artillery and air fire in the area in a bid to secure Sievierodonetsk. ""The Russians are working hard on the Sievierodonetsk industrial zone and the outskirts of the city,"" he said. ""The same is true in the Toshkivka and Ustynivka districts, because the orcs want to make a breakthrough there, and for this purpose they have gathered a large amount of equipment there. ""Battles are taking place in many villages around Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Unfortunately, we do not currently control Metiolkine near the centre of the oblast."" Mr Haidai described 'creeping' tactics used by 'the orcs' and said that Luhansk Oblast ""is destroyed with all possible weapons."" He continued: ""'Silent' evacuation continues from Lysychansk by military administration staff, police, rescuers and volunteers. ""From settlements where active hostilities proceed, people are taken out by the military on armoured vehicles."" He later told of ""lots more shelling"" from artillery and the air with the ""entire perimeter of the city"" being targeted. "" Russia poured in a huge amount of equipment, dozens of tanks, and heavy artillery,"" he said. ""But the loss of one settlement is not yet a lost war. You must believe in the Ukrainian Armed Forces."" As fighting continues in the east, Vladimir Putin lost his 55th colonel who crashed in his helicopter after being hit with a Ukrainian missile.

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the West must increase the supply of weapons to liberate the Donbas region from Russian control. He said the costs of the conflict, including energy and food hikes, were high but the price of letting Moscow triumph was even greater. He said: “We must prepare for the fact that it could take years. We must not let up in supporting Ukraine.” On a trip to the heavily bombed Black Sea city of Mykolaiv, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said: “We will not give away the south to anyone, we will return everything that’s ours.” British defence chiefs say four months of brutal fighting in Ukraine seems to be straining troop morale on both sides.Russian soldiers are deserting and defying orders, even staging armed stand-offs with superior officers. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “Russian morale highly likely remains especially troubled”. He added that many Russian soldiers of all ranks “likely remain confused about the war’s objectives”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “Everything will depend on whether Ukraine can strengthen its ability to defend its soil faster than Russia can renew its capacity to attack.” There is growing concern for British combat medic John Harding, 59, not seen since being captured by pro-Russian forces last month in Mariupol.

Colonel-General Andrey Serdyukov, 60, has paid the price of devastating “mass casualties” among paratroopers, it was alleged. The speculation comes as one Russian source suggested the country’s overall losses in Ukraine are close to 50,000 - significantly higher than most other estimates. Unconfirmed Ukrainian sources cited by Odessa military-civilian spokesman Serhiy Bratchuk say that Putin has axed Serdyukov and replaced him with Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky, 53, current chief of staff of the Central Military District who was born in Donetsk region. Serdyukov was sanctioned by Britain as having Ukrainian blood on his hands in the wake of the Bucha horrors. If his axing is true this “would indicate that Serdyukov is being held responsible for the poor performance of, and high casualties, among Russian [airborne] units, particularly in early operations around Kyiv. “Continued dismissals and possible internal purges of senior Russian officers will likely further degrade poor Russian command and control capabilities and the confidence of Russian officers.” There has been no indication from Moscow that Serdyukov has been ousted. He is a ""Hero of Russia "" - the country’s highest honour - and is seen as one of the country’s ablest military minds. Izvestia said he commanded the operation to annex Crimea from Ukraine in the spring of 2014. Russia has announced very few of the myriad changes Putin has made among commanders during the war which started on 24 February. But several sources claim that Putin is personally micromanaging war decisions and wielding the axe on commanders he sees as under performing. Telegram channel General SVR alleged that the overall Russian army toll in the Ukraine conflict is now 37,592. Add to this were the alleged losses of 9,457 fighters from private military companies backing the Russian war effort, said the channel. Additionally, the Russian national guard - which reports directly to Putin - has suffered 1,788 losses, it claimed. The channel said that these figures had been reported directly to Putin, but provided no evidence of this. It was not possible to verify this claim. If correct, it would mean overall military losses of 48,837. It contrasts with other figures which suggest Putin has lost in excess of 30,000 troops.",14,3.9280745806435524,3.970346484853298,-0.04227190420974569,11

Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, along with Moroccan Sadun Brahim, 21, were captured during the attempted defence of Mariupol. The Brits appeared in court in the separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and will appeal against the barbaric sentence. Another British detainee Andrew Hill, 35, a father of four from Plymouth, has also been warned to expect the death penalty when his verdict is handed down. MP Aleksey Zhuravlyov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defence committee, told Rossiya 1 state TV the DPR intends to execute them with British weapons and bullets. He said: “I like the way the DPR is performing their international obligations. “As I was told…the shooting will be performed with a British weapon, and a British bullet. “And then this bullet will be sent to the British relatives who will be made to pay for it. In roubles…converting from pounds.” Kremlin-loyalist TV anchor Yevgeny Popov intervened to say this was “a mockery”. The hardline MP hit back: “Why mockery? No mockery, we need just to finish these bastards off. “Without any negotiations. No need even to mock them. I saw what they are doing with my own eyes, personally so I have no mercy for them. “All those b******s who came here from Britain must be eliminated.

Colonel Sergei Postnov was killed on a combat mission earlier this week, according to reports. He was part of a military propaganda unit in the Russian National Guard, which reports directly to Putin. He had been on active duty with Russian forces close to Kyiv, in Kharkiv as well as more recently in the Luhansk region. It is unclear exactly how and where he was killed. An official statement said that his life was “cut short” while on a mission in Ukraine. It said he had “performed service and combat missions in the zone of the special military operation in Ukraine” from the start of Putin’s active campaign on February 24. “He was distinguished by high professionalism, organisation and diligence, and a creative approach to solving problems,” said the Russian Interior Ministry’s council of veterans. He was a graduate of the Yekaterinburg Suvorov Military School in 1997, and believed to be in his 40s. His death was the latest in a huge toll of Russian top brass to be wiped out in Putin’s war in Ukraine. He is the 53rd colonel known to have died, while a minimum of 11 generals have also been slain. Overall Russian losses are believed to be in excess of 30,000. Postnov leaves behind a widow Ekaterina and daughter. Last month The Mirror told how two more Russian colonels had been killed in Russia’s war in Ukraine - including the country’s “best paratroop commander”. Lt-Col Alexander Dosyagayev, 34, was a commander of an airborne assault battalion of the 104th paratrooper regiment. Troops from his 104th air assault regiment were reportedly in Bucha, which was the scene of alleged rape and torture atrocities by Vladimir Putin ’s forces earlier in the war. His battalion based in Pskov had been recognised as the best in Russia in checks on combat training and military discipline. At the military festival ‘Army of Russia-2021’, he was judged the winner of the Winged Infantry category.

Defiant Kyiv ignored Moscow’s surrender demands as Russia continued to attack with rockets, mortars and machine guns. More than 500 civilians, including 40 children, are stranded at the Azot chemical plant. If the ruined city falls, President Vladimir Putin will celebrate the capture of Luhansk, one of two contested Donbas regions. Severodonetsk has for weeks been the main focal point of the war and more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops are defending the position. Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk said: “We are trying to push the enemy towards the city centre... this is an ongoing situation with partial successes and tactical retreats. The escape routes are dangerous, but there are some.” The Azot bombardment echoes the siege of the Azovstal steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, which fell to Putin’s forces last month.

The private, 46-year-old Sergei who wanted to be known only by his last name in line with military rules in the region, had left his bunker to smoke but had a breeze out his cigarette. “I took one step around the wall to get out of the wind exactly when there was an explosion,” he said. “If I hadn’t been trying to light my cigarette I’d be dead."" The dad-of-one, a Russian-born welder, was concussed by the 120mm artillery shell blast in Rubizhne, The Sun reports. The city is now under Kremlin control. Sergei signed up for his adopted homeland when the war began in February. According to Sergei, Chechen forces loyal to their leader along with Putin stooge Ramzan Kadyrov had fought his men in street-to-street battles. “They put their guns over compound walls and sprayed bullets,” he added. “We were a few metres away. We threw grenades.” The soldier was dismissive of how difficult life was on the front line, saying it was “just like dangerous camping”. “The hardest thing was the Russian bodies because they just left them,” he said. News of the hero’s survival comes amid reports of Russian forces swarming into the neary city of Severodonetsk on Monday, bombing an area sheltering hundreds of civilians and mirroring the horror Mariupol assault. Moscow’s troops now control about 70% of the key city, which sits northwest of Rubizhne. Troops are reportedly trying to cut off around 500 locals sheltering in an industrial complex - just like Mariupol. The assault on the ruined Luhanks city - whose toppling will mark a major Russian victory - underlined a desperate race for western weapons to get to Ukraine’s frontline. Pro-Moscow separatists claimed the last bridge out of Severodonetsk had been destroyed and Ukrainian defenders there must now surrender or die. Ukraine said there was still another way out via the city’s last remaining bridge although that route was severely damaged. Ukraine has issued increasingly urgent calls for more Western weapons to help defend Severodonetsk, which Kyiv says is a battle for control of the eastern Donbas region. Regional governor Sergei Gadai said:""The battles are so fierce that fighting for not just a street but for a single high-rise building can last for days.” He said: ""Russians continue to storm the city, having a significant advantage in artillery they have somewhat pushed back the Ukrainian soldiers. ""About 500 civilians remain on the grounds of the Azot plant in Severodonetsk, 40 of them are children. Sometimes the military manages to evacuate someone.” Ukraine's account of civilians trapped in an industrial plant echoed the fall of Mariupol last month, where hundreds of civilians and badly wounded Ukrainian soldiers were holed up for weeks.",17,4.672236437238315,4.974983894722383,-0.3027474574840685,25

Since Vladimir Putin ’s invasion on February 24, thousands are now thought to have lost their lives with death tolls racking up at an alarming rate on both sides. Speaking to the BBC, the presidential adviser to Ukraine ’s Volodymyr Zelensky, Mykhaylo Podolyak, said that between 100 and 200 soldiers are dying every day. Putin’s grotesque and nightmarish war has seen the names of many towns and cities become synonyms for horror. Nowhere more so than Mariupol in the south-east of the country, where troops and civilians came under months of siege, culminating in a brutal last stand in the Azovstal Steel Works. Now though, a new town has lent its name to the list of places associated with the violence that has happened there - Sievierodonetsk. Sievierodonetsk is situated in the east of Ukraine, in the Luhansk Oblast - one of the two parts of the Donbas region that have become the focus of the war alongside Donetsk. Nestled to the north-east of the Siverskyi Donets river, it has become of high tactical importance to both sides in the war. All bridges into the town from neighbouring Lysychansk across the river are now reported to have been rendered unusable, leaving Ukrainian defenders unable to evacuate the remaining civilians still stuck there. Two bridges are understood to have been destroyed and the third is old and not safe. 70% of the city is now thought to have fallen into Russian control, although Ukrainian troops are still said to be able to get their wounded to hospitals. It is thought that, at the time of writing, around 10,000 civilians remain in the besieged city, just one-tenth of the pre-war population of 100,000. Lysychansk on the west bank of the river is one of the few areas in Luhansk not under Russian control, although it is reported to be regularly shelled by Russia. President Zelensky has voiced his concerns about the battle and has given an address to stress the need for extra weapons to help with the fight there. He said: ""Only a sufficient number of modern artillery will ensure our advantage."" ""The battles in Donbas will surely go down in military history as one of the most brutal battles in Europe.

As a result, several cases have been reported of Russian sappers blowing themselves up trying to place said mines.” Meanwhile a new report claims the likelihood of nuclear missile strikes has shot up to the highest level since the end of the Cold War . After 35 years of gradual de-escalation, flare-ups between nuclear-armed states are predicted to continue into the next decade, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) , an arms watchdog. At the height of the Cold War - a nuclear stalemate between Russia and the US - there were almost 70,000 warheads circulating across the globe.",14,4.431926565503021,4.756934641295955,-0.3250080757929341,9
2022-06-13,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-state-tv-gloats-over-27215079,Russian state TV gloats over sham ruling of Brit fighters condemned to death,"Russia’s propaganda machine has openly mocked Brits sentenced to death on live broadcasts to millions of viewers. Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were last week convicted of taking action towards violent seizure of power at a show trial in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. They, along with Moroccan Sadun Brahim, 21, have been warned they face the death penalty, with a firing squad rumoured to be preparing to take their lives. Another British detainee Andrew Hill, 35, a father of four from Plymouth, has also been warned to expect the punishment when his verdict is handed down The Kremlin’s propaganda machine has openly gloated about the shocking result at the sham trial, which was condemned by world leaders and organisations. RT reporter Roman Kosarev told Russian state TV that Aslin and Pinner “were simply writhing like eels trying to defend themselves somehow”. Footage was shown of Pinner dancing in military fatigues before his surrender to the pro-Putin forces in Mariupol. Troika Telegram channel vindictively posted the dancing footage with the caption: “Shaun Pinner when he learnt he would be hanged in a square in Donetsk.” Their hopes for leniency have been dashed as the man responsible for hearing their pardon pleas has indicated he believes the men deserve to die. Putin stooge Denis Pushilin, head of puppet Donetsk People’s Republic puppet state, was quoted saying putting the men to death was “just punishment”. Meanwhile Russian state TV anchorwoman Olga Skabeyeva - known as Putin’s “Iron Doll” - claimed Secretary of State Liz Truss faces problems as it was on her “orders” the Brits went to fight for Ukraine. She told viewers: “London aims to work on freeing Pinner and Aslin, but they don’t know how to do it. “ Liz Truss, the head of the Foreign Office, called the sentence illegal and promised to pull the Englishmen out — and do it via Kyiv. Good luck, Liz. “The British Government also said they were deeply concerned by the DPR issuing death sentences. Boris Johnson ’s representative even remembered - out of the blue! - some Geneva Conventions and combatants’ immunity. “As if the Brits should not stand trial for taking part in a safari [killing] Russians.… “And a separate question to tank driver Liz Truss, who says she would do everything to bring the Brits back…but on 27 February, Liz Truss called on all interested Brits to sign up as volunteers to the Ukrainian front. ""While right now Liz Truss can’t even find time to see the families of those who were sentenced in Donetsk, and who fought on her orders.” Truss - loathed by the Kremlin for her forthright demands for the West to arm Ukraine, and being pictured on a British tank close to the Russian border - was also blasted by leading propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, another TV host known as ‘Putin’s Voice’. He interviewed the so-called DPR’s “foreign minister” Natalia Nikonorova. She alleged the British men had come to Ukraine to kill people “for money”, and this is why they were sentenced to death. Previously the ex-UK army comrade of a Mr Pinner branded the 'disgraceful' judgement a war crim e. Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan is a former comrade of Mr Pinner’s as they served in the same Royal Anglian Regiment together. ""This is disgraceful and I utterly condemn it. “Shaun is a soldier and should be treated as such. “This decision is a war crime and contravenes the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war.”",13,6.068961043793629,6.073505689367202,-0.004544645573573369,23

Niinisto said during security policy talks at his summer residence in Naantali, Finland, that Russia has begun to use ""very powerful"" weapons, including illegal thermobaric bombs ""that are in fact weapons of mass destruction"". Ukraine and NATO countries have also accused Russia of using thermobaric bombs, which are also known as vacuum bombs and have much more brutal consequences than conventional explosives. A CIA report said thermobaric bombs can cause ""many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness.” The pressure wave from the explosive destroys delicate air sacs or can cause an embolism, as the wide area of the ignited particles makes people 'suck in' oxygen in the first stage of the blast. Niinisto's remarks come as new evidence shows scores of civilians have been killed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv by indiscriminate Russian shelling using widely banned cluster munitions. Amnesty International said in a new report that Russian forces caused widespread death and destruction by relentlessly bombarding residential neighbourhoods in the city. Amnesty found evidence of Russian forces repeatedly using 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions which are subject to international treaty bans because of their indiscriminate effects. They also used unguided rockets - such as Grads and Uragans - which have a margin of error of more than 100 metres, all of which are banned under international law. In residential areas where buildings are no more than a few metres apart, inaccuracies are much more likely to cost civilian lives and cause widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure. The human rights group said: ""The continued use of such inaccurate explosive weapons in populated civilian areas, in the knowledge that they are repeatedly causing large numbers of civilian casualties, may even amount to directing attacks against the civilian population."" Veronica Cherevychko, a 30-year-old logistics manager, lost her right leg when a Grad rocket struck a playground in front of her home in the Saltivka neighbourhood, in the northeastern region of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine. She told Amnesty: “I was sitting on this bench when the explosion happened. I remember hearing a whistling sound just before the explosion. ""Then I woke up in hospital, without a leg; my right leg was gone. Now my life is divided into before 12 March and after 12 March. I will get used to this. ""Now I am not yet used to it; I often try to touch my leg, to scratch my foot … I don’t know what to say about [the] people who did it. I will never understand them.”",17,5.331054257553547,5.307153681996812,0.02390057555673497,27

Moscow’s troops now control about 70% of the key city and are trying to cut off around 500 locals sheltering in an industrial complex - just like Mariupol. The assault on the ruined Luhanks city - whose toppling will mark a major Russian victory - underlined a desperate race for western weapons to get to Ukraine’s frontline. Pro-Moscow separatists claimed the last bridge out of Severodonetsk had been destroyed and Ukrainian defenders there must now surrender or die. Ukraine said there was still another way out via the city’s last remaining bridge although that route was severely damaged. Ukraine has issued increasingly urgent calls for more Western weapons to help defend Severodonetsk, which Kyiv says is a battle for control of the eastern Donbas region. Regional governor Sergei Gadai said:""The battles are so fierce that fighting for not just a street but for a single high-rise building can last for days.” Russian forces now control about 70% of Severodonetsk, he said, and were destroying it in one of the bloodiest assaults since they launched their invasion on Feb. 24. He said: ""Russians continue to storm the city, having a significant advantage in artillery they have somewhat pushed back the Ukrainian soldiers. ""About 500 civilians remain on the grounds of the Azot plant in Severodonetsk, 40 of them are children. Sometimes the military manages to evacuate someone.” Ukraine's account of civilians trapped in an industrial plant echoed the fall of Mariupol last month, where hundreds of civilians and badly wounded Ukrainian soldiers were holed up for weeks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said severe fighting was ongoing in the Donbas, ""literally for every metre"" and that child casualties of attacks had created a lasting image of Russia for the rest of the world. He said: ""Not Peter the Great… but children injured and killed in Russian attacks.” He referred to President Vladimir Putin's comparison of Moscow's military campaign to Russian emperor Peter the Great's 18th century conquest of lands held by Sweden. So far 288 Ukrainian children have been killed by the February 24 Russian invasion and 527 injured. Post bombing assessment shows Russian cruise missiles destroyed a large ammo and weapons depot in Ternopil, west Ukraine, according to Moscow. If true, it marks a fresh bid by Putin's forces to pin down transport hubs for weapons from west to east. Yesterday President Zelensky’s office delivered a massive shopping list of deadly weaponry it needs urgently to beat Russia. It includes 1,000 howitzer artillery systems, 300 Multi Launch Rocket Systems, 500 tanks. 2,000 armoured Vehicles and 1,000 drones. Last night (Mon) Ukraine claimed Russia’s total troop losses are now 32, 300 dead. Latest figures said 1, 432 Russian tanks had been destroyed, along with 3,492 armoured personnel vehicles. Kyiv said 178 of Moscow’s helicopters had been blown up along with 585 drones.",14,6.15696843857033,5.084517397630451,1.072451040939879,25

According to the Ministry of Defence, the five-and-a-half-ton missiles, designed to target aircraft carriers, are causing ""significant collateral damage and civilian casualties"" to Ukraine's forces in the Donbas region. “When employed in a ground-attack role with a conventional warhead they are highly inaccurate and can, therefore, cause significant collateral damage and civilian casualties,” said the MoD. It comes as the Russian army concentrates its efforts on capturing the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Ukraine remains in control of the Azot chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, which makes up half of Donbas, where hundreds of civilians are sheltering amid bitter fighting, the region's governor said. Russian shelling has ignited a fire at the plant after a leak of tonnes of oil, according to the governor, Serhiy Haidai. Ukraine has around 800 people hiding in bomb shelters underneath the plant, including about 200 employees and 600 local residents, with fears Azot could become another Azovstal – in reference to the siege in the Mariupol steelworks that lasted weeks. The MoD said that there was now “intense street-to-street fighting” and that “both sides are likely suffering high numbers of casualties”, reports the Telegraph. Ukraine has appealed for swifter deliveries of heavy weapons from the West to turn the tide of the war, saying Russian forces have at least 10 times more artillery pieces. The news comes on the back of a Ukrainian artillery strike reportedly killing hundreds of soldiers on June 11. Footage emerged showing a large ammo store on fire after it was allegedly hit – leaving just one survivor. Private soldiers from Russia's infamous Wagner Group were reportedly using the sports arena as a base in Kadiivka, eastern Ukraine. The Wagner Group are considered Putin's private army and have operated across the world. The Russian president is claimed to have used the group to give himself plausible deniability as they are not explicitly tied to the Kremlin. The 8,000 strong group have been accused of killing children, raping and torturing women and carrying out executions. It is reported up to 300 mercenaries were killed in the attack in what would be one of the biggest losses of life since the war in Ukraine commenced in in February.",17,4.319456628400898,5.325295065790925,-1.005838437390027,29

Senior sergeant Alexei Bakulev was personally presented with his trophy by Russia ’s defence minister. The 26-year-old won a succession of war game competitions in his T-72 but said when the war started in Ukraine that he wanted to be in a “real fight”. Bakulev was killed from shrapnel wounds as he covered a retreat by his forces, it has been claimed. The location where he died was not revealed. A picture shows him being presented with a trophy by defence minister Sergei Shoigu. He was a world champion in tank biathlon in 2017, and winner of Russia’s prestigious Army Cup two years later. At the start of the brutal conflict in which Russia is believed to have suffered 30,000-plus losses, he said he craved testing his war game skills in a real conflict. “I want, to be honest, to be in a real fight,” he said. “I hope that my relatives will understand this desire if the time comes.” He was a native of Verkh-Uimon village in the remote Altai Mountains in Siberia. The Kremlin has lost at least 11 generals and 52 colonels in the brutal conflict yet despite the heavy toll, there is little sign of the mass dissent against Putin inside authoritarian Russia that the West hoped to see. Earlier this month a Russian fighter went public with his complaints of exhaustion and fighting conditions in eastern Ukraine as the war shows no signs of abating. One soldier who had fought near Kyiv, Kharkiv and is now in eastern Ukraine, complained to the Guardian of his desperate exhaustion. Andrei, who serves with the 37th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade headquartered in Buryatia in Siberia, said he had even contacted a lawyer to find out whether his deployment to the front is even legal. He also complained that he had not seen his wife for months. “I have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the war, it has been over three months now,"" Andrei said. ""It is exhausting, my whole unit wants a break, but our leadership said they can’t replace us right now.""

A Russian company commander showed off the captured tents and other war ""trophies"" as he guided a pro-Kremlin journalist around his base in the Kherson region of Ukraine. However, the Kremlin commander bitterly complained about equipment shortages, claiming he lacked gun sights, drones, night vision devices and radios. Some of his troops were even using using antique Mosin-Nagant sniper rifles, with one of them dating back to 1943. It comes after multiple reports of supply and equipment shortages within the Russian army. The Kherson commander, who was not named, told pro-Kremlin journalist Patrick Lancaster: ""The tents belonged to the escaped Ukrainian army. ""They left them, so now the tents are our trophies, where people live. The cars are also trophies. ""We even have a field sauna. Also a trophy!"" However, the commander admitted his troops were lacking in certain equipment. ""You've see we've gotten some trophies. What we are lacking is drones... we are lacking gunsights. We are lacking night vision devices. And certainly we really need communication tools,"" he said. The journalist also interviewed a Russian sniper platoon at the base. The men were using antiquated Mosin-Nagant rifles from World War Two. One of the snipers said: ""It is (made in) 1943. Our grandparents fought with it."" Another member of the platoon held up his rifle and showed the serial number, proving it was manufactured in 1944. Mr Lancaster is an American ""journalist"" who has been embedded with pro-Russian forces over the last few years. His YouTube video comes after numerous reports exposed how Russian troops were woefully unprepared when they invaded Ukraine. Military observers noticed that Kremlin convoys appeared to only move during daylight hours, probably because the crew did not have adequate night vision devices. Many Russian soldiers have been using analogue radios to communicate on the battlefield. It has allowed a community of online sleuths to monitor their communications and share them publicly, often exposing their plans and locations. Meanwhile, the Russian army also appeared to have failed to invest in satellite mapping and GPS technology, with their soldiers struggling to navigate across the country using out-of-date Soviet-era paper maps.

Even presenter Vladimir Solovyov, a Vladimir Putin mouthpiece who has his own show and regularly champions the current Russian regime, appeared shocked by the direction of the discussion and said it was ""chaos"" to be discussing how people should be executed in the 21st century. British citizens Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were captured in Ukraine after travelling to fight against the Russian invasion. They and Moroccan-born Brahim Saadoun were sentenced to death by a Russian-backed court in Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). They are said to have admitted ""training in order to carry out terrorist activities"". According to reports, the so-called trial lasted just three days and the three are to appeal - which they must do so within a month. In footage shared by Ria Novosti on social media on Wednesday, a translator can be heard asking Mr Aslin if he would ""plead guilty"" to an offence, to which he replied: ""Yes."" The video appeared to show the two Britons and the Morrocon in the dock in the pro-Russian territory's supreme court. Mr Pinner was facing more severe charges after allegedly admitting to ""seizing power by force"". On Russian State TV a discussion was held over whether the Brits should be shot or hung if they are sentenced to death, reported the Daily Star. Solovyov, the presenter, asked about what should happen now to the captives: “What can the British Empire respond with if two of its subjects are shot or hanged?” The sickening debate, shared by journalist Julia Davis on Twitter, saw pundit Yaakov Kedmi convinced that the British citizens be hanged. “Pirates are never executed by shooting, only hanging,” he said. “Military gets shot, criminals get hanged.” Solovyov disagreed: “But we’re not dealing with pirates and these are not the Middle Ages, we don’t do quartering, we don’t care whether others execute by hanging.” The discussion then moved to the history of hangings in Russia, and Kedmi’s point that there were public executions at the end of WW2 was ridiculed, with Solovyov saying times have moved on. He said: “We’re in the 21st century in the centre of Europe, holding discussions about how to execute mercenaries, to hang them, shoot them or quarter them? This is the new world. “This is chaos, we’re descending into chaos.” Russia has been hit hard by sanctions from the West since invading Ukraine, and another pundit, Malek Dudakov, suggested that rather than executing the prisoners, the Brits could be used as a bartering tool for lifting these economic barriers. “Why can’t we use the current situation to offer them to Britain in exchange for Russia’s frozen holdings?” he said. “We know that their elites likely won’t go for it; they’ve already shown unwillingness to compromise, but this will cause a storm in British society.”",13,4.367048038859725,2.4221049674952884,1.9449430713644364,23

Britain and other Western countries have condemned the threat of execution facing Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, along with a Moroccan Sadun Brahim, 21, who was tried with them. All have one month to appeal, and can also seek a pardon from the head of the pro-Putin separatist region, which in intentional paw is part of Ukraine. A third British detainee Andrew Hill, 35, a father from Plymouth, has also been told to expect the death penalty when his verdict is handed down. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called it a ""sham judgement"" and with ""absolutely no legitimacy”, while No.10 said it was “deeply concerned” at the failure to treat the men as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. Russian nationalist MP Aleksey Zhuravlyov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defence committee, went on state TV Rossiya 1 to urge that appeals should be rejected and they should be shot dead. Then other “scum” and “beasts” - international fighters in Ukraine - will realise they should leave Ukraine now. “So, the bastards still have another month of life,” said the politician on state TV referring to the Britons convicted of being mercenaries, engaging in terrorism and plotting to overthrow the authorities. “Let them live, try to appeal the sentence, somehow. “But I hope it will stay without any changes. “Then it will be clear to all who are fighting now, like Georgians and other scum, that or you will die out there, beasts “Or you will be anyway shot by a court decision. “So you have no options - gather your things and leave quickly. “You cannot do anything there.” Russian state TV propagandist anchorman Vladimir Solovyov claimed there was now “panic” in Boris Johnson ’s government over the death sentences since they had no way to exert influence on Moscow and the DPR authorities to spare the men. “Now there is actually a panic situation in England,” he said. “The death penalty as an exceptional punishment for those convicted. “Now begins the hardest moment. “Liz Truss [UK foreign secretary] screams that it's all illegal, that it's all awful. “She should resign, because all this blather about 'I will now talk to the Ukrainian authorities', what will it do? “The Ukrainian government cannot influence in any way. “Liz Truss cannot talk to the Russian authorities. “The [British] have completely screwed up relations [with us]. “Boris Johnson and Liz Truss are going to fight to the last Ukrainian. “Now what are they going to do [about the British men sentenced to death]? “What are they going to do?” Solovyov suggested they could face a “firing squad”. Separately, Channel One in Russia accused Truss of “demagoguery”, reporting that the Geneva Convention did not apply to “mercenaries”. ""The reaction of the convicted men can be seen from their faces - downcast and bewildered,"" said the state-controlled channel. ""They pleaded guilty including to a charge of training for terrorist activities, but in fact they didn't just train.” Pinner had “shot at civilians”, according to other captives, said the report.\ However, five supposed witnesses did not attend what in the West has been labelled a “show trial”. State-owned Rossiya 1 reported that “nobody from the British authorities has been in contact with the republic's leaders or law-enforcement agencies about the fate of the convicted mercenaries”. Aslin was shown saying ahead of the death sentence: ""I would like to apologise to the residents of Donetsk. I hoped that the sentence would be more just, taking into account that I cooperated with the investigation and that I surrendered voluntarily to the Donetsk people's republic. “I hoped for a different sentence. I shall face divine judgement when the time comes."" There are claims that Moscow wants to use the British men as pawns to seek releases of Putin supporters held by Ukraine.

The Cabinet minister will speak to Ukraine ’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba by phone after she condemned the “sham” judgement against Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner. It is understood the meeting has been in the diary for a few days but the case will be raised. But the Foreign Secretary has resisted holding direct talks with Russia - as demanded by one of the two men's local MP Robert Jenrick, who wants her to summon the Russian Ambassador. UK officials claim it would give credibility to Russia’s ""sham"" claims that the men are mercenaries. Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were convicted of taking action towards violent seizure of power at a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. A third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, was convicted alongside Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner. The UK maintains that as members of the Ukrainian army the men are prisoners of war and therefore should be protected by international law. Britain believes the men are being exploited for Russia’s political ends and it could end in a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine. Robert Jenrick, Tory MP for one of the two men, told the Mirror: ""If it is resolved it's going to be via a prisoner exchange. Both sides have at least a couple of thousands of the other side's personnel."" He added: “This disgusting Soviet-era show trial is the latest reminder of the depravity of Putin’s regime.” Ms Truss said yesterday: “I utterly condemn the sentencing of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner held by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine. “They are prisoners of war. This is a sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy. “My thoughts are with the families. We continue to do everything we can to support them.” A Foreign Office Spokesperson said: “We are working with the government of Ukraine on the detention of British Nationals. “We condemn the exploitation of Prisoners of War for political purposes. They are entitled to combatant immunity and should not be prosecuted for participation in hostilities.” Mr Aslin, originally from Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, and Mr Pinner were both members of regular Ukrainian military units fighting in Mariupol, the southern port city which was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting since Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Aslin is thought to have a Ukrainian partner and other members of his family are still in Newark where they are prominent members of the local community. Mr Jenrick, who represents the Newark constituency, called for the Russian ambassador to the UK to be summoned to the Foreign Office. He said it ""has been a fraudulent show trial, we shouldn’t give it any credibility whatsoever"", adding: “They’re not mercenaries, they are British citizens who chose to join the Ukrainian army for personal reasons before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.” It comes after a friend of Mr Aslin said the death sentences will ""invigorate"" those still resisting Russia's advances. Brennan Phillips, an American former soldier who met Mr Aslin in Syria and worked alongside him in Ukraine, said the judgement is a ""provocation"". Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mr Phillips said: ""I think it will invigorate people more than anything. ""Whatever effect they thought they would have in this provocation, I don't think that and I don't think it's going to be well-received. And they did this as a provocation."" Tory MP Bob Seely, who sits on the foreign affairs select committee, accused Russia of breaking international law. ""I very much hope they are not killed quickly - they may be killed quickly as shock value,"" the Isle of Wight MP told the BBC. ""But if, as everyone expects, they are not then they will be held as a diplomatic tool and I think the bigger picture here - what is happening - is that the Russians are going to become increasingly aggressive as part of the indirect conflict against the Baltic republics, against the Poles, against the UK and others who are close to the Ukrainian government and are supporting the Ukrainians in the conflict."" A No 10 spokesman said: ""We are obviously deeply concerned by this. We have said continually that prisoners of war shouldn't be exploited for political purposes. ""Under the Geneva Convention, prisoners of war are entitled to combatant immunity and they should not be prosecuted for participation in hostilities. ""So we will continue to work with the Ukrainian authorities to try to secure the release of any British nationals who were serving in the Ukrainian armed forces and who are being held as prisoners of war.""",13,2.5378710035281347,3.9576642189998243,-1.4197932154716897,23

The autocratic ruler - who is lauded for modernising the country by the Russian public - lead battles including against the Ottomans and seized land from Sweden in the Great Northern War. While he made Russia an empire, he was also a monstrous tyrant and during one revolt of guardsmen he mercilessly beheaded five of them himself and even had his own son imprisoned and tortured. ""It seemed [Peter] was fighting with Sweden and seizing territories,"" Putin told his audience of young engineers, entrepreneurs and scientists. ""He wasn't seizing anything! He was taking it back!"" ""What was (Peter) doing? Taking back and reinforcing,” he said. “That's what he did. And it looks like it fell on us to take back and reinforce as well.” Finland's President Sauli Niinisto was due to meet with Sweden's King Carl Gustav XVI and Queen Silvia on the island of Åland but the meeting was abruptly cancelled - with speculation it was due to Putin's comments. During the meeting of Russia's best and brightest young adults, he also admitted the public will need to wait a decade before they can shake the constraints of Western sanctions. A member of the audience asked him: ""So will we live better in 10 years’ time?” He replied: “Yes, in the end this [reaching the goals I have set] will lead to a better life quality.” It comes as Sweden said it will look to make constructive progress in talks with Turkey on Erdogan's objection to them joining NATO. Finland and Sweden applied to join NATO last month in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine but face opposition from Turkey. Erdogan has accused them of supporting and harbouring Kurdish militants and other groups it deems terrorists. The objections caught Finnish, Swedish and many NATO officials by surprise and have dimmed prospects for rapid progress on the membership bids ahead of a NATO summit in Madrid later this month. ""Our application has received broad support among NATO members,"" she said in a foreign policy declaration in the Swedish parliament. ""Our ambition is to, in a constructive spirit, make progress on the questions that Turkey has raised."" Linde added that there should be no doubts that Sweden stood together with allies against terrorism. Sweden's government survived a no-confidence vote on Tuesday with the help of a lawmaker whose demands for support for Kurds in Northern Syria could complicate its attempts to join NATO, all of whose members must approve any new entrants. Ankara has also hit out at Swedish authorities for halting arms exports to Turkey in 2019 as the country launched a military operation in northern Syria. While not referring directly to Turkey, Linde said Swedish membership in NATO could ""change the conditions for arms exports within our national regulatory framework"".",29,5.341128476453827,5.503177356810627,-0.16204888035680032,10
2022-06-10,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/scared-vladimir-putin-ordered-death-27200723,"'Scared' Putin ordered death sentences against Brit fighters, expert claims","Vladimir Putin ordered the execution of two Brit fighters imprisoned in Donetsk because Russians are terrified of elite UK troops, an expert has claimed. After a three-day sham trial, Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner were issued death sentences by the supreme court of the rebel-held Donetsk People's Republic. The pair were sentenced alongside a Morrocan-born soldier and all three have just one month to appeal the court's decision. Dr Huseyn Aliyev, who has undertaken extensive research on foreign fighters as a research fellow at the University of Glasgow, told the Mirror that officials in the DPR would have ""definitely"" taken orders from the Kremlin before the sentence was handed down. He believes Putin will use them as bargaining chips for territorial concessions or sanctions relief, and to send a warning to other foreign fighters thinking of joining the Ukrainian armed forces. But the tyrant also ordered their killing as a publicity stunt to calm the nerves of everyday Russians and soldiers who ""fear"" the elite UK and US fighters, Dr Aliyev said. He told The Mirror: "" Russia also wants to send a signal to other foreigners fighting in Ukraine[...] ""The Russians are obviously quite intimidated by the foreign military personnel who have higher levels of training and combat experience."" Prof Aliyev said at the start of the Ukraine would let anyone sign up, but tightened their selection criteria as the war rolled on. He said: ""They only accept those who have actual combat experience who've done missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""So these are usually very experienced former or active service people from the US, Britain or Europe, with better training and experience than Ukrainian troops. ""They also know how to use the western-supplied weapons, like the Javelins, but also more sophisticated artillery systems. ""So they're highly valued in Ukraine, but they're also much feared in Russia. "" As a response to the superior troops, Putin's propaganda outlets have been fabricating reports of military defeats against these foreign fighters. But most are ""fake"" with the soldiers still out leading their daily lives, Dr Aliyev adds. He also believes Putin is using them as a means of shrouding his intentions of grabbing territory from Ukraine. ""It's sending the signals to the domestic audience in Russia that basically NATO has invaded Ukraine, and that's what Moscow is fighting against,"" he explained. ""The Kremlin is saying NATO and US British troops have invaded Ukraine and Ukrainians are just victims in this larger global conflict involving NATO, and Russia. ""This is very much falls in line with Russian propaganda efforts to present this conflict."" Mr Aslin, 28, and Mr Pinner, 48, were detained in April while fighting in Ukraine, before appearing in court in the separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). They are said to have admitted ""training in order to carry out terrorist activities"". Mr Aslin's family said in a statement: ""We've heard the news from Donetsk and need some time to take everything in. ""We love Aiden with all our hearts. He and Shaun, as members of Ukrainian armed forces, should be treated with respect just like any other prisoners of war. ""They are not, and never were, mercenaries. ""We hope that this sentence will be overturned and beseech the government's of the UK and Ukraine to do everything in their power to have them returned to us safely, and soon. ""We can only imagine what they are going through right now. ""This is a very upsetting development and we ask that our privacy is respected at this time."" It is understood Mr Aslin's mum Ang Wood found out about the draconian sentence while watching the TV news at the family home in Newark, Notts. In footage shared by Ria Novosti on social media on Wednesday, a translator can be heard asking Mr Aslin if he would ""plead guilty"" to an offence, to which he replied: ""Yes.""

Footage has emerged showing a large ammo store on fire after it was allegedly hit – leaving just one survivor, reports The Sun. Private soldiers from Russia's infamous Wagner Group were reportedly using the sports arena as a base in Kadiivka, eastern Ukraine. It is reported up to 300 mercenaries were killed in the attack in what would be one of the biggest losses of life since the war in Ukraine commenced in in February. Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk province, said that Ukrainian forces shelled the mercenary headquarters. He said: ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine launched a well-aimed attack on it. Only one occupier survived."" Putin's notorious Wagner Group are believed to have been covertly operating in Ukraine since Russia illegally annexed Crimea. The Russians have reportedly occupied the sports facility since their initial incursion into Ukraine back in 2014. Before launching their full scale invasion in February, the Kremlin had been for years supporting pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas area. The Wagner Group are consider Putin's private army and have operated across the world. The Russian president is claimed to have used the group to give himself plausible deniability as they are not explicitly tied to the Kremlin. The 8,000 strong group have been accused of killing children, raping and torturing women and carrying out executions. Wagner mercenaries are often retired Russian soldiers and they reportedly earn up to £2,000 pounds a month. The group first appeared in Ukraine in 2014 where it played a key role in Russia's illegal seizure of Crimea. Russia is estimated to have lost more than 30,000 men after just over 100 days of the war in one of the biggest military disasters in modern times. Ukraine is mounting a sterling defence against Russia's massive military, but their losses are almost mounting as they try to push back Putin's men. It is estimated between 100 to 200 Ukrainian troops are now being killed every day on the frontline.

2022-06-10,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-uk-brands-brits-death-27199393,UK brands Brits' death sentences an 'egregious breach of the Geneva Convention',"Boris Johnson is “appalled” by the “sham” death sentences handed out to two Brits fighting in Ukraine, Downing Street today as the Foreign Secretary branded them ""an egregious breach of Geneva Convention"". The Prime Minister has ordered ministers to do ""everything in their power"" to secure the release of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who were paraded by pro-Russian officials in eastern Ukraine in a show trial. Yet he has not instructed Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to summon the Russian Ambassador, despite the move being demanded by one of the two men’s local MP. UK officials believe that would escalate the situation and give credence to Russia ’s claims that the men were mercenaries. In fact they were legitimate members of the Ukrainian Army, so are prisoners of war protected by the Geneva Convention. No10 also declined to say if Boris Johnson had spoken to the families of the two men, saying: “I’m not aware of that.” It comes after Ms Truss held a phone call with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba this morning “reiterating her concern and discussing next steps”. She tweeted: ""Spoke with Ukrainian FM Dmytro Kuleba to discuss efforts to secure the release of prisoners of war held by Russian proxies. The judgment against them is an egregious breach of the Geneva convention."" Mr Aslin, 28, and Mr Pinner, 48, were convicted of taking action towards violent seizure of power at a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. A third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, was convicted alongside them. Robert Jenrick, Tory MP for Newark where Mr Aslin is from, slammed the “disgusting Soviet-era show trial”. He said a prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia - not involving the UK - is the most likely solution. He told the Mirror: “If it is resolved it's going to be via a prisoner exchange. Both sides have at least a couple of thousands of the other side's personnel."" But he also urged Liz Truss to summon the Russian Ambassador - something No10 today repeatedly declined to say would happen. Human rights charity Amnesty also urged the UK to contact counterparts in Moscow. Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty International UK’s Crisis Response Manager, said: “This is a grotesque decision. “This so-called trial always had the appearance of a show trial designed to exert pressure on the UK, and these sentences look like they’re intended to fire a warning shot to the UK over its support for Ukraine in this brutal war. “The Geneva Conventions clearly state that prisoners of war must not be tried or sentenced simply for participating in hostilities, and still less should they ever receive death sentences. “Russia and its proxies in the Donetsk People’s Republic will be adding to a massive catalogue of war crimes if they attempt to carry out these sentences. “The UK and the UN and other bodies should inform Moscow that these sentences are completely unacceptable and must be quashed immediately.” A No 10 spokesman said: ""The Prime Minister was appalled at the sentencing of these men. He has been following the case closely and has asked ministers to do everything in their power to try and reunite them with their families as soon as we can. ""We completely condemn the sham sentencing of these men to death. There's no justification at all for this breach of the protection they're entitled to."" But the spokesman declined to say the case would be raised directly with Russia, saying: “We are clear we are supporting Ukraine in its efforts to get these men released “They were Ukrainian armed forces members and are therefore prisoners of war.” One person close to the families' struggle likened the Foreign Office's stance to the plight of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - whose family were initially told not to give more publicity to her imprisonment in Iran. Mr Aslin, originally from Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, and Mr Pinner were both members of regular Ukrainian military units fighting in Mariupol, the southern port city which was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting since Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Aslin is thought to have a Ukrainian partner and other members of his family are still in Newark where they are prominent members of the local community. A Foreign Office Spokesperson said: “We are working with the government of Ukraine on the detention of British Nationals. “We condemn the exploitation of Prisoners of War for political purposes. They are entitled to combatant immunity and should not be prosecuted for participation in hostilities.”",13,3.8144258715274244,2.3444822213637604,1.469943650163664,23

Aiden Aslin, 28, and British Army veteran Shaun Pinner, 48, were convicted of taking action towards violent seizure of power at a show trial in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, a Kremlin proxy. Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan is a former comrade of Mr Pinner’s as they served in the same Royal Anglian Regiment together. He has condemned the sentencing of both men as he spoke about Mr Pinner, who is from Bedfordshire, saying: “This is disgraceful and I utterly condemn it. “Shaun is a soldier and should be treated as such. “This decision is a war crime and contravenes the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war. “Shaun Pinner is a hugely respected former soldier and everybody liked him when he served as a fellow soldier and friend. “There is a huge strength of feeling within the regiment about this. “Both of these men were serving in the Ukrainian Army and should be afforded the same fair and legal treatment as lawful combatants under the Geneva Convention.” It is believed both men’s horrific sentencing will involve death by firing squad, breaking Geneva Convention rules on prisoner of war treatment and prisoner of war immunity. They will be allowed to appeal the judgment but last night it sparked outrage among family members of the two men, military friends and colleagues and political figures. Mr Aslin’s family said in a statement: “We’ve heard news from Donetsk and need some time to take everything in. “We love Aiden with all our hearts. “He and Shaun, as members of Ukrainian armed forces, should be treated with respect just like any other prisoners of war. “They are not and never were mercenaries. “We hope that this sentence will be overturned and beseech the governments of the Uk and Ukraine to do everything in their power to have them returned to us safely and soon. “We can only imagine what they are going through right now. “This is a very upsetting development and we ask that our privacy is respected at this time.” The UK Government insisted the judgment had no legitimacy and the pair should be treated as prisoners of war. The Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""I utterly condemn the sentencing of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner held by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine. ""They are prisoners of war. This is a sham judgment with absolutely no legitimacy. ""My thoughts are with the families. We continue to do everything we can to support them."" Labour immediately condemned the sentencing. MP Stephen Doughty, shadow Minister for Europe, said: “It is an outrageous and shameful breach of international law for the Russian regime or its puppets to use an illegitimate court to prosecute legitimate prisoners of war who are entitled to combatant immunity. “The international law of armed conflict must be upheld at all times. “The FCDO must urgently support the families of these soldiers who will be in deep distress at this time.” Mr Aslin, originally from Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, and Mr Pinner were both members of regular Ukrainian military units fighting in Mariupol, the southern port city which was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting since Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Pinner is married to a Ukrainian woman and both men signed up to the Ukrainian military legally in 2018 long before Russia ’ invasion on February 24 this year. It is believed they both hold Ukraine nationality. Robert Jenrick, Tory MP for Newark, said on his constituent Mr Aslin getting the death penalty: “This Soviet era show trial is the latest reminder of the depravity of the Russian state. “As prisoners of war they are entitled to protection under the Geneva Convention.” A No 10 spokesman said: ""We are obviously deeply concerned by this. We have said continually that prisoners of war shouldn't be exploited for political purposes. ""Under the Geneva Convention, prisoners of war are entitled to combatant immunity and they should not be prosecuted for participation in hostilities. ""So we will continue to work with the Ukrainian authorities to try to secure the release of any British nationals who were serving in the Ukrainian armed forces and who are being held as prisoners of war."" Commenting on the sentences Dr Aurel Sari, an expert in conflict and security law, from the University of Exeter, said: ""British nationals serving in Ukraine’s armed forces are not mercenaries but lawful combatants. “They cannot be prosecuted for lawful military actions carried out prior to their capture. “Sentencing them for participating in hostilities is a serious violation of international humanitarian law. Including the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 on prisoners of war. A third man, Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim, was convicted alongside Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner. The men were accused of being ""mercenaries"" after fighting with Ukrainian troops. Russian media outlet RIA Novosti reported that the three are set to face a firing squad.

Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner were captured while battling Kremlin troops in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Harrowing footage showed the moment the pair were sentenced to death by the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) today. Moroccan national Saaudun Brahim was also handed a death sentence, with all three men accused of acting as mercenaries by the pro-Russian rebel state in eastern Ukraine. However, Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner's families insisted they were prisoners of war and deserved to be treated as such. Foreign Secretary Lizz Truss called the death sentence a ""sham judgement with absolutely no legitimacy"". Mr Pinner stared at the ground as the execution verdict was announced, while Mr Aslin and Mr Brahim looked around the courtroom. Mr Aslin is known to hope that his cooperation with the investigation will lead to leniency. But he acknowledged ahead of the final hearing that a video he made might be his last. He made clear he knew the death penalty was at stake. Russian media outlet RIA Novosti reported that the three are set to face a firing squad. The judge Alexander Nikulin said: ""The verdict can be appealed to the Supreme Court of the DPR through the chamber of appeal within one month from the verdict being announced.” There was also a right to appeal for a pardon, he said. The Kremlin is expected to demand that Britain must appeal directly to the rebel authorities in Donetsk - which the UK does not recognise. Russia itself does not administer the death penalty in judicial cases. Nor does Ukraine - on the territory of which the DPR exists. Russia has already sought to embarrass Britain into recognising the DPR, and state TV has claimed the death penalty verdict will pose huge problems for Boris Johnson. The political leader of the DPR made clear the trial was a sham by saying ahead of the main hearings that “the crimes they committed” were “monstrous”, indicating no other verdict than guilty was possible. “The evidence base has been fully assembled,"" he said. “The crimes they committed are monstrous."" Russian state TV demanded that they should not be forgiven and sent home.

A military vehicle is pictured on a road in a forested area before it is hit, with explosions causing it to catch fire. It is currently unclear exactly where the footage was filmed, but the video was obtained from the 30th Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Ground Forces on Wednesday. Its publication comes as the war in Ukraine continues to rage in the eastern part of the country. The 30th Mechanised Brigade said: ""Our tankers are aware of how important it is to save the country and people's lives, so without thinking, they just do their job. “A matter that is very effective and fruitful is the destruction of the enemy. The enemy BMP burns."" 'BMP' refers to an amphibious (suited for both land and water) infantry fighting vehicle, first developed by the Soviet Union and currently used primarily by the Russian Armed Forces. Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24th February, in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"". Thursday marks the 106th day of the campaign. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has reported that between 24th February and 8th June, Russia had lost 31,500 personnel, 1,393 tanks, 3,429 armoured fighting vehicles, 703 artillery pieces, 213 multiple launch rocket systems, 96 anti-aircraft systems, 212 warplanes, 178 helicopters, 559 tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, 125 cruise missiles, 13 warships, 2,406 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 53 units of special equipment. Over 1,000 Ukrainian troops captured in Mariupol have been transferred to Russia, according to Russian media. Satellite imagery has shown significant damage in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, where heavy fighting is ongoing. The Ukrainian military said that Ukrainian positions had come under ""intense fire"" around Avdiivka, Novopavlivska and Zaporizhzhia. It added that storming operations were underway around Slovyansk and that Russia had also intensified its aircraft use around Bakhmut. The Ukrainian Centre for Strategic Communications (StratCom) said on 6th June that Russian Major General Roman Kutuzov was killed in a battle near Popasna in the Luhansk region. This has now been confirmed by Russian state media. The United Kingdom and the United States are sending long-range missile systems to Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned of more attacks in Ukraine if the West sends long-range weapons. Russian missiles struck Kyiv on Sunday in the first assault on the Ukrainian capital in weeks. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Russian attacks on the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk have turned them into ""dead cities"". But he added that Ukrainian forces could still hold Severodonetsk despite being outnumbered.

Early fears Ukraine would fall quickly to the Russian onslaught were quickly put to bed as stiff resistance bogged down the invading army forcing the Kremlin to reassess the strategy. The latest two colonels to be killed including one of Russia’s youngest to reach such a high rank, takes the Russian toll to at least 52 colonels killed during the bloody conflict. Lt-Col Vadim Gerasimov, aged only 36, a battalion from Leningrad region, was posthumously awarded a Hero of Russia - the country’s highest honour - on Putin’s orders. His funeral was being held today in Leningrad region, with his widow also expected to receive his posthumous Order of Courage. A graduate of the prestigious Frunze military academy, he was the father of a daughter. The second high-ranked officer whose death was revealed today is Colonel Ruslan Shirin, a brigade commander, who “heroically died in battle”. The chief of staff of the 336th Separate Guards Marine Brigade, part of the Baltic Fleet, was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. It was not clear how and where in the Ukrainian war zone the colonels were killed. The deaths were revealed two days after the 50th colonel - artillery commander Lt Col Vladimir Nigmatullin, 46, a father of three, from Yekaterinburg. Russia recently lost its 11th general of the conflict, Major-General Roman Kutuzov was the chief of staff of the 29th Combined Arms Army. He was awarded a posthumous promotion to Lieutenant-General. Some sources have claimed that Russia lost a second and more senior general in the same incident in Donetsk region. They say there is evidence that Lieutenant-General Roman Berdnikov, 47, was killed, too. There have been claims that Ukraine has received Western intelligence assistance to target Putin’s commanders in the field, in an attempt to weaken the morale of Russian forces. Whether or not this is the case, a large number of high ranking officers have been killed, with almost one colonel every two days in the war. This comes as a former CIA agent claims the West is moving towards direct war with “unhinged” Vladimir Putin which may well turn nuclear. Robert Baer believes the situation is “likely to get a lot worse” with Putin pursuing “Russian fascism” and that no one predicted the extent to which he would go. The ex-CIA case officer, who discusses the threat from Putin in his new book “The Fourth Man”, said that the US was left flat-footed with Russia ’s invasion of Crimea and then the attack on Ukraine that began on February 24. He told the Express : “What we have today is worse than anything during the Cold War. “There’s no question the West had to support Ukraine but at the same time we’re inching towards a direct conflict between NATO and Russia. ""Whether or not it goes nuclear is anyone’s guess.”",14,6.185594207944695,3.5063636947177867,2.6792305132269085,11

A state-run news agency claimed to show a “diary” belonging to Brit fighter Andrew Hill, 35, who surrendered to Vladimir Putin ’s forces. The father-of-four from Plymouth faces a possible death penalty and is one of three Britons currently on trial in the unrecognised Donetsk People’s Republic. And all three Brits have been warned they could be executed for “monstrous crimes”, even though their trial has barely begun. Mr Hill did not appear in the dock alongside Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, when they were shown on TV in the court cage on Tuesday. A RIA Novosti report today said: “The coordinates of a burial place, presumably civilians, were found in the diary of British mercenary Andrew Hill, who was taken prisoner by the Russian military during an operation in Ukraine.” However, there was no evidence given that the diary belonged to Hill. The diary supposedly reads: ""East or south. 280 civ mass grave.” Coordinates are given on the previous page in different ink and it is unclear the two entries are connected. Another comment reads: “No stable income - savings running thin.” RIA Novosti suggest the coordinates are “between the cities of Irpin and Bucha, possibly Vokzalnaya Street in Irpin”. There are fears that the three will be subjected to rebel justice in the Donetsk People’s Republic, which unlike Russia and Ukraine appears ready to sentence captives to death. Last month Mr Hill was forced to read out a humiliating ""confession"" to being involved in ""war crimes"" in a sickening video released by Russian forces. Russian TV anchorwoman Olga Skabeyeva claimed that comments by UK deputy prime minister Dominic Raab indicate Britain is recognising the puppet regime in the DPR. “Britain wants to appeal the possible death sentence that two Britons face in the DPR [Donetsk People’s Republic],” she said. “Dominic Raab has made a request. “We come to the conclusion that the UK has recognised the DPR, and that’s good.” In fact Raab had said on LBC: ""In relation to that case, I don't know all the details, but of course we would expect the laws of armed conflict to be respected, and we will make sure that we will make all the representations.” He added: ""I know the Foreign Office will be looking at making sure all those representations are made.",13,4.1357329680574395,6.600692321133398,-2.464959353075958,23

Local officials reported at the end of May that Vladimir Putin's forces had loosened the ""Togliatti-Odessa"" ammonia pipeline during a military operation. The fighting lead to the gas being released into the skies near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donetsk region, the site of the war's new front line. The branch of the pipeline affected had been out of use since 2014 and the valves were closed at the time - but the corrosive element still slipped out, officials said. The gas - which is mainly used as fertiliser - is corrosive and exposure can cause the eyes, nose and throat to burn. Higher amounts can lead to blindness, lung damage and even death. Writing on Telegram, the Chairman of the Donetsy Oblast Military Administration Pavlo Kyrylenko said: ""Due to the actions of the Russian army, another natural disaster occurred in Ukraine. ""Donetsk RMA warns that in the Bakhmut district of Donetsk region, as a result of combat operations, damaged the tightness of the branch of the ammonia pipeline. ""A cloud of ammonia is moving over from the village of Maiske towards Bakhmut. Bakhmut, Hladosovo, Dacha, Mykolayivka Druha, Odradivka and Opitne may also be affected. ""Local authorities have informed the public about the necessary security measures. Rescuers are ready to eliminate the consequences of the accident."" Russia's bombing of the Azovstal steelworks could cause a major environmental crisis as thousands of tons of toxic chemicals risk being dumped into the sea. Mariupol City Council reported today how the shelling of the Azovstal iron and steel plant could have dire consequences for local wildlife and cause a ""world-class environmental catastrophe"". The council fears the bombs could have damages a facility holding back tens of thousands of tons of concentrated hydrogen sulfide solution, reports EspresoTV. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said: ""The leak of this liquid will completely kill the flora and fauna of the Sea of Azov. Then dangerous substances can get into the Black and Mediterranean Seas."" The mayor called for United Nations experts to be granted immediate admission to prevent the climate threat. He added that Russia is trying to create a ghetto in Mariupol and that the chemical-tainted water supply could cause another crisis. Russian troops stormed the plant on April 19 and destroyed large areas, however, pockets of organised resistance fighters battled on at the plant for weeks - refusing to surrender. Members of the Azov Battalion, a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine in Mariupol, were based in the plant. As the war rolls on, Putin has threatened to hit new targets if the West supplies longer-range missiles to Ukraine in the fight against Russian invaders. The warning came hours before the Ministry of Defence announced it would help Ukrainian fighters defend their country by sending rocket launchers that can hit targets 50 miles away. Explosions rocked Kyiv in the first assault on the capital in weeks as Russian strategic bombers fired missiles from as far away as the Caspian Sea. Putin said the “fuss” around Western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed to drag out the conflict, as Russian troops struggle against dug-in defenders in the eastern Donbas region, He warned that if the US dispatched longer-range missiles to the war zone, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”.",17,5.848572764113905,5.022060330029614,0.8265124340842913,27

The death was revealed of artillery commander Lt Col Vladimir Nigmatullin, a father of three, from Yekaterinburg. He was killed on 31 May 2022 but his loss to Russian forces was only disclosed today. Russia has lost almost one colonel every two days in the bloody conflict in Ukraine which was triggered by Vladimir Putin. His family shared news of his death on social media, where they said Nigmatullin - who they called their ""little man"" - was a father-of-three and an ""example to the motherland"". Ukraine also confirmed his death by his personal service number F-578429. The exact circumstances of how he died have not yet been revealed. His sister-in-law Marina Konyukhova posted on social media: “Eternal memory, darling, dear, much-loved man, you passed away. “We still cannot believe you are gone. “You are a father of three children, and an amazing husband to my sister. “I am always proud of you, and I will always be proud. “You set an example to the Motherland, so that everyone does like you did. “You were ordered with the Order of Bravery, posthumously. “You went through a lot of conflict areas.” His death comes as Russia lost its 11th general of the conflict in recent days, Major-General Roman Kutuzov was the chief of staff of the 29th Combined Arms Army. It was revealed today that he was awarded a posthumous promotion to Lieutenant-General. He died in an ambush in Donbas. “He calmly walked up the career ladder, successfully commanded the troops, and died as a soldier, fighting on the front lines,” said a report by Readovka. A picture shows Kutuzov’s funeral in Russia. One mourner said: “I knew him personally, Roman lived a hero and died a hero. “My condolences to his loved ones, strength and patience to his subordinates and fellow officers.” Some sources have claimed that Russia lost a second and more senior general in the same incident in Donetsk region. They say there is evidence that Lieutenant-General Roman Berdnikov, 47, was killed, too. Less than a month ago, Berdnikov was commander of the Russian armed forces task force in Syria, and he was moved to take charge of Putin’s forces and those of the Donetsk People’s Republic [DPR] in Donbas. If his death is confirmed he will be the 12th general to have been killed in the war.",14,4.893818790289454,3.0983834146653955,1.7954353756240584,11

One soldier who had fought near Kyiv, Kharkiv and is now in eastern Ukraine, complained to the Guardian of his desperate exhaustion. Andrei, who serves with the 37th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade headquartered in Buryatia in Siberia, said he had even contacted a lawyer to find out whether his deployment to the front is even legal. He also complained that he had not seen his wife for months. “I have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the war, it has been over three months now,"" Andrei said. ""It is exhausting, my whole unit wants a break, but our leadership said they can’t replace us right now."" Unconfirmed Ukrainian reports place Russia's losses after three months of the war at 1300 tanks, over 3000 armoured vehicles, 600 artillery pieces and close to 30,000 troops. There have been reports that Russia is finding it difficult to rotate out its exhausted troops and in another sign of defeat, the maximum conscription age has been scrapped. Michael Kofman and Rob Lee wrote in their new analysis of Russia’s armed capabilities that the Kremlin's army is poorly designed for a ""sustained occupation, or a grinding war of attrition, that would require a large share of Russia’s ground forces, which is exactly the conflict it has found itself in."" They continued: ""The Russian military doesn’t have the numbers available to easily adjust or to rotate forces if a substantial amount of combat power gets tied down in a war.” Fighters from Russian-controlled east Ukraine also went public with their complaints about poor conditions “Our personnel have faced hunger and cold,” said fighters from the Russian-controlled 113th regiment from Donetsk in one video posted online. They continued: “For a significant period, we were without any material, medical or food support. Given our continuous presence and the fact that amongst our personnel there are people with chronic medical issues, people with mental issues, many questions arise that are ignored by the higher-ups at headquarters.” Andrei said that the three months of fighting feel longer than the four years he spent serving in the army during peacetime. He said: “I have already contacted a lawyer online who told me that by law the general can keep us here until our contract runs out so there isn’t much we can do.” Another soldier loyal to President Vladimir Putin's government said he believes their mobilisation was done unlawfully, without medical certification. He claimed to be serving in Donetsk’s 107th regiment and said: ""Over 90% have never fought before and saw a Kalashnikov for the first time. We were thrown onto the frontlines.” Russian deaths are mounting as the battle for Donbas rages on, with Ukraine killing one colonel of war every two days. The British Ministry of Defence said in the first three months of the war, Russia has likely suffered ""a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan.""",14,4.064889259983128,2.5568925541366654,1.507996705846463,12

The number of Russian soldiers slain since the start of the invasion has been stacking up, with unconfirmed Ukrainian estimates reaching a staggering 30,000 dead Russian men, women and teens. In Russia, where the death toll is being downplayed, the Defence Ministry claimed just 1,351 service members had been killed during the first month of the war. The ministry has failed to update the official numbers of dead Russians since March 25. But now one Telegram channel dubbed ""Look for Your[s]"" has been sharing bleak daily updates showing every soldier killed each day Vladimir Putin's horrific war rumbles on. The channel - which is nearing one million subscribers - is written in Russian but was set up by the Ukrainian government to allow the soldier's relatives find the ""fate"" of their ""loved ones"". On Tuesday the channel posted portraits of two soldiers - one born in Ulyanovsk and the other in Yekaterinburg - both with the word ""died"" under their photos. Among other images and general war updates, the channel also shares the identities and photographs of Russian soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces. The channel claims to be an offshoot of the website 200rf.com - which shared information about ""captured and killed Russian soldiers since the beginning of the occupation"". In another pinned post, the page - which is run by Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs- claims it was blocked by the Kremlin after it ""chose to hide information about their loved ones from its citizens"". An explainer post reads: ""This channel was created by representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. ""On it you will find information about captured and killed Russian soldiers in Ukraine since the beginning of the occupation. ""Here we will promptly post photos and videos that we receive from the battlefield.

Dmitry Kovtun ’s death at the age of 56 was revealed on Saturday, with the official cause being that he had died from Covid complications. He was wanted in Britain for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko - a leading Vladimir Putin foe - which was reportedly carried out with polonium-210 in 2006. The assassination claim comes from Telegram channel General SVR which claims - without offering proof - to have inside sources in the Kremlin. “The decision to liquidate Kovtun was made three days before his death after a report by the Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Patrushev, to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which indicated Kovtun's connection with the intelligence of an unfriendly country,” claimed the channel. “This is the fastest implementation of a liquidation of a ""traitor"" after the decision was made. “Earlier it took at least two months to prepare an operation of this kind.” The report gave no further detail and did not indicate which foreign country’s intelligence service was being referred to. Kovtun was accused with ex-FSB operative Andrei Lugovoy - now a ultranationalist MP - of spiking Litvinenko’s tea with polonium-210 in a London hotel. After the poisoning allegation, there remained questions about businessman Kovtun’s health. Lugovoy said on Saturday that Kovtun had “passed away suddenly as a result of a serious illness linked to a coronavirus infection. “This is an irreplaceable and difficult loss for us. “From the bottom of my heart I express my deepest condolences to all of Dima’s (Dmitry’s) relatives and friends.” Kovtun, who had been a KGB operative - like Lugovoy and Litvinenko, died in a Moscow hospital, he said. Later he moved to Hamburg where he claimed political asylum. His former wife said he had dreamed of becoming a porn star, and had a drink problem. Britain said he and Lugovoy were working for the Russian state, and acting on orders, when Litvinenko was poisoned with polonium-210 at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair. Litvinenko died aged 43 on 23 November 2006, more than three weeks after the initial poisoning. Three days before he died an infamous photo of him was released - lying in bed without hair. It was claimed he had given valuable information to Western intelligence services. A British public inquiry in 2016 concluded that Litvinenko's murder was ""probably approved"" personally by Putin. Both suspects repeatedly denied the UK allegations. Russia refused to extradite the pair to face trial in London. General SVR claims to be authored by an exiled Kremlin lieutenant-general insider who is known by the alias Viktor Mikhailovich.",3,2.869684875087642,5.041303512013617,-2.1716186369259756,3
2022-06-07,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/zelensky-says-ukraine-fight-recover-27172263,Zelensky says Ukraine will fight to regain land as it 'lost too many people',"Russia's bloody assaults on remaining communities in embattled Luhansk have reduced them to war-battered “dead cities,” the Ukrainian President said today. Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed his troops are still defending much of the key town of Severodonetsk against a ferocious attack from Russian battalions. The Kremlin is believed to be throwing increasing numbers of troops into the battle for Severodonetsk as Moscow courts banned all mention of death toll in the media. If Severodonetsk falls into Russia ’s hands it will mean Moscow will have taken almost all of Luhansk, one of two regions that make up contested Donbas in the east. Both sides are fighting bloody street-by-street battles with artillery shells raining down on scenes of carnage constantly and bodies lying in the streets. It has long been suspected the Kremlin wants to reduce neighbouring Ukraine to a “frozen war,” occupied by a skeleton force and its main cities in ruins. But today Zelensky vowed Ukraine will fight to recover all its territory occupied by Russian forces, focusing on Severodonetsk, one of the bloodiest battles so far. He said: ""We have already lost too many people to simply cede our territory.” Zelensky vowed stalemate was ""not an option"" and added defiantly: ""We have to achieve a full de-occupation of our entire territory."" And in reference to French President Emmanuel Macron recently suggesting it was important not to “humiliate” Moscow, he added: ""We are not going to humiliate anyone, we are going to respond in kind."" Ukrainian officials had claimed that in Severodonestk their forces launched a surprise counter-attack last week, driving the Russians from a swath of the city centre. On Tuesday the British MoD said Russia was still trying to cut off Severodonetsk by advancing from the north and south. It said: ""Russia will almost certainly need to achieve a breakthrough on at least one of these axes to translate tactical gains to operational level success and progress towards its political objective of controlling all of Donetsk Oblast.” Zelensky added that Kyiv was gradually receiving ""specific anti-ship systems"", which will help break a Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports. It has emerged Russia is gagging the media from revealing details of troop deaths in Ukraine as Moscow is thought to have lost 31,000 already. Legal chiefs banned death toll mentions and Russian courts declared lists of slain soldiers a “state secret.” The cover-up was revealed amid growing fears Russia’s soaring toll in Ukraine may erode support for the bloody invasion. But support for the war - albeit based on false narratives such as Ukraine being run by “Nazis” spread for years by the Kremlin has increased in Russia. According to the US thinktank the Atlantic Council, Russian pollsters estimate 77% of Russians support the war - an increase from 74% in April. This is despite graveyards now hosting lanes of corpses and tombstones dubbed “alleyways of the dead.” It is now feared dead conscripts on the sunk Moskva cruiser may never be identified and the father of one conscript has challenged the Kremlin. Dmitry Shkrebets, 43, is under investigation on terror charges in the wake of his campaign for the truth about his son Yegor, 20, who may have been on the Black Sea Fleet flagship, which was hit by Ukrainian missiles.",14,4.025282888215794,3.568081434513526,0.45720145370226817,25

Vladimir Andonov, 44, from the Buryatia region of Russia's Far East, was part of the infamous Wagner Group of Russian mercenaries and is believed to have been shot dead in the Kharkiv region of eastern Ukraine. Andonov won himself the moniker ""The Executioner"" because of the brutal warmongering tactics he has used while fighting in Ukraine and in previous missions in Syria and Libya. The Wagner Group operatives are all battle-hardened ex-paratroopers or special forces and have some of the worst records for committing war crimes across the globe. His death was first reported by the Russian publication Moskovsky Komsomolets, which wrote: ""The death in Ukraine of Vladimir Andonov, better known as Vaha, has become known. ""He died last night during a reconnaissance of the area together with his friend."" It said he likely died from a sniper shot. Moskovsky Komsomolets said the brute previously fought for Russia in the Donbas in eastern Ukraine back in 2014, serving in the special forces and receiving a medal ""For Merit in Battle"". Andonov is believed to have had a pivotal role in the mass shooting of Ukrainian prisoners of war as well as the massacre of civilians in the Donbas. His name is also included in the Ukrainian-run ""Peacemaker"" database, the Ukrainian blacklist website with close ties to law enforcement agencies and hackers that lists all of the crimes of the Russian military. Andonov's death was also to be confirmed by Russian military sources based in Buryatia on the messaging app Telegram. One user wrote: ""He died at night, during the reconnaissance of the area, together with his companion, probably killed by a sniper."" The news marks another huge military loss for Russian President Vladimir Putin who also lost two generals in a single strike overnight. Lieutenant General Roman Berdnikov, 47, and Major General Roman Kutuzov were allegedly killed in the same ambush on a bridge in eastern Ukraine on Sunday. Born in Kusoci, in the Mogoituiski district in 1978, Andonov enlisted in the Russian army in 1997. ""I was in Donbas in September 2014, volunteering. I was urged by the events of May 2 in Odessa, where people were burned alive. For ideological reasons, my grandfather fought in Ukraine, in Vinita, he led Bandera until 1946 "", he said in an interview given to Nomer Odin in 2017. Another military channel on Telegram said he died with Bair Mitupov, another fighter from Buryatia. This comes as Putin signed a decree on Monday ordering the payment of 5 million roubles (£64,587) to the families of members of Russia's National Guard who died in Ukraine and Syria.",14,2.2755927403459126,4.228592339986097,-1.9529995996401843,11

Moscow is piling tanks and reinforcements into the crucial town, whose loss would mean Russia would control virtually all of the region of Luhansk. It comes as Kyiv is in a race-against-time to prepare troops how to use essential British and US-supplied missiles capable of repelling the invasion. The UK is sending M270 Multi Launch Rocket Systems capable of hitting targets from 50 miles away and the US is sending deadly M-142 missiles. During a visit close to the Severodonetsk front President Volodymyr Zelensky rallied troops, telling them: “What you all deserve is victory - that is the most important thing.” It was a rare trip outside the capital Kyiv, which was hit by missiles over the weekend for the first time in many weeks as Russia tries to smash supply lines. Moscow is desperate to stop the western military supplies which could severely hamper the slow advance its troops are making in the Donbas region. Ukrainian counter-surveillance teams all over the West are trying to hunt down undercover Russian spies trying to pinpoint how Kyiv is transporting missile systems to the frontline. Zelensky vowed that his military has “every chance to fight back” after his officials admitted they had lost ground to the Russian advance in Severodonetsk. Ukraine ’s defence ministry said Russia was throwing troops and weapons into its drive to capture Severodonetsk, the largest remaining Ukrainian-held city in the Donbas region’s Luhansk province. The Ukraine position in the city is perilous and could become the bloodiest battle scene of the war so far as the Kremlin is suspected of preparing a new offensive from the Black Sea. Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said: “Our defenders managed to undertake a counter-attack for a certain time, they liberated almost half of the city. But now the situation has worsened a little for us again.” The city has become the main target of the Russian grinding offensive in Ukraine’s Donbas region - made up of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces. New UK missile systems would give the Ukrainians the more precise, long-range firepower needed to reach Russian artillery units, key to Moscow’s battle-plans. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would respond to Western deliveries of long-range weapons to Ukraine by pushing Ukrainian forces further back from Russia’s border.

2022-06-06,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/brit-fighters-captured-ukraine-could-27160426,"Brit fighters captured in Ukraine could be executed, claims Russian state TV","The pro-Putin leader of the puppet regime in so-called Donetsk People’s Republic has warned three British ""mercenaries"" that they could be executed for ‘committing monstrous crimes’. Denis Pushilin spoke on the day the trial opened of the surrendered men who had fought alongside Ukrainian defenders. Aiden Aslin, 28, Shaun Pinner, 48, and Andrew Hill, 35, have already been warned that they face the death penalty - even though neither Russia nor Ukraine, on the territory of which the DPR stands, permit executions. Pushilin’s statement, shown on Russian state TV, may be seen as tantamount to a political demand for a death sentence after alleging “the crimes whey committed” were “monstrous”.. Nor did he challenge a comment by presenter Olga Skebeyeva - dubbed Putin’s ‘Iron Doll’ - who branded them ‘war criminals’ before their trial was properly underway. ""Today is the first hearing of the Supreme Court of the Donetsk People's Republic in connection with the British mercenaries,” he said. “The evidence base has been fully assembled. The crimes they committed are monstrous. “And I can say that according to the articles they were charged with, I would not rule out the death penalty. “But the decision will be made by the court.” Skebeyeva demanded that the detainees should not be sent home. “What will happen to the war criminals? People want details, want to know what's next? Won't they let them go, send them home? “People want justice in the first place.” The combined comments appear to make a mockery of any hopes of them receiving a fair trial in the Donetsk statelet. The British volunteer fighters are charged with commission of crimes by a group of persons, forcible seizure of power or forcible retention of power, and mercenary activities. The maximum penalty is execution - believed to be by gun shot - if convicted of “combat operations” in “wartime” against the pro-Putin region, said a local law enforcement official. All three have been paraded for the cameras in violation of the Geneva Convention. However, Russia and the DPR authorities say the convention does not apply to them as ‘mercenaries’.

Lieutenant Colonel Mezhid Utsmigov was hit during a brutal battle just after Kadyrov used Russian President Vladimir Putin’s absence from Moscow to gain promises from Kremlin chiefs in Moscow that the war would proceed at a “faster pace”. Colonel Utsmigov is deputy commander of a special forces regiment named after Kadyrov’s father and is close to Putin. Kadyrov is a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin and has used his power to deploy troops to support the warmonger in his war in Ukraine. Colonel Utsmigov and his forces were retreating from Ukrainian shelling in the Luhansk Region when he was hit in the leg and concussed, according to Ukrainian sources. The soldier's defeat came soon after Kadyrov was boasting about winning a “faster pace” for the war following meetings in Moscow with Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu and FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov. “We’ll make Russia ’s real patriots happy and may our enemies die,” he promised. He continued: ""The measures adopted will allow for increasing the efficacy of the offensive manoeuvres, which facilitates conducting the special operation at a faster pace."" Around 49 Russian colonels are known to have died in Ukraine during the war and the 11th General, Major-General Roman Kutuzov, died on Sunday. Kutuzov was the chief of staff of the 29th Combined Arms Army and his vehicle was ambushed by Ukrainians in the Donbas on Sunday. In the Donbas, fighting is heavier than before as forces fight in the contested town of Sieverodonetsk. The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russian forces are continuing to push towards Sloviansk ""as part of their attempted encirclement of Ukrainian forces."" The Russian forces in the area have mobilised from the reserve of Russian-led Separatist Forces of the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic. Who, the MoD says, are ""poorly equipped and trained, and lack heavy equipment in comparison to regular Russian units."" Kadyrov, appears to be rising in stature among hardliners who are seeking a more robust approach to defeating Ukraine, with the use of heavier weapons from Russia’s military arsenal. He has claimed of been at the frontlines in Mariupol, accompanied by his rifle-toting 14-year-old son Adam. Kadyrov has been accused of a string of human rights abuses and torture against his political opponents and gay activists. But many of his supporters say he has brought order to his troubled region in southern Russia. He recently claimed that losing the ""Battle for Donbas"" would add to instability in Russia and could lead to a coup or further territorial loss.",14,3.5955593762415914,3.6667839332732903,-0.07122455703169894,11

Major-General Roman Kutuzov was the chief of staff of the 29th Combined Arms Army, according to reports. His vehicle was ambushed by Ukrainians and he died in a fight in Donbas, say sources. His death is the 11th general, but the first such high ranking army officer in more than a month. In addition, at least 49 colonels have been killed in the war with Ukraine. The latest was Lt-Col Zaur Dimayev, deputy commander of the 4th battalion of the Akhmat Kadyrov special forces regiment. He was a close associate of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. In 2020, Kutuzov was head of the headquarters of the combined arms formation of Russia’s sprawling Eastern Military District. The previous general to be killed was Kanamat ’Flop Gun’ Botashev, 63. He was a “pensioner pilot” who was hit in his Su-25 after coming out of retirement to fly in Putin’s forces. He was reportedly shot down by a Ukrainian Stinger missile. There have been unconfirmed claims that Western countries are assisting Ukraine to target high-ranking Russian officers. Russian sources say Kutuzov was killed in the area of Nikolaevka settlement, in the Popasnyansky district of the Luhansk People’s Republic, close to the frontline. Last month it was claimed Putin could be 'running out of missiles' as his generals are turning on each other to avoid being purged, it has been reported. Just 10 weeks into the invasion and Putin's forces are said to be firing more missiles than they expected to because of how the war has dragged on. Britain's Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told TalkTV : ""He potentially has a problem because the rate of expenditure and the toughness of the fight is totally different to the one that he perceived on February 24. ""I think there are several wars going on. There's a tactical, geographical war going on in Ukraine. ""There's a logistics war going on, in terms of how you maintain that rate of expenditure. ""We're talking severe impact on their armed forces. ""We’ve had 25% of their forces effectively being taken out - either through people being killed or through the damage to their battalion tactical groups.” He added that Putin is under ""incredible pressure"" to deliver a victory for Russia. The admiral's comments come as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Putin's generals are ""turning on themselves"" to avoid becoming the scapegoat amid the failed operation.",14,4.253938544732756,5.619204388506195,-1.3652658437734395,11

Life for the city’s remaining residents has been relatively calm in recent weeks as the invading forces focus the majority of its attacks on the east of the nation. The war loomed back into focus this morning as attacks resumed on the capital- Vladimir Putin’s original target at the start of the conflict before being humiliatingly defeated by local forces. Mayor and former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram: ""Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital. ""Services are already working on site."" At least one person was hospitalised as a result of the attack, with no fatalities yet reported. This morning's cowardly attack was said to have been on the war-torn nation's rail network, possibly to disrupt Ukraine's ability to send urgent supplies such as munition, food and water to areas of fierce fighting. In recent days the Kremlin's soldiers have been focused on areas in the south and east of the country, with an intense battle reported in Sievierodonetsk which nearly fell to the Russians before Ukraine's forces fought back. The factory city is now practically ""split in two"", according to Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region which includes Sievierodonetsk. He added: ""It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back. ""The city is now, more or less, divided in half."" Sievierodonetsk's mayor Oleksandr Stryuk added: ""The situation is tense, complicated. ""Our military is doing everything it can to drive the enemy out of the city."" The UK's Ministry of Defence said in its morning update the Russian forces in the area are from the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic and are ""poorly trained and armed."" It added: ""Over the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have counterattacked in the contested city of Sieverodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower. ""Russian forces committed in this area include personnel mobilised from the reserve of Russian-led Separatist Forces of the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic. These troops are poorly equipped and trained, and lack heavy equipment in comparison to regular Russian units."" Putin is expected to give an interview on the state of the war later today. An early excerpt showed the tyrant claiming to have shot down ""dozens of Ukrainian weapons,"" comparing the relative ease to ""cracking nuts.""",14,4.4953759311660155,2.184105240069147,2.3112706910968686,25
2022-06-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-running-out-soldiers-27144237,Putin running out of soldiers as catastrophic Ukraine invasion hits 100 days,"Russia is running out of troops and military equipment as Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine continues to be viewed by experts as the ""biggest catastrophe"" in modern warfare. It is not 100 days since Russian troops crossed the borders into Ukraine on February 24 for what the government was branding as a 'special military operation'. Since then, Russia has faced crippling military losses as Ukraine's forces defended their homeland gallantly, aided by state-of-the-art military equipment provided by Western nations who actively opposed the Russian aggression. Putin has also faced huge international backlash and lethal economic sanctions as a result of his decision to invade. With the war now focused predominantly in eastern Ukraine following a Russian pullback in April, experts say that Putin's miscalculations continue, with the Russian forces now perilously low on personnel and equipment. The conflict has reached a ""state of attrition"", said Swedish economist and Russia expert Anders Aslund. Aslund told the Sun : ""At the 100-day mark, the war is at a stalemate. Ukraine has all the soldiers it can possibly need, it can mobilise up to one million men. ""Russia, on the other hand, has a shortage of soldiers. Because this is not technically a war, Putin cannot legally send in conscripts."" Ukraine's military says more than 30,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far - more than double the number killed in the almost decade-long Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s. Aslund says Putin's position has been made ""weak"" in his own country, as grim details of the war emerge vast death tolls, low morale amongst troops due to poor supply chains, and dreadful living conditions on the ground. In addition, the corpses of at least 6,000 Russian soldiers abandoned by their comrades are thought to be in storage in Ukrainian morgues. Aslund warned of huge revolts in Russia as a result of Putin's decision to invade Ukraine and said the widespread opposition could result in a revolution. Russia currently controls roughly 20% of Ukraine's territory, according to President Vlodomyr Zelensky, who made an address to lawmakers in Luxembourg on Thursday (June 2). “As of today, about 20% of our territory is under the control of the occupiers,” Zelensky said. “The Russian army has already destroyed almost the entire Donbas. This, once one of the most powerful industrial centers in Europe, is simply devastated. The occupiers are destroying it city by city.” On Wednesday (June 1), Ukrainian forces commenced their retreat from Severdonestsk, which is the final Ukrainian holdout in the Luhansk oblast, one of two states that comprise the besieged Donbas region. In its latest bid to arm the Ukrainian resistance, the UK announced it would be sending precision rocket launches to the Ukrainian military and providing the appropriate training to troops. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “The UK stands with Ukraine and has taken a leading role in supplying its heroic troops with the vital weapons they need to defend their country. ""As Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine. ""These highly capable multiple-launch rocket systems will enable our Ukrainian friends to better protect themselves against Russia’s brutal use of long-range artillery, which Putin’s forces have used indiscriminately to flatten cities.” The announcement came as President Joe Biden said the US would be sending a small number of medium-range M142 artillery rocket systems to Ukraine. The Kremlin responded by announcing that they were holding nuclear weapons drills in Ivanovo province near Moscow. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the West of “pumping up the Ukrainian nationalists with weapons” and said that any weapons headed for Ukraine would become a legitimate military target.",14,3.9185866927687263,3.046305818123978,0.8722808746447481,29

A screenshot on social media shows the anti-tank weapon being sold by a user in Kyiv – and it comes as Interpol, the cross-border police force, warned many of the weapons sent to Ukraine will eventually wind up in criminal hands in Europe. The photos, shared by pro-Russian ASB Military News on the Telegram messaging app, cannot be independently verified. They may be fake and part of a Russian propaganda campaign to halt the West ­funnelling arms to Ukraine’s defenders. The Javelin rocket launcher is a “ fire and forget” design, which uses heat-seeking technology to hit its target. The US has promised 5,000 Javelin missiles, many of which are already being used to blitz Russian tanks. The hand-held weapons were used with British NLAW missiles to help Ukrainian troops stall Russian ­convoys threatening Kyiv in March. Yesterday was the 100th day since the February 24 invasion – which has killed over 20,000 civilian so far, say Ukraine. The conflict is causing food shortages in Africa, South America and the Middle East. Some 40% of Africa’s grain imports are from Russia and Ukraine. The head of the African Union told President Vladimir Putin yesterday that “Africans are victims of this economic crisis”. Russian invaders continued to batter the eastern city of Severodonetsk yesterday as Ukrainian soldiers cling on in bloody street fighting. UK intelligence said Russia has increased air strikes in the Donbas region in a bid to speed up its faltering assault.

Ferocious fighting is now concentrated on a 600-mile eastern front, leaving the capital of Kyiv safe for the time being. Thousands of Russian troops were pushed back, leaving behind a trail of shattered, brutalised and murdered civilians. More than 10,000 war crimes have been alleged, including rape, murder, torture and abduction. Russia is tightening its grip on Severodonetsk in Donbas, whilst throughout Ukraine 100 die daily and 500 are wounded. But Ukraine’s ferocious defence has destroyed the Kremlin’s prediction of a quick victory. Security sources believe it highly likely that the Russian President, 69, is seriously ill and needs regular medical attention. His puffy face and frequent disappear-ance from public view have sparked cancer rumours. He spends much of his time in his huge mansion outside Moscow and is accompanied by doctors wherever he goes. It is possible the embittered ex-KGB man’s obsession with recreating the strength of the old Soviet Union has been influenced by illness. His unhinged assertion that Ukraine is full of Nazis who are threatening Russia defies belief. One security expert said: “Putin’s absences and appearance point towards illness and paranoia. “This would likely have a serious effect on his decisions.” The invasion began with widespread strikes followed by a massive armoured push towards Kyiv. Ukraine fought a brilliant defence, smashing Moscow’s tanks with western-supplied missiles and bombing them from drones. Hundreds of tanks were blown up, forcing Moscow to withdraw. But their retreat revealed Russian atrocities with hundreds of dead civilians piled into mass graves. Almost 1,200 Russian tanks have now been destroyed together with 200 planes. Around 30,000 Russian soldiers are dead. Tens of thousands of civilians have died – 20,000 in Mariupol. The fight has now switched east and Ukraine is struggling to hold a slow Russian advance. America is sending rockets that may outrange Russian artillery. But it’s a race against time. If Russia’s attack on Severodonestk succeeds it will control all Luhansk, the smaller of two regions in Donbas. Total control of industrial Donbas and the southern coast would be devastating to Ukraine. The former comic’s calm defiance on TV, dressed in a green military teeshirt has become an emblem of Ukrainian strength. In the days following the invasion he looked exhausted, his voice cracking with emotion. But within a week he morphed into a warrior, refusing to flee as Russian hit squads moved in on him. He answered a US rescue offer with: “I don’t need a ride - I need ammunition.” Fake Russian news about him fleeing was met with selfie footage of him in Kyiv saying: “The president is here, our troops are here, the citizens are here. We are all here to protect the independence of our country. Glory to Ukraine!” His standing up to Putin has bolstered Ukrainians in the face of grotesque violence. Born into a Jewish family, the 44-year-old grew up speaking Russian and Ukrainian and graduated in law before becoming an actor. Clever use of social media launched his political career in 2018 and he became the country’s sixth president. Six million fled at the beginning of the war although two million have since returned. A further eight million have been displaced within Ukraine. The Pew Centre research organisation said at the outset: “Russia’s invasion has created one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times. “There are now almost as many Ukrainian refugees as there were Afghan refugees fleeing the Taliban in 2001.” The UK is processing tens of thousands of applications for resettlement under the Homes for Ukraine campaign. More than 100,000 people have offered rooms. More than 26,000 Ukrainians have arrived here to take up the offer and a further 34,000 have arrived via family visas.= But the Government scheme has hit problems and there have been painfully slow delays in processing applications. Russia has become the world’s most-sanctioned country with 5,000 sweeping bans slapped on it and its key figures. The US has launched more than 1,000 restrictions, hitting Moscow’s ability to trade and the finances of its leaders and lawmakers. Companies refusing to do business in Russia including McDonalds, Coca Cola, KFC , BP and Shell. Russian transport has been crippled with flight bans. But the sanctions which will eventually cripple Putin are flooding his short- term war coffers through increased oil and gas prices. It is thought an extra £76 billion has been pumped in. But more than half of Russians gave suffered a lowering in earnings and unemployment is rising. Experts believe sanctions will eventually affect Moscow’s ability to buy weapons. What began as a disorganised invasion harassed by well-trained guerilla defenders has become a more conventional conflict. Russia has suffered huge losses but Putin believes this is unimportant. War, which began in the east in 2014, could rage for years more at a much more bloodier cost. Missile strikes against western Ukraine are likely to increase as Moscow tries to stop military supplies. Western naval support to escort merchant ships from Ukraine would be extremely risky. And if Russia cuts off Ukraine from the sea that will be devastating. NATO would have to rethink its policy of not having hands-on involvement. A former UK military intelligence officer said: “Only one man knows Russia’s next move. Those around him who know he is deluded are either not listened to or are too intimidated to speak.”",14,3.004082120628592,3.5079217554511413,-0.5038396348225493,29

The shocking video captures the Russian military commander of the Donetsk Republic's 113th regiment reading off a notepad of some kind as he makes the speech. His revelations paint a grim picture about the state of some of Vladimir Putin's troops fighting in the east of Ukraine. In the video, released by a pro-Russian telegram channel, he stands in front of his battle weary soldiers, who are armed. He reveals how they have been fighting on the front in the Kherson region “in hunger and cold” with no medicine or proper weapons. The video pans to some of the soldiers as a number seemingly run through injuries. Some of the soldiers are dressed in vests, wearing running shoes despite being on the frontline. The commander says that they were sent to the slaughter without proper weapons and asks to return to Donetsk and stop the mobilisation there. He adds that they have no proper weapons, food or equipment and the unit suffered from ""chronic illness"". The shocking revelation comes on the 100th day of conflict during Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine amid ongoing reports of Russian brutality aimed at its own troops. On the online channel where the video was shared they talk about “another video of our illegally mobilised guys”. It continues: “Since February, the guys have been at the forefront in the Kherson region in hunger and cold. “No one passed a medical examination, they mobilised children who have mental illness, fathers of many children, guardians. “Also, our fighters report that the command throws them to the slaughter without proper weapons.” The Telegram channel goes on to complain about how Russia has mobilised fighters and brands it “illegal”. It seems to represent fighters from the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine and has regularly posted other videos complaining about how Russia has treated the region it claimed to be liberating and fighting for. However, the regions that Russia has claimed are now republics, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, have found themselves suffering on Russia’s behalf some have argued. Kamil Galeev, a fellow at The Wilson Centre, highlighted online how troops from these regions were often bearing the brunt of the conflict. Two regiments from the DPR had reportedly recently refused to fight, and made almost identical complaints to the 113th regiment commander. This included that they were being used as ""cannon fodder"" or treated like mercenaries. It comes as in recent months Russia has sought to relaunch its campaign against Ukraine. The fighting has so far taken almost 50,000 lives according to Reuters, with the majority of dead having been suffered by Russia. Millions have been displaced from their homes and forced to flee the Russian invasion. Despite an initial push for the capital, Russia quickly found its forces floundering and unable to take Ukraine’s urban centres. After regrouping in the east of the country, Putin’s forces have since had more success seizing cities and territories and has been advancing gradually. Speaking of the 100 days of fighting so far, the Ministry of Defence tweeted: “Russia’s assault into northern Ukraine ended in a costly failure. “Russia failed to implement its own principles of war. With the limited combat readiness of many units, it spread its forces too thinly without enough support from artillery and combat aircraft. “Above all, it was based on wildly optimistic assessments about the welcome Russian troops would receive in Ukraine. Russia has now adopted a “strategy of attrition” and is achieving slow and costly gains in the Donbas.”",14,3.622289862967331,4.710743272822325,-1.0884534098549938,6

Legal experts say “forcibly transferring children” may be genocide as it plays a part in trying to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Ukraine ’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said: “From the first days of the war, we started this case about genocide. That’s why this forcible transfer of children is very important.” Ukraine human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova has said Moscow had relocated over 210,000 kids to Russia during the conflict, among 1.2 million deportees. The Genocide Convention – adopted by the UN after the Holocaust – specifies five acts of genocide: killing members of a group, causing serious bodily or mental harm, imposing destructive conditions, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children. Ms Venediktova said investigations are focused on the regions of Mykolaiv and Kherson on the southern coast but war is hindering evidence collection. Other alleged Russian war crimes are being probed in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Sumy and Zhytomyr, including the targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, rape, torture, and extra-judicial killings. Ms Venediktova said Ukraine has identified more than 600 Russian suspects and launched prosecutions against about 80, some prisoners of war. Genocide has only been proven in international courts for conflicts in Bosnia, Rwanda and Cambodia. But experts say there is mounting evidence to support a case in Ukraine, including a pattern of atrocities that meet rigorous tests to prove genocidal intent. Melanie O’Brien, president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, said: “They should absolutely focus on the forcible transfer of children. “We definitely see a risk of genocide.” Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said the Kremlin is trying to move the war into a “protracted phase” by building layered defences in the south of the country, instead of advancing. It is feared Russia has almost taken the entire key city of Severodonetsk marking a victory in the region of Luhansk. The Donetsk region will not fall soon, but needs the world to supply more weapons, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Russian troops are just nine miles north of Sloviansk, the second biggest Ukrainian-controlled city in Donetsk. Seizing the regions of Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk is a key Russian objective. ust under half of Donetsk is still in Ukrainian hands. He said: “I am sure that they will not advance quickly. In the longer term, it all depends on the concentration of our forces. The world must do even more.”",13,4.903852212637954,4.089219465551013,0.8146327470869412,22

Kalibr cruise missiles hit the Beskydy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains, it is reported. A family, with notable fear in their voices, recorded the strike in the Lviv region, and said that two missiles had struck the area. Ukrainian official Anton Gerashchenko and Lviv governor Maksym Kozytskyy confirmed the late evening attack. “The goal is to try to disrupt the railway communication and stop the supply of fuel and weapons from our allies,” he said. Russia was also targeting a second tunnel, he said. Russian sources also said the attacks had involved Kalibr missiles. This type of strategic missile has been previously used in the war in Ukraine aimed at destroying vital infrastructure. In April, images showed Kalibr missiles being loaded onto a submarine in Sevastopol naval port in annexed Crimea. The extent of any damage to the Beskydy tunnel was unclear with the route connecting Ukraine to NATO state Slovakia - a rail connection between Lviv and the EU. The first tunnel was built in 1886, with a second inaugurated in 2018 as a gateway to Europe. On the video, a voice is heard saying: that the strike was in the direction of Stryi. “Damn…,” says one voice in Ukrainian. “Look! F***ing hell!” “Dad, lie down!” Then someone says: ""Look, look!"" and “Switch the light off!” When another asks: “What?” there is a reply of: “Look there!

In his latest nightly address to mark Ukraine ’s Children’s Day, June 1, the Kyiv leader spoke about the impact Russia ’s invasion has had on his country’s children. He said that 243 children had tragically died, 689 had been injured and 139 had gone missing. These figures only included the children they were aware of. On top of that, he also spoke about Russia’s “criminal policy” of stealing Ukrainians and “forcibly deporting” them across the border. Zelensky branded this one of Russia’s “most heinous war crimes” and said that it involved orphans from orphanages, children with parents and children separated from their families. The president also spoke of a number of heartbreaking examples of the children who had been brutally killed. Fourteen-year-old Anya, from Bucha, home of the infamous massacre, was killed along with her mother and grandmother when the minibus they were trying to escape in was fired upon by Russian troops. He also spoke of a young girl called Polina, who wasn’t even two years old. She lived in Boroyanka and had been at home when a Russian tank fired upon her house, killing her instantly. Arina, who’s fourth birthday would’ve been this month, died in the Mykolaiv region after an artillery strike led to her receiving fatal shrapnel wounds. He continued: “Like little Denys from the Zhytomyr region, from the village of Malynivka, who died with his whole family when a Russian plane dropped bombs on the village. Denys was less than two years old. “Like Stepan from the village of Novi Petrivtsi, Kyiv region. He was less than three years old when a Russian shell hit the yard. The kid was fatally wounded. “Svyatoslav from Odesa, he was 15 years old. He was killed by a Russian missile strike at a dormitory. It happened on May 2.

2022-06-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/more-40000-vladimir-putins-troops-27125064,"More than 40,000 Russian troops have been wounded in Ukraine, officials believe","More than 40,000 Russian troops have been wounded in action and 15,000 killed during the Ukraine war, Western officials believe. But President Zelensky's estimate that 60 to 100 Ukrainian troops a day are being killed is ""pretty credible"", they admitted today. It came as Russian forces pressed closer to the centre of the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk in a drive to grab a swathe of eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile the United States said it would supply advanced rockets to Kyiv to help force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war. A Western official said Russia is ""starting to learn from its mistakes and make advances in the Donbas"". But over the last month Putin's forces have advanced just 500 metres to one kilometre per day, the official said. And there are ""a lot more challenge to come"" before Russian troops can reach the city of Kramatorsk, including rivers that would be difficult to cross while under fire. The ""long"" conflict will last at least until the end of 2022 as Russia still wants to take “at least the large part of Ukraine”, the senior official predicted. The Western official said: ""My estimate would be that the number killed in action for Russia is more than 15,000 now, but I think not necessarily significantly more. ""The fact they've narrowed the nature of their advance has meant they're still taking casualties, but they're taking them in smaller numbers than they were previously. ""I think the number wounded in action is probably north of 40,000."" This does not include the number captured by Ukrainian forces. It comes after the US announced it is sending the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to Ukrainian forces. Russia criticised the decision to supply advanced rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine, warning of an increased risk of direct confrontation with Washington. Russia's nuclear forces are holding drills in the Ivanovo province, northeast of Moscow, the Interfax news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying. A Western official said the rockets will be a ""real complication for Russian forces"" but are ""not going to turn the tide"" on their own. The official said: ""The M142 gives a range of about 80km. ""It’s a weapons system which is highly mobile, and is particularly effective in terms of being able to engage targets and move, or engage multiple targets in very quick succession. “In that, it outperforms the other systems Russia is fielding in the battle space. “That weapons system will enable counter-battery fire to go after Russian artillery in a deeper, more effective way. “By having that reach of 80km, you can get into those Russian supply lines”. The official said it is ""difficult at the moment to see any path to a negotiated settlement any time soon”. “We’re looking at a conflict that’s got the potential to run at least to the end of this year” and “possibly longer”, they added. European Union leaders have agreed an embargo on Russian crude oil imports that will take full effect by the end of the year. But Hungary and two other landlocked Central European states secured exemptions for pipeline imports.

Alexander Bobykin, 26, said ""Putin should stop the war now"" and branded it a failure after admitting to violating the laws and customs of war in Ukraine. He and fellow fighter Alexander Ivanov, 21, were in an artillery unit that shot at least 38 missiles at civilians and blasted a school in the early stages of the invasion. The pair pleaded guilty last week to “violating the laws and customs of war” with the judge commenting that their guilt had ""been proven in full.” Both men were handed a 12 year prison sentence at Kotelevska District Court in Poltava on Tuesday, The Sun reports. Bobykin told the publication that Putin's war was a ""failure"" and how it had all been a mistake before being led away to his cell. He insisted that he regretted his actions and even wanted to defect and join Ukrainian forces before being placed back in handcuffs and led away with his co-defendant Ivanov. ""I want to change to the Ukraine military,"" he said in a surreal exchange. “Putin should stop the war now. It is a mistake. The war is a failure. “I’m satisfied with my conditions in prison. My family know I am here. I have changed my mind about what I did. My verdict is true.” During the hearing, Bobykin and Ivanov sat blank faced behind bulletproof glass as the judge gave his verdict. The pair were captured after crossing the border thanks to a specialist police investigation. They were described as an artillery driver and a gunner whose unit had shot Grad missiles from Belgorod in Russia. A school in the town of Derhachi was destroyed by the shelling but no casualties were reported, according to prosecutors. When asked if Putin had been a failure, Bobykin replied ""yes.” Bobykin and Ivanov remained silent during the one hour hearing before the judge, legal officials and members of the Kharkiv prosecution service. They were monitored closely by armed police officers after pleading guilty last week to violating the laws and customs of war. Outlining the case, Judge Evhen Bolybok told the court that a platoon from their unit's first artillery battery was told to "" fire "" at around 5pm on February 2. The first fire platoon was based near the village of Malinovka in Belgorod where the battery commander gave the order. “Upon receipt of this command, the commander, aware of consequences in the form of warfare prohibited by international law, other violations of laws and customs of war, returned a special key and pressed the button to open fire with BM21 ‘Hail’, covered by Bobykin’s criminal intent,"" the judge said. A ""volley"" of 38 rockets were then fired as a result of these actions, he added. Following orders, Bobykins then left his firing position and arrived near Malinovka 20 minutes later where the commander ""charged BM21 'Hail' rockets,"" it was said. The judge also told the court that he beleived the guilt of Bobykin and Ivanov had been ""proven in full.” Kharkiv authorities welcomed the convictions was two of more than 1,000 war crimes under their investigation as well as 14,000 cases countrywide.",13,5.16429483586267,3.704518622975817,1.4597762128868528,2

Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said the explosion was caused by a Russian airstrike while the Kremlin said it was Ukrainian forces that hit the nitric acid tank, The footage was captured by a Ukrainian soldier. A Russian source said: “Footage has emerged of an explosion of a chemical tanker, presumably containing nitric acid, set off by the Ukrainian armed forces at the Azot plant in Severodonetsk. “The relaxed behaviour of Ukrainian soldiers confirms that Russian artillery was not shelling the plant at the time of the explosion.” The Russian Investigative Committee announced a criminal investigation into the nitric acid release. Mr Haidai said an aerial attack from a Russian warplane led to the chemical release. He said thousands of residents were exposed to toxic fumes. It is unclear how many residents of the city's 106,000 population are still there as many have fled since the start of the invasion in February. Haidai told the BBC : ""Our troops still remain in the city and for the time being are still resisting the Russian army. ""But if they need to withdraw to the other side of the river, closer to Lysychansk, in order to preserve troops then they will probably do so.” It comes one day after a Kremlin TV propagandist has claimed World War 3 has already begun and claims Russia ’s task is now to “demilitarise” NATO. Rossiya-1 anchor Olga Skabeyeva is seen on a video claiming that the much-vaunted Russian special military operation in Ukraine “is now over”. The West’s provision of arms to Ukraine meant it was now a global conflict, she said, as Russia's enemy showcased new British Wolfhound heavy tactical support vehicles. “It's time to admit, perhaps, that Russia's special operation in Ukraine is now over,” said Skabeyeva. “In the sense that a real war has started, World War 3.

Lt-Col Zaur Dimayev was deputy commander of the 4th battalion of the Akhmat Kadyrov special forces regiment. He is said to be a close ally of the Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov. He died in a hail of artillery fire from the Ukrainians, reported the Baza media outlet. Reports said he was killed in the village of Komyshuvakha, in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, making him the 49th colonel to die since the start of the invasion. He was in a UAZ Patriot SUV vehicle which came under fire. His driver was also killed on the spot, it has been reported. Dimayev’s commanding officer colonel Zamid Chalaev, 40, this week said the colonel “enjoys” killing Ukrainians. In a video reposted by Kadyrov - a lead of Chechnya - the commander standing amidst a group of fighters said: “We want to say to all [Ukrainian] shaitans, Nazis, Banderovtsy - when we are killing you, we enjoy it.” It comes as two more Russian colonels have been killed in Ukraine, including the country’s “best paratroop commander”. Lt-Col Alexander Dosyagayev, 34, was a commander of an airborne assault battalion of the 104th paratrooper regiment. Troops from his 104th air assault regiment were reportedly in Bucha, which was the scene of alleged rape and torture atrocities by Vladimir Putin ’s forces earlier in the war. His battalion based in Pskov had been recognised as the best in Russia in checks on combat training and military discipline. Russian media outlet Mediazona confirmed the death of another colonel killed earlier in the war which has not been announced. Col Vladimir Ivanov, 41, was labelled a “propagandist” by the Ukrainian media because he served in the Russian defence ministry’s department of Information and Mass Communication. Dosyagayev and Ivanov are the 47th and 48th colonels known to have died fighting for Russian forces in Ukraine. The toll of generals is now believed to be ten. It is likely that the true toll among Putin’s higher ranks is higher, as Russian officials have not revealed details of those killed in action in Ukraine.

Aiden Aslin, 28, has emerged as a YouTuber, praising the “amazing” food he receives in detention, and offering to answer questions from around the world. He along with two other UK fighters are being held by authorities in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic [DPR] - a region that is not internationally recognised - after they surrendered in Ukraine. Aiden has not been named as one of the fighters who are potentially facing the death penalty, but the other two have. It is strongly suspected that Aiden is being used for propaganda purposes. Fellow UK captives Shaun Pinner, 48, and Andrew Hill, 35, have both been branded “neo-Nazis” and warned that they face execution if convicted in a suspected upcoming show trial in the statelet, which is not recognised internationally. Senior official Elena Shishkina referred to Pinner, Hill and Moroccan captive Saadun Brahim when she said today that they would not be exchanged. Shishkina, who chairs the DPR parliament’s committee on criminal and administrative legislation said: ""They did not act here as servicemen, who comply with international conventions. They acted as terrorists, like neo-Nazis, so any exchange is ruled out."" Aiden's name was not mentioned. The death penalty is suspended in Russia and abolished in Ukraine. In the YouTube video, Aiden appears relaxed and boasts that he has put on weight because of the “amazing” food he is receiving. The Mirror is not publishing the video. One was headlined “Greetings from Custody” and he tells viewers he is allowed to call home. He said: The situation is that Britain is aware of...my existence. They know what's happening. “I've been allowed to make phone calls to them, speak to my family. “As far as I'm aware [the] British government - they have steps in place to secure my release, however, I do not know what the steps are and hopefully in the future, I will learn more on what the steps are actually going to be, like a prisoner exchange.” In one broadcast, he tells watchers: ""So my name is Aiden Aslin. If you do not remember who I am, I am a British citizen, was born in Nottingham, 1994.” He added: ""Five weeks ago I surrendered to the [Donetsk People’s Republic] forces in the city of Mariupol. “If you want to ask questions about how the reality is of the military service in the Ukrainian military as a foreigner…you can find my e-mail address and feel free to send messages to ask me anything about …life as a private in the Ukrainian military.” He promises to “tell you anything you want to know”. Then he gives a culinary guide to life in his DPR jail.

2022-06-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-already-sacked-second-27117951,Vladimir Putin's general mysteriously vanishes just a month after being hired,"Vladimir Putin may have sacked his new general just weeks after he was shipped in to save the faltering Ukraine invasion, it has been claimed. The Russian President appointed General Aleksandr Dvornikov in April in a move considered by experts to be an acknowledgement that his war was failing. However, the new commander has not been seen for a fortnight leading some US officials to speculate whether he has kept his job. It comes as a Pentagon official said Moscow's military is making the same mistakes on its new eastern frontline as it did when trying to capture the whole country. When Dvornikov was brought in it's understood he tried to form bridges between the disjointed air and land units to better coordinate their attacks. In the early weeks of the ""special military operation"" the Kremlin's campaign was run from Moscow, lacking a central war commander on the ground, reports the New York Times. This changed with the appointment of Dvorikov in early April, as he worked to streamline the war effort. The general cut a foreboding figure on his arrival into the hot seat. He fought in Russia's savage second Chechnya war as a commander, while forces under him in Syria were accused of targeting civilians. In the current conflict his methods appeared to be working, with pilots and ground troops having better co-ordination in Donbas. But US intelligence reportedly shows that despite capturing territory in the Donbas region, Moscow troops' ""plodding and incremental"" pace is continuing to damage morale. Officials say the Russian air force's risk-averse mentality is the same as in February, in which pilots are still darting across the border to launch strikes then retreating back home. By refusing to remain in Ukrainian air space they are failing to cut off usage by its foes. However, its military has made some progress on its new front, getting the upper-hand in multiple ground battles in recent days. And having taken southern port city Mariupol last month it could now look to forging a corridor into Crimea. Troops are now advancing on the centre of eastern city Sievierodonetsk, but Russia's haphazard approach means anywhere it does seize is often quickly contested again. A prime example of this is Ukrainian second city Kharkiv. “The Russians took Kharkiv for a short period of time; the Ukrainians counterattacked and took Kharkiv back,” US Defence Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said last week. “We’ve seen them really proceed at a very slow and unsuccessful pace on the battlefield.” It is also reported Ukraine is looking to cut off Russian supply lines east of Kharkiv, which would put the invading troops in the same predicament as earlier in the war when it had to abandon its advance on capital Kyiv. Frederick W. Kagan, a senior fellow and director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, told the NY Times the new front is not going to plan because those in charge ""haven't been able to change the character of the Russian army"". And retired Gen. Philip Breedlove told the newspaper Dvorikov's ideas on streamlining the forces was correct but the brief break in between the Kyiv campaign ending and the new one starting was not long enough. “The force was thrust back into the battle too quickly. That decision had to have come from Moscow,” he added.",14,4.723560972904969,3.6986103156558165,1.0249506572491525,25

Russia failed to make the quick gains that was anticipated following the invasion of its neighbour that began on February 24 - and it has turned into a war of attrition. Ukrainian fighters have battled for every inch and it led to a change of strategy from the Russians who withdrew from the north and an assault on the capital Kyiv, to instead concentrate in the more pro-Russian eastern regions close to the border. Now they are pummeling the city of Sievierodonetsk as they aim to take full control of the province of Luhansk. And two top Russian military officials Colonel Maksin Vlasov and Colonel Vitaly Kovtun have blasted the failure to take Kyiv in an alleged bugged call by Ukrainian intelligence services. “A f***ing rocket should fly into (Ukraine’s Parliament) in Kyiv. That’s it f*** it. Why didn’t (a rocket) f***ing fly? I don’t f***ing get it, you’re f***ed, Putin motherf*****,” Kovtun said, reported the Daily Beast. “Why didn’t a rocket fly into Kyiv…. Something hasn’t been done the right way.” The alleged call was broadcast by Radio Free Europe’s Ukrainian service and is believed to have taken place on April 14. The two military men also attacked the Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu who Vlasov called “incompetent” and he said that their army had made “horrible losses”. Russian forces have lost thousands of soldiers and many top brass in the fighting with claims that there has been poor strategy and a lack of organisation. While Ukrainian fighters have shown determination and willingness to die for the cause, Russian soldiers have appeared to have low morale. In the recorded message Vlasov and Kovtun were heard to agree that the war is being led by “bootlickers” and they criticised the poor salaries of the soldiers. They are reported to be given 30,000 rubles (£381) a month. “(There are) no contracted forces. Of course not! Why would there f***ing be? They paid them 30,000 rubles (£381), where are they going to get contractors?” Kovtun reportedly said. Meanwhile, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War has said Putin ""is now hurling men and munitions"" at Sievierodonetsk, ""as if taking it would win the war for the Kremlin. He is wrong."" Thousands of residents remain trapped in the city and Russian forces are advancing towards its centre, but slowly, regional governor Gaidai said. Russia's advance could force Ukrainian troops to retreat across the river to Lysychansk, he added. Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council aid agency which had long operated out of Sievierodonetsk, said he was ""horrified"" by its destruction. Up to 12,000 civilians remain caught in crossfire, without sufficient access to water, food, medicine or electricity, Egeland said. ""The near-constant bombardment is forcing civilians to seek refuge in bomb shelters and basements, with only few precious opportunities for those trying to escape,"" he said. There were few reports of major shifts elsewhere on the battlefield. In the south, Ukraine claimed to have pushed back Russian forces to the border of Russian-held Kherson province. Moscow took control of Kherson in March and residents there have staged protests against Russian occupation. Mobile and internet access in Kherson were shut down on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said, blaming Russia for disconnecting cables. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said troops there were fighting on ""despite the fact the Russian army has a significant advantage in terms of equipment and numbers.""",14,3.910099440661523,3.616025172707565,0.29407426795395786,21

He told MPs earlier this month: ""So far, we've delivered in excess of 6,500 anti-tank missiles, many of which have been used successfully to repel columns of tanks, as well as eight air defence systems - including Brimstone and Starstreak missiles, the fastest in the world at some 2,000 miles an hour.""

Bodies have been strewn across the city, causing the soil to get poisoned, eventually getting into underground water and into rivers and the sea. Russian forces have since washed the corpses above ground in an attempt to restore running water to the ruined city, according to Petro Andryushchenko, the Mariupol mayor’s adviser. He said the volume of bodies being washed out of the ground was too large, and forces were unable to bury them. Mr Andryushchenko wrote on his Telegram social media channel: ""The Russians are bringing the bodies of the dead here [in the supermarket], bodies which were washed out of graves and partially exhumed in an attempt to restore water supply. ""They are just dumping them like garbage.” Photographs from the Shchyryikum supermarket show decomposing and discoloured bodies in civilian clothes littered across the floor. Andryushchenko said there is a ""catastrophic"" shortage of people to bury the corpses and dig makeshift graves, so there has been a ""separate recruitment campaign for pathologists"" launched in Moscow. Ukrainian authorities said on Tuesday that while digging through the rubble they found more than 200 bodies in Mariupol, which faced some of the worst aggression from Putin's forces in the last few months. Before the war, Mariupol had a population of around 500,000 people and was a cosmopolitan city famed for its beaches. The estimated 100,000 remaining residents of Mariupol are living among rubble and dead bodies without medicine, running water or electricity. Little remains following months of siege and Ukrainian officials have said the city has been reduced to “ashes of a dead land."" Russian forces destroyed almost ""80% of the city’s infrastructure in 22 days, of which 30% can no longer be rebuilt"", they continued. Mariupol Mayor Vadim Boychenko estimated more than 20,000 civilians had been killed during the final weeks of the aggressive fighting. He said this was twice the number of deaths recorded in the entire two-year Nazi occupation of the city during World War Two. He said: “Putin is a bigger evil than Hitler and we must stop him."" Putin's forces were unabashed with their violence in the port city. They struck maternity wards and bombed a theatre, clearly marked as a refuge for hundreds of civilians. Officials claim their actions amount to war crimes. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or targeting of civilians.

Police colonel Zamid Chalaev, 40, has been awarded the Hero of Russia award by Putin despite numerous allegations of human rights abuses. In a video reposted by Kadyrov - lead of Chechnya - the commander standing amidst a group of fighters said: “We want to say to all [Ukrainian] shaitans, Nazis, Banderovtsy - when we are killing you, we enjoy it “Hopefully… you won't run away from Lisichansk just as you fled from Severodonetsk.” Chalaev is said to be leading pro-Russian forces in part of an advance against Ukraine in Luhansk region. Kadyrov praised the determination to Chaelaev’s forces “to destroy the bandits to the end and liberate the Donbas from the terrorists who have been oppressing its population for eight years. “I am sure that these men will cope with the most difficult tasks at any cost, even if necessary - with their lives. “They will achieve the victory of good over evil.” Chalaev commands a special forces police regiment named after Kadyrov’s father Akhmat-Khadzhi Kadyrov.

It comes in response to Poland's ongoing support of neighbouring Ukraine after lawmakers called for Russian oil and gas imports to be axed. Kadyrov, 45, the self-dubbed ""attack dog"" for tyrant Putin, said Ukraine is ""done"" before turning his sights on Poland, the Daily Telegraph reports. He said: ""What is Poland trying to achieve?

2022-05-30,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/exact-date-putins-forces-run-27099598,"Exact date Putin's forces will run out of ammunition, according to expert","Russian forces will run out of ammunition by the end of the year, Ukraine's Intelligence Chief has warned. Kyrylo Budanov believes that Russia only has enough fuel, ammunition and military equipment to sustain another seven months of full effort. Despite Russian forces having recently captured most of the town of Lyman, in the north of Donetsk Oblast, pictures on social media show ancient T-62 tanks on trains heading to the frontline in Ukraine. The tanks are believed to be around 60 years old and were seen pulled out of storage. Some say this is a huge indicator of Moscow's fighting stock as its arsenal has been decimated. Budanov predicts that by the new year, Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces will be depleted. He told Sky News : ""The breaking point will be in the second part of August. ""Most of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year. As a result, we will renew Ukrainian power in all our territories that we have lost including Donbas and the Crimea."" The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) intelligence assessment says Russia’s Southern Grouping of Forces will receive the T-62 tanks and their presence ""highlights Russia’s shortage of modern, combat-ready equipment.” Ukrainian forces will likely wipe out the tanks with basic rocket-propelled grenades and they will not have to use their sophisticated weaponry to wipe out the decrepit vehicles. Unconfirmed Ukrainian claims place Russia's losses after three months of the war at 1300 tanks, over 3000 armoured vehicles, 600 artillery pieces and close to 30,000 troops. Despite Bundanov's predictions that Putin's forces will be gone by the end of the year, Kremlin Senator Andrei Turchak said: ""I wanted to say once again, that Russia is here forever. There should be no doubt about that. There will be no return to the past."" But in another sign of weakness and indicator of a high Russian death rate, the maximum conscription age has been scrapped. The Russian Duma voted to remove the upper age limit for military conscription so that any male over the age of 18 can serve. Before, anyone over 40 was disallowed. The MoD said in the first three months of the war, Russia has likely suffered ""a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan."" It said a combination of ""poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility, and a command approach which is prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes"" has led to this high casualty rate. The T-62 tanks, which were first used in 1962, were spotted being carried by train into the city of Melitopol in southern Ukraine. A Ukrainian army post on Facebook wrote that as a result of losses during hostilities, the Russian enemy ""was forced to withdraw"" T-62 tanks from storage ""to recruit reserve battalion tactical groups that are being formed to be sent to Ukraine"" In just one week, 70 Russian tanks were reported destroyed by Ukrainian artillery as they attempted to cross a river. Ukraine claims more than 1300 have been destroyed, with open-source intelligence confirming 700.",14,3.782163803623792,3.5268475408392757,0.25531626278451647,8

Ukrainian officials in eastern areas are being kept constantly on the move in order to avoid death squads as Russia has been making advances in the Donbas region, taking the city of Lyman. A police chief in the Luhansk region of the Donbas has compared the offensive to the 'Red Terror' carried out by the Bolsheviks in Soviet Russia between 1918 and 1922. “Heads of local administration, including myself, we are constantly on the move,"" Chief Oleg Grigorov said. ""The Russians are hunting for our heads, be it capture or outright liquidation.” Around 95% of Luhansk is now under Russian control and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted the situation was “difficult” in his latest address. “Donbas will be in Ukraine because this is us, this is our essence,” he added. “And even if Russia brings destruction and suffering there, we will still restore every city and every community.” Luhansk’s governor Serhiy Haidai has conceded that Ukrainian troops may have to withdraw to prevent a repeat of the brutal siege in Mariupol. “It is possible that in order not to be surrounded, they will have to leave,” he said. “People’s nerves are like steel. Morale is high and there is no panic. “But the bodies are just lying there, in the street. There are casualties among children. Russians are indiscriminate, they are shooting at residential areas, at the local population.” Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal last night told the BBC that Russia's invasion has led to the destruction of more than 15,000 miles of roads, hundreds of bridges and 12 airports.

The Kremlin previously only admitted Russians aged between 18 and 40 to fight in its armed forces and foreigners aged 18-30. But such is the toll the tyrant’s brutal war in Ukraine has had on their troops he has paved the way for older professional soldiers to take up arms. The move is being presented as recruiting more “technical specialists”, rather than a desperate move to boost soldiers numbers after losing an estimated 30,000 troops during the war in Ukraine. State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said: ""Today, especially, we need to strengthen the armed forces and help the Ministry of Defence. “Our Supreme Commander is doing everything to ensure our armed forces win, and we need to help."" Last month it was reported more than 130,000 new conscripts were set to join the Russian war effort. Putin had initially sworn to concerned parents their loved ones would be kept away from “hot zones”, although it was later revealed some were expected to fight in Ukraine. A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “Putin has signed over 130,000 new conscripts into the Army. “The timing aligns with previous Spring drafts but we think that’s an unusually high number. “We do think there’s a realistic possibility these conscripts will be sent into Ukraine, even though the Russian MOD have said only professional soldiers will go to Ukraine.” At the outbreak of war Putin had said only professional soldiers and officers would be sent to invade Ukraine. Its defence secretary later acknowledged some were fighting with Putin’s spokesman saying at the time the president had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts. Meanwhile Russia may bolster troops on its border with Finland after Turkey blocked its bid to join NATO, an expert has warned. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blocking Sweden and Finland from joining the alliance may lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin building up troops on the border. In a shock move, President Erdogan confirmed his decision to block Finland and Sweden's decision to join NATO . He said Sweden should not expect Turkey to approve its bid without returning people it deems terrorists harboured by the two countries - namely the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group. Dr Samuel Ramani, an international relations expert at Oxford University and Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, has said that Russia is probably ""pretty happy"" with Turkey.",14,3.523019915861612,5.569422662815749,-2.0464027469541373,10

Russian troops have reportedly advanced in the east, where a focus on the Donbas region has shifted the momentum of the three-month-old war. A withdrawal could bring bloodthirst Putin close to capturing eastern Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions and land a significant and symbolic blow onVolodymyr Zelenskyy's hero defenders. His troops have gained ground in two areas, collectively known as the Donbas, while blasting some towns to wastelands. Serhiy Gaidai, Luhansk's governor, said Russian troops had entered Sievierodonetsk, the largest Donbas city still held by Ukraine, after trying to trap Ukrainian forces there for days. But he added Russian forces would not be able to capture the Luhansk region ""as analysts have predicted"". ""We will have enough strength and resources to defend ourselves. However, it is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat,"" Gaidai said on Telegram. He said 90% of buildings in Sievierodonetsk were damaged with 14 high-rises destroyed in the latest shelling. Speaking to Ukrainian television, Gaidai said there were 10,000 Russian troops based in the region and they were ""attempting to make gains in any direction they can"". He claimed several dozen medical staff were staying on in Sievierodonetsk. but that they faced difficulty just getting to hospitals because of the shelling. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine was protecting its land ""as much as our current defence resources allow"". Ukraine's military insisted it had repelled eight attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk on Friday, destroying tanks and armoured vehicles. ""If the occupiers think that Lyman and Sievierodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian,"" Zelensky said in an address. 'The General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces said on Saturday Ukrainian forces had repelled eight assaults in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the previous 24 hours. Russia's attacks included artillery assaults in the Sievierodonetsk area ""with no success"", it claimed. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said while Russian forces had begun direct assaults on Sievierodonetsk, they would struggle in the city itself. ""Russian forces have performed poorly in operations in built-up urban terrain throughout the war,"" they said. Enemy troops advanced after piercing Ukrainian lines last week in the city of Popasna, south of Sievierodonetsk. The invaders' forces have captured several villages northwest of Popasna, Britain's defence ministry said. Popasna was said to be in ruins. The bloated body of a dead man in combat uniform could be seen lying in a courtyard when reporters visited the scorched area. Resident Natalia Kovalenko had left the cellar where she was sheltering in the wreckage of her flat, its windows and balcony blasted away. She said a shell hit the courtyard, killing two people and wounding eight. ""We are tired of being so scared,"" she said. Russia's eastern gains follow the withdrawal of its forces from approaches to the capital, Kyiv, and a Ukrainian counter-offensive that pushed its forces from Kharkiv. Forces shelled parts of Kharkiv on Thursday for the first time in days killing nine people, authorities said. The Kremlin, however, denies targeting civilians in what it calls its ""special military operation"". Ukraine's General Staff claimed on Saturday while there was no new attack on the city, there were multiple Russian strikes on nearby communities and infrastructure.

Captives Shaun Pinner, 48, and Andrew Hill, 35, are to be put on trial in self-styled Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Pro-Russians are feared to be aiming to stage a show aimed at maximising concessions in Britain. If convicted, the maximum penalty is execution - believed to be by gun shot - for conducting “combat operations” against the pro-Putin region, said a local law enforcement official. Absent for unexplained reasons from the list of those to be tried was British ""mercenary"" Aiden Aslin, 28, who had been also detained by pro-Russian forces. Prosecutor-General’s official Viktor Gavrilov said in a video: “After detailed testimonies of British citizens Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill obtained by officers of the Prosecutor General's Office of the DPR.... “Their involvement in the commission of unlawful acts has been established. “A criminal case against mercenaries involved in the preparation and conduct of combat operations against the DPR is completed. “The case materials have been submitted to a court for trial on the merits of the case. “As a result of which capital punishment (death penalty) can be imposed on the accused in wartime conditions.” He did not mention Aslin who earlier had been detained and warned the maximum penalty was death. Pinner in April appeared drained as he acknowledged he understood charges against him. Yet like Pinner, he was not seen admitting guilt. Bearded Hill, a father-of-four from Plymouth, earlier this month confessed in a video broadcast by pro-Putin media admitted to “unwittingly” being involved in “war crimes” —and pleaded for leniency. Speaking as his British partner Candice Morgan was making frantic efforts to bring him home, he appeared to compromise other foreign fighters as his confession echoed the Russian playbook. They “shoot [civilians], kill them and injure them indiscriminately,” he said. “They stole valuable things from these people without any shame at all. “Mercenaries also tortured Russian soldiers and Russian fight activists. “They cut off their fingers and they torture them. “Prisoners were severely beaten and they were deprived of food and a drink. “I've never seen such cruelty on this scale before. “ His words matched exactly the Russian propaganda version of the war, even though until last week he was apparently voluntarily fighting on the Ukrainian side. “Supporters of the Neo-Nazi and the nationalist ideology prevail in this camp,” he said. “They are proud of the tattoos of the swastikas and the double-S's emblems. It was awful. “Unfortunately I found myself among these terrible people and unwittingly became involved in these war crimes. “I understand everything has been done wrong and I hope for leniency from the Donetsk People Republic.” Aslin said: “I understand fully what I am accused offend I agree with it fully up to the part about murdering civilians - I don’t agree with [this].” Earlier this month Pinner and Aslin had been told by prosecutor Andrei Spivak that they had committed “a number of crimes against civilians of the Donetsk People’s Republic. “The maximum punishment for these crimes is the death penalty.” The British men had been fighting in Mariupol where they were detained by Russian forces.",13,7.319551698630117,6.723744706147956,0.595806992482161,23

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the Russians used a TOS-1 multiple rocket launcher to strike at Ukrainian targets near Novomykhailivka in the eastern region of Donetsk Oblast. The horrendous 30-barrel or 24-barrel multiple rocket launcher is capable of firing thermobaric warheads, a type of explosive that uses oxygen in the surrounding area to generate a high-temperature blast. Ukraine has described Moscow's invasion the ""largest and most horrific war of the 21st century"" and appealed to NATO to supply its forces with similar Multiple Launch Rocket Systems as a matter of urgency. Speaking on Friday, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said: ""Russian TOS-1s shelling Ukrainian positions near Novomykhailivka, Donetsk region. ""This is what the largest and most horrific war of the 21st century looks like. Ukraine is ready to strike back. To do this, we need NATO-style MLRS [Multiple Launch Rocket Systems]. Immediately!"" Dr Marcus Hellyer, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the thermobaric weapons were effective at their ""specific purpose"" of ""primarily destroying defensive positions"". Speaking to the Guardian, he added: ""They are not illegal even though their effects can be pretty horrific, because of that effect of creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders."" As his barbarism heats up, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that makes it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become citizens of Russia. The Kremlin has also done away with the upper age limit for contractual service in its military in a bid to sign more of its citizens up to fight in Ukraine. Since February 24 the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at around 29,600 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The sickening examples are from a 24-hour catalogue of sexual torture as a weapon of war by Vladimir Putin ’s forces, it is claimed. They are from one town, Oleksandrivka, in Kherson region, now under Russian occupation, with one-third of homes reportedly destroyed. The harrowing cases were highlighted by Lyudmila Denisova, the Kyiv parliament’s human rights commissioner. “ Russia uses rape and sexual violence in other forms as tactics of warfare, systematically, everywhere and with striking brutality,” she said. “During the last 24 hours, the commissioner's psychological helpline was contacted by persons from Oleksandrivka, Kherson region, who gave permission to publish information on the facts of sexual violence. “Two girls aged 12 and 15 were raped by the Rashists [a term combining “Russian,” “racist” and “fascist”]. “A six-month-old girl was raped by a Russian with a teaspoon.” In another alleged case a mother was at home with her twin boys aged two. Ms Denisova said: “Five Rashists broke in, one held the mother, the other two raped the children orally and anally. “The children died from ruptures and blood loss. “A three-year-old boy was raped in front of his mother by two Rashists, and the child died of his injuries.” She added: “Sexual violence is strictly prohibited by Article 27 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949. ""Rape as a war crime is the most serious crime and one of the components of genocide. “I ask the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, to initiate an investigation into these facts and bring the perpetrators to justice.” Ms Denisova has also called on international action taking “measures to prevent sexual violence by Russian troops”. The Ukrainian human rights commissioner said: “I call on the world community to ensure the imposition of personal sanctions against political leaders, Russian military commanders and perpetrators of these terrible crimes.”",13,6.321026009642559,4.675164300920753,1.6458617087218057,22

European intelligence officers told the Guardian that more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Putin’s army to potentially prepare for a similar brutal campaign in the Ukraine war. Barrel bombs are deadly weapons fashioned out of oil barrels, fuel tanks or gas cylinders which are packed with explosives, fuel, and metal fragments and dropped from helicopters and planes. The Syrian Network for Human Rights revealed that the Syrian regime dropped nearly 82,000 barrel bombs in nine years, killing 11,087 civilians, including 1,821 children. The regime was also accused of filling canisters with chlorine and dropping them on civilians. Barrel bombs can destroy everything in an 800ft radius. State Department Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland described the brutal explosives to NBC News as ""vicious things indiscriminately launched ... at targets without any concern about civilians."" It is believed that the specialists' arrival is a big factor behind both the United States and European nations warning that chemical weapons are likely to be used in Ukraine. ""Barrel bombs are the most horrible and hurtful weapon… We deal with multi-trauma, many amputations and intestines out of the body, it’s too horrible"", a surgeon from Aleppo, Syria's capital, told Amnesty. Despite this, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has denied ever using barrel bombs. Putin, a staunch ally of al-Assad, has already used brutal tactics to kill thousands of civilians in his bloody war. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 7,964 civilian casualties in the country with 3,778 killed and 4,186 injured. However, the true toll is thought to be much higher with the Kremlin's forces using tactics to cover up deaths. It has been reported that around 800 Russian-trained Syrian fighters have signed up to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine. Some say the Kremlin has promised salaries of between $1,500-$4,000 – up to 20 times the amount they would receive in Syria. Videos purporting to show Syrian fighters brandishing posters of President Putin have been circulating but a senior US defence official told reports that evidence of fighters on the frontline has yet to materialise. They said: ""We haven't seen indications that their recruiting efforts have borne fruit and resulted in the actual arrival of foreign fighters from that part of the world."" Recruits are reportedly deployed under contract with the Wagner Group, the Russian private military organisation which has been accused of war crimes in Ukraine's Bucha — where up to 1,000 people were massacred over a few days in early April. This comes as Putin recently named General Alexander Dvornikov as the new war commander in Ukraine. General Dvornikov earnt the moniker ""Butcher of Syria"" as he played a prominent role in the Syrian war and forces under his order were frequently accused of committing crimes against humanity.",13,4.668106445176969,3.738683057769229,0.92942338740774,0

The video shows people dressed in head-to-toe protective suits and lifting body bags into the trains.

""Cargo 200"" is a Soviet military code word for the transportation of military fatalities. The video continually makes references to Russia's unwillingness to repatriate the corpses of their dead soldiers and last week, Anton Gerashchenko, Adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, tweeted: ""Russia is still not picking up the bodies of its dead soldiers, which are in refrigerated cars near Kyiv. There are more than 250 of them."" The video continues: ""Russia hides real losses from families to avoid panic and to avoid payment of compensations.""

Russian forces struck a barracks that housed troops at a training base in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not specify whether the casualties from the attack in Desna were military persons or civilians, it is likely linked to the May 17 attack on a military training centre. ""Today we have finished works in Desna. Unfortunately, the statistics are as follows: 87 victims under the rubble in Desna,"" President Zelensky said during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""Eighty-seven corpses, victims killed. The future of Ukraine will lack these people."" On May 17, a Russian military spokesman said high-precision, long-range missiles had hit Ukrainian reserves forces at a training centre near Desna, in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, and at one other site. In March, Russian forces carried out a similar attack on a military base in Yaraviv, in the west of Ukraine, but the attack on Desna had more than double the number of victims. The second-largest toll was following an attack on Kramatorsk's train station where around 52 people were killed. Ukrainian authorities have also said they believe hundreds were trapped under the rubble of a theatre in Mariupol following a bombing in March, but they were unable to confirm the number of deaths. Chernihiv's governor said on Tuesday that the war is not over and has not left the region. He urged residents to “be careful” and listen for air raid sirens. A city of around 300,000 people, Chernihiv is less than 60 miles from both the Russian and Belarusian borders and has been subject to some of the most brutal bombings from Putin's forces. For over a month, the Russian military made it their objective to besiege the city and rained bombs on residents. In March, images showed trenches being dug in an unused field at the edge of the Yalovshchina cemetery, in the city of Chernihiv, to make space for hundreds of dead bodies. As many as fifty people were killed every day during the peak of the campaign in March, with civilians flagrantly targetted while queueing up for food. Human Rights Watch said in a report that Russian forces controlling the Chernihiv region subjected civilians to summary executions, torture and other abuses.

Captain Adam Khamkhoyev, 30, a paratrooper commander, was killed on Friday night in Ukraine and later buried in the southern Russian province of Ingushetia. His uncle is Colonel-General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, Russia's hardline deputy defence minister is a pro- war figure in Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s Government. Captain Khamkhoyev’s death marks the first time a senior official of Putin has suffered the loss of a close relative in his war in Ukraine. Colonel Yevkurov flew to Karabulak to attend his nephew's funeral. Baza news outlet reported that he “shared his condolences, spoke to the elderlies and the religious part of the community, and then flew back to Moscow.” Khamkhoyev was a graduate of the elite Ryazan Airborne Forces school and a commander of a Russian airborne assault squadron. His uncle, Yevkurov, was a decorated paratrooper who once won the Hero of Russia honour, the country's highest award. No details have been released from either Russia or Ukraine on the details of his death. The news comes as Russian soldier Sergeant Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was given a life sentence after being convicted of killing a 62-year-old civilian in the first war crimes trial since the invasion of Ukraine. Putin has faced continued losses with the British Ministry of Defence saying that in three months of the war in Ukraine, Russia is likely to have suffered casualty numbers similar to those experienced by the Soviet Union during a nine-year conflict in Afghanistan. Yevkurov is a former governor and now one of the deputies of close Putin ally Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister. He was the subject of an assassination bid in 2009. In March in a harrowing clip, he was seen visiting a bed-bound soldier in hospital. The serviceman had lost a leg and looked wide-eyed and scared as Yevkurov told him: “ I hope you’ll get back on your feet.” A report in the New York Times states that the United States has provided intelligence about Russian units that have allowed Ukrainians to target and kill Putin's generals, with the attrition rate now standing at around one colonel every two days. Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US was providing “Ukraine with information and intelligence that they can use to defend themselves”. But Adrienne Watson, a national security council spokesperson, said intelligence was not provided “with the intent to kill Russian generals”. Ukrainian officials said they have killed around 12 generals on the front lines.",14,5.371500303816392,4.306474664066258,1.065025639750134,11
2022-05-23,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-russian-soldier-jailed-life-27039166,Russian soldier on trial for war crimes jailed for life over killing civilian,"A Russian soldier has been sentenced to life in prison after killing a civilian in Ukraine's first war crimes trial. Russian serviceman Vadim Shishimarin - who was captured by Ukrainian troops - has been handed the life term during Ukraine's first war crimes trial held since the start of the invasion in February. Shishimarin, a 21-year-old tank commander, had pleaded guilty to killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the northeastern Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on Feb. 28 after being ordered to shoot him. Judge Serhiy Agafonov said Shishimarin, carrying out a ""criminal order"" by a soldier of higher rank, had fired severalshots at the victim's head from an automatic weapon. Shishimarin, wearing a blue and grey hooded sweatshirt, watched proceedings silently from a reinforced glass box in the courtroom and showed no emotion as the verdict was read out. The trial has huge symbolic significance for Ukraine, which has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civiliansduring the invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes. The Kremlin did not immediately comment on the verdict. It has previously said that it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide assistance. ""Of course we are concerned about the fate of our citizen, but, I repeat, we do not have the capacity to protect hisinterests in person,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Shishimarin, 21, testified last Thursday that he shot a civilian on orders from two officers and pleaded for his victim's widow to forgive him following her heartbreaking statement. ""I acknowledge my guilt... I ask you to forgive me,"" he told the widow Kateryna Shelipova. Ms Shelipova, 62, described to the court the anguish at hearing shots from the garden and calling for her husband, only to find Shishimarin with a gun and her husband’s dead body. She said her husband was a tractor driver who did not possess weapons. Ms Shelipova said the loss of her husband is ""everything for me, he was my protector."" She told the court that Shishimarin deserves a life sentence for killing her husband but voiced she wouldn’t mind if he was exchanged as part of a prisoner swap with Russia for the surrendered Ukrainian defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. She asked Shishimarin what he felt when he killed her husband. ""Do you repent of this crime?"" she asked. He responded: "" I admit my guilt. I understand you can't forgive me. I ask forgiveness."" Shishimarin told the court he first disobeyed his immediate commanding officer’s order to shoot the unarmed civilian but then had no other choice but to follow the order when it was forcefully repeated by another officer. The captured member of a Russian tank unit is being prosecuted under a section of the Ukrainian criminal code that addresses the laws and customs of war. Another trial of two Russians in Ukraine started on Tuesday in the Kharkiv region.",13,5.208134289672904,5.630490458944358,-0.42235616927145436,21

Andriy Shevchyk has been hospitalised with injuries of ""varying severity"", reports suggest. The door to the entrance of the home of the self-proclaimed head of the people’s administration was struck in the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar. The explosion took place this morning, with the major said to have been hurt. He was immediately rushed to hospital and remains under medical care. Adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Anton Gerashchenko tweeted about the blast.

Sergei Shoigu said he believed as many as 600 were still inside the plant. The ex-radio host, Dima Kozatsky, and a former student at a Polish university, is said to have signed up for the Ukrainian army in 2015 before joining Azov in 2017.

Professor Alexei Fenenko, a leading research fellow at the Institute of International Security Studies, signalled on the state-controlled channel Russia-1 that a future conflict could be with The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Speaking on a discussion panel this week, Prof Fenenko used the term ""war"" - as opposed to the Kremlin's insistence that the Ukraine invasion was a ""special military operation"" - and suggested more was to come. He said: ""For us, the war in Ukraine is a rehearsal. Rehearsal for a possible bigger conflict in the future. We'll test and compare Nato weapons to our own, we'll find out on the battlefield how much stronger our weapons are then theirs. This may be a learning experience for future conflicts."" Speaking on Twitter, retired US general Barry R McCaffery described Prof Fenenko's statement as ""astonishing"" given how much stronger Nato was compared to Russia. He said: ""The economic and conventional military power of Nato/EU is multiple times that of Russia. A rehearsal for a war with Nato against a much smaller adversary in Ukraine that’s going very badly for Russia. Escalation of Russian aggression against other Nato countries would be completely illogical."" Prof Fenenko's comments came after both Sweden and Finland applied to join Nato, a grouping of 30 member states. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Monday that an expansion of the alliance into either country would force Moscow to react. It came as Russia said it had ""completely liberated"" the Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian coastal city of Mariupol. Nearly 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly left the steelworks early this week after a siege lasting 80 days. Major General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defence Ministry said: ""The territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant in Mariupol, where since April 21 the group of Ukrainian militants of the Azov Nazi formation has been blocked, has been completely liberated."" The Ukrainian captives are being taken to a Russian prison colony. There are fears that Russian president Vladimir Putin could put them on trial as “Nazi war criminals”. A small resistance force in and around the four square-mile steelworks was all that remained and it is believed they have also been defeated.",29,5.301592312630406,6.479207183250404,-1.1776148706199976,29

Putin's forces has suffered heavy losses during the 86 days of fighting since the invasion began. It is widely believed that tens of thousands of Russians have died fighting in Ukraine. Advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Vadym Denysenko, says Russian families haven’t collected the bodies of dead loved ones out of “fear” of the authorities. He said Putin’s government was “intimidating relatives of the dead and missing”. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here They had allegedly told grieving families that they would not receive state compensation for the deaths of their loved ones if they retrieved the bodies from the Ukrainian authorities. This “stops mothers, wives, children from going to the territory of Ukraine and to take the bodies of their dead”, said Denysenko. “This is probably also the first case in the history of mankind when wives, mothers and children of Russian servicemen, choosing between possible compensation and fear of the Russian authorities and the opportunity to bury their child or husband, choose the former.” Alongside that, he claimed that Russia was refusing to take back any of its dead, with bodies piling up in Ukraine. Vadym added: “We can only say that this is probably the first war in the history of mankind when one country refuses to take the bodies of its dead.” The Russian corpses that Ukraine has retrieved from the battlefield are kept in refrigerated train carriages. But it is suspected that Putin is in no rush for them to return home because a flood of dead bodies would highlight the true death toll of the war. “We appeal to the mothers, relatives, and friends of those soldiers who died on Ukrainian territory to come, identify and collect the bodies of their relatives,” Vadym said. Ukraine also highlighted how it had search teams which collected the bodies of Russian invaders and, where possible, identified and tagged them. In a report, Army Inform, the information agency of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, said: ""We receive information about such burials and simply abandoned bodies in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region primarily from our military.” Information about the dead Russian soldiers left behind by their commanders often came from the local residents who survived the occupation. The report said: “Having discovered a number of graves of destroyed Russian servicemen, we deliver their remains to refrigerated wagons only after a certain period.” There have been reports of Russian commanders shooting dead their wounded, rather than retrieving them for medical help. This comes as the Russian invasion of Ukraine comes towards the end of its third month of fighting, since beginning on February 24. Estimate vary, with Ukraine claiming Moscow has lost in excess of 24,000 troops, but most calculations but the upper end of the Kremlin's losses around 20,000 dead.",13,5.8823793511389635,4.4821619264936885,1.400217424645275,12

Eventually parts of the building begin to be visible as the smoke clears and the damage and destruction can be seen. It's unclear how many casualties there are. Further footage shared on Telegram shows more Russian air attacks that have taken place recently. This includes a Russian Iskander-M strike on a Ukrainian position near Petrovsk, in Kharkiv. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said in a social media post early on Saturday that Russia was trying to destroy the city of Sievierodonetsk. In a video posted on Telegram, he said: “Shelling continues from morning to the evening and also throughout the night”. In the early hours of this morning air raid sirens could be heard over much of Ukraine, including in the region around the capital Kyiv, and the southern port of Odessa. After an initial failed push for the capital, Russia withdrew and reorganised its forces to focus on the east of the country. Last month, Moscow announced its new intention to capture the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, much of Ukraine’s industrial Donbas region. Amongst losses suffered elsewhere, Russian forces have successfully been advancing into the Luhansk region. And recently, in a sign that politicians in Moscow might be ramping up the war effort, they said they would consider letting Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 join the military. The last remaining Ukrainian-held territories in the Donbas region are expected to become central in Putin’s ongoing war efforts. The cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, both in Luhansk, are crucial Ukrainian controlled cities in a pocket that Russia has been trying, and failing, to take since April. However, amid the ongoing fighting, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said today that the war could only be resolved through “diplomacy”. His comments come amidst a deadlock in negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Speaking to a Ukrainian TV channel, he said: “The end will be through diplomacy” and he added that the war “will be bloody, there will be fighting, but it will only definitively end through diplomacy”. Recent weeks have seen Russia forced from the outskirts of Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv. However, they have re-taken some of the lost ground and combined with the end of fighting in Mariupol this means Russia now controls a large portion of the south and east of Ukraine.",17,5.090383732908061,4.955774845995173,0.1346088869128872,16

Ukrainian military chiefs claim to have killed hundreds of enemy soldiers as they attempted to cross the Seversky Donets River close to Severodonetsk in the east of the country. Footage and pictures from the scene show destroyed military vehicles- with a Ukrainian soldier claiming the Russians looked like ""some sort of suicide club"". The trooper, named Yuri, told Sky News: “It seems like they were some sort of suicide club, or their commanders didn't care for them - it’s strange. “They just sent them to die and they followed stupid, stupid orders from their commanders.” The Russian forces are understood to have tried to use smoke as a cover as they built pontoon bridges across the strategically-important river. But Ukrainian forces were laying in wait and launched a devastating attack claimed to have killed hundreds of Russians and destroyed around 70 vehicles. Yesterday Ukraine's 30th Mechanized Brigade said its troops had destroyed dozens of Russian armored vehicles close to the village of Dronivka.

Two disabled men in the Donbas region - close to the Russian border - were mobilised by Russian militants despite being physically unable to fight, a Ukrainian Telegram channel claims. One man, who told Ukrainian security services of his ordeal after being arrested, said Vladimir Putin's troops found him at his workplace and gave him ""call-up papers"" forcing him onto the battlefield. Another soldier was also arrested and told Kyiv intelligence agents he saw ""people with cerebral spastic infantile paralysis and without arms"" sent into battle, according to Ukraine NOW. A man with a ""severe head injury"" at the time of his recruitment also told officials soldiers were being mobilised with ""no bulletproof vests"". He added the recruiters ""gave out only a helmet and a cross"" and that bulletproof vests had to be bought for 10,000 rubles (£130). It comes as reports emerge of Russia sustaining heavy losses of around 28,000 men, according to Ukrainian officials, which amounts for almost 20 per cent of the total force Moscow sent across the border on February 24. The Kremlin has also lost as much as 60 per cent of its equipment, including tanks, artillery launchers and other costly military hardware. It's believed that some Russian squads - now focusing on the Donbas region - are depleted to as little as 20 per cent of their former full strength. This void has left the Kremlin vying for assistance from private military companies and mercenaries, Aljazeera reports. There are several reasons for the Russian army's shocking performance during the war. They have been badly neglected over the years. Poorly trained, badly fed and sent into battle with insufficient supplies, which even included rations that were five years out of date. Some had so little fuel they broke down. Top down corruption in Russia has led to funding being diverted into the wrong hands, leading to a cynical and under-performing force. Discipline is a huge issue and senior officers have been sent to the frontline to try to control troops, before getting killed. The backbone of any army is its non-commissioned officers and Russia’s are badly trained. Many recruits are complete novice conscripts. Russian troops fled the outskirts of Kyiv weeks ago to concentrate on the mission in the east, where the two sides have been battling since 2014. They tried repeatedly to take the north-eastern city of Kharkiv and reports indicate they have lost this crucial area. Despite grandiose Russian claims of a huge victory in the key city of Mariupol, Ukraine ’s troops are still holding out in the steel works and their struggle is now a symbol of Ukrainian defiance and bravery. Russia is barely able to claim having taken any major cities in Ukraine and is failing to keep hold of ground it had once dominated. The Ukrainian counter seems to be gaining ground and momentum. In the short term it appears Russia will continue to take heavy losses while claiming the lives of Ukrainian civilians with brutal bombardments. Ukrainian troops are rallying but this next stage in their defence is crucial. Until now they have been constantly flanking Russian forces, ambushing them and cutting off supply lines.",14,4.463095119765612,5.445560296822657,-0.982465177057045,25

Sergeant Vadim Shishimarin, on trial for war crimes, smirked in the dock as he heard he might yet be set free as part of an exchange - despite killing unarmed Oleksandr Shelypov, 62. The 21-year-old POW sheepishly begged for ""forgiveness"" and hung his head during cross-examination from his victim's widow Kateryn, 61, yesterday at Kyiv's Appeal Court. The sadistic soldier, from Irkutsk in Siberia, had shot Oleksandr in the head with an AK-47 assault rifle in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivk on the fifth day of his country's invasion. His mood quickly changed when prosecutors said two of his comrades, due to give evidence against him, had been shipped back home as part of a swap and he learned he could have the same fate. The case was adjourned for sentencing today, with the defendant facing life in prison. Kateryna told judges on Thursday she would support swapping her husband's killer for 1,700 Ukrainian troops captured in the Azovstal factory siege in Mariupol. Kateryna had previously said she hoped he would ""rot in jail"". She said: ""I want him to get life, but if he is exchanged for defenders of the Azovstal, our boys from Mariupol, I will not mind. I will not be against it."" Moscow forces are holding the defending fighters who had been living in the tunnels under the captured plant. Russia has subjected the southern port city to almost constant airstrikes, leaving it largely in ruins, before it fell to their control - one of Vladimir Putin's only successes during the war. But outnumbered Ukrainian forces at the plant continued to hold strong until succumbing this week. Kyiv has confirmed it is negotiating an exchange of the fighters for captured Russian prisoners. However, the Kremlin has not publicly agreed to anything. It is rumoured Putin is planning to put Ukrainians on trial. Kateryna cross-examined Shishimarin on the stand, demanding: ""Tell me what did you feel when you killed my husband? Do you repent of this crime?"" The defendant replied: ""I admit my guilt. I understand you can't forgive me. I ask for your forgiveness."" Kateryna said: ""Tell me, please, why did you come here? To protect us? From whom? From my husband who you killed?"" Shishimarin answered: ""We were just following our orders."" Prosecutors said Oleksandr - who had served as a KGB bodyguard in the Soviet Union - was pushing his bike home when he was gunned down yards from his door on February 28. Shishimarin said he was on the backseat of a VW Passat he and his two comrades had stolen after escaping an ambush by defending forces. They had been trying to evacuate fellow Russian soldiers who had been injured during an apparent friendly fire incident prior to the attack. Shishimarin claimed an officer demanded he shoot Oleksandr. ""I did not want to. He started to say in a forceful tone that I should shoot,"" he said. ""He was saying I was going to put us all in danger if I don't. I shot him at short range with an automatic burst. It killed him. I did not want to kill him. I shot him so they would leave me alone."" Shishimarin said the officer was subsequently killed in a neighbouring village after the unit was attacked by civilians armed with hunting rifles before they eventually surrendered. Kateryna previously said she had attended the trial to see her husband's killer up close. ""He looked like a child, but nevertheless he will get his punishment,"" she said. The widow added: ""I know he is a serviceman and he is following orders but why didn’t he shoot at the ground or in the air? ""He should rot in jail, and spend the rest of his days thinking about what he has done.""",13,5.43775910657026,4.9735563358699135,0.46420277070034643,21

Finland and Sweden formally applied to join NATO on Wednesday after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had discussed the issue with the Dutch prime minister on Friday and would also speak to Britain on Saturday. He did not specify the people he would speak to in Finland and Britain. ""Of course we will continue all these discussions for the sake of not interrupting diplomacy,"" Erdogan told reporters. Ankara says Sweden and Finland harbour people linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group and followers of Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. Western leaders have expressed confidence that Ankara's objections will not be a roadblock for the NATO accession process of the Nordic countries without spelling out how Turkey's position could be changed. Erdogan on Friday criticised the West for not viewing the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia as a terrorist group while viewing the PKK as such. Turkey views both groups as identical. ""Currently there is a terrorist organisation in many European countries, especially in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Sweden, in Finland and in France,"" he said. Erdogan has previously said that Swedish and Finnish delegations should not bother coming to Ankara to convince it to approve their NATO bids and that ""terrorists"" would have to be returned to Turkey before approval is given. Dr Samuel Ramani, an international relations expert at Oxford University and Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, has said that Russia is probably ""pretty happy"" with Turkey. He told The Mirror that Russian media is trying to use this as proof that NATO does not really want Sweden and Finland. Dr Ramani said: ""Russia is using this as a disinformation front at home to reinforce their narrative about NATO being an American hostage organisation."" Russia may be emboldened by Erdogan's move and Dr Ramani says Putin might order more troops on the Finnish border. However, he added: ""They have a manpower shortage right now. But Russian military strategy has been so unpredictable and sometimes baffling in terms of its rationality that it is possible.""

Putin claims there has been a surge in foreign attacks against Russia since the start of his “special operation” in Ukraine. He added these attacks have been coming from state players rather than individual hackers. Russia’s financial and media institutions were among the facilities hit, he said. But the tyrant claims the attacks have failed, before calling on Russia to improve its cyber defences by cutting the risk of using foreign software and hardware. ""Purposeful attempts are being made to disable the Internet resources of Russia's critical information infrastructure"", Putin said. At the start of May, Russian tech terrorists threatened to shut down ventilators in British hospitals, it was claimed. It came a few days after an alleged cyber criminal and supporter of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin was arrested in the UK on May 1. The accused, who is said to be London-based, was detained after a police raid in the aftermath of a cyber assault on government and media websites in Romania, according to reports. He was reportedly a member of hacking group Killnet, which has since warned it will disable NHS ventilators, as well as those in Romania and Moldova if he is not released. The 'gang' has claimed responsibility for the attacks, committed in retaliation for the country's support for Ukraine. The official government webpage and defence ministry were targeted, as well as political parties and other companies. A source told The Sun : ""The UK has robust cyber security measures in place and, working with partners, the NCA would lead an appropriate response to any cyber crime incident having a significant impact on the UK."" It comes after the world’s top intelligence alliance warned last month Russian hackers are plotting cyber attacks on the NHS, nuclear power plants and Whitehall ministries. The Five Eyes security network - involving the UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand - issued an alert accusing the Russian government of exploring options for potential web assaults against critical organisations. The spy coalition urged them to bolster cyber defences as they face a heightened risk of Kremlin-sponsored attacks. According to the alert, ""evolving intelligence"" suggests hackers within the Russian government are seeking to engage in ""malicious cyber activity"" in response to the ""unprecedented economic sanctions"" imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. And in April, it emerged Russian hackers were plotting cyber attacks on the NHS, nuclear power plants and Whitehall ministries, the world’s top intelligence alliance warned in April. The Five Eyes security network - involving the UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand - issued an alert accusing the Russian government of exploring options for potential web assaults against critical organisations.

The horrific report comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Defence logged 10 incidence of rape, including offences against eight children. In a tweet the ministry wrote: ""Today, in just one hour, 10 reports of rape by the [Russian] occupiers, including 8 children, were received from newly liberated villages in the Kharkiv region. Yesterday - 56 reports. ""Among the children: two 10-year-old boys and a 1-year-old boy who died of his injuries."" Ukrainian journalist Iryna Matviyishyn supported the claims with a list of children allegedly abused by Russian soldiers. Ms Matviyishyn also alleged that Kremlin troops had raped a nine-year-old triplet while their mother was forced to watch. A two-year-old girl was also assaulted by two soldiers, the journalist claims. The reporter cited Ukraine’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Lyudmyla Denisova as the source of the allegations. She added: ""According to Denisova, Russians also raped two men aged 67 and 78. “And, reportedly, the Commissioner's Psychological Assistance Line receives calls about such war crimes every day now. ""This is a very small part of territory that was liberated from Russians, compared to those towns, villages and cities that are still under the occupation. ""We can only imagine the number of such atrocities in Kherson, Melitopol, Mariupol, Berdyansk, and others."" Cruel Russian troops also gunned down a teen playing football and held hundreds of people - including babies - hostage underground in the brutal early days of the invasion, a new report has revealed. Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused the Kremlin’s troops of an “abhorrent and cruel” campaign against civilians in late February to early March. Researchers from the humanitarian group visited 17 villages and small towns in Kyiv and Chernihiv regions and discovered 22 executions, six disappearances and seven cases of torture. Among the war crimes uncovered from talking to survivors, they found Dmytro Solovei, 14, was shot dead as he kicked a ball about on a playground in the village of Nova Basan. His older brother was killed as he attempted to retrieve Dmytro’s body. Shockingly, in Yahidne, survivors said Russian soldiers held more than 350 people hostage in a school basement for a month, with 70 of the captives children. Five were babies. The captives had little air or room to even lay down and were forced to use buckets if they needed the toilet. One said of the time underground: “After a week, everyone was coughing violently. “Almost all the children had high fevers, spasms from coughing, and would throw up.” Ten of the adults died during the ordeal. Giorgi Gogia, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said: “The numerous atrocities by Russian forces occupying parts of northeastern Ukraine early in the war are abhorrent, unlawful, and cruel. “These abuses against civilians are evident war crimes that should be promptly and impartially investigated and appropriately prosecuted.” Other appalling acts of cruelty uncovered by teams include Russians holding dozens of people in a 40 meter room in Dymer, where the men were blindfolded and handcuffed for several weeks. HRW found seven cases of enemy soldiers beating their prisoners, using electric shocks on their bodies or carrying out mock executions in which the people were convinced they were about to die.",13,5.280813279505044,4.039651864200161,1.2411614153048829,22

Ukrainian troops surrendered at the besieged Azovstal plant earlier this week after suffering from severe shortages. After weeks of being besieged by Russian forces, the soldiers did not even have basic necessities such as bandages to treat their wounded troops. Russian soldiers first stormed the Azovstal iron and steel works plant in the city of Mariupol on 19th April and destroyed large areas. The Azov Battalion, a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine based in Mariupol, remained at the plant to mount a resistance. As a result, around 1,000 Ukrainian fighters have surrendered at the Azovstal plant this week. The Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in a statement this week: ""In Mariupol, militants of Azov nationalist unit and Ukrainian servicemen holed up in the Azovstal plant continue to surrender. ""Over the past 24 hours, 694 militants have laid down their arms and surrendered, including 29 wounded. ""A total of 959 militants have surrendered since 16th May, including 80 wounded, 51 needed urgent hospital treatment and were admitted to Novoazovsk Hospital in the Donetsk People's Republic."" Ukrainian fighter Pryashchenko Stanislav gave an account of the treatment he has been receiving at the hands of his Russian captors. In the footage, he is heard saying: ""Today they took us to the dining room. We had soup in the morning. There was also soup and porridge at lunch. ""We have not had dinner yet, we are still waiting. So we have beds, mattresses. ""Everything is as it should be. Blankets, pillows, everything is there, bed linen. ""Here are the beds, we have mattresses, blankets. We have enough beds for everyone."" Stanislav added: ""We have wounded guys here. We are waiting for the doctor now, they promised to come right now, to change the dressing."" Junior sergeant Slivak Sergey Evgenievich, 30 57 National Guard, said: ""Treatment is better than I expect, I have a blanket, mattress. Food is adequate, there is enough to eat. ""As for everything else, conditions here are good."" Surgeon Yuri Zayduk, lieutenant of the Medical Service, said: ""I really didn't know what to expect. In general what I wanted, what turned out was better than I expected. ""Everything is fine, I have no complaints, everyone is respectful, adequate. Nobody uses insults here, nobody offends us, for sure. ""They helped my colleagues, I was assured that everything was fine. ""Most of the seriously wounded soldiers were taken out, at least during that first time with me. It was fine, they did the dressings. I hope such treatment will continue there."" Following the fall of Mariupol, the Russian authorities plan to tear down the Azovstal metallurgical plant and turn the city into a ""resort"", according to the Institute for the Study of War. The Kremlin also says that the Ukrainian fighters from the Azovstal plant have been taken to a former prison colony in a Russian-controlled part of Donetsk. Russia's defence ministry said 771 Ukrainian fighters from the steelworks had surrendered up until 19th May, taking the total to 1,730, and 80 of the fighters were wounded.",17,5.057979990990594,4.5508841791150445,0.5070958118755495,26

Vladimir Putin is said to have axed two of his military leaders in relation to the failure to capture second city Kharkiv as well as the sinking of Moscow's flagship Moskva. Lieutenant General Serhiy Kisel, who commanded the elite 1st Guards Tank Army, has been suspended, as has Vice Admiral Igor Osipov, who commanded Russia ’s Black Sea Fleet. Russian Chief of the General Staff Valeriy Gerasimov, meanwhile, likely remains in a post, but it is unclear whether he ""retains the confidence of President Putin"", the intelligence says. A statement from the Ministry of Defence adds: ""A culture of coverups and scapegoating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system. ""Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia’s operational setbacks."" The 510-crew missile Moskva ship was struck by two Ukrainian missiles and was a major military blow for Russia. Putin's nation still refuses to acknowledge that dozens and even hundreds of missing sailors on the ship are dead after it sank on April 14. Kharkiv fell early during the war but in recent weeks, Russian forces have abandoned the area around the city. ""We have some success in these directions,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak told MSNBC this week. It came as invaders across the country were forced to completely change tack after struggling to gain a central foothold as it moved in on Kyiv. The capital city has always held firm and Kremlin fighters were eventually ordered to withdraw from the region to focus on the southeast. However, despite several weeks of further bloody conflict on the new main front in the Donbas border region - which Moscow claims on behalf of separatists - it has made little headway. Where Putin has seen rare success, is in Mariupol. After months of daily shell attacks leaving the southern strategic port city almost completely in ruins, 700 Ukrainian fighters have this week surrendered allowing Russia to shore up control. Kyiv has ordered its garrison in Mariupol to stand down, but the ultimate outcome of Europe's bloodiest battle for decades remains unresolved. Moscow says it is engaged in a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour. The West and Kyiv call that a false pretext for invasion. Around Slovyansk to the north of Donetsk, in the Donbas, Russian forces ""suffered significant losses"" around the settlement of Velyka Komyshuvakha, according to reports. Ukrainian forces shelled a border village in Russia's western region of Kursk at dawn on Thursday, killing at least one civilian, regional Russian Governor Roman Starovoit said. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukrainian saboteurs had blown up railway tracks ahead of an armoured train carrying Russian troops in the occupied southern city of Melitopol.",14,6.186795572951263,5.46028840020966,0.726507172741603,20

Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, 21, testified on Thursday that he shot a civilian on orders from two officers and pleaded for his victim's widow to forgive him following her heartbreaking statement. ""I acknowledge my guilt... I ask you to forgive me,"" he told the widow Kateryna Shelipova. Ms Shelipova, 62, described to the court the anguish at hearing shots from the garden and calling for her husband, only to find Shishimarin with a gun and her husband’s dead body. She said her husband was a tractor driver who did not possess weapons. Ms Shelipova said the loss of her husband is ""everything for me, he was my protector."" She told the court that Shishimarin deserves a life sentence for killing her husband but voiced she wouldn’t mind if he was exchanged as part of a prisoner swap with Russia for the surrendered Ukrainian defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. She asked Shishimarin what he felt when he killed her husband. ""Do you repent of this crime?"" she asked. He responded: "" I admit my guilt. I understand you can't forgive me. I ask forgiveness."" The young sergeant is convicted of shooting the Ukrainian man in the head through an open car window in a village in the northeastern Sumy region on February 28, just four days into the Russian invasion. If sentenced he will likely get life imprisonment. Shishimarin told the court he first disobeyed his immediate commanding officer’s order to shoot the unarmed civilian but then had no other choice but to follow the order when it was forcefully repeated by another officer. The captured member of a Russian tank unit is being prosecuted under a section of the Ukrainian criminal code that addresses the laws and customs of war. Another trial of two Russians in Ukraine started on Tuesday in the Kharkiv region. Alexander Bobykin and Alexander Ivanov are accused of violating the laws or customs of war from their shelling in Kharkiv. The duo have already pleaded guilty to violating the customs of war.

Colonel Denis Kozlov, 40, was the second commander of the 12th Separate Guards Engineers of Keningsbersko-Gorodok Red Banner Brigade to die in the conflict. He was buried in Murom, Vladimir Region, on Tuesday, BBC News Russia reported. Col Kozlov had replaced Colonel Sergei Porokhnya, 45, who was killed in Ukraine on March 14. Kozlov died while building a pontoon crossing for the further advance of the troops, on May 11. According to local Russian news outlet Murom24 he ""heroically died when guiding a pontoon ferry to make a further advance of the troops."" On Friday, Putin's army suffered heavy losses while trying to establish a pontoon crossing across the Seversky Donets River near the village of Belogorovka in the Luhansk region. Ukrainian military claimed to have destroyed a pontoon bridge and part of a Russian armoured column, according to footage published by the Ukrainian military on Friday. The number of deaths is unknown but the video shows multiple burnt-out military vehicles and parts of the pontoon bridge submerged. Reuters reports that images also show damaged vehicles, including tanks, in the forest and on the road leading to the river. It is thought Col Kozlov was among the Russian troops who perished in the failed advance across the Seversky Donets River when he and his men were ambushed by a Ukrainian attack. This is the third unsuccessful attempt from Putin's forces to build bridges across the Seversky Donets River in eastern Ukraine, Sergei Gaidai, head of the military administration of the Lugansk region, told the BBC. ""We destroyed Russian boats and helicopters that they used to cover their attempts [to build bridges]"", Gaidai claims that the Russian military tried to disguise their operations. Col Kozlov was posthumously decorated with the Russian Order of Courage and laid to rest in his hometown Murom, in Vladimir Oblast. His death now makes him the 42nd known Colonel to perish in the war, indicating the huge toll suffered by Putin’s army. With the attrition rate now standing at around one colonel every two days.

The Kyiv government has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during the invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes and accused Kyiv of staging them to smear its forces. The SBU Security Service of Ukraine conducted the investigation into the case, it said. State prosecutor Andriy Synyuk told reporters after his first hearing last week: ""This is the first case today. But soon there will be a lot of these cases."" Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said on May 12 there were many examples of possible war crimes since the Russian invasion and that 1,000 bodies had been recovered so far in the Kyiv region.

With the conflict being described as Vladimir Putin's war, as well as speculations of the Kremlin leader's health - including recent claims of him suffering from blood cancer - it raises the question of how involved Putin is in making war decisions. Here's what you need to know about Putin's involvement in war strategies and decisions, as revealed by Western military sources this week. Western official sources have claimed that Vladimir Putin has become increasingly involved in low-level military strategy in Ukraine. In particular, Putin is said to be playing a significant role in determining troop movements in the Donbas region, after Ukrainian forces successfully prevented Russians from crossing the river. The officials also said that Putin is working closely with General Valery Gerasimov, the top commander of the Russian armed forces, despite rumours that the senior general had been suspended after multiple defeats. According to The Times, military sources believe that Putin's heavy hand in military operations may be contributing to Russia's failures in Ukraine. Putin ""micromanaging"" Russia's war efforts is a tactic that's often used in Russian military fights, according to Simon Miles, an assistant professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy. Most Western armies are trained to spot opportunities to carry out their orders based on shifts in an enemy's position or readiness. Meanwhile, major decisions in the Russian military have to be run up the chain of command, often to a high-ranking officer, before they can be implemented Miles, who is a historian of the Soviet Union and US-Soviet relations, believes that this common practice of sending top-level officials to the front line is a major reason Russia has lost so many generals since the war began. He explained: ""It's not the most combat-effective military culture by a long shot, but it helps us understand the Russians' poor battlefield performance."" Speaking of Putin's involvement in war decisions, he said: ""The president's low-level decision-making is probably contributing to tactical failures now, but more importantly, it is the cause of the massive strategic failure in week one."" He added: ""I think it is inevitable that [Putin] is getting into micromanagement because this is so very much his war. We know more and more that this whole thing was planned by a very small group, with Putin at its centre.""",14,5.157206576962592,4.452817918734581,0.7043886582280106,29

Videos show the much-feared urban warfare armoured vehicles reportedly in the Donbas, where fighting in Ukraine is now centred. The deployment comes after Russia has suffered significant losses of its tanks at the hands of Ukrainian forces so far. The capture of Russian tanks was so common that the Ukrainian government had to issue instructions on how to hand them over to the authorities to make sure ordinary Ukrainians weren't driving them round. This comes as Ukraine has said it destroyed Russian tanks using British-made Brimstone missiles for the first time. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In the days leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the terminator tanks were seen amassing near the Ukrainian border . The move came shortly after Russia had said it would pull troops back from the border, and before Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine three days later. Newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta confirmed “a platoon of Terminator tank support vehicles was used for the first time in battle in the Donbas”. The BMPTs - or tank support combat vehicles as they are designated - were seen near Severodonetsk in Luhansk region. “They are involved in the fire destruction of Ukrainian positions, armoured vehicles, and crews of anti-tank missile systems,” a defence source told state news agency RIA Novosti. The vehicles are equipped with grenade launchers, anti-tank systems and small arms, and were nicknamed Terminator by its manufacturers Uralvagonzavod. They saw action in Syria and it is unclear why Putin’s generals have delayed its deployment until now. One theory is that his beleaguered commanders do not trust it to be as all-conquering as its name suggests. Pro-Russian war reporter Alexander Sladkov posted: “Thank God we are starting to use Terminators. “There might be issues and mistakes, but practice is everything.” In the videos, a steady stream of the tanks can be seen rolling by along the residential street in Ukraine. This all comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues into its 83rd day. After Russia's initial push to seize Ukraine's cities and urban centres, Russia quickly found its progress stalling in the face of tougher than expected resistance. After weeks of their forces stalling outside of Kyiv, but unable to penetrate the Ukrainian capital, Russia pulled back and regrouped in the Donbas in the east of the country, where fighting is now focused. Mariupol has been one of the flashpoints of fighting, and the city where Russia has made the most progress. Ukrainian forces made their last stand in the Azovstal steel and iron works in the city. However, in the last 24 hours reports emerging from the city seem to suggest that the fighters have surrendered but their fate is unknown.",14,4.842258877771902,4.510445260874915,0.3318136168969863,8

Russia is being accused of false promises after it agreed to exchange the Ukrainians still fighting in Mariupol if they gave up their resistance. Members of the Azov Regiment had been stubbornly fighting on against Vladimir Putin ’s forces at the massive steelworks with a maze of tunnels that made it difficult for them to be defeated. More than 250 Ukrainian soldiers surrendered after weeks of desperate resistance, bringing an end to the most devastating siege of Russia's war in Ukraine. But now Russia’s Parliament has said it will vote on a resolution not to allow the “exchange of Nazi war criminals” and some MPs have called for them to be executed. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Russian Parliament, said: “They are war criminals, and we must do everything to bring them to justice.” The Russian MP Leonid Slutsky called for the troops to be executed. He said: ""They do not deserve to live after the monstrous crimes against humanity that they have committed and that are committed continuously against our prisoners."" Putin had personally guaranteed the prisoners would be treated according to international standards, and Ukrainian officials said they could be exchanged for Russian captives. TASS news agency said a Russian committee planned to question the soldiers, many of them members of the Azov Battalion, as part of an investigation into what Moscow calls ""Ukrainian regime crimes"". With some fighters still in the Azovstal steelworks, any going back on the agreement would lead to a breakdown in further surrenders and prisoner exchanges. Vladislav Davidzon, a Russia expert at the Atlantic Council think-tank, reportedly said: ""A change to the law by Russian MPs could derail any prisoner swap. It shows just how underhand Putin and his cronies are in the dishonourable way they wage war."" The complete capture of Mariupol is Russia's biggest victory since it launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on February 24. But the port lies in ruins, and Ukraine believes tens of thousands of people were killed under months of Russian bombardment. Russia said at least 256 Ukrainian fighters had ""laid down their arms and surrendered"", including 51 severely wounded. Ukraine said 264 soldiers, including 53 wounded, had left. Russian defence ministry video showed fighters leaving the plant, some carried on stretchers, others with hands up to be searched by Russian troops. While both sides spoke of a deal under which all Ukrainian troops would abandon the steelworks, many details were not yet public, including how many fighters still remained inside, and whether any form of prisoner swap had been agreed. Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar told a briefing that Kyiv would not disclose how many fighters remained inside until all were safe. Its military said units in Azovstal had completed their combat mission and Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Kyiv aimed to arrange a prisoner swap for the wounded once their condition stabilises, but neither side disclosed terms for any specific deal.",13,4.370800086985669,4.258905372654196,0.11189471433147347,26

Human Rights Watch has documented that Russian soldiers requested civilians to become execution “volunteers”, and there are also numerous cases of civilians being held in “dirty and suffocating conditions” thus developing bedsores. One woman from the Chernihiv region said she witnessed soldiers suggesting to a 63-year-old man with cancer that he could “hang himself” to alleviate the pain he was experiencing from sitting for days in a school basement. “The numerous atrocities by Russian forces occupying parts of northeastern Ukraine early in the war are abhorrent, unlawful, and cruel,” said Giorgi Gogia, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Gogia urged that these war crimes should be ""promptly and impartially"" investigated and appropriately prosecuted. To chronicle the horrors, the organisation visited 17 villages and small towns in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions where they investigated 22 apparent summary executions, nine other unlawful killings, six possible enforced disappearances, and seven cases of torture. They encountered 21 civilians who all described unlawful confinement in inhuman and degrading conditions. Since Putin invaded Ukraine at the end of February, his forces have been implicated in numerous atrocities that likely amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. In one of the newly documented killings by Human Rights Watch, Anastasia Andriivna said that she was at home when soldiers detained her son after they found his old military coat. A few weeks later, on March 31, the day after Russian forces withdrew, Andriivna found her son’s body 100 metres from her house after recognising his trainers poking out a barn door. She said: ""He was lying there in a foetal position, with his hands tucked under his head, and his jacket draped over his shoulders. He had been shot in the ear, with blood covering his face. ""His best friend was lying next to him; he had also been shot. His legs were bent in an unnatural position."" The organisation has credible evidence which shows troops forcing civilians, for days or weeks, into dirty and suffocating conditions at sites such as school basements, a room in a window manufacturing plant, and a pit in a boiler room. In Yahidne, over 350 villagers, including at least 70 children were held in a school basement for 28 days with little air or room to lie down. One of the women held in the basement and who sat close to the door, which had cracks in it, described seeing an armoured vehicle bringing a man, covered in a blanket, to the schoolyard. She saw Russian soldiers put him on his knees and question him, and then throw him into the boiler room on the other side of the schoolyard. The British government says it is considering supporting a special international tribunal to try Putin for the war in Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that ministers were looking at the “most effective way” of holding Russia ’s leaders to account for “appalling war crimes”.",13,4.609909917264505,5.050298592018762,-0.44038867475425647,22
2022-05-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-could-swap-ukrainian-steel-26991177,Russia 'could swap Ukrainian steel plant siege heroes with imprisoned officers',"Hundreds of besieged Ukrainian soldiers have emerged from their Mariupol bunker hell and handed themselves over to Russian forces. Their evacuation into Russian custody triggered prisoner swap talks with Moscow expected to demand Ukraine releases imprisoned officers. Even as they evacuated Russian forces continued to pound Ukraine with missiles, killing ten civilians and injuring three in a strike on Chernihiv. And in Lviv officials were investigating Monday night’s air strikes on the western region which were aimed at crippling a military storage area. Many of the Mariupol troops have horrific injuries and are being treated at medical facilities in Russian-held territory in east Ukraine. It comes amid fears Russian forces will appoint Chechen soldiers to “control” the citizens of Mariupol and have been given a free pass to “loot and intimidate” locals. More than 260 Ukrainian fighters freed themselves from a labyrinth of underground tunnels beneath Azovstal steelworks having held off Russian attacks for more than 80 days. Civilians and Ukrainian fighters, many from the Azov Regiment, hid in the Soviet-era steel complex which was designed to withstand nuclear attack. There are fears for the welfare of the soldiers after “death penalty” calls from Russian lawmakers and politicians branding them “Nazis.” Ukraine’s military command had said in the early hours of Tuesday that the mission to defend the steel plant was over and President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive.” A convoy of buses took the soldiers from the plant to Russian-occupied Novoazovsk, although it is not known if and how many Ukrainians are left in the complex. Moscow has depicted the Azov Regiment as one of the main inspirations behind Moscow’s ridiculed narrative that Ukraine is being governed by “Nazis.” The Azov Regiment was formed in 2014 as an extreme right-wing volunteer militia to fight Russian-backed separatists but the troops deny being fascist, racist or Nazis. Ukraine says it has been reformed away from its radical nationalist origins to be integrated into the National Guard and commanders call them:”Heroes of our time.” A Russian Supreme Court hearing will rule on whether the Azov regiment should be designated a terrorist organisation on May 26, according to the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy said in his address that “the work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy - and time”. But Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, Russia ’s lower house, said: “Nazi criminals should not be exchanged.” Lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, one of Russia’s negotiators in talks with Ukraine, called the evacuated combatants “animals in human form” and said they should receive the death penalty. He said: “They do not deserve to live after the monstrous crimes against humanity that they have committed and that are committed continuously against our prisoners.” Pavlo Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol Mayor, accused Russia of planning to hand Mariupol to Chechen troops, explaining: “It becomes a little clear what the occupiers plan to do with Mariupol and who will be the recovery curator.” Referring to Ramzan Kadrov, the Chechen leader, he added: “In order to intimidate and suppress the resistance it is planned to give the city to the Kadyrovites.” He indicated that the Chechens will be given freedom of the port trade and will be at liberty to steal anything they like, explaining the deal came : “. . . . With port and looting rights.”",17,3.8182752827648736,4.049752161787451,-0.2314768790225772,26
2022-05-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-failing-ukraine-war-due-26988117,"Russia failing in Ukraine war due to Putin meddling in decisions, sources say","Vladimir Putin has been meddling in everyday battlefield decisions which has lead to Russia 's failures in the Ukraine war, sources say. The tyrant has been making tactical decisions usually reserved for officers in charge of as few as 700 troops - rather than a national armed force of over 150,000 soldiers. Putin and his war-tactician crony General Valery Gerasimov are micromanaging battle decisions - which are unfitting for men of their position, a military source said. The source said: “We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision-making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier."" The source compared the situation to Amazon businessman Jeff Bezos, who ""doesn't deliver your parcels"" but ""makes strategy decisions"". Last week rumours swirled that the chief of staff had been axed for failing to capture Ukraine as quickly as Putin wanted. But the general is still ""up and running"" and helping Putin's meddling, the source told The Times. They said Putin and Gerasimov are making orders usually made by a ""colonel or brigadier"" - who generally command two battalions at a time. Each battalion would contain roughly 900 servicemen or women, they add. But these battalions - dubbed BTGs - are being blasted back by Ukrainian forces, and the military source predicts Russian forces may have dwindled to as little as 700 soldiers, a second military source revealed. Putin's meddling may be the root of failures in the Donbas region, which the Kremlin expected to capture quickly due to pro-Russian support in the area. Confidence in Moscow has turned to despair after Russian troops failed to capture cities in the Russian speaking West. Western sources have pondered why Ukraine - which is outgunned and outmanned - continues to beat Russia on the battlefield. The head of the British Army, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, told Parliament yesterday it was because Ukraine is involved in an ""existential fight for its nation"". This will guarantee the survival of the Kyiv government, he said. Former FSB agent Igor Girkin - who orchestrated the annexation of Crimea - wrote on social media that Russia's attempts to capture Donbas had failed. He wrote: ""In more than two weeks of fierce hostilities, only tactical successes have been reached. But trouncing Moscow may have dire consequences for the rest of the world, with some experts saying Putin might press the button and unleash a nuclear war if his ""special operation"" fails. Sir Antony Beevor says the Russian President believes NATO's 'advance' on his own country's borders is the equivalent to the Nazis moving through Europe 80 years ago. And the push for Finland and Sweden to join the alliance in recent days amid the despot's catastrophic invasion of Ukraine will have done little to ease his misplaced suspicions. Sir Antony, who has published several books on the Second World War, said Putin genuinely thinks the Red Army fought off Adolf Hitler's Wehrmacht ""single-handed"" while the western allies wanted to ""stab the Soviet Union in the back"". Moscow's current invasion, which it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists, has jolted European security.",14,4.537052630420057,4.208531992139302,0.3285206382807546,29

Tatiana Monko and her husband fled the besieged city of Bucha with their two young children when Russian forces invaded. The family headed for central Ukraine, having no idea when or if they could ever return to their home. However after Russians withdrew from the city in late March many displaced families, including Tatiana's, returned. Most found their homes either completely obliterated or ransacked. Tatiana described how her home was turned upside down by Russian troops who had occupied it, before she went on to discover a grenade hidden in the workings of a piano after noticing one of the ivory keys didn't fully press down. She said: ""I tell my husband, 'there is something there'. ""We had suspicions about them planting bombs before — my husband mentioned that the awards on the shelf were placed in the wrong order."" Tatiana and her husband asked Ukrainian military troops to return to their home for a further inspection - having already declared the property safe from explosives. However, during their second visit, they discovered and removed a VOG-25P grenade launcher round from their daughter Dashunya's piano. In a shocking image taken from under the piano, the grenade can be seen resting under the white keys. Tatiana told Business Insider : ""This photo symbolises the ugliness of those who attacked us. ""And...not only the leaders of their state, because it was done by ordinary people who enjoy the murders of Ukrainians. This is a real genocide. ""It is horrible that the world is trying to bargain with Russia, not realising that their price is our lives. This act — that they left an explosive for a talented child — it speaks for itself."" It comes as a Russian tank commander accused of killing a Ukrainian civilian has gone on trial in the first for alleged war crimes committed during the invasion. The Ukrainian court held a preliminary hearing on Friday after charging a 21-year-old soldier with the murder of a 62-year-old civilian. During the short hearing, the defendant said his name was Vadim Shishimarin and confirmed that he was a Russian serviceman. Shishimarin was accused of ""violations of the laws and norms of war"". The defendant did not enter a plea at today's hearing and will do so at a later date, his lawyer Viktor Ovsyannikov said. Shishimarin wore a casual blue and grey hoodie and was led into the courtroom by police to a glass booth for defendants. The Ukrainian prosecutor told the court the defendant was a tank commander in the Kantemirovskaya tank division from the Moscow region. If convicted he faces up to life imprisonment over the killing in a village in the east of Kyiv on February 28.",13,4.375620091800387,5.940267065454234,-1.564646973653847,21
2022-05-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-killed-more-ukrainian-26985240,"Putin has killed more in Ukrainian city than Hitler did during WW2, mayor says","Vladimir Putin has killed twice as many people in Mariupol than Adolf Hitler did during World War 2, the Ukrainian city's mayor has claimed. In a grave warning to western allies, Mayor Vadym Boychenko said that the number will only increase if more pressure is not piled on the Russian President. Boychenko is firefighting a crisis of a huge scale, with 82 days of bombardment and decomposing bodies infiltrating the water supply, thus triggering a deadly epidemic. After months of bombardment, Ukraine ’s military said on Monday it was ending its combat mission as evacuations at the embattled Azovstal steel plant commenced. Around 260 Ukrainian fighters were taken to Russian-held territory and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said they will exchange them for Russian prisoners of war. Speaking with the i Newspaper, Boychenko said that the evil created by Russia in Mariupol is ""even worse than Nazi Germany"". He continued: ""In the Second World War, 10,000 people were killed in Mariupol in a two-year occupation. In two months of this blood-shedding war, Russia has killed more than 20,000. Putin is a bigger evil than Hitler and we must stop him. “He will not stop at Ukraine. It is not enough for Russia. That is why we need to stop him as soon as possible so Russia cannot continue to spread its influence in Europe. We need to have our territories back.” Putin's forces tried to take the port city before, in 2014. As a huge industrial centre and port on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol would be a huge economic coup for Russia and is also a main supply route from Rostov into southern Ukraine. Boychenko spoke of the fear civilians face daily, along with no electricity or gas, nor food. But the biggest problem now, he says, ""is with the drinking water."" Bodies are littered across the city, causing the soil to get poisoned, eventually getting into underground water and into rivers and the sea. He continued by saying weather is getting warmer and, according to the estimates of doctors, the city can expect contagious diseases that will take thousands of lives. The Russians wheeled out similar tactics in Mariupol to those used in Syria. Troops repeatedly hit hospitals and bullied civilians into evacuating after targeting shelters and evacuation corridors. Once the city was mostly cleared the Russians could then focus all efforts against the defenders and pushing them into a last stronghold. The situation in Mariupol is bleak — Boychenko saying there are also no medical facilities and the council has warned that cholera, dysentery and E.coli could spread as temperatures creep up and thousands of bodies lie slain among the rubble. He said the occupiers claim they are a competent authority but they don’t understand what they are doing. And he added that it will take up to two years to restore the gas and water.",17,4.531465125865443,4.017999160763711,0.5134659651017319,26
2022-05-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-hit-another-mystery-fire-26985440,Russia hit by another mystery fire at chemical plant after series of infernos,"Russia has been hit by another fire at a chemical plant after numerous have mysteriously gone up in flames in the last few months. It is the latest in a series of infernos at industrial facilities during the war in Ukraine with some experts saying sabotage could be to blame. Today’s blaze was at a plant making plastics in Berdsk, in Novosibirsk region, four time zones east of Moscow. It was unclear if the plastics had defence uses. A video shows thick black smoke emanating from the fire amid reports the roof was destroyed and extensive damage caused. The blaze appears to have destroyed production facilities, offices and a canteen. Almost 50 firefighters were working at the scene with some 22,000 square feet destroyed. The fire began in polyethylene products on the building's first floor, according to some reports. There were no reports of fatalities. Another fire on May 4 was at a railway tanker containing unspecified solvents on the territory of huge factory Kaprolaktam, in Dzerzhinsk, which once made chemical weapons. A blaze on 1 May saw a gigantic fire in which three women died at explosives manufacturer Perm Gunpowder Plant, which supplies the army. The plant makes Grad and Smerch multiple launch rocket systems, used by Russian forces in Ukraine, and air defence systems as well as tank rounds. It supplies gunpowder for small arms. The Dmitrievsky chemical plant in Kineshma burned down on April 21. This was the largest Russian manufacturer of chemical solvents used in a variety of industries including defence facilities. Another fire that has raised questions of sabotage was at a Russia missile design institute in which 22 weapons officials and designers died. At least 13 employees of the facility in Tver remain in hospital from among 54 rescued from ferocious flames. Another 98 were safely evacuated and one remains missing, presumed dead, from the blaze on 21 April at Russia’s Central Research Institute of the Aerospace Defence Forces This and other mysterious fires may be aimed at seeking “to dissuade his weapons of mass destruction brinkmanship”, says a US expert. Professor Douglas London, of Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, and a retired 34-year CIA operations officer, told Foreign Policy journal that some recent incidents - including oil deport fires - may have been sabotage linked to the war. “US and allied enabling of a Ukrainian sabotage campaign inside Russia telegraphs a significant and escalating cost Putin can ill afford,” he said. Russia’s leading independent gun-maker urged the Russian authorities to be more suspicious of sabotage over the wave of fires. Vladislav Lobaev said: “The Dmitrievsky chemical plant in the city of Kineshma burned down. “It is the largest Russian manufacturer of chemical solvents used in a variety of industries…. “Separately, the building of the defence research Institute in Tver burned to the ground… “It was at this institute that the Iskanders and the S-400 were developed.” He warned: “It is hard to believe in such coincidences, especially with large or such iconic enterprises. “In wartime, it is necessary to work out the version of sabotage more actively.”",17,5.463537233124358,4.855796135145794,0.6077410979785638,16

It comes amid claims that the spymaster seen as responsible for telling him that Ukraine was ripe for invasion has not been arrested, as widely reported. Col-General Sergei Beseda, 68, head of the 5th Service of the Federal Security Service (FSB), was said to have been detained either under house arrest or under pre-trial detention in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo jail. Now, despite stark new evidence of the incompetent intelligence reaching Putin, a new account based on rare leaks says this is not true. “Beseda is untouchable,” one source told IStories, a media outlet linked to Russia ’s top investigative journalists. “People like him don’t get jailed.” It is unclear if he is still in post or currently advising Putin but the report stated: ""At the start of the war many media even reported Beseda and colleagues were arrested for the fact their information about Ukraine was false. ""But four sources said it is not true."" Despite this, there is open war inside the FSB over intelligence that led Putin to believe Russian troops would be welcomed in many Ukrainian regions. ""The level of professionalism there is worthless,” said a source quoted by IStories. Beseda’s agents were “selling air” instead of providing hard and reliable data. “They would over- or misinterpret information, sometimes they would make up things completely,” said a former FSB officer. “The senior executives used to believe all of this nonsense. “For instance, they would report that the regions of Ukraine did not have any real connection with the Kyiv government and would run towards Russia should they have a chance to do so.” This led Putin to setting a target to take Kyiv in five days, and Mariupol in three, according to IStories. In fact, Putin was forced to abort his plan to grab the capital, and has only gained control of a devastated and unrecognisable Mariupol after almost three months of fighting. A servicing FSB staffer said of the 5th service: “It was full of people who had no clue how the job is done. “Many people refused to join the department, it is something of a swamp really.” A key problem was that the spies Putin relied on were gathering intelligence from discredited and fugitive members of the Ukrainian government overthrown in 2014. These people had an axe to grind. Another ex-FSB agent told journalists: “They would feed Beseda with their made-up fantasies to seem worthwhile and receive financial aid. “They were also dreaming about returning to Ukraine. “They would even plan out what positions they would take in the future. This way they adapted their stories to create a favourable picture.” A member of a Russian special-purpose unit - referring to Putin - told IStories: ""However funny it may sound, the decision about the war was taken by the most uninformed person that could possibly have taken it. The president.” The report said that while Beseda may not have been arrested, there is a mood for recriminations. “No-one hides that inside FSB that there are big questions over the work of the 5th service,” said the report. “Moreover, many fellow FSB are thirsty for the blood of their colleagues from that service, and wait for criminal cases to start against them.” Novaya Gazeta - an independent Russian investigative news outlet now in exile - wrote: “Putin relied upon the information provided by incompetent FSB officers when he planned his invasion into Ukraine.” Other accounts, especially from leading security expert and journalist Andrei Soldatov, have insisted that Beseda was detained as part of a sweep up of dozens of FSB operatives seen as having given Putin dud data over Ukraine. He was being held in Lefortovo under a pseudonym, it was claimed.",3,4.4261869299595915,4.944981760360714,-0.5187948304011227,3

The clip is claimed to show two BMP-2 IFV tanks put out of action during Vladimir Putin's assault on Donbas in Ukraine. In the 13 second footage, two large plumes of smoke are seen as the Russian tank steers into mines, which send mud flying into the air. Ukraine's military estimates that Russia has lost more than 1,200 tanks since the invasion began in February, while intelligence chiefs believe that more than a third of its ground forces have been obliterated. Latest estimates claim that more than 27,000 of Putin's troops have died during the assault on Ukraine. It is also claimed to have lost 200 planes, 165 helicopters, and almost 3,000 armoured personnel carriers. A British intelligence assessment released on Sunday said: ""Russia has now likely suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed in February. ""Russia's Donbas offensive has lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule. ""Despite small-scale initial advances, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains over the past month whilst sustaining consistently high level of attrition."" Russia has previously been accused of using banned anti-personnel landmines during its invasion. In March Ukrainian explosives technicians discovered the mines, which can indiscriminately kill and maim people within an apparent 16-meter range. Human Rights Watch said that Ukraine does not possess this type of landmine, with arms director Steve Goose stating: “Countries around the world should forcefully condemn Russia’s use of banned antipersonnel landmines in Ukraine. “These weapons do not differentiate between combatants and civilians and leave a deadly legacy for years to come.” Anti-vehicle mines are not banned, but the UN has warned about their deadly legacy. This morning Ukraine admitted defeat in the battle of Mariupol, saying it was working to evacuate all remaining troops from the stronghold. The evacuation of hundreds of fighters, many wounded, to Russian-held towns, likely marked the end of the longest and bloodiest battle of the Ukraine war. Mariupol is now in ruins after a Russian siege that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of people in the city. With the rest of Mariupol firmly in Russian hands, hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians had holed up beneath the city's Azovstal steelworks. ""The 'Mariupol' garrison has fulfilled its combat mission,"" the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said in a statement. ""The supreme military command ordered the commanders of the units stationed at Azovstal to save the lives of the personnel...

Fassakhov Bulat Lenarovych, a 21-year-old soldier from the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, stands accused of being part of a gang of invaders who committed war crimes in the region around Kyiv. A press release published by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) today detailed his alleged crimes, as well as featuring a series of photos of the accused rapist. The release states that Lenarovych broke into the house of a Ukrainian family and locked them all in the basement - aside from one young girl. The occupier raped the girl after threatening to kill her family, then repeated the atrocity along with three accomplices. “Under the supervision of Kyiv Region Prosecutor’s Office, the SSU has notified him, in absentia, of suspicion of violating laws and customs of war,” the release went on. “He is a native of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, and serves in the 30th separate motorized rifle brigade of the 2nd guards combined army of the central military district of Russia.” “The SSU established that during the temporary occupation of one of the towns in the Kyiv region this individual committed a number of war crimes against civilian population. Witnesses have identified him and confirmed the facts of crimes committed by him.” Several images of the accused rapist show him in full regalia; one a front-on mug shot presumably shot for the military, and another of Lenarovych in an army beret, taken by someone sitting beside him. Another shows a serious and unsmiling Lenarovych posing in full regalia with a woman holding his arm, presumed to be his mother. The last image of Lenarovich shows him standing with two people his own age, presumably friends. While his companions are smiling, he shows no emotion. Late last month The Mirror reported on a 14-year-old girl who reportedly fell pregnant after being raped by five Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The teenager, from Bucha, plans to keep the child after doctors warned if she had an abortion now she may not be able to have children again, the report said. Her story has been told by psychologist Oleksandra Kvitko, who works on the ombudsman's hotline for psychological assistance, with the consent of the victim's parents. The psychologist is said to be working with the young girl to learn how to accept her child. Kvitko now works with five girls between the ages 14-18 who allegedly became pregnant after being raped by Russian soldiers. The youngest victim she works with is only 10.

All those in need of medical care were sent for treatment to a hospital in the city of Novoazovsk, Donetsk People's Republic.” However, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine claim the invasion is not going as well as the Kremlin may have hoped. From 24th February to 17th May, the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at around 27,900 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 1,235 tanks, 3,009 armoured fighting vehicles, 578 artillery systems, 198 multiple launch rocket systems, 90 anti-aircraft systems, 201 warplanes, 167 helicopters, 2,109 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, 13 vessels, 436 unmanned aerial vehicles, 43 units of special equipment and 97 cruise missiles. The Ukrainian military added that the Russian Armed Forces' greatest losses yesterday were sustained in the Lyman and Zaporizhzhia directions. Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has suggested that he may block Finland's and Sweden's applications to join NATO after he accused the Nordic nations of harbouring Kurdish militants who he regards as ""terrorists"". Today marks the 83rd day of the Russian ‘special military operation’. Days ago Ukraine showed off its devastating Brit-made Brimstone missiles in action. The weapon has been adapted to be fired from small vehicles on the Ukrainian battlefield rather than their usual launchpads - warplanes or as drones of naval ships. Video footage released by the Ukrainian defence ministry is said to show the Brimstone and also the NLAW new generation portable anti-tank weapon. A statement from Ukrainian forces said: “From the first days of the open invasion of Russia, the support of our foreign partners has played an important role in countering enemy forces. “Weapons, material and technical means that give us fellow countries are our strength on the way to victory. We are learning fast and learning new weapons. “And foreign instructors help us master them without delay. After all, we are fighting not only for the land. “We fight for our principles, history, senses, for the very existence of the Ukrainian people, their values and freedom. “And we are grateful that along this way, the titanic support is given to us by the partner states of the free world. “Together for the Victory.” The Brimstone came into service in 2005 with an updated version supplied to the RAF six years ago. It can strike using laser-seeking guidance or autonomous targeting. In another video, said to have been released by Ukrainian forces, it claims to show the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol hit with incendiary of phosphorus bombs by Vladimir Putin ’s forces.",14,4.430268755809028,4.079632168987845,0.3506365868211825,8
2022-05-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russias-military-might-fails-putins-26982352,All you need to know as Russia's military might fails in its invasion of Ukraine,"It has been nearly three months since Vladimir Putin's Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine that has seen devastation wrought upon the country. But Russia has not seen the quick successes it may have expected faced with fierce resistance from its neighbour. Below Chris Hughes answers all the key questions on the invasion and why Russia has failed to secure victory so far. It was over-ambitious and launched using a badly funded, ill-disciplined and poorly trained military against a courageous, highly motivated defending force that has performed to great effect. Putin’s commanders led attacks on several fronts, from the east, where they have been fighting for years, north from Belarus and the south. In the east they are bogged down, up against well-trained, battle hardened, disciplined Ukrainian troops fighting an existential battle. The Russians seem not to be invested in the fight and suffer poor morale. Many Russians entered the battle unaware of where they were, their commanders arrogantly hoping they would take Kyiv within days. It takes roughly four to one in numbers to take a city and Putin’s plan to overrun Kyiv and other cities was based on shockingly poor intelligence of Ukrainian resolve and capability. They have been badly neglected over the years. Poorly trained, badly fed and sent into battle with insufficient supplies, which even included rations that were five years out of date. Some had so little fuel they broke down. Top down corruption in Russia has led to funding being diverted into the wrong hands, leading to a cynical and under-performing force. Discipline is a huge issue and senior officers have been sent to the frontline to try to control troops, before getting killed. The backbone of any army is its non-commissioned officers and Russia’s are badly trained. Many recruits are complete novice conscripts. Russian troops fled the outskirts of Kyiv weeks ago to concentrate on the mission in the east, where the two sides have been battling since 2014. They tried repeatedly to take the north-eastern city of Kharkiv and reports indicate they have lost this crucial area. Despite grandiose Russian claims of a huge victory in the key city of Mariupol, Ukraine ’s troops are still holding out in the steel works and their struggle is now a symbol of Ukrainian defiance and bravery. Russia is barely able to claim having taken any major cities in Ukraine and is failing to keep hold of ground it had once dominated. The Ukrainian counter seems to be gaining ground and momentum. In the short term it appears Russia will continue to take heavy losses while claiming the lives of Ukrainian civilians with brutal bombardments. Ukrainian troops are rallying but this next stage in their defence is crucial. Until now they have been constantly flanking Russian forces, ambushing them and cutting off supply lines. From 2014, Ukraine and pro-Russian forces fought running battles in an everchanging theatre of war but then settled into battlefronts with long-term positions. It is possible this will happen again. This is unlikely as Putin has backed himself into a corner and has to save face, even with a small victory in the Donbas region, which he may have to settle for. But Ukraine has shown no sign that it is ready to settle on such a victory for Putin. Western diplomats are returning to Kyiv, a further indication the war is settling and is likely to rumble on for a few years. It is thought it will be concentrated in Donbas with long-range Russian missile attacks on Western supply lines as Putin tries to halt the stream of support that Ukraine’s troops are getting. There are indictments in Kyiv against named Russian troops for crimes but major international court war crimes cases are unlikely for years. The weight of proof needed is enormous and not just a case of proving civilians were killed. There is an avalanche of anecdotal evidence against thousands of Russian troops but it has to be nailed down.",14,4.485160813666097,3.6987797455130993,0.7863810681529975,25

Images on social media show the sky above Lviv lit up with the apparent blasts on Tuesday morning. There has been no word on casualties following the explosions, which occurred just before 1 am local time. Some reports said about eight to 10 blasts occurred in quick succession. Ukraine MP Lesia Vasylenko wrote: ""Lviv is under heavy attack right now. Friends say it has never been this loud. This is WEST #Ukraine. Very close to Poland."" While Kiev Independent's Illia Ponomarenko wrote: ""And almost immediately following the Azovstal rescue — a massive Russian missile attack upon Lviv."" On Sunday a missile strike hit some military infrastructure in Lviv, the region's Governor Maxim Kozitsky said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. ""Four enemy missiles hit one of the military infrastructures in the Lviv region,"" Kozitsky said. ""The object is completely destroyed. According to preliminary information, there are no casualties. No one sought medical help."" The regional ""West"" Air Command of Ukraine's Air Force said in a social media post that several missiles were fired from the Black Sea at the Lviv region. Two of the missiles were destroyed before hitting targets, it said. Up until now the Russian invasion has concentrated in the east of Ukraine with occasional shelling of cities on the western side of the country. Many Ukrainians have fleed their towns and cities for Lviv for its relatively safer location. The latest attack on Lviv comes after Ukrainian fighters appeared to cede control of the besieged port of Mariupol after months of bombardment. Troops have been evacuated with Ukraine's deputy defence minister saying 53 injured troops from the Azovstal steelworks were taken to a hospital in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk, 20 miles to the east. Another 211 people were taken to the town of Olenivka, in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatists, Deputy Defence Minister Anna Malyar said. All of the evacuees will be subject to a potential prisoner exchange with Russia, she added. Reuters saw five buses carrying troops from Azovstal arrive in Novoazovsk late on Monday. Some of the evacuated troops were wounded and carried out of the buses on stretchers. Some 600 troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant. ""We hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a late night address. ""There are severely wounded ones among them. They're receiving care. Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive."" Ukraine's military said it had ""ordered the commanders of the units stationed at Azovstal to save the lives of the personnel"" and that troops there had fulfilled their combat mission.",17,4.606710413952669,4.983383224908381,-0.3766728109557116,27

They have also repelled incursion by a Russian sabotage and reconnaissance group in the northeastern region of Sumy, in another major blow to Moscow. Defending troops are driving Russian forces back in a new counter-offensive as it emerged that Moscow has lost a third of its ground forces in just 82 days since the invasion started. Latest official Ukraine battle loss figures suggest Russia ’s death toll and destroyed military hardware is far worse than has been reported by western intelligence figures. Ukraine estimates revealed Russia has now lost 27, 400 soldiers, 1200 tanks, 200 warplanes, 164 helicopters, and 13 warships in a stunning blow to Vladimir Putin ’s faltering attack. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia’s new offensive in Donbas had stalled and Ukraine could win the war, adding “Russia’s war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned.” Kyiv’s commanders have now deployed many new U.S. M-777 howitzers to the front lines, and Washington has delivered all but one of the 90 artillery pieces it promised to send. The grinding down of Russia’s advance suggests the new Ukraine counter-offensive is having increasing success in pushing back Russian forces in the northeast and the Donbas assault is also ailing. Ukraine’s defence ministry said in a Facebook post that the 227th Battalion of the 127th Brigade of Ukraine’s Territorial Defence Forces had reached the border with Russia after driving them out of Kharkiv, adding: “Together to victory!” The ministry published a video on Facebook purportedly showing Ukrainian troops by a border post in the colours of the Ukrainian flag. Kharkiv region governor Oleh Sinegubov wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the troops had restored the post on the border, adding: “We thank everyone who, risking their lives, liberates Ukraine from Russian invaders.” Ukraine has scored a series of successes since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, forcing Russia’s commanders to abandon an advance on the capital Kyiv before making rapid gains around Kharkiv. On the Sumy failure a Russian reconnaissance group entered Ukrainian territory under the cover of mortar shells, grenades and machine gun fire. But they were forced to retreat after Ukraine’s border guards fought back. But in Mariupol Russian ground troops were believed to be blocking exit routes out of the besieged Azovstal steel works complex where hundreds of Ukrainian troops, many of them wounded, are holed up. Ukraine also believes Russia is preparing another false narrative that Mariupol was destroyed by the defending troops. Petro Andryushchenko, who is adviser to Mariupol’s Mayor, said residents were being invited to apply for compensation. He said first they must claim their property “was destroyed by the Ukrainian military” and that their relatives were “killed by the Ukrainian Army.” And people across the world in more than 100 cities have recorded video appeals to support the Mariupol defenders. Within two days of the global appeal #World4Mariupol, thousands of Ukrainians and others globally have expressed their gratitude and support to the Ukrainian heroes. The videos with hashtag #World4Mariupol continue pouring in from every corner of the planet: from Finland to Antarctica, from the USA to Japan. On the initiative’s website you can watch all the appeals and a video in support of the defenders: #World4Mariupol | Save Mariupol News of Ukraine's successes comes as McDonald's has said it will permanently leave Russia after 30 years and has started to sell off its restaurants there. The move comes after it temporarily closed its 850 outlets in March following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The fast-food giant said it made the decision because of the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the ongoing war. The chain opened in Moscow in 1990 as the Soviet Union was opening its economy to Western brands, and its departure carries similar symbolic weight. The move places pressure on other western brands to consider their future in Putin's Russia. Once the sale of the company is finalised - possibly to a local buyer - the Russian restaurants will be ""de-Arched,"" meaning they will no longer be allowed to use the McDonald's name, logo or menu. The company yesterday (MON) said its 62,000 staff will still be paid until the transaction closes and that ""employees have future employment with any potential buyer.” CEO Chris Kempczinski said: “We have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values.

2022-05-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-pay-unacceptable-cost-26978748,"Putin will pay unacceptable cost if Russia attacks NATO country, expert claims","Russian President Vladimir Putin must pay an unacceptable cost if he decides to invade Sweden or Finland following their formal request to join NATO, an expert has claimed. The Kremlin has warned it would have to take retaliatory military steps in response to the Nordic nations seeking to join the US-led alliance. Putin sees NATO's eastward expansion as a threat to Russia ’s borders and is displeased with the increased western alliance with Ukraine — one of the motives behind the devastating invasion. To avert the war spilling over the border, the UK and other NATO nations must show ""with certainty"" that Russia will ""pay an unacceptable cost"" should it carry out attacks outside of Ukraine, Dr Martin Smith, a defence expert at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst told the Mirror. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine propelled Finland to leave behind its long history of neutrality and seek NATO membership. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, was asked whether Finland’s membership would be a threat, to which he said: “Definitely.” Sweden has since followed Finland in confirming it will also apply to join the alliance. Sergei Ryabkov, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, warned that the two Nordic countries should have ""no illusions"" that Putin will ""put up with it."" He warned that the move was “another grave mistake with far-reaching consequences” and the “general level of military tension will increase”. Both countries have deemed joining the US-led NATO alliance as a grave and unnecessary provocation of Moscow, but they now feel the only threat to European security is Russia. Finland has bore the brunt of Putin's threats over the years, having faced off military planes in their airspace and confronting Russian submarines chasing after Finnish research vessels in international waters. When Finland joins the alliance, it will see the size of Russia’s land border with NATO double. Dr Smith believes that the UK is a ""pivotal player"" during this time of high tension, as they are working with other NATO member states to ""practice operating together in joint military training."" In Estonia, British troops and armoured vehicles have strengthened NATO's uplift to Eastern Europe and there are also troops embedded into a Finnish Armoured Brigade, with participation from other partners such as the US, Latvia and Estonia. The Ministry of Defence said the troops are working together to deter Russian aggression in Scandinavia and the Baltic states. Enlarging NATO is the opposite of what Putin wanted to do, should he invade Finland then there will be a mechanism in place to ""facilitate necessary and appropriate military deployments onto the territory of Finland from UK national assets"", says Dr Smith. He continued: ""If there was a Russian attack, then the whole basis of NATO planning is to bring in serious reinforcements from elsewhere in Europe, such as from Germany and from the United Kingdom."" On Monday, Putin's troops were seen moving nuclear-capable missiles towards its border with Finland. A video posted shows the deployment of mobile Iskander missiles purportedly from a motorway on the way to Vyborg, a western Russian town close to the Finnish border. Dmitry Suslov from the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow warned the Washington Post that if the United States or Britain establish bases in Finland, Russia will have “no choice but to deploy tactical nuclear weapons to target those bases."" Last week, British Prime Minister agreed on mutual security pacts with Sweden and Finland, saying the UK will come to their aid should either nation come under attack. He said the security agreement would “fortify Europe’s defences for generations to come."" But Smith is wary that the current forces in place would not be sufficient to be able to hold the surface military attack from Russia and push it back. As part of the new security agreements, Britain will offer to increase the deployment of personnel and assets from the RAF, Royal Navy and army and deepen intelligence-sharing. Russian lawmaker Vladimir Dzhabarov gave a grave warning to Finland, saying their accession to NATO could lead to “the destruction of their country”. He continued: “Finland, which has been successfully developing all these years thanks to close trade and economic ties with Russia, would become a target.” Should such an attack occur, then Smith says NATO would switch to an operational effort, which is ""putting forces in place to punish the Russian attackers.""",29,4.005695834753919,1.0175158668097777,2.988179967944141,10

The shock move comes after decades of historic neutrality and was sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The strong show of aggression towards another non- NATO neighbour of Russia will no doubt have caused concerns for both countries that they could suffer the same fate, and so are now looking to shore up their defensive ties with the West. Russia, which regards NATO as a threat, has labelled the moves a “mistake” and has grimly warned of “consequences”. For the parties ruling these two countries, the decision to join NATO now clearly outweighs any arguments against joining the bloc. But what does membership give to countries and the people who live inside them? Being a citizen of a NATO nation means living in a country that has the full military defensive support of all of the group's other members. NATO is an alliance, an agreement between countries to come to one another’s aid in the face of aggression and support one another in matters of security. One of NATO’s primary functions is what it calls ‘collective defence’. Describing what this means, NATO says: “The greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and defend NATO’s territory and populations. “Article 5 of NATO’s founding charter, the Washington Treaty, sets out the Alliance’s collective defence commitment. “It states that an attack on one shall be considered an attack on all. Article 5 has been invoked only once in NATO’s history, on 12 September 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks on the United States.” This is one of the most fundamental principles and reasons for the alliance’s existence - the aim that people who live in countries can feel safer because aggression towards their country would be met with the force of all 30 member states' defensive capabilities. A second advantage to living in a NATO country is the need for member nations to uphold standards of “individual liberty, democracy, human rights and the rule of law”. From a defensive perspective, the military forces of each member country benefit from collaborating with each other’s military forces, in theory making each member country’s military stronger. Generally speaking, NATO has maintained peace in Europe since its foundation in 1949, although it is worth noting that there are also possible downsides to membership, such as the likelihood of being drawn into conflict if an ally is attacked and the need for your government to aim to put 2% of its GDP into defence spending. Of these countries, 12 are founding members. They are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.",29,4.206356702589318,1.6365071866400782,2.5698495159492394,10

A video posted on Monday shows the deployment of mobile Iskander missiles purportedly from a motorway on the way to Vyborg, a western Russian town close to the Finnish border. The footage comes immediately after Helsinki formally announced its bid to join NATO, a move which Russian President Putin has long been opposed to. A commentary on a dashcam video says that seven ballistic missile systems were on the way to the town just 24 miles from the Finnish border. Russian state television previously said that Moscow would deploy nuclear weapons to its European borders should Nordic nations Finland and Sweden set up military bases on their territory. They said: ""When NATO bases appear in Sweden and Finland, Russia will have no choice but to neutralise the imbalance and new threat by deploying tactical nuclear weapons.” The Russian leader also said they will face ""consequences"" if they ""worsen the situation"" in Ukraine. “As soon as the president of Finland said they were joining NATO, a whole division of Iskanders, seven of them… is moving towards Vyborg,” said the voice on the video uploaded to the VHCK-OGPU channel. “Looks like a new military unit is about to be formed in Vyborg or the region. “All the equipment is new, Ural trucks are driving it. ""So…get ready Finns… to join NATO. “New Urals, seven Iskanders, looks like a new military unit is being formed - well done.” On Sunday evening, Finland and Sweden's leaders confirmed their intention to join NATO, marking a historic foreign policy shift that was triggered by Russia's bloody invasion of Ukraine. The two countries previously had decades of military non-alignment, but will now formally submit a joint membership application to the 30-member alliance as soon as the decisions are ratified by their respective governments. Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said: “A new era is opening. A protected Finland is being born as part of a stable, strong and responsible Nordic region. We gain security, and we also share it. It’s good to keep in mind that security isn’t a zero-sum game.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said she hoped parliament would confirm the decision “in the coming days."" Iskanders with conventional warheads have already been used in the war in Ukraine. They are capable of carrying cluster munitions or fuel-air explosive enhanced-blast warheads. Timothy Wright, a research analyst with the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies told Newsweek that they can ""accurately target and destroy what it is being fired at."" Putin has repeatedly warned both countries against joining NATO, saying the move obliges Russia to strengthen its defences in the Baltic Sea region. British troops are training in another Baltic nation, Estonia and have said they are ready for an escalation should the war in Ukraine spill across the border. Some 70 miles from the Russian border, NATO troops, tanks, fighter jets and armoured vehicles have amassed for military drills under British command. Lieutenant-General Rupert Streatfeild, the Royal Welsh commanding officer overseeing the exercise in Estonia, told the Times that the war in Ukraine and threats against NATO had given his troops a “razor-like focus."" Turkey is threatening to dampen Sweden and Finland's accession to NATO, with its Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu expressing concerns. He said it was ""unacceptable and outrageous"" that the prospective new members give support to the Kurdish militant political organization, the PKK. In response, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned Ankara that it risked handing Putin a major victory by opposing the expansion. Public support for NATO accession in Finland has skyrocketed, trebling to about 75% and is surging to between 50% and 60% in Sweden. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's Secretary-General, has said both countries would be “welcomed with open arms” and has said he hopes the accession process would be quick. Despite this, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the two Scandinavian countries ”should have no illusions that we will simply resign ourselves to this”. Latest British military intelligence has said that Russia’s offensive in the Donbas had “lost momentum” and demoralised Russian troops are failing to make gains, with the Kremlin's battle plan “significantly behind schedule.""",29,2.3390192994889945,1.8424885785519445,0.49653072093705,10

Retired general Jarmo Lindberg said the ratification process, however, could take months and he expects there could be some retaliation from Russia. Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin warned Finland against joining the western military alliance in recent days. Finnish President Sauli Niinisto today confirmed his country would submit an application in a historic policy shift prompted by Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow, which shares a 1,300 km (800 mile) border with Finland, said it would harm bilateral ties. Sweden is also expected to follow suit as public support for membership has grown due to security concerns. Mr Lindburg, who served in the Government from 2014 to 2019, told Sky today that joining NATO would ""stabilise the region"". ""All Nordic nations being then part of NATO now, Norway and Denmark are already members, and Iceland, Finland and Sweden would bring a very large area,"" he said. ""Also, make the Baltic Sea an internal NATO sea and make it probably easier for NATO to optimise the planning for this more unified area."" Asked if neutral Finland's ""significant"" army are ready to fight for the alliance, Mr Lindburg said: ""Finland has the capability for both high and long range precision guided engagement and we still have a large reserve."" He went on to say the nation has been in NATO's Partnership for Peace since 1994, as well as other programmes. He said: ""In this process we have developed our defence forces to be fully interoperable with NATO."" ""So, yes, we are ready,"" he said, adding: ""We have had several exercises with NATO throughout the years so we are very used to training with NATO."" He was asked if he envisages such a move will lead to a build up of military hardware on both sides of the border with Russia. ""Russia is, as we all know, very busy in Ukraine at the moment,"" he said. ""Some of the forces that are in Ukraine come from the garrisons that are just across the border from Finland and there is knowledge that they have sustained some losses in Ukraine. ""So, there are actually less forces now on the other side of the border than there used to be. ""Nobody has any idea when the forces will return but still there will be less forces there, so it will take some time to get back to the level that was the situation in western Russia before the war."" He added: ""Logically, it is hard to see that there would be more forces very soon in that area. ""Finland, for the forceable future probably will keep the force structure as it is but that is not for me to decide. That is for the current defence leadership."" Mr Lindburg said Finnish President Sauli Niinistö was ""very confident"" during his press briefing earlier on Sunday, when announcing the intention to apply, which he has discussed with Putin. In terms of a possible retaliation from Russia in the future, he said: ""There maybe some information, actions, operations, cyber operations. ""We have had our fair share of espionage violations throughout the history, so we may see some of that again."" He said issues around refugees crossing the border may also resurface again. Mr Linburg said, despite being a full member of the EU, Finland is not in agreement with the political and economic union that the PKK Kurdish militant group ""is a terrorist organisation"". But he said, despite Turkey's concerns about the application, he did not feel there would be an issue on that standpoint. ""There needs to be more discussions and clarification of what are the concerns and there should be time for that because the membership application ratification process will take months because all the NATO member nations need to ratify it,"" he added. He was then asked about what direction he sees the war in Ukraine going in. He said: ""It seems at the moment the Russian forces are a bit stalled in the Donbas area and are not making any significant advance. ""And the Ukrainians are getting more and more better equipment...so we may even see some Ukrainian advance but at the moment there seems to be no swift or very fast change.

Niinisto called Putin on Saturday to tell him of Finland's plans to join the alliance. Putin said such a move would hurt Russian-Finnish relations. ""I, or Finland, are not known to sneak around and quietly disappear behind a corner. It is better to say it straight what already has been said, also to the concerned party and that is what I wanted to do,"" he said about his call on Sunday.

""It will be necessary to respond...by taking adequate precautionary measures that would ensure the viability of deterrence,"" Interfax agency quoted Grushko as saying. Kremlin forces invaded Ukraine on February 24. Putin has demanded the former-Soviet allies never be allowed to become a member of the alliance. The southeastern region of Donbas has become the main theatre of war over the past month.

Since Russia's invasion on February 24, Ukraine's military has forced Russia's commanders to abandon an advance on the capital Kyiv. This was before they made rapid gains in the northeast and drove them away from the second biggest city of Kharkiv. A Ukrainian counteroffensive has been underway near the Russian-held town of Izium, though Ukraine's military reported on Sunday that Russian forces were advancing elsewhere in the Donbas region, the main theatre of war over the past month. ""Despite small-scale initial advances, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains over the past month whilst sustaining consistently high levels of attrition,"" the British defence ministry said on Twitter. ""Russia has now likely suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed in February."" It said it was unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days. The Ministry of Defence concluded: “Russian forces are increasingly constrained by degraded enabling capabilities, continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness. “Many of these capabilities cannot be quickly replaced or reconstituted, and are likely to continue to hinder Russian operations in Ukraine. “Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days.” In his usual nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sung the praises of those defending the Donbas. Russian forces were withdrawing from the city of Kharkiv, he said, the second-largest in Ukraine. Troops had now begun to reclaim areas, Mr Zelensky added, and had moved back into six towns over the past day.

Sir Antony Beevor says the Russian President believes NATO's 'advance' on his own country's borders is the equivalent to the Nazis moving through Europe 80 years ago. And the push for Finland and Sweden to join the alliance in recent days amid the despot's catastrophic invasion of Ukraine will have done little to ease his misplaced suspicions. Sir Antony, who has published several books on the Second World War, said Putin genuinely thinks the Red Army fought off Adolf Hitler's Wehrmacht ""single-handed"" while the western allies wanted to ""stab the Soviet Union in the back"". Moscow's current invasion, which it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists, has jolted European security. Kyiv and its Western allies say the fascism assertion is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression. Writing in the Daily Mail, Sir Antony said: ""Ultimately, he has trapped himself in a past that he fails to understand. ""He refuses to acknowledge that it is his own aggressive actions which have achieved that. ""So, combined with his bitter resentment that the West never showed proper 'respect' – that gangster euphemism for 'fear' – Putin wants to terrify us."" Sir Antony, whose latest book Russia : Revolution And Civil War 1917-1921 is released later this month, went on to say Putin's ""own disastrous mistakes have backed him into a corner"". He believes the former KGB intelligence officer is prepared to use nuclear weapons if ""his own regime"" is defeated in Ukraine.

The hellish scenes have reportedly been uncovered in four sites in the town of Borodyanka which compare to some of the worst atrocities carried out in Bucha, that shocked the world. Borodyanka, which had a population of 25,000 people, began to be pummelled from Russian shelling when the Russian invasion began on February 24. As the Russian forces bore down on Kyiv it tried to bomb towns on the outskirts like Borodyanka and Bucha into submission. There is now evidence that at the same time it unleashed unthinkable horrors on the population with civilians tortured and murdered. Police chief Vyacheslav Tsilyurik told how the town centre was shelled which included the smashing of a statue of Ukraine poet Taras Shevchenko, reported The Sun. The Ukrainians fought back, said Mr Tsilyurik: “We knew we had to fight back and so ambushed a column of them in the middle of town. We killed eight of them but they took their revenge the next day.” Large apartment blocks were reduced to rubble with countless people buried in the ruins, while those who ventured out were indiscriminately shot in the street, he said. The police chief said that people were tortured and women were raped in the barbarity which has seen 150 people die and 50 more are missing. The death toll in nearby Bucha now stands at 412 people. Borodyanka mayor Georgi Yerko, 60, arranged for evacuations with his daughter Galyna, 36, saying the scenes were even worse than that in Bucha. She said: “It’s even worse than Bucha. It was more concentrated evil in a smaller town. The Russians knew my father’s email addresses and constantly emailed and texted death threats but we avoided them until liberation came. My father led us. He is a modest man but he is a hero.” Police officer Ivan Symarov lost all his family in the bombings. His wife Lena, 26, father Vasile, 54, mother Natalia, 47, brother Petro, 21, and grandmother Nina, 82, all died immediately and his two-year-old daughter Polina later passed away in hospital. “Putin’s animals had dropped a bomb on my home for no reason and I pulled at the rubble knowing I’d lost everything I loved,"" he said. “I am alone in the world now thanks to Putin and the barbarians he sent to kill us. I’ve no idea if they targeted my home because I’m a policeman but it had no military value. It was cold-blooded murder."" Ukraine has claimed that more than 10,000 possible war crimes have taken place and the country's prosecutor general has now said that her office was readying 41 cases against Russian soldiers. ""We have 41 suspects in cases with which we will be ready to go to court. All of them concern Article 438 of the (Ukrainian) criminal code on war crimes, but different types of war crimes. There is the bombing of civilian infrastructure, the killing of civilians, rape and looting,"" Iryna Venediktova said in a live briefing on Ukrainian TV on Friday evening. Friday marked the first war crime prosecution of a member of the Russian military in Kyiv, as a 21-year-old Russian soldier went on trial for the killing of an unarmed Ukrainian civilian in the early days of the war. Ms Venediktova said that two more of the suspects, who are physically in Ukraine, are likely to face preliminary hearings next week. Ukraine has accused Russia of forcibly deporting more than 210,000 children since its invasion, saying they were among 1.2 million Ukrainians transferred against their will.

Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine has seemingly gone far from plan for Putin with his forces having struggled to make serious inroads since it was launched on February 24. Dogged resistance from Ukrainian fighters coupled with a lack of determination from his own forces has led to war of attrition. The Russian president was unable to announce any great breakthrough at the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow where he also appeared frail and used a blanket to keep warm. Rumours are now rife that Putin is seriously ill with some claims that he is suffering from cancer. And Ukraine’s head of military intelligence, Major General Kyrylo Budanov has said that a coup is now under way in Russia to remove Putin. He is also confident that Ukraine will have defeated the Russian invasion by the end of the year and the turning point will be in August. General Budanov is convinced that the loss for Russia will lead to Putin being removed from power. ""It will eventually lead to the change of leadership of the Russian Federation. This process has already been launched and they are moving into that way,"" he told Sky News. Asked if a coup has already started he replied: ""Yes. They are moving in this way and it is impossible to stop it."" The General claimed that Putin has cancer saying he is in a “very bad psychological and physical condition and he is very sick”. On the Russian invasion he claimed: “The breaking point will be in the second part of August. “Most of the active combat will have finished by the end of the year. It will eventually lead to the change of leadership of the Russian Federation. This process has already been launched. “As a result we will renew Ukrainian power in all our territories.” It comes as Ukrainian forces destroyed parts of a Russian armoured column as it tried to cross a river in the Donbas region, video from Ukraine's military showed on Friday. Fighters have driven Russia from the second-largest Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in their fastest advance since Kremlin troops pulled away from Kyiv and the northeast over a month ago to focus their offensive on the Donbas region bordering Russia. The city, which had been under fierce bombardment, has been quiet for at least two weeks and Ukraine now controls territory stretching to the Siverskyi Donets River, around 25 miles to the east. However, Moscow is still bombarding villages north of Kharkiv. Around six miles north of the city, firefighters doused smouldering wreckage in Dergachi after what local officials said was an overnight Russian missile attack on the House of Culture, used to distribute aid. Volunteers inside were trying to salvage packages of baby nappies and formula. ""I can't call it anything but a terrorist act,"" the mayor Vyacheslav Zadorenko said. ""They wanted to hit the base where we store provisions and create a humanitarian catastrophe.""",14,3.212648435694437,4.7163705414203525,-1.5037221057259154,29

""I suppose he would know more about the military situation in Ukraine and so if he feels that the war is perhaps drawing to a close in a couple of months that maybe an honest assessment based on the intelligence that they've gathered,"" he explained. ""What I would say is he didn't really say how the war would end. ""He said he was optimistic about Ukraine's prospects but it might be that the war ends with Russia in possession of Luhansk and Donetsk."" Russia initially sent in troops to the two breakaway states in Ukraine's Donbas border region in February before a full-scale invasion was launched. Luhansk and Donetsk have seen fierce fighting since 2014 when they were first declared People's Republics. Armed Russian-backed separatist groups seized government buildings throughout the Donbas three months ago leading to the current ongoing armed conflict across Ukraine. Speaking of Maj Gen Budanov's claims about Putin's health and a possible coup, Mr Cranny-Evans said: ""That could depend on a number of things...there is, obviously, a lot to be gained from undermining Putin as a leader right now."" He was then asked if the Russian President will likely be happy to now focus on consolidating gains made in the east, including Donbas, and skip over the failures elsewhere, including attempts to take the capital. Mr Cranny-Evans said: ""I think at present, the most we can really say is that Russia is not winning and Ukraine is not losing. ""They are definitely at war. They are fighting a very vicious and bloody war. ""Both sides are likely suffering heavy losses on a daily basis and we can see that the Ukrainians are advancing in some places and Russians are advancing in some places. He continued: ""And there's nothing to immediately say or indicate that is about to shift or change. ""It's approaching a stalemate. It's approaching a point where neither side can push much more, I would say."" Asked if it will now be difficult to make further gains due to entrenched positions, he said: ""The Russians are putting on an exhausted force. ""Without some kind of reach further into their reserves and reserve materiel - a declaration of war - it becomes difficult for them to keep feeding personnel into the conflict."" However, he said the Ukrainian forces are ""facing a similar situation"". ""We've seen reports of the territorial defence force being pushed into the frontlines and some of them are okay with that and some of them are not okay with that. ""Because they are actually supposed to just protect a certain area, a certain region of Ukraine. ""And if they're not from Donbas areas they are not supposed to be there. ""So there are signs of...not desperation but signs of the impact of this conflict to both militaries. ""They are far from unscathed at the moment and I would say that that is approaching a peak point where perhaps they no longer really have fresh things to give that might change the way the fighting is going."" He said he was a ""little"" surprised that Putin didn't use his Victory Day speech last Monday to make a declaration of war or some kind of mobilisation which could open up more forces. He said he had seen evidence that he might and said authorities in Belgrade ""have been instructed to prepare"" for such a move. ""We did actually have evidence leading up to it that something of that ilk was going to happen. I'm a little surprised,"" he added. Mr Cranny-Evans was asked if a partial mobilisation would be enough to shift the balance, as bringing in more new conscripts may result in a lag as they got up to speed. The expert said: ""It depends a lot on what the Russians are lacking because their force is really artillery focused and artillery seems to be of higher quality than the infantry and the armour. ""If they need infantry to just push forward and protect the armour's flanks and things like that then throwing conscripts in is not the best for the conscripts...but they might get the job done so it really depends on the level of specialisation that the Russian's are lacking and what they need.""",14,2.707254195412361,6.30746621216189,-3.600212016749529,4

The Ukrainian court held a preliminary hearing on Friday after charging a 21-year-old soldier with the murder of a 62-year-old civilian. During the short hearing, the defendant said his name was Vadim Shishimarin and confirmed that he was a Russian serviceman. Shishimarin was accused of ""violations of the laws and norms of war"". The defendant did not enter a plea at today's hearing and will do so at a later date, his lawyer Viktor Ovsyannikov said. Shishimarin wore a casual blue and grey hoodie and was led into the courtroom by police to a glass booth for defendants. The Ukrainian prosecutor told the court the defendant was a tank commander in the Kantemirovskaya tank division from the Moscow region. If convicted he faces up to life imprisonment over the killing in a village in the east of Kyiv on February 28. Shishimarin is alleged to have stolen a privately-owned car to escape with four other Russian servicemen after their column was targeted by Ukrainian forces. The Russian soldiers then drove into a village where they saw an unarmed man riding a bicycle and talking on his phone, the court heard. Shishimarin was allegedly told to kill the civilian to prevent him from reporting on the Russians' presence and is accused of firing several shots through the open window of the car with an assault rifle at the civilian's head, and he died on the spot. The SBU Security Service of Ukraine conducted the investigation into the case, it said. State prosecutor Andriy Synyuk told reporters after the hearing: ""This is the first case today. But soon there will be a lot of these cases."" It comes as the Ukrainian government has accused the Russian military of carrying out horrific crimes against its citizens including rape and murder. It says it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes and the Kremlin told reporters on Friday that it had no information about a war crimes trial. Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said yesterday there were many examples of possible war crimes since the Russian invasion and that 1,000 bodies had been recovered so far in the Kyiv region. Last month, the International Criminal Court (ICC) said on April 25 that it would take part in a joint team with Ukrainian, Polish and Lithuanian prosecutors investigating war crimes allegations against Russian forces.

His funeral was held yesterday in the village of Tirlyansky in his native Bashkortostan region. Russia has not disclosed the circumstances of his death during Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine which has seen tens of thousands of his forces killed. Nine Russian generals are also known to have died with reports that the US has assisted Ukraine with intelligence to allow them to target Putin’s top brass. Karimov is the 41st known colonel to have died in the war which has devastated Russia’s senior ranks. And Major-General Andrei Simonov, 56, became the ninth Russian general killed in Ukraine when he died in battle in Izyum near Kharkiv. He was Russia's most respected electronics warfare commander, serving with the 2nd Combined Arms Army, and died in a devastating fightback by the Ukrainians against a Russian offensive. More than 30 Russian armoured vehicles were destroyed in the attack along with around 100 Russian troops, unconfirmed reports suggest.

Finland's plan to apply for NATO membership, announced on Thursday, and the expectation that Sweden will follow, would bring about the expansion of the Western military alliance that Russian President Putin aimed to prevent. Abandoning the neutrality they maintained throughout the Cold War would be one of the biggest shifts in European security in decades. And former Brit ambassador Sir Tony Brenton told BBC ’s Newsnight programme the Kremlin may think “it expands their view of NATO as a threat to them”. He continued: “They will be very conscious especially as this war winds its way to a conclusion that their conventional forces have not produced the results they hoped for. “They will be increasingly inclined therefore to use their nuclear strength as a demonstration they need to be taken seriously. “I think we need to resign ourselves to the likelihood of much more Russian nuclear deployment in the Baltic area as a response to Finland’s accession to NATO, when it comes, and Sweden’s very likely one as well.” Moscow called Finland's announcement hostile and threatened retaliation, including unspecified ""military-technical"" measures. ""Helsinki must be aware of the responsibility and consequences of such a move,"" said the foreign ministry. Russian officials have spoken in the past about potential measures including stationing nuclear-armed missiles on the Baltic Sea. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Finns would be ""warmly welcomed"" and promised a ""smooth and swift"" accession process. The White House backed such a move. ""We would support a NATO application by Finland and-or Sweden should they apply,"" said press secretary Jen Psaki. Finland's 800 mile border will more than double the length of the frontier between the US led alliance and Russia, putting NATO guards a few hours' drive from the northern outskirts of St Petersburg. ""Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay,"" President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in a joint statement. Asked on Wednesday if Finland would provoke Russia by joining NATO, Niinisto said: ""My response would be that you caused this. Look at the mirror."" Five diplomats and officials told Reuters that NATO allies expect both countries to be granted membership quickly, paving the way for an increased troop presence in the Nordic region to defend them during a one-year ratification period. Putin cited NATO's potential expansion as one of the main reasons he launched a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine in February. NATO describes itself as a defensive alliance, built around a treaty declaring that an attack on one member is an attack on all, granting US allies the protection of Washington's superpower might including its nuclear arsenal.

Spokesman Serhiy Bratchuk said in an online post that the Vsevolod Bobrov had been struck near Snake Island, the scene of renewed fighting in recent days. ""Thanks to the actions of our sailors, the Vsevolod Bobrov logistics vessel, one of the latest in the Russian fleet, caught fire. ""They say that it is going to Sevastopol. The information needs to be clarified,"" Bratchuk said, according to Ukra News. 10ztalk have quoted Bratchuk as saying: ""As a result of the actions of our Navy, the Vsevolod Bobrov logistics ship, one of the newest in the Russian fleet, set on fire. ""They say she is limping toward Sevastopol."" The tiny Snake island is near Ukraine's sea border with Romania. These reports come after shocking footage taken by a drone showed the moment a Russian helicopter was blown out of the sky by a Ukrainian missile. The black and white footage, shared on social media, showed the Mi-8 helicopter unloading troops on Snake Island before an explosion rocks the camera. Smoke is then seen billowing from the scene of the blast. The short video is undated and it is unclear how many casualties were caused by the devastating attack.",17,5.8186944140240815,7.58009550122737,-1.7614010872032884,20

New satellite images have shown a tomb of Russian armoured vehicles lying destroyed near the River Donets in Ukraine and it's believed all the tanks were obliterated in the same battle. According to reports the doomed unit made up of around 52 tanks was trying to cross the river to fortify Russia's position near Bilohorivka, west of Lysychansk. Russian forces have redeployed to the south and east of Ukraine in a desperate attempt to turn the tide of the war following set back after set back. The photos also show a destroyed pontoon bridge that it's thought was targeted by Ukrainian defenders as a means to trap the armoured convoy in a crossfire. The staunch resistance was praised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who has proclaimed that Putin's forces are being ""pushed away"". He tweeted: ""The occupiers are gradually being pushed away ""I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders."" According to a Twitter user, Maxim, who claims to be a Ukrainian military engineer, the exact spot Russia was most likely to cross on May 7 was identified and troops ordered to be on the look-out for sounds of tugboat engines pushing a pontoon bridge. On May 8, Russian troops tried to cover their advance by burning nearby fields and letting off smoke grenades, the military engineer said. Drones were used to spot the battalion before a devastating artillery strike ordered in. ""Roughly 20 minutes after recon unit confirmed the Russian bridge was being mounted, heavy artillery engaged against Russian forces, and then aviation chipped in as well,"" Maxim said. ""I was still in the area, and I have never seen or heard such heavy combat in my life. ""After one day of combat, 9th May morning the bridge was down. ""Some Russian forces - roughly 30 to 50 vehicles and infantry - were stuck on the Ukrainian side of the river with no way back. ""They tried to run away using the broken bridge. Then they tried to arrange a new bridge. ""Aviation started heavy bombing of the area and it destroyed all the remains of Russians there, and the other bridge they tried to make. ""Rumors say it's 1,500 Russian dead. Their strategic objective was to cross the river and then encircle Lysychansk. They miserably failed."" According to Forbes, the attack destroyed more than 50 vehicles and up to 1000 Russian soldiers. On Wednesday evening, Ukraine's general staff said its forces had captured Pytomnyk, a village on the main highway north of Kharkiv, about halfway to the Russian border. The governor of the Russian region on the other side, Belgorod, said a village had been shelled from Ukraine, wounding one person. Ukrainian forces seemed to be in control of Rubizhne, on the banks of the Donets river. ""It is burned out, just like all Russian tanks,"" a Ukrainian soldier told Reuters near Rubizhne next to the ruins of one Russian tank. ""The weapons are helping a lot, the anti-tank ones."" Kyiv has so far confirmed few details about its advance through the Kharkiv region. ""We are having successes in the Kharkiv direction, where we are steadily pushing back the enemy and liberating population centres,"" Brigadier General Oleksiy Hromov, Deputy Chief of the Main Operations Directorate of Ukraine's General Staff, told a briefing, providing no specifics.",14,4.630460975181379,4.712689167174155,-0.08222819199277609,25
2022-05-12,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/shocking-new-maps-reveal-how-26947269,New maps show how much territory Russia has lost in Ukraine in just days,"Shocking new maps claim to show the amount of territory Russian forces have lost in a matter of days in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin's barbaric invasion started almost three months ago. A miscalculated plan saw the Kremlin chief expect to take capital city Kyiv within 48 hours of sending his troops in on February 24. But over 11 weeks later, with that objective abandoned, the invaders are haemorrhaging soldiers, weapons and equipment. And now they're losing much of the geographical gains made in the early weeks. Nathan Ruser, a researcher for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), an independent think tank, shared maps showing the situation as of Tuesday (May 10). On his Twitter account, he posted multiple maps showing the receding line of Moscow's territorial control. Ukraine expert Michael MacKay said: ""The Russians are retreating north of Kharkiv, shifted to the defensive around Izyum, and suffered a resounding defeat attempting to cross the Siverskyi Donetsk River at Bilohorivka. ""The Ukrainians have gone on the offensive in Kharkiv region west of the Siverskyi Donets River."" Putin's battle plan pivoted away from Kyiv last month and began focusing on the eastern and southern regions - but his men have struggled to gain any foothold. John Spencer, a retired US Army major, told Salon the Russian military was considered second or third in the world before the war. But its performance during what the Kremlin still insists is a 'special military operation' has shown it to be actually around 30th, he said. ""On paper, the Russian military should have been able to dominate the Ukrainian military and win in three days, based just on the size of the Ukraine military,"" he explained. However, he said there's been a failure to properly predict the ""fierce resistance"" from within Ukraine, as well as the impact of weapons, supplies and support from the likes of NATO - not to mention superior intelligence information. Mr Spencer added: ""The Russian plan of attack in the beginning was not ridiculous. It was actually a solid plan, but they didn't have the military strength they thought they had to follow through on it. ""This conflict, in a larger sense, won't end for years. Russia will always contest the borders of Ukraine as a sovereign nation. But this war, the battle for Ukraine, will end within weeks or months. That is my opinion. ""We will see the Russian military in Ukraine reach its culmination point soon,"" he added. Meanwhile, intelligence also suggests propaganda within Russia has changed to reflect things not going to plan, reports Yahoo News. In order to ""prepare the society for a possible defeat"" the country's state run media is being ordered to talk about the invasion as an ""armed confrontation between the Russian Federation and all the countries of the European Union and NATO"". ""According to Kremlin political strategists, this will lessen the shame of losing to a more powerful adversary,"" the news outlet claims.",14,4.6589080744087985,4.5124346770669925,0.14647339734180598,25
2022-05-12,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/putin-dealt-fresh-blow-sweden-26946814,Putin dealt fresh blow as Sweden and Finland plan to join NATO quickly,"Vladimir Putin was dealt a fresh blow today as Finland announced plans to join NATO “without delay”. Kremlin forces invaded Ukraine in February because the Russian President wanted to push the Western military alliance back from his country’s borders. But the war has instead led to its neighbour Finland, with which it shares an 810-mile border, saying it wants the protection of the 30-member, nuclear-armed coalition. In a joint statement, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said: ""Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. “We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days."" A formal application is expected within days and NATO leaders are expected to discuss the bid at their summit in Madrid next month. Sweden, which shares a maritime frontier with Russia, is also set to apply to join the organisation. The country’s government plans to submit an application to join NATO next week, Expressen newspaper reported today. Sweden's parliament will reportedly debate the security situation on Monday and Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson will call a special cabinet to sign it off. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg previously said it would be possible to allow Finland and Sweden to join ""quite quickly"". Russia said Finland's decision was a hostile move that ""definitely"" posed a threat to its security. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the steps taken by Finland to join NATO were a cause for regret and a reason to impose a symmetrical response. Asked whether this presented a threat to Russia, Peskov said: ""Definitely. NATO expansion does not make our continent more stable and secure."" He added Finland had joined ""unfriendly steps"" against Russia. Downing Street said the UK would support the two nations’ “democratic wish” to try to join Nato. The unity of allied nations shows “democratic countries are further joining together as a direct consequence of Putin’s illegal invasion” and “demonstrates the futility of the action he has taken”, the PM’s spokesman said. No10 said the Kremlin’s claims that Finland joining NATO would be a threat to Russia were “clearly not true”. Boris Johnson’s spokesman added: “At no point have we seen any increased threat to Russia. The action taken by Nato is defensive by its very nature. “The only aggression that was actually enacted was the illegal invasion.” It comes after Boris Johnson said Britain’s Army could come to the aid of Sweden or Finland if Russia attacks the countries for applying to join Nato. The Prime Minister visited the two countries on Wednesday to sign security partnerships which will share intelligence on military exercises and technology. Asked if it could mean British boots on the ground, Mr Johnson replied: “In the event of a disaster or an attack on either of us, then yes we will come to each others’ assistance - including with military assistance. “The nature of that assistance will of course depend on the request of the other party.” The potential move raised fears of retaliation by Moscow before Sweden and Finland formally join and enjoys the protection of NATO’s Article V collective defence clause, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all. The West will act “very rapidly and very harshly” if Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons, Ukraine’s UN envoy warned. Sergiy Kyslytsya, the country’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, told LBC Radio’s Tonight with Andrew Marr: “President Putin acts by his own choice, he hardly listens to his advisors… So it is very difficult indeed to say whether he may or may not order to use tactical nuclear weapons. “I think the probability of using tactical nuclear weapons is higher than other types of nuclear weapons. “Some people hope that not everyone around him is crazy as he is and even if he orders to use tactical nuclear weapons, they may be sabotaged by the chain of command. It’s very difficult to say. “But if it happens, the retaliation by the West, I understand, will be very rapid and very harsh.”",29,5.703646555143987,5.049332385936989,0.654314169206998,10

Lt Col Albert Karimov, 39, was a highly-decorated special forces officer in the GRU military intelligence. His funeral is being held today in the village of Tirlyansky in his native Bashkortostan region. Russia has not disclosed the circumstances of his death during Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine which has seen tens of thousands of his forces killed. Nine Russian generals are also known to have died with reports that the US has assisted Ukraine with intelligence to allow them to target Putin’s top brass. Karimov is the 41st known colonel to have died in the war which has devastated Russia’s senior ranks. This is a rate of around one colonel every two days. The GRU is seen as Russia's most secretive and - until recently - most effective intelligence service. Britain says a GRU hit squad was behind the poisoning with Novichok of its ex agent Sergei Skripal - who had defected to Britain - and his daughter Yulia in 2018. Major-General Andrei Simonov, 56, became the ninth Russian general killed in Ukraine when he died in battle in Izyum near Kharkov. He was Russia's most respected electronics warfare commander, serving with the 2nd Combined Arms Army, and died in a devastating fightback by the Ukrainians against a Russian offensive. More than 30 Russian armoured vehicles were destroyed in the attack along with around 100 Russians troops, unconfirmed reports suggest. Losing senior military members can be a sign that an army is suffering from ill discipline as generals and colonels are required to take control of their forces on the front lines. Putin has now sent his chief of defence staff General Valery Gerasimov to take personal command of the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Simonov is far from the only high profile military man to lose their life in the course of the invasion. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, one of Putin’s most senior commanders and in charge of the 8th All-Military Army of the Kremlin’s vast Southern Military District, was killed at the beginning of March. While the exact number of people killed during the war is difficult to determine, it is clear that Russia has endured far greater losses than it initially expected. Last week UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace said that 15,000 Russian troops had died so far. The rate of fatalities among the invading army's number is now decreasing as the scope of the offensive is narrowed, a Western official told Reuters. Having failed in an assault on Kyiv in the north of Ukraine last month, Russia is now trying to fully capture two eastern provinces known as the Donbas. ""The nature of the operations have been reduced in terms of geographic spread so the overall numbers are reducing,"" one of the officials said on Russian casualties. ""But the level of casualties that we're seeing in terms of those areas where they are engaging Ukrainian forces are still remaining quite high.""",14,5.62185715797632,5.4730501461503716,0.1488070118259488,11

Mateusz Morawiecki has sounded the alarm about the Russian President, whom he pointed out has ""deadlier weapons at his disposal"" than the 20th century despots. Mr Morawiecki said that ""deputinisation"" is needed to make the world safe again. Writing for the Daily Telegraph, the Polish leader said: ""Putin is neither Hitler nor Stalin. ""Unfortunately, he is more dangerous. If Europe does [not] stop him, Putin will march Russian forces further into Europe."" Mr Morawiecki said it is ""up to us where we decide to stop ( Russia )"". He lashed out at Putin's 'Russkiy Mir"" ideology - which means Russian World, placing the country at the centre of world power, with sinister echos of 20th century communism and Nazism. Mr Morawiecki branded it ""an ideology through which Russia justifies invented rights and privileges for its country"". The warning comes amid fears that Putin will continue to escalate war in Europe even if he is able to secure victory in the Donbas region. On Monday the Russian President misleadingly told Russians that he had no choice but to launch his war in Ukraine, claiming that foreign powers were poised to invade. Russia has suffered heavy losses since launching its invasion, with an estimated 25,000 troops killed after facing strong resistance. It is now feared that Putin is prepared for a long war, and intends to continue his warmongering beyond Ukrainian borders. Yesterday US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said a Russian victory in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine might not end the war. ""We assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas,"" she said. The intelligence chief added that the United States had indications that Russia wanted to extend a landbridge to Moldova's breakaway region of Transdniestria. ""Combined with the reality that Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia's current conventional military capabilities ... the next few months could see us moving along a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory."" On Tuesday Ukraine said its forces had recaptured villages from Russian troops north and northeast of the city of Kharkiv. Ukrainian troops in recent days recaptured four settlements north of Ukraine's second-largest city, said Tetiana Apatchenko, a press officer with the main Ukrainian force in the area.

Mrs Propopenko told the Pope: “You are our last hope, I hope you can save their lives. Please don’t let them die.” Officials described the underground bolthole as a disease-ridden “medieval ghetto” containing rotting flesh and unburied bodies. The women said soldiers at the Azovstal plant lack food, water and medicine. Mrs Prokopenko said Russian captivity “is not an option” for the soldiers as they face almost certain execution. The Pope said he would do everything possible for Lt Col Denis Prokopenko and Sgt Arseniy Fedosiuk, and pray for them. Mariupol mayoral aide Petro Andryushchenko today claimed that “at least 100 civilians” remain in the “hell on earth” Azovstal shelters, which were still under attack.

The sweeping move has seen the Kremlin boss oust five regional heads. Some suggested the drastic move could be an effort to open up positions to oust out-of-favour officials from Moscow. It comes after a number of reports Putin was increasingly angry at some of the military and security personnel for failures during the ongoing invasion. Speculation suggests he is ready to fire those he feels has let him down on the ongoing invasion. The worst offenders in Putin’s eyes are reportedly already under arrest. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The shock of the simultaneous resignations of five governors was reportedly indicative of pressure put on them by the Kremlin to go. Valery Radayev, 61, quit as governor of Saratov region to ""focus on another area of work”. Tomsk region governor Sergey Zhvachkin, 65, said it was time “to give way to youth”. Ryazan region governor 50-year-old Nikolay Lyubimov announced he would not seek another term in September. Igor Vasilyev, 60, Kirov region governor, also quit, as did Alexander Yevstifeyev, 64, head of the Mari El Republic. In the past, Putin has parachuted ex-bodyguards or other favourites into such governships This all comes as Putin’s invasion of Ukraine comes into its third month, after beginning on February 24. In the 75 days since Russia ’s “special operation” began tens of thousands have died and nearly ten million people have been displaced. Whilst official death tolls are hard to come by for both sides, it is widely believed that Russia has suffered considerably worse losses than Ukraine has. Over the weekend, Ukraine’s official death toll stood at 3,381 however, Matilda Bogner, head of the human rights monitoring mission for the United Nations in Ukraine said the actual toll may be “thousands” higher. This was largely because of cities like Mariupol, which has seen some of the worst Russian air raids and bombings, is like a “black hole” for gathering information. In Russia, Moscow quickly stopped releasing its own official death count early on in the war. Since then, the Kremlin has remained silent on the losses it has suffered during the war but Ukraine recently said that it has lost 25,000 troops, and other estimates come in around 20,000 dead as well. Alongside that, reports suggest that Vladimir Putin has grown frustrated with some of the military and security personnel close to him. This includes parts of the infamous security service, the FSB, who reportedly provided faulty intelligence in the early periods of the war. In the last few days, Putin used his speech at his country’s Victory Day parade to brazenly claim that the West was preparing to invade Russia. He claimed his invasion was a “preventative” strike and hypocritically went on to claim the “horror” of World War Two should never be repeated as his troops massacred innocent civilians.",14,3.9232152737147965,2.659927236405249,1.2632880373095476,3

Ukrainian military chiefs said the friendly fire was ""positively perceived"" and thanked their enemies for helping to drive out ""racist occupiers"". It is understood to have happened in the Zaporizhzhya province on Sunday. Ukraine's 97th Infantry Battalion posted on Facebook following the incident: ""The leadership of the 97th Infantry Battalion expresses its satisfaction with the actions of the Russian occupiers, who today, using the heavy Zantsepek flamethrower system in the Zaporizhzhya direction, used it against their positions and actually burned the racist occupiers from Ukrainian soil. ""Such actions are positively perceived and supported in every way by the Ukrainian military."" Reports claim the strike was carried out using thermobaric flamethrowers, and TOS-1 rocket launchers. Russia has not publicly commented on the incident, and it is unclear how much damage was inflicted on Putin's troops. There have been claims from the same region that demoralised Russian troops have been vandalising their own vehicles so they cannot be sent into battle. The Zaporizhzhia Military Administration posted on Telegram: ""According to local residents, Russian troops have shelled 20 of their own vehicles in Polohy in order to avoid going to the front line; they blamed the shelling on [Ukrainian] resistance fighters in the temporarily occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia."" A desperate Putin may “escalate” the Ukraine invasion as the only way out and could even use nuclear weapons, a former NATO commander said. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has seen the Russian forces suffer far greater losses than many expected and fail to make significant inroads into their neighbouring country. At the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow on Monday, Putin cut a sombre figure as he was unable to announce the breakthroughs he would have wanted. And with the pressure growing, Sir James Everard, a former NATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander in Europe said that Putin could “significantly escalate” the invasion with over 600,000 troops or even choose the nuclear option. He said that the Russian president is now under threat from army generals due to the failure so far in Ukraine. ""He is in a terrible place. It was entirely of his own making,"" Sir James said. ""I can't see him achieving his objectives without escalating conventionally."" But he added: ""Where Putin has an advantage over the West is that he has a family of nuclear weapons. From the very small to the big city destroyers. In the UK, we have the city destroyers, but not the small ones. Perhaps for Putin, nuclear escalation isn't as big as we see it to be. I still think it would be horrific."" At the same time Joe Biden said on Monday he is worried that Putin does not have a way out of the Ukraine war, and the US president said he was trying to figure out what to do about that. Warmongering Putin claimed yesterday that Russia carried out a 'preventative' strike on Ukraine and defended his war during his Victory Day speech. Putin, whose health is the subject of persistent rumours, addressed the nation at the annual military parade, which marks the defeat of Nazi Germany. The Kremlin leader tried to justify his invasion by claiming Russia was in danger. He told crowds that the devastating intervention in Ukraine had been necessary because the West was ""preparing for the invasion of our land, including Crimea"". Speaking directly to troops, the Kremlin boss said: ""You're fighting for our people in Donbas, for the security of our motherland, Russia.""",14,3.4561122865092164,2.8400935587857052,0.6160187277235112,29

2022-05-09,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-troops-parade-new-tanks-26915896,Russian troops parade new tanks and missiles in display 300 miles from Ukraine,"Russian troops in medal-adorned uniforms paraded new tanks and deadly missiles in Red Square yesterday almost 300 miles from the death and depravity of war in Ukraine. Even as President Vladimir Putin marked Russia ’s proud World War II Victory Day celebrations, Ukrainians were desperately battling his forces’ brutal 75 days-long invasion. The rising death toll on Russia’s troops was obvious, according to sources, with ranks bolstered by police, female soldiers, railway troops and even Moscow’s spooks in uniform. Over the border devastating civilian tragedy and suffering marks the Ukraine invasion - in stark contrast to Russia’s attempt at a proud remembrance of its sacrifice fighting Nazi Germany. Rotting dead bodies and other debris of horrific fighting have been swept aside across south and east Ukraine as Moscow’s commanders cleared the way for their Victory Day pomp. In grisly contrast to Moscow’s gleaming tanks in Red Square Ukraine’s north, east and south is littered with 1,200 burnt-out, blackened and bombed out armoured vehicles. Each one is horrific evidence of a brutal end suffered by the Russian crews that once manned them as they tried without success to overwhelm Ukrainian defence positions. A staggering 26,650 Russian troops have died in almost three months of fighting, many of whose families still are not aware of what has happened to their loved ones. Well over 100 Russian warplanes have been shot down since the February 24, perhaps accounting for the lack of a huge and victorious fly-past over Moscow. The parades were slammed by Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry who said: “The World today sees very well who is marching through Red Square and what the real essence of the Russian Army is.” It went on bitterly: “Russian soldiers are war criminals who have no idea of honour. “They rape an barbarically kill women and men, children, the elderly and even pets.” UK defence secretary Ben Wallace accused Russian forces in Ukraine of “mirroring the facism and tyranny” they fought more than 70 years across their country and into Germany. And he called for the Russia’s senior generals who have acted out Putin’s wishes to attack Ukraine to face a court martial. Even as Putin addressed the sombre Moscow parade of just 9,000 troops and their vehicles of war, fellow Russian families were coming to terms with the losses. Last year 14,000 Russian troops took part in the parade, along with 160 pieces of military equipment including tanks, which went on for two hours. British Russia expert Bruce Jones told the Daily Mirror: “Russia has struggled to fill its ranks this as is seen by the number and categories of personnel in the parade. “This is as a result of the losses the Russian armed forces are suffering. “This was a less lengthy parade and the lack of a large fly-past was noticeable because although it was blamed on poor weather, it was a bright day.” Putin told his troops Russia’s war against democratic Ukraine was to rid the region of “Nazi filth” whilst in Ukraine war-crimes investigators are picking over the evidence of Russian troops’ Nazi-like atrocities- more than 9,000 noted already. But Putin claimed: “The death of every soldier is painful to us. The state will do everything to take care of these families.” Small comfort to the family of the dead Russian soldier who just weeks ago during an assignment, we found lying by the side of the road north of Kyiv. This young man had bagged up and dumped in a field after medics had failed to save him, surgical gloves lying by his side. His story is repeated throughout Ukraine’s killing fields where many Russian soldiers have been left behind by fleeing colleagues. Putin addressed his troops, lamely adding: “You are fighting for your Motherland, its future. For Russia, For Victory, Hurrah.” Many of his troops killed by Ukraine’s defending army were lied to, told they were “going on exercise” and emerged in Ukraine unaware they were already at war. Putin’s hijacking of Russia’s proud memorial of the 27 million his country lost in the Second World War is sickeningly contrasted to the blood and misery his troops are spilling in Ukraine. And no mention of the war-crimes they are now being investigated for, the rapes, murder, torture and industrial horror they have deployed against innocent Ukrainian civilians. The huge pits filled with the bodies of elderly men, women and even children, hurriedly piled into mass graves by relatives given half an hour at gunpoint to bury them. In Bucha, north west of Kyiv we saw bodies being exhumed from a pit of around 100 corpses - men and women of all ages, many shot dead in the street the piled on top of each other. Further north we met an elderly man who wept uncontrollably as he described sheltering in a school basement with women, children and dead bodies. Another man, aged 77, told us how he begged an angry 20 year-old Russian soldier with “dead eyes” to stop beating him in the street, leaving him with a limp. His cries of: “I could be your father, your grandfather - why are you doing this to me,” falling on deaf ears as the beating continued. And we met the son-in-law of 77 year-old disabled grandmother Svetlana Mykolayivna who was shot dead in her home by Russian troops. Andrei, 52, said: “She just put her light on as she heard a noise. They shot her dead.” Still, Putin blamed Moscow's invasion of Ukraine on western policies, claiming it was necessary to ward off potential aggression. He even brazenly drew parallels between the Red Army's fighting against the Nazi troops and the Russian forces' action in Ukraine. Addressing Russian troops filling Red Square, Mr Putin said the invasion was needed to avert ""a threat that was absolutely unacceptable to us.” He said: ""The danger was rising by the day,"" he claimed, adding ""Russia has given a pre-emptive response to an aggression"" in a ""forced, timely and the only correct decision by a sovereign, powerful and independent country"". The Victory Day that Russia marks on May 9 is the country's most important holiday, celebrated with military parades and fireworks across the county. Some in Ukraine and the West expected Mr Putin to use his speech at the parade to switch from calling the attack on Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to acknowledging it as a war. But he failed to make any shift in rhetoric or give any indication that the Kremlin may change its strategy and declare a broad mobilisation to beef up its ranks. The Kremlin has focussed on Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas, where Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting Ukraine since 2014. Russia has re-armed and re-supplied its forces withdrawn from areas near Kyiv and other regions in Ukraine's north-east and moved them to Donbas.",14,3.2210553128112593,3.044583310681417,0.1764720021298425,13

Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said almost the whole village of Bilohorivka had been sheltering in the building. Around 30 people were rescued from the rubble following the strike on Saturday afternoon. However, 60 others are thought to have died under the debris. Mr Gaidai said: ""The fire was extinguished after nearly four hours, then the rubble was cleared, and, unfortunately, the bodies of two people were found. ""Sixty people were likely to have died under the rubble of buildings."" Separately, Mr Gaidai said Russian Grad rockets killed two children in the city of Pryvillya yesterday, with two other youngsters and a woman left injured. Elsewhere, he added that shelling in the village of Shypilovo had destroyed a house and 11 people remained under the building's debris, according to preliminary information. It comes after Ukraine and the West have repeatedly accused Russian forces of targeting civilians and war crimes, charges Moscow rejects. Russia's 10-week-old war on Ukraine has killed thousands, destroyed cities and driven 5 million Ukrainians to flee abroad. The besieged port city of Mariupol, a strategic target for Russian forces, has been virtually destroyed, with the last 300 civilians trapped in the bombed-out Azovstal steelworks evacuated on Saturday. Evacuation efforts will now focus on getting the wounded and medics out of the steelworks. Ukrainian fighters in the plant have vowed not to surrender and Russian forces are seeking to declare a victory in time for Monday's Victory Day celebrations in Moscow.

Bato Basanov was in a record-breaking tank biathlon team that performed last year in war games in front of defence minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of the army general staff Valery Gerasimov. But his luck ran out on the battlefield when his tank was hit in Ukraine, killing him. The 25-year-old is the latest of dozens of men from the impoverished region of Buryatia some 3,500 miles east of Moscow to be killed in Putin’s war. As two bereft mothers in grief-stricken Buryatia spoke about collecting the bodies of their sons, one reportedly said to the other: ""You’re lucky because your son’s body arrived intact. Mine came back as a head and two hands."" Basanov, a corporal, had been hailed last year for ""glorifying Russia by becoming a world champion in tank biathlon as part of his team"". He shot without missing a single target at speeds of up to 50mph at the Alabino training ground in Moscow region. Yet as a report from Volya Media said: ""The death of Bato Basanov is grim confirmation that tank biathlon and real war are completely different things."" Russian commanders Shoigu and Gerasimov saw regular tank biathlon competitions as key military prestige events, yet the huge death toll of Russian forces shows they were not ready for real war. Basanov — whose Russian T-72B3 team beat soldiers from 19 countries in combat games including China — was shown being presented to Gerasimov, now in charge of Putin's crumbling war effort. Yet an anonymous Russian military expert has blamed Putin’s government for botched modernisation of tanks, leaving them worse in optics and targeting technology than Ukraine’s older tanks which were upgraded with Western equipment. ""Combat training in [Russian] tank units is disgusting,"" he added. The ""shortcomings"" have led to Russia’s dismal performance in the war, he said. Basanov was a gunner of the first company of the tank battalion of the 37th separate guards motorised rifle brigade of the Russian Air Defence Forces. The body of the ‘hero’ took seven weeks to be retrieved and returned to his family for a funeral on Friday. His friends and family said in a joint statement: ""Bato was an open, responsive, very sociable man, a faithful comrade and friend, who was always ready to come to the rescue. ""Cheerful, smiling and sincere, Bato has always been the pride of our family, a kind, honest, much-loved son.""",14,4.148935891783245,3.623727444000636,0.5252084477826093,11

Away from the underground hell of the besieged Mariupol steel plant where thousands of Ukrainian troops and civilians have been trapped for weeks. Away from the relentless Russian shelling and into the safety of temporary accommodation in the seaside village of Bezimenne 20 miles away. She was one of dozens evacuated on Friday and handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Her escape comes as Ukraine continues its bid to push back the Russian invaders in the eastern Donetsk region where shattered Mariupol lies under siege. Around 2,000 troops and 200 civilians, including children, are still holed up in the depths of the Azovstal steelworks, stopping Russia seizing the city and establishing a vital land corridor between the east and Crimea. Their very presence is raining on Vladimir Putin ’s “victory parade”. Ukrainian officials said Moscow was planning one in the scorched city to coincide with tomorrow’s annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, marking the Soviet Union’s part in the defeat of Hitler in 1945. And Ukraine is expecting the Russians to celebrate with an increase in attacks. Reports say surviving Mariupol civilians are being forced to clear the bodies of dead neighbours before the “military show” to get food, water and medicine. Ukraine’s first deputy interior minister Yevhen Yenin said Russia was “preparing to dance over bones in Mariupol” to back the Kremlin state media lie that “peaceful life is being established”. The ruins of the city’s bombed theatre, where 600 people died, were also being cleaned up in preparation for the parade. Officials also believe Russia plans to disguise 2,000 civilians in Ukrainian army kit to parade “prisoners of war” on TV. Mariupol mayoral advisor Petro Andryushchenko said: “These men are told that they will be dressed in Ukrainian uniforms and involved in the so-called parade of prisoners in Mariupol because there are not enough real prisoners.” Meanwhile Russia faced fresh claims of war crimes yesterday amid reports 500 civilians were being held in torture chambers in Kherson in the occupied south. It came as defence forces said they had recaptured five villages around Kharkiv in the north east, raising hopes of driving back Russia. A US think tank said Ukraine’s military may be able to push Russian forces “out of artillery range of Kharkiv providing an opportunity to build a successful, counter-offensive”. And now Britain is keeping up the flow of weapons Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky needs to maintain the momentum.” Boris Johnson said: “The UK was the first country to send arms to help the Ukrainians defend themselves. We will stand by that endeavour.” And Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who agreed to the package, added: “We are unwavering in our support – and this extra £1.3billion will ensure we continue to provide the military and operational support they need to defend themselves against Putin.” Mr Johnson and other G7 leaders spoke to President Zelensky by video link yesterday to discuss Ukraine’s long-term arms needs.",17,3.4443697690844934,4.496402420834896,-1.0520326517504022,25

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said that Putin’s senior military brass were scrambling to dodge blame for the stuttering invasion. He said they were blaming one another for the “disaster” of the war so far, and lived in terror of being purged if the “quagmire” turned into a retreat for the Kremlin’s forces, the Times reports. Wallace said that military chiefs in the general staff were already scapegoats for Putin’s botched invasion. He added: ""Those in the military system were “always terrified they are about to be purged and pushed out."" Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Wallace made the comments whilst in Finland to observe a military exercise with British troops and tanks. He also said that the generals were getting closer and closer to the frontline in an effort to try and “sort out this quagmire that they’re in”. He said: “They do it by shouting and screaming at people but it tends not to get the best result.” Most recently, reports said that General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff, had recently headed to the frontline in a highly unusual move. According to a Russian news outlet, the 66-year-old general was injured by shrapnel during fighting in Izyum, eastern Ukraine and had to be evacuated. But, a senior defence source dismissed these claims to The Times and said it was a member of his entourage rather than him himself. When Ben Wallace was asked if Gerasimov was being sent out as a “fall guy” the cabinet minister warned: “They’re all in fall guy territory. Be careful if you’re out in sole command of something in the Russian system, because it may not be for long. “There is a point of tension in the system. As much as they respect the former KGB man [Putin] for being a strong leader, the Russian general staff are going to be made scapegoats for his mess. “He [Putin] would be foolish, potentially, to blame Gerasimov and the other generals for what is predominantly a politically, emotive-driven invasion defying all logic. It’s a political decision he took, not a military one, and he needs to wear that decision.” Wallace added that Putin had no one close to him who has told him to abandon their plans to seize Ukraine. He added that the war could “very quickly turn from a quagmire to a rout” if the Russian forces collapsed like they in the north of Ukraine around Kyiv. However, with Russia ’s ‘Victory Day’ only days away on May 9, the defence secretary previously warned that Putin might use it as an opportunity to cal up more troops or declare all-out-war.",14,3.7449596830670906,4.105407514515601,-0.36044783144851067,4

Amnesty International said innocent civilians also suffered from “reckless shootings and torture” from rampaging Russian troops during attacks throughout February and March. Donatella Rovera, Amnesty’s senior crisis response officer, said: ""These are not isolated incidents. These are very much part of a pattern wherever Russian forces were in control of a town or a village.” She was speaking at a news conference in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv as Amnesty launched a major new report into Russia ’s orgy of violence as its troops attacked Kyiv. Ukrainian authorities are investigating over 9,000 potential war crimes by Russian troops and the International Criminal Court is also looking into alleged war crimes. Amnesty’s report is the latest to document alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces when they occupied an area northwest of Kyiv, including the town of Bucha, where more than 400 civilians were killed. Armour piercing rounds or bullets, with black tips and a 9x39mm calibre were fired at civilians and these are only used by some elite Russian airborne units more commonly known as paratroopers. Moscow withdrew its troops in early April as the invasion faltered, driven back by a ferocious Ukrainian counter-attack. The report concludes Russian troops committed a ""host of apparent war crimes"" in Bucha, including ""numerous unlawful killings.” Evidence has been uncovered leading to the identities of individual Russian soldiers and military units present in Bucha, amongst them the troops of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division, Rovera said she collected in Bucha armour-piercing bullets and shell casings produced at a plant in Tula, south of Moscow, for rifles used only by elite Russian airborne units. It adds enormous weight to earlier revelations this week linking war crimes to Russian airborne troops. She added: “We also found and were able to view some military documents that indicate the presence of these special units in these places where these crimes were committed.” Amnesty has documented 22 cases of unlawful killing by Russian forces - ""most of which were apparent extrajudicial executions"" - in Bucha and nearby areas. The devastating report was revealed amid fears for more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops and hundreds of civilians holed up in a steel works in Mariupol which Russian forces are trying to overrun.",13,5.44166402916013,6.497878391554493,-1.0562143623943632,22

Just 10 weeks into the invasion and Putin's forces are said to be firing more missiles than they expected to because of how the war has dragged on. Britain's Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told TalkTV : ""He potentially has a problem because the rate of expenditure and the toughness of the fight is totally different to the one that he perceived on the 24th of February. ""I think there are several wars going on. There's a tactical, geographical war going on in Ukraine. There's a logistics war going on, in terms of how you maintain that rate of expenditure.

During a visit to Poland, Mr Wallace said Putin's top men are blaming each other for the ""disaster"" and fear being purged in the event of a retreat, The Times reports.

Railway tankers containing solvents caught fire by a huge factory in Dzerzhinsk, which has made chemical weapons. A fire train was deployed to fight the raging inferno in the industrial city which is 250 miles east of Moscow and more than 150 emergency service workers spent nine hours battling the fire covering over 2,500 square metres, on Wednesday. It is one of many attacks that have been taking place on strategic sites with military links on Russian soil since the Ukraine invasion. And as Vladimir Putin is rumoured to be considering mass army mobilisation, a video has been shared showing a Russian military enlistment office hit by multiple Molotov cocktails. Another blaze that officially killed 22 at a defence ministry missile design research institute, and an attack that saw three die at an explosive plant, are also seen as possible arson with the Russian authorities also being accused of playing down incidents. There remains suspicion over the cause of a fire which killed 22 at the top secret missile-designing defence plant in Tver and saw some of the country’s top missile designers die and their work destroyed. Some military scientists jumped for their lives from windows at the burning plant which develops new space and weapons systems. And in a gigantic fire on Monday three women died at explosives manufacturer Perm Gunpowder Plant, which supplies the army. The plant makes Grad and Smerch multiple launch rocket systems, used by Russian forces in Ukraine, and air defence systems as well as tank rounds, while also supplying gunpowder for small arms. The dead explosives workers were named as Svetlana Bardakova, 59, Olga Savishchenko, 43, and Ulyana Frants, 36. An eyewitness told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: ""The building just flew into the air” and the facility at the plant “just doesn't exist anymore”. One of the dead Svetlana Bardakova “couldn't even run out, but the other girls fled - they were all burned. Olga (Savishchenko) had 100 per cent body burns. She was not even taken to the hospital. “But Ulyana (Frants) was alive, she had 99% burns, and her son in the second grade is waiting for her at home. I don’t know how to go to work any more. I cried all night.” In another case, blame has been put on faulty wiring and a criminal case is under way into a fire which razed the Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence causing untold damage to Russian weapons research. Suspicions have been voiced that the fire was sabotage. The institute is central to the design of Iskander missiles, which have been unleashed in the war in Ukraine, as well as Russia ’s S-400 missile defence system. And human rights group gulagu.net viewed this week’s attack on the military enlistment office in Nizhnevartovsk, that caused a fire and no reported injuries, as an “anti-war protest”.

It comes after an alleged cyber criminal and supporter of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin was arrested in the UK on Monday. The accused, who is said to be London-based, was detained after a police raid in the aftermath of a cyber assault on government and media websites in Romania, according to reports. He is said to be part of group Killnet, which has since warned it will disable NHS ventilators, as well as those in Romania and Moldova if he is not released. The 'gang' has claimed responsibility for the attacks, committed in retaliation for the country's support for Ukraine. The official government webpage and defence ministry were targeted, as well as political parties and other companies. The arrested man has previously declared his support for Moscow's barbaric invasion in Facebook posts, say reports. Investigators from Romania teamed up with National Crime Agency officers for the raid earlier this week. Killnet has said the suspect was not involved in the attacks, but warned it would retaliate within 48 hours if demands weren't met. The threat was reportedly posted on Telegram on Thursday evening and said: ""If he is not released within 48 hours I will destroy your Romania, Great Britain and Moldova. ""I will destroy your entire information structure and even your Ministry of Health. ""All ventilators will be attacked. Only then will you begin to realise the mistake you have made."" The suspect had been released under investigation prior to the warning. A source told The Sun : ""The UK has robust cyber security measures in place and, working with partners, the NCA would lead an appropriate response to any cyber crime incident having a significant impact on the UK."" It comes after the world’s top intelligence alliance warned last month Russian hackers are plotting cyber attacks on the NHS, nuclear power plants and Whitehall ministries. The Five Eyes security network - involving the UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand - issued an alert accusing the Russian government of exploring options for potential web assaults against critical organisations. The spy coalition urged them to bolster cyber defences as they face a heightened risk of Kremlin-sponsored attacks.

A total of 25 national guards “refuseniks”, who report directly to Putin, are demanding their job back after they were fired for defying commanders’ orders to send them to a foreign war zone. The Vladikavkaz garrison military court is due to start considering their lawsuit on Thursday said lawyer and human rights campaigner Pavel Chikov. They aim to prove that their dismissal was “illegal” since it was based on their refusal to enter Ukraine. The “refuseniks” were ordered to enter Ukraine early on in the war to keep order in Ukrainian cities. At the time, the Kremlin believed that victory would be swift and locals would surrender to Russian troops but many died, with the true figure not yet public. The case comes at a time when reports of open dissent in Russia are increasing, even among those in uniform. Hundred of guards from at least 17 cities have sought legal advice and aim to follow in the footsteps of the 25 national guards who have already launched their case. The servicemen are challenging Putin’s commander to the North Caucasian District to the National Guard Troops, Lt-Gen Sergey Zakharov.

Moscow’s troops have allegedly discussed the sick dress-up ruse to falsify their May 9 Victory Day celebrations - a key date in Russian military tradition. Petro Andryushchenko, advisor to the mayor of Mariupol, confirmed he had heard reports that Russians intend to put Ukrainian Army uniforms on civilians for a twisted “parade of prisoners"". It comes amid soaring fears for hundreds of civilians and more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops desperately making a last stand at the besieged Azovstal steel works in Mariupol. Andryushchenko said many of Mariupol’s men had been forcibly removed and separated from women and children after fleeing the strategic city. He also hinted that he had heard of Russian plans to disguise Ukrainian civilians as prisoners of war for the May 9 parade, which marks a 1945 Soviet victory against Nazi Germany. He said: “Men have been forcibly detained without being allowed to leave without a convoy of Russian troops. “The conditions are terrible - people are forced to sleep on the floor in the corridors. Medical care is not provided. “As for the future the occupiers emphasise that they have not yet decided whether to use people as labour or mobilise them to the Army as prisoners. “Why should they be disguised as Ukrainian soldiers?” Russian forces have stepped up brutal shelling of trapped troops and civilians in the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol as the defenders are in underground tunnel complexes. They have defended the vast industrial site for weeks, despite coming under heavy attack and being driven back by Ukraine ’s forces repeatedly. Ukraine’s President Zelensky warned that women and children sheltering underground now need to be dug out from the rubble under which they are buried alive. He said: “It takes time to just lift people out of these basements, out of underground shelters. “In the current conditions we cannot use special equipment to clear the debris. “Everything is done manually but we believe everything will work out.” Russian forces have promised to allow a ceasefire to allow a rescue bid for the rest of Mariupol’s trapped civilians. But Ukraines’ attempts to evacuate stricken civilians have been repeatedly thwarted by Russia going back on its ceasefire promises. According to Kyiv figures 221 Ukrainian children have been killed during the invasion and 408 injured.",17,5.590356682525578,3.060069526388998,2.53028715613658,26

The country's defence ministry said war monger Putin's invaders were attempting to increase the tempo of its offensive, with around 20 bombs launched from airspace above the Caspian Sea. Officials said the weapons were fired “with the aim of damaging our country's transport infrastructure."" Lviv was among those targeted for the first time in around a month as Russia targeted railway stations and other supply-lines bringing urgent essentials from allies in the West. Some of the weapons struck electrical substations, leaving terrified people waiting in the dark as the attacks intensified. Six rockets were fired on the west of Ukraine, with two being shot down by the nation before they could hit their targets. One 24-year-old victim was nearly killed when a bomb landed outside his home in Lviv. The Mail Online reported him saying: “‘When I took off my helmet, I saw a rocket flying in my face. It fell behind a concrete wall, about ten metres from me. The garage I was standing near exploded. “Only when I ran home did I notice that there were fragments in my leg.” The flurry of attacks comes as Russia prepares to celebrate Victory Day on Monday, marking the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany. There are fears President Vladimir Putin will use the occasion to declare victory in Ukraine or expand what he calls the ""special military operation"". A declaration of all-out war would allow him to introduce martial law and mobilise reservists to make up for significant troop losses. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu justified the latest attacks by saying Lviv had been a gateway weaponry being sent around the country by Nato. In the under siege nation’s latest update, they reported heavy fighting continues to rage at the Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in the ruined southern port city. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: ""All of these crimes will be answered, legally and quite practically - on the battlefield."" A Kyiv official said: “With the support of aircraft, the enemy resumed the offensive in order to take control of the plant.” He added the Russians were ""trying to destroy Ukrainian units"". Ukrainian fighters earlier claimed enemy forces had begun storming the plant, but the Kremlin denied it. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the latest in Mariupol: ""The order was publicly given by the supreme commander (Russian President Vladimir Putin) to cancel the storming (of the plant). There is no storming. ""We see that there are escalations associated with the fact that fighters are taking up firing positions. “These attempts are being suppressed very quickly, there is nothing else to say at the moment.” The United Nations announced that more than 300 civilians were evacuated on Wednesday from Mariupol and other nearby communities. The evacuees arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles to the north west, where they were receiving humanitarian assistance.",17,4.135260828168371,3.318075179150571,0.8171856490177998,26

This is the moment Russian troops bomb the Azovstal plant to “suppress” Ukrainian soldiers who resumed fighting after civilians were allowed to evacuate. The video was filmed at the Azovstal iron and steel works plant, in the city of Mariupol. Russian troops stormed the plant on April 19 and destroyed large areas, however, pockets of organised resistance fighters remain at the plant. Those remaining are refusing to surrender to the Russian demands. Members of the Azov Battalion, a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine in Mariupol, are said to be based in the plant. The footage was shared by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) on May 4. Contact was lost with the Azonstal Steelworks defenders as Russian forces pounded them with missiles and stormed their redoubt with tanks and infantry. The Mayor of the city Vadym Boichenko confirmed he has “lost contact” with those inside the vast complex and added he no longer knew if “they are safe or not.” According to the ministry, Ukrainian fighters based in the plant resumed fighting after civilians were allowed to leave. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works was the last stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the southern port city. It had been under siege from Russian forces for weeks, and stood even as the rest of the city fell to Putin's troops. Hundreds of civilians and wounded were said to be trapped down there as well as the troops fighting Russian occupation and there were growing fears of starvation as they began to run low on supplies. Russia’s Mariupol onslaught came amid fears Russian forces are desperate to wipe out the resistance in advance of a big military parade on May 9. It marks Victory day and the 1945 defeat of Germany and Russia is considering staging a “sick” parade in the ruined city, cleaning up corpses and faking welcomes from locals. Fears are growing for around 1,000 remaining Ukrainian troops - many of them wounded - and a few hundred civilians believed to still be there. It is believed the planned parade was leaked by Ukrainian intelligence which had intercepted Russian phone calls in which the May 9 project was mentioned. Russia has continued to pound targets across Ukraine, targeting supply lines for foreign weapons in the west and intensifying attacks in the east. Moscow confirmed on Wednesday it used sea- and air-launched precision guided missiles to destroy electric power facilities at five railway stations across Ukraine. Artillery and aircraft also struck troop strongholds and fuel and ammunition depots. The flurry of attacks happened as Russia prepares for its Victory Day on May 9, when President Vladimir Putin may use the occasion to declare a limited victory. Explosions hit the western city of Lviv on Tuesday evening, close to the Polish border. The strikes damaged three power substations, knocking out electricity in parts of the city and disrupting the water supply and two people were hurt. Kremlin war planners are desperate to stop western weaponry - much of it from the UK -pouring into Ukraine and helping to blunt Russia's offensive. In the eastern Donetsk region, which lies in the Donbas, Russian attacks left 21 dead on Tuesday, the highest number of known fatalities since the April 8 missile attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk killed at least 59 people. The US believes Ukrainians in recent days pushed Russian forces about 25 miles east of Kharkiv, a northeastern city that lies outside the Donbas but is key to the offensive there. Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said authorities on Wednesday plan to continue efforts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol. Thanks to the evacuation effort over the weekend, 101 people - including women, the elderly, and 17 children, the youngest six months old - emerged from the bunkers under the Azovstal steelworks to ""see the daylight after two months"", said Osnat Lubrani, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Ukraine. A few hundred civilians also remained there, Ms Vereshchuk, the deputy prime minister, said. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that by storming the steel mill, Russian forces violated agreements for safe evacuations. He said the prior evacuations are ""not a victory yet, but it's already a result. I believe there's still a chance to save other people.” However on Tuesday, the UN, in corodination with The International Committee of the Red Cross, confirmed 101 people were successfully evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant. The DPR claimed the “militants” took up firing positions straight after the civilians left the plant and opened fire on Russian troops and DPR fighters. The footage shows Ukrainian soldiers moving around the plant in tanks and armoured vehicles before Russian bombs rain down, sending large plumes of smoke into the sky. The DPR said they used aerial bombs and artillery ammunition to “suppress enemy activity at Azovstal”. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin called a ""special military operation"". Today marks the 70th day of the campaign. From February 24 to May 4, the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at around 24,500 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 1,077 battle tanks, 2,610 combat armoured vehicles, 491 artillery systems, 163 MLR systems, 81 anti-aircraft systems, 194 warplanes, 155 helicopters, 1,867 vehicles, 10 vessels, 76 fuel tank trucks, 303 operational-tactical level UAVs, 38 units of special equipment, and 87 cruise missiles have been shot down. Meanwhile, a host of international organisations have banned Russia, already hit by economic sanctions, from taking part in sporting and cultural events, such as this year’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar, in response to the country’s invasion.",17,3.63814167872395,4.472043250443044,-0.8339015717190943,26

State news agency RIA has released images of the battered remnants of the Ukrainian artillery headquarters on the outskirts of a village called Trekhizbenka. A so-called ""expert"" claimed the symbol - made up of the anarchy sign with scribbles in the spaces in between - is a hybrid insignia of Nazism and occultism. Ekaterina Dais told RIA: ""This is a magical sigil (symbol) consisting of many intersecting lines. ""What it means is difficult to say for sure, in it you can see both the inverted sign of anarchy, and part of the ""SS"" sign, the rune zig, it is clearly visible in the extreme left sector of the circle, and the Hebrew letter ""zain"" written in German, meaning a sword or weapon."" The propagandist publication goes on to remark the sigil was drawn in one continuous hand movement - which also points to its ""occult nature"". RIA added the Ukrainian mortarmen had made attempts to ""consecrate"" their weapons and smeared blood over a document - a practice said to enable someone to make a pact with a demon. Dais drew attention to the word ""Zain"" scrawled crudely under the symbol which she says means ""sword"" in the Hebrew alphabet. She said: ""Perhaps the spell's authors performed rituals to strengthen weapons or 'asked' for more weapons to be sent to them."" Dais' comment about the unfinished ""SS"" symbol is the most-recent example of state propaganda supporting the Kremlin's branding of Ukraine as a neo-Nazi state. Putin has repeatedly called the government in Kyiv a neo-Nazi regime and dubbed the invasion a ""special military operation"" to rid its former Soviet ally from the grips of its far-right dictators. But at the start of April, a far-right Russian batallion called Rusich were spotted on the Ukrainian border. They are notorious for their cruel tactics and post-mortem mutilations, including the collecting the ears of enemies downed on the battlefield. The unit is linked to private military company, the Wagner Group, which is backed by the Kremlin and is said to currently have 1,000 soldiers operating in eastern Ukraine. Rusich was founded nearly a decade ago in St Petersburg by Red Army paratrooper Aleksei Milchakov, 30, and Yan Petrovsky, 33 - after the pair met at a white supremacist event. Symbols have been a prominent feature for both sides since the start of the invasion. One that has become particularly infamous is the Kremlin's chilling ""Z"" - which has been plastered across social media, and the tanks rolling through Ukrainian neighbourhoods. Perhaps most shockingly, one was also seen draped on the chest of a Russian athlete. Not a part of the Cyrillic alphabet, the Z was first seen painted on the side of tanks and equipment ahead of the invasion alongside other letters including V, A, X and O. At the time it was thought the lettering performed two jobs: to mark out Russian equipment from the often very similar military vehicles of Ukraine, and to indicate where that equipment was destined for or originated from. Now though questions hang over this theory - after almost two weeks of full-scale war in mainland Europe, the lettering has changed its meaning into something far more symbolic.",14,3.337876977441791,3.8456942063737767,-0.5078172289319856,13

In Mariupol, Ukraine says that Russian troops are rounding up the dead and burning them in a massive “cleaning” effort. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said that Russian troops in the city had been undertaking the macabre task since April 15. It added that they had been using three mobile crematoriums in their 'clean up’ as they rounded up the bodies of the Ukrainians that they had killed. In a statement released today they said: “Today in Mariupol occupiers carry out ‘big cleaning’. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here “The Russians are searching for and destroying the bodies of the dead. To do this, the city has three mobile crematoria since April 15.” It is believed this is in an effort to hide Russian crimes in the city, and comes weeks after sickening revelations of mass killings in the Kyiv Oblast left the streets littered with dead. By burning the dead it means charities, the UN and Ukraine would be unable to assess to extent of Russian actions and how many have died. It would also make reuniting families, or informing them of their loved one’s passing, nearly impossible as well. It has previously been reported that Russia were trying to “cover their tracks” by using the mobile crematoriums to hide the true scale of slaughter in the city. Mariupol has been at the centre of some of the worst atrocities in Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The city has been hit by relentless Russia shelling and air strikes, including targeting a maternity and children’s hospital and a shelter. Officials said that more than 90 per cent of the city’s infrastructure had been hit by shelling. Now, most of the city is under Russian control, with Ukrainian troops holed up in a steelworks plant. Mariupol’s city council previously accused Russia of sending out “special brigades” to round up the dead the dead bodies and burn them. The council quoted eyewitnesses who said they had seen “special brigades” collect “the bodies of Mariupol residents murdered and killed as a result of the Russian invasion"". On top of that, they said that because of the destruction of evidence it would be difficult to accurately assess the true number of dead and it could run into “tens of thousands civilians”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also said that Russia was “cleaning up” before anyone could see what had happened in the city. If the port city were to fall to Russia, it would give Moscow a continuous land bridge connecting its territories from the east of Ukraine to the Crimean Peninsula. It is thought this would help it with resupplying efforts of its stuttering invasion.",17,4.224314620146384,5.030641168087369,-0.8063265479409853,12

Major-General Kyrylo Budanov has said that the Russian leader has effectively signed his death warrant by ordering his troops into Ukraine. Boldly predicting a Ukrainian victory at the same time as warning that mass-mobilisation in Russia was near, Major-General Budanov issued this veiled threat on Monday evening. “Leaving him a way to retreat is one of the strategies, but it is almost unrealistic,” he told The New Voice of Ukraine when asked if Putin would survive the war. “He is a war criminal for the whole world. This is his end, he drove himself into a dead end. Don't worry, Ukraine will win."" The Head of the Chief Intelligence Directorate would not be drawn on how the despot would be ousted or assassinated, but did predict that the future of Russia could unfold in one of two ways. He said that Russia could be divided into multiple parts following its failure in the invasion, or it could be kept whole, but under new leadership. Major-General Budanov went on to suggest that Russia was less than a week away from mass mobilisation, which would see its non-military citizens required to have a direct involvement in the war. ""Russia has already been enacting covert mobilisation and is preparing to announce a mass mobilisation in the near future,"" he told NV. When asked whether Putin planned to announce the mobilisation on May 9, he said: ""Yes, they are preparing."" In recent weeks Russia watchers have turned their attention to May 9, which is the day the country celebrates its victory over Nazi Germany. While the invasion has not gone as planned - the Ukrainian forces having not only slowed the Russian advance, but forced it to focus on the eastern section of the country - Putin is expected to make some kind of declaration of victory. Many military analysts have warned it could also be a key date for escalation in the war, which the Russian leader has claimed is an effort to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. “They had the main deadline—to have time to finish by April 24… they completely failed him. The second date is to complete the operation at least in Donbas by May 9,” Major-General Budanov said. “Putin cannot admit that he is losing to Ukraine."" The one clear victory the Russians can now claim is in Mariupol, which effectively fell into their hands last week despite the presence of Ukrainian troops in a besieged steelworks. Otherwise the invasion has been far slower and much more costly in terms of lives lost than planned. According to the UK Ministry of Defence, Russia has lost a quarter of its combat forces deployed in Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. According to intelligence experts, Russia committed more than 120 battalion tactical groups - some 65 per cent of their entire ground combat strength - and now had around 30 completely out of action. ""At the start of the conflict, Russia committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65 per cent of its entire ground combat strength,"" an update from the Defence Intelligence agency reads.

Russia threw ""approximately 65 per cent of its entire ground combat strength"" at Ukraine during its ongoing invasion. This equalled around 120 battalion tactical groups and despite this the Kremlin forces have found themselves struggling, and in recent weeks they regrouped in the east to refocus their efforts. The Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update yesterday that it believed over a quarter of Moscow’s units had been rendered useless in the war. This would reflect reports on the ground that have highlighted poorly equipped Russian soldiers whose vehicles have run out of fuel, as well as claims of low morale and desertion.

It will probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces.” Since the early days of the war, the Ministry of Defence has been offering regular intelligence updates on its Twitter account. This is seemingly a part of a wider Western strategy whereby officials and governments are publicising intelligence unlike ever before in an effort to stay one step ahead of Vladimir Putin. That comes as today’s intelligence update further highlighted issues amongst Russia’s military and more failings of its invasion. This included in reporting its belief that the invasion would have a “lasting impact on Russia’s ability to deploy conventional military force”. The MoD wrote that despite Russia’s push to appear like it was undertaking an expansive military modernisation over the past few decades, significant failures meant it was unable to translate this into any meaningful advantage on the battlefield. They wrote: “Russia’s defence budget approximately doubled between 2005 and 2018, with investment in several high-end air, land and sea capabilities. “From 2008 this underpinned the expansive military modernisation programme New Look. “However, the modernisation of its physical equipment has not enabled Russia to dominate Ukraine. “Failures both in strategic planning and operational execution have left it unable to translate numerical strength into decisive advantage. “Russia’s military is now significantly weaker, both materially and conceptually, as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. “Recovery from this will be exacerbated by sanctions.

The 35-year-old is apparently being held in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, which Russians forces occupied early in their offensive. In the footage bearded Mr Hill, a father of four, can be seen seemingly reading a statement and occasionally stumbling over his words. The Mirror is not publishing the video. “After coming to Ukraine I realised it was hell here,"" he says, before adding that the foreign mercenaries he was fighting with until last week were ""really bad people and sadists"". ""They were ready to do any dirty job needed for money,"" Mr Hill said. ""They don't come to war for money, they do get money, but they do it because they enjoy it. Many of them do not understand the Ukrainian and Russian language."" Mr Hill is filmed saying that the mercenaries' lack of understanding of the language is why “they shoot (civilians), kill them and injure them indiscriminately."" He adds: “They stole valuable things from these people without any shame at all. Mercenaries also tortured Russian soldiers and Russian fight activists. “They cut off their fingers and they torture them. Prisoners were severely beaten and they were deprived of food and a drink. “I've never seen such cruelty on this scale before."" The script Mr Hill appears to have been given hits on key talking points pushed repeatedly by the Russian propaganda machine. “Supporters of the Neo-Nazi and the nationalist ideology prevail in this camp,” Mr Hill continues. “They are proud of the tattoos of the swastikas and the double-S's emblems. It was awful. “Unfortunately I found myself among these terrible people and unwittingly became involved in these war crimes. “I understand everything has been done wrong and I hope for leniency from the Donetsk People Republic.” In the UK his partner Candice Morgan has been making frantic efforts to get him back to the UK, spreading the word that her partner is a ""prisoner of war."" She and his family “are trying everything in our power and are in contact with the right people to try and get him home safely”. ""This isn’t an easy process and will take time,"" Candice said. ""Again, I know how hard it is not knowing what is happening but please can everyone be reassured that this situation has not been taken lightly.""

When they see civilian convoys – families, children – they annihilate the whole f* ing column, everyone.” Russia has been accused of carrying out a “big cleaning” by burning countless dead bodies in mobile crematoriums to hide the extent of its crimes in Ukraine. In Mariupol, Ukraine says that Russian troops are rounding up the dead and burning them in a massive “cleaning” effort. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said that Russian troops in the city had been undertaking the macabre task since April 15. It added that they had been using three mobile crematoriums in their 'clean up’ as they rounded up the bodies of the Ukrainians that they had killed. In a statement released today they said: “Today in Mariupol occupiers carry out ‘big cleaning’. “The Russians are searching for and destroying the bodies of the dead. To do this, the city has three mobile crematoria since April 15.” It is believed this is in an effort to hide Russian crimes in the city, and comes weeks after sickening revelations of mass killings in the Kyiv Oblast left the streets littered with dead. By burning the dead it means charities, the UN and Ukraine would be unable to assess to extent of Russian actions and how many have died. It would also make reuniting families, or informing them of their loved one’s passing, nearly impossible as well. It has previously been reported that Russia were trying to “cover their tracks” by using the mobile crematoriums to hide the true scale of slaughter in the city. Mariupol has been at the centre of some of the worst atrocities in Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The city has been hit by relentless Russia shelling and air strikes, including targeting a maternity and children’s hospital and a shelter. Officials said that more than 90 per cent of the city’s infrastructure had been hit by shelling. Now, most of the city is under Russian control, with Ukrainian troops holed up in a steelworks plant. Mariupol’s city council previously accused Russia of sending out “special brigades” to round up the dead the dead bodies and burn them.",17,4.526061447431609,4.52765656382453,-0.001595116392920204,12

Kyiv intelligence officers believe the killer disease could spark an epidemic in the region whilst Moscow would accuse Ukraine of launching a bio-attack. The Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate says Russian officials are already preparing for a Cholera outbreak by restricting mass gatherings. They also believe Moscow medical officials are preparing “disease prevention measures” in anticipation of Cholera hitting the Ukrainian border regions. It is not known if Moscow has any evidence of Cholera hitting eastern Ukraine but the combination of contaminated water and food could spark an epidemic. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It is also not known if Moscow has evidence of Cholera breaking out in eastern Ukraine but it has been suspected of planning a bio-attack itself. Crowded shelters can also risk spreading the bacterial disease if large numbers of displaced locals are forced to take refuge together, spreading the disease. The Ukrainian MoD warned that Moscow has even ordered its medical chief to undertake “additional measures on Cholera prevention…” It said: “The chief state sanitary doctor of Russia Anna Popova signed a decree ‘On additional measures on cholera prevention.’ “Special attention is paid to additional prevention measures in the border with Ukraine regions: Bryanska, Kurska, Belgorod, Voronezka, Rostov region, Krasnodar region and occupied Crimea.” And it warned Russia will likely launch a “false flag” bio-attack claim towards the end of May or in June - relating to a Cholera outbreak. It said: “...the Russian Federation may be involved in provocations in border areas with Ukraine. “Responsibility for this traditionally will attempt to translate to Ukraine, accusing of 'the use of biological weapons'."" Russia has been repeatedly accused of launching and planning “false flag” operations - self-inflicted incidents used to a pretext to attack Ukraine. The latest such attack is believed to be explosions in Moldova, aimed at stirring up unrest, possibly as a pretext for it to launch a so-called peace mission to rescue pro-Russians there. Increasingly Moscow’s troops are resorting to more brutal and depraved tactics after suffering enormous losses in 69 days of brutal fighting.

The harrowing footage was filmed from the drone’s perspective as the Russian soldiers crowd around the car. Not far from the car are the destroyed remains of a building and the rural road around them is strewn with debris. As one Russian troop dives into the car, another runs up from the direction of the destroyed building and leaps in too. The bomb’s dropped from the drone as the third Russian runs around the back of the car and it reverse slightly, perfectly positioning itself so the bomb falls through the sunroof. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It immediately explodes upon impact, sending smoke spewing out the car as it keeps reversing with its doors hang open. The only Russian not to get in the car keeps running towards the ruined building, without even seemingly looking back as the car trundles into a tree. It is not known where the attack took place, but the footage was originally posted on Telegram. It was then shared on Twitter by Ukrainian government advisor Anton Gerashchenko who said the attack was executed by soldiers of Ukraine ’s 92nd Brigade. Throughout Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv’s forces have utilised drone attacks to wreak havoc on the Kremlin’s forces. Only last week, footage showed another drone strike from what was thought to be Ukraine’s 503rd Naval Infantry Battalion which left two Russian tanks destroyed. Back in March, a group of amateur drone users claimed they were able to destroy Russia’s infamous 40-mile convoy of tanks and armoured vehicles in a number of ambushes. The group’s commander Lieutenant Colonel Yaroslav Honchar said that they staged an ambush near the town of Ivankiv. This helped to halt the massive Russian operation and the force approached on quad bikes at night, before attacking the column's supply depot to stop their advance. This comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues well into its third month of fighting. Vladimir Putin ’s forces found their original attempts to seize the capital of Kyiv unsuccessful and eventually pulled back from the city. They retreated and regrouped their forces in the east of Ukraine in an effort to take the east of the country in what Volodymyr Zelensky dubbed the “Battle for the Donbas”. When Russian troops retreated from the Kyiv Oblast in their wake they left evidence of atrocities their forces committed in Bucha where the bodies of civilians littered the streets. However, now the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence has said that Putin’s forces are now trying to carry out a “big cleaning” to hide evidence of its atrocities. In Mariupol, Ukraine said three mobile crematoriums are said to be in the city, burning the bodies of dead Ukrainian civilians.",14,4.941508288088308,4.467243074798821,0.47426521328948645,16

The Russian President has reportedly left his military officers in ""shock"" with impossible demands as he attempts to get the faltering invasion back on track. The despot is said to have lost patience with his generals as Victory Day celebrations on May 9 quickly approach. It marks the day Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945 at the end of World War II, with Putin having been using the holiday to glorify Russia and himself. It is understood the 69-year-old leader has ordered his battle-weary generals to capture the city of Kryvyi Rih, the birthplace of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Such a symbolic success could be fed into the Kremlin's propaganda machine, papering over the stuttering military campaign. The Russian army has struggled with poor co-ordination, as well as out-dated equipment and severe dips in morale while facing a driven Ukrainian defence with a clear shared goal - and modern weapons from NATO. It has seen Moscow troops fail to take capital Kyiv before retreating to focus on the east - though now that front is failing to make much headway. A senior EU source told Mujtaba Rahman, a managing director at the Eurasia Group, that Putin had ""now taken day-to day-control of the conflict"", reports the Daily Express. His new key target - Kryvyi Rih - is Ukraine's second largest city by area with a population of around one million. Social media user ""UOI"", a frequent commentator on events in Ukraine, wrote: ""Putin is demanding that Dvornikov take Kryvyi Rih, Zelensky's homeland, by May 9. ""We are told from communication interceptions that Russian officers are simply in shock. ""They have losses of 400 soldiers a day killed and wounded, and their equipment keeps breaking down."" It comes after General Aleksandr Dvornikov was put in charge of the invasion last month, charged with taking the entire Donbas region in the east. But the Ukrainians are refusing to back down, despite having vastly inferior numbers. Through tactical retreats, counterstrikes and guerrilla warfare, they have been able to inflict heavy casualties on the invading troops. The head of Moscow's army narrowly escaped with his life over the weekend after being caught in artillery fire near Izyum. General Valery Gerasimov had only taken over command of the Izyum axis days earlier. Russian forces are seeking to push south towards Slovyansk. Defending forces, however, targeted the Russian HQ in the area, killing multiple officers, including General Andrey Simonov, a commander of electronic warfare forces of the West district. Gerasimov managed to escape the attack with minor legs injuries, according to former Internal Affairs minister Arsen Avakov. Veteran officer Victor Kovalenko tweeted: ""Yesterday's Ukraine attack on the Rus. HQ in Izium was designed to liquidate the high-value target - chief of Gen. Staff of RAF Gen. Valeriy Gerasimov. ""The Kremlin sent him to get a victory for the May 9 parade. Gerasimov was close to the blast but wounded. ""Gen. Gerasimov suffered a minor shrapnel wound to his right shin without breaking a bone."" Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs, added: ""We received confirmation of yesterday's explosion in Izium (Eastern Ukraine) near the Russian headquarters. ""It is known that Russian Head of General Staff Gerasimov was there to lead the attack on Sloviansk.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov could also take the opportunity to strike and grab power amid the chaos, they added. The agent also indicated that losing the ""Battle for Donbas"" would add to instability in Russia and could lead to a coup or even further territorial loss. The Kremlin has launched its latest attack in the eastern territories of Ukraine with Vladimir Putin battling to take control of the entire Donbas region. But Ukraine continues to put up fierce resistance and is currently slowing down Russian troops as they advance from the east. In a letter to a Russian human rights campaigner Vladimir Osechkin, the agent predicted that Putin's army will fail in achieving its objectives in Donbas. “The current reality leaves the country with two options,"" he wrote. “The first is a total collapse due to the full set of all wrong actions taken together. The second is a civil war.” Ukrainian forces carrying out tactical retreats and launching counterattacks in the Kharkiv region, leading to heavy losses on Russian invaders. The agent added to Mr Osechkin that Kadyrov is fully aware that civil war could break out and is carefully gathering his forces. The insider predicts that the Chechen leader is patiently waiting for the chance to exploit the ensuing political turmoil and carry out his long cherished ambition of creating an ""Emirate of the Caucasus."" He said: ""There is reason to believe that Kadyrov is not only aware of the inevitability of a civil war in Russia, but is actively playing along the lines of a potential split. ""Kadyrov himself does not care about Ukraine, the Donbas, and this entire war. He has gone beyond these limits, he is already thinking in a different reality."" As many as 12,000 troops have been send from the Chechen Republic to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, according to Russian state TV. But these fighters were not Kadyrov's elite forces but simply ""Chechen volunteers"" including law enforcement workers, the agent claimed to Mr Osechkin. He also predicted that Kadyrov will become ""the main beneficiary of the military failure of the Russian Armed Forces"". Describing the upcoming conflict as a ""Donbas meat grinder"", the FSB insider said that Kadyrov is ""guaranteed to keep his forces intact"". While the rest of Russian forces will be ""heavily drained and exhausted"" in any outcome of the battle. He continued: ""In general, Kadyrov cannot but realise that after the Donbas battle, he will retain the most powerful and combat-ready military force in the country. ""But then a big turmoil can begin, in which everything will be incomprehensible. ""By all indications, Kadyrov, like no one else, is preparing for this particular point, everything else is informational tinsel, designed to hide his true plans."" The insider also criticised Putin and accused him of sacrificing everything for the sake of his political ambitions. He wrote: ""The culmination of the Russian problem has now been created personally by Putin, already by the fact that he puts his political demands above any expediency: military, social, economic. We do not have a strategy. ""Two weeks ago, there was hope that the current crisis would force the top leadership of the country to take a responsible step back, assess the situation and look for real solutions to the current situation.

After a 700-mile journey, the thieves were unable to use any farm equipment from the dealership as they had been remotely disabled. The past few weeks have seen growing numbers of reports of Russian troops stealing farm equipment, grain, and even building materials. But the removal of important agricultural equipment from a John Deere dealership in Melitopol is the result of a more organisation operation, with Russian military transport used as part of the heist. According to CNN, the equipment was worth almost £4million taken from an Agrotek dealership in Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since early March. The combine harvesters alone are worth £240,000 each. The process started with the seizure of two combine harvesters, a tractor and a seeder. Over the following few weeks, all 27 pieces of farm machinery were stolen. One of the flat-bed trucks used, and caught on camera, had a white ""Z"" painted on it and seemed to be a military truck. There were rival groups of Russian troops, some of whom would come in the morning, and some in the evening. Some of the machinery was taken to a nearby village, and some of it went overland to Chechyna, over 700 miles away. The high quality of the machinery, equipped with GPS, ensured its travel could be tracked, and it was last located in the village of Zakhan Yurt in Chechnya. The equipment ferried to Chechnya, which included combine harvesters, can also be controlled remotely. The contact told CNN: ""When the invaders drove the stolen harvesters to Chechnya, they realised that they could not even turn them on, because the harvesters were locked remotely."" It now seems to be left in a farm near Grozny, but the contact added that ""it seems that the hiijackers have found consultants in Russia who are trying to bypass the protection"". The contact said: ""Even if they sell harvesters for spare parts, they will earn some money."" Others in Melitopol believe theft by Russian military units has extended to grain captured in silos, in a region producing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of crops a year. Another source said Russian forces were simply taking the grain, adding: ""They steal it, take it to Crimea and that's it."" Last week the mayor of Melitopol posted a video showing a convoy of trucks leaving Melitopol allegedly loaded with grain. The mayor said: ""We have clear evidence that they unloaded grain from the Melitopol city elevator. They robbed the elevator along with private farms.""",14,4.175734472198275,5.584182067056626,-1.4084475948583508,6
2022-05-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/two-russian-workers-die-massive-26850595,Two Russian workers die in huge unexplained gunpowder explosion at bomb factory,"Two employees at a factory building bombs for Vladimir Putin have died in an explosion. The blast erupted yesterday when a product being built at the Perm Powder Factory set alight. The blast killed one worker on the spot before another died from their injuries later Sunday night in hospital. Three more workers were injured, two of them hospitalised, according to RIA.ru. The fire has been confirmed - but not explained - by Russian state media. They wrote: ""In Perm, two people died in an emergency at a gunpowder factory, one victim is in the hospital. ""The enterprise manufactures charges for Grad and Smerch multiple launch rocket systems and air defence systems."" The report says an investigation is currently underway to establish what happened. At the end of March, another military weapons depot containing Putin's shells was bombed by Ukrainian missiles that lead to an explosion which injured at least four. The explosion took place in the city of Belgorod, which sits close to Russia's border with Ukraine. Russian state media reported at the time that Ukraine shelling struck the arsenal causing it to explode. There are at least four injuries although that may be downplaying the severity of the attack. Witnesses said the strike had “presumably” come either “via drone or short range ballistic missile”. Video of the explosion shared to the social media platform shows a huge explosion illuminating the night sky in the distance of the scene being filmed. Russia has previously refused to confess to many of their humiliating defeats on the battleground. In April, a Ukrainian missile tore through Russia's prized Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, killing 40 sailors as it sank. The ship went down in the Black Sea in mid-April after Kyiv said it launched a rocket strike - but the Kremlin repeatedly refused to confirm its destruction. The truth was eventually uncovered by families of the dead and injured sailors - many of whom were left with horrific burns and other major injuries. It remains unclear how many of the crew survived the sinking amid claims the dead may run into the hundreds. Russia has not revealed any information about survivors. Sunday's gunpowder factory explosion could be considered yet another blunder in Putin's poorly executed mission. The tyrant is reportedly facing dissent from senior hardliners among Russia's armed forces and the FSB security services over the ""serious errors"" made during the invasion. It comes as a ""blame game"" plays out in the halls of the Kremlin - with many powerful figures placing the responsibility for the humiliating blunders squarely in the hands of the despot. These hardliners think Putin has not gone far enough in the ongoing war and that he should come down heavier on Ukraine. The powerful ‘soloviki’, the security bloc comprised of conservative and ex-KGB individuals, were previously described by Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of political analysts R.Politik as people who ""dominate the agenda, fuel Putin’s anxieties and provoke and escalate tension"". And now, according to a new report, they blame Putin for the “serious error” of retreating from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, instead of storming it.",17,3.34107908488255,5.501911553774577,-2.160832468892027,16
2022-05-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/fresh-blow-vladimir-putin-loses-26847256,Vladimir Putin's fresh blow as he loses 9th general in Ukraine counter-strike,"A devastating new blow has been dealt to Vladimir Putin with the loss of his ninth general killed during the course of the war in Ukraine. Major-General Andrei Simonov, 55, was killed in battle in Izyum near Kharkov, the country’s second city, according to Ukrainian sources. He was Russia ’s most respected electronics warfare commander, serving with the 2nd Combined Arms Army, and died in a devastating fightback by the Ukrainians against a Russian offensive. More than 30 Russian armoured vehicles were destroyed in the attack along with around 100 Russians troops, unconfirmed reports suggest. As well as losing nine generals, Putin's army has seen 36 colonels slain in little over two months fighting in what military experts say this is an astonishing rate of attrition. Losing senior military members can be a sign that an army is suffering from ill discipline as generals and colonels are required to take control of their forces on the front lines. Putin has now sent his chief of defence staff General Valery Gerasimov to take personal command of the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Sinonov’s death alongside 100 Russian troops - and the reported loss of armoured vehicles - indicates another setback for the Kremlin leader who aimed to declare the success of his mission on 9 May, Victory Day in Russia, marking the anniversary of the end of the Second World War. He is far from the only high profile military man to lose their life in the course of the invasion. Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, one of Putin’s most senior commanders and in charge of the 8th All-Military Army of the Kremlin’s vast Southern Military District, was killed at the beginning of March. So was Colonel Sergei Sukharev, one of Russia's top paratroop commanders and part of the country's most elite fighting squads. While the exact number of people killed during the war is difficult to determine, it is clear that Russia has endured far greater losses than it initially expected. Last week UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace said that 15,000 Russian troops had died so far. The rate of fatalities among the invading army's number is now decreasing as the scope of the offensive is narrowed, a Western official told Reuters. Having failed in an assault on Kyiv in the north of Ukraine last month, Russia is now trying to fully capture two eastern provinces known as the Donbas. ""The nature of the operations have been reduced in terms of geographic spread so the overall numbers are reducing,"" one of the officials said on Russian casualties. ""But the level of casualties that we're seeing in terms of those areas where they are engaging Ukrainian forces are still remaining quite high."" Asked about Ukrainian casualties, he said there had been Ukrainian losses in the Donbas. ""They are taking some losses (but) certainly not at the sort of scale that Russian forces are taking,"" the official said. He added: ""Those losses on Russian forces, we assessed to be having a significant impact on the will to fight of wider Russian forces, but the Ukrainian losses are not affecting the morale of the Ukrainian forces."" Russia, which says it launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, has not updated its official casualty figures in several weeks. Today the UK's Ministry of Defence predicted that a quarter of the battalions Russia sent into Ukraine had been rendered combat ineffective.",14,5.111550804109989,3.8879791254601677,1.223571678649821,11
2022-05-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/brit-prisoners-russia-face-death-26846948,Brit prisoners in Russia could face death penalty for 'crimes against civilians',"Two British soldiers who were detained after fighting in Ukraine have reportedly been told they could face the death penalty. Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were both captured within days of each other while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in the besieged city of Mariupol last month. They have since appeared in separate videos pleading to be swapped for pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk. The prosecutor of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic appeared to be smirking as he told the British fighters of their charges. Both men were told they were charged with crimes against civilians. Prosecutor Andrei Spivak said: “They are charged with a number of crimes against civilians of the Donetsk People’s Republic. “The maximum punishment for these crimes is the death penalty.” Aslin was heard saying he understood the accusations against him but did not agree that he had murdered civilians while fighting for the Ukrainians in Mariupol. It is unlikely these charges could have been brought without Russia's approval. The prosecutor said: ""In the period from approximately December 2018 to April 2022 Shaun Pinner, Aiden John Mark Aslin, and [another foreign fighter] acting deliberately by a group of persons by prior agreement as part of the armed forces of Ukraine, being on the territory of Donetsk People’s Republic [DPR] in a time of war, being armed with firearms, took part in the preparation and military actions against the Armed Forces of the Donetsk People's Republic for the purpose of forcibly seizing and forcibly retaining power on the territory of DPR, violating its constitution, by committing terrorist acts, diversions, explosions, shelling from artillery, mortar, small arms of settlements, peaceful citizens, military of the Armed Forces of DPR, committing murders of the citizens of DPR, threatening of the civilians, who carried out their will during the referendum on May 11, 2014, which resulted in the forming of the state Donetsk People Republic. Do you understand the essence of the charges, do you plead guilty?” Aslin said to the camera: “I understand fully what I am accused offend I agree with it fully up to the part about murdering civilians - I don’t agree with. “I agree with the fact that I fought on the territory of the [DPR], and fought against the soldiers of the [DPR] in peaceful settlements. He admitted using arms and weapons systems alongside other foreigners including Pinner. Pinner also acknowledged that he understood the charges. Neither of the men was seen entering a plea and nor did they react to the threat to use the death penalty as the ultimate punishment. It is unclear if they were told directly about the death penalty because the prosecutor is seen revealing this to the camera. Russia has suspended the use of the death penalty and it has not been used since 1996, although there are moves to use it again. The DPR is a state unrecognised in the world except by Russia. Under International law, it is part of Ukraine. The British men were fighting in an area at the time controlled by Ukraine. Aslin is from Newark, Nottingham, and was already living in Ukraine when the war broke out. In 2018, he joined Ukraine's armed forces as a marine and has since applied for citizenship there. Pinner is from Bedfordshire and a former Royal Anglian soldier. The Brit moved to Ukraine four years ago before joining the Ukrainian marines in hopes of passing over the expertise he picked up while in the British Army.",13,6.976689486294627,4.928003745493382,2.048685740801245,23

Until now the Kremlin despot has called the invasion a “special military operation” but General Sir Richard Barrons, an ex-Commander of Joint Forces Command, said Putin would use Monday’s (May 9) annual Victory Day parade in Moscow to “shift the narrative for the Russian people from a ‘special military operation’. Something that was intended to be short, sharp and decisive, to what is becoming a long, drawn-out, attritional war - and he will probably use the word ‘war’. The Victory Day celebrations mark the Soviets’ triumph over the Nazis in the Second World War. Putin has increasingly used the Red Square occasion to unveil new weapons or equipment. This year, the focus is expected to be on the war in Ukraine. General Sir Richard believed rebranding the conflict would allow Putin to make greater use of young conscripts. “That provides a different legal basis in Russia for hanging onto the current cycle of conscripts and deploying other reserves and taking other measures,” he said. “Essentially, it’s bracing Russia for what will become a long, drawn-out war in Ukraine, which will become more about annexation than anything else.” General Sir Richard predicted a stalemate in the Donbas as Ukrainian and Russian forces do battle. “The most likely outcome is it grinds down into a stalemate and that may cause Russia to stop or if it’s still got plenty of resources I think it will then turn its attention to taking more territory in the south,” he told the BBC. “There is a very stiff fight and it’s inconclusive.

Around 100 civilians were successfully evacuated during a brief ceasefire before Vladimir Putin ’s troops again blocked escape routes out of the ruined city with more shelling. Ukraine ’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said: “The situation has become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe.” National Guard commander Denys Shlega said several hundred civilians remain trapped alongside nearly 500 wounded soldiers and “numerous” dead bodies. He added: “Several dozen small children are still in the bunkers underneath the plant.” There are fears the troops may not be allowed to surrender. During the ceasefire, old women and mums with small children climbed over rubble at the plant before boarding buses. The civilians were driven to Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia, 140 miles north of Mariupol. People who fled Russian-occupied areas say their vehicles were fired at. An escapee at a UN-backed centre in Zaporizhzhia said: “Those without cars can’t leave. They’re desperate.” As many as 100,000 people may still be in Mariupol. Thousands have been killed in the port city which is running out of water, food and medicine. Kyiv claims Russia is guilty of 9,000 war crimes including executions, rapes and abductions. Ukraine’s SBU security service has traced the names of 900 Russian servicemen linked to war crimes against civilians in the Kyiv region. While 100 locals have been identified as “collaborators”. As many as 219 Ukrainian children have been killed and 405 injured during the invasion which began in February, officials say. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky says Moscow is waging “a war of extermination”, adding Russian shelling has hit food and grain warehouses, as well as residential areas in Kharkiv, the Donbas and other regions. A rocket strike in the Black Sea port city of Odesa killed a number of people last night, officials say. Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne quoted military bosses saying the strike had damaged a religious building. Phone calls involving Putin’s soldiers in Kharkiv have been intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence staff, and show troops have been forced at gunpoint to fight against their will. Russia has lost close to 24,000 troops so far. Putin has suffered another major blow as his top man in Ukraine, Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia’s General Staff, has been sent home wounded. Western officials say Russia is advancing slowly in its effort to gain complete control of the Donbas region in the east. Boris Johnson is today set to become the first world leader to give a speech to Ukraine’s parliament since the invasion. Echoing Winston Churchill, he is expected to say via video link: “This is Ukraine’s finest hour.” He is set to announce £300million of defensive military aid for Ukraine. Britain will also send drones that can airlift gear to troops. There are increasing concerns Moscow now has its sights on Moldova, where controlling separatist Transnistria would forge a supply point for the invasion of southern Ukraine.",17,4.62550674835618,3.5630400351064226,1.0624667132497576,26

The Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov had been sent by Putin to take personal control of his push to grab territory in Donbas and eastern Ukraine. The unconfirmed, reports claim is that Gerasimov, 66, was wounded in Izyum in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, which is at the centre of intense fighting. It is the same location Russia ’s ninth general Maj-Gen Andrei Simonov, 55, was killed, according to earlier reports today. An unofficial and unconfirmed Russian source reported that Gerasimov sustained “a shrapnel wound in the upper third of the right leg without a bone fracture. “The shard was removed - there is no danger to life.” Ukrainian government official Anton Gerashchenko claimed the attack on Izyum was “the very place where…Gerasimov, who personally came to lead the attack on Slavyansk, was located”. A “large number” of senior officers were killed, he said. Pro-Ukr Telegram channel Vertikal suggested Gerasimov had been “wounded near Izyum”. “Our source reports that his legs and hips are damaged.” It claimed three of his entourage had been killed and the chief of the general staff was evacuated. Agentstvo media outlet reported that he was flown out of the war zone initially by an Mi-8 military helicopter to Belgorod in western Russia. Separately, a military site in Belgorod region was seen on fire in videos, caused by a suspected Ukrainian attack. Three Ka-52 attack helicopters circled as the Mi-8 transported him and other top brass. Then in Belgorod he boarded a Defence Ministry Tu-154 plane which flew to an unknown destination. Founder of independent Conflict Intelligence Team Ruslan Leviev said an eyewitness at the airport had seen Gerasimov board the plane unaided. ""The source confirms that it was Gerasimov who flew away,” he posted. “But he went on board himself, alive and well."" If true, his wounding even if minor by the Ukrainians is another deep psychological blow to Putin and his faltering war campaign. Gerasimov is in charge of the Russian war campaign alongside defence minister Sergei Shoigu.",14,4.631455539569676,6.736518743858761,-2.1050632042890847,11

The prisoner exchange was carried out on Saturday with seven soldiers and seven civilians coming home, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced. ""Today, we carried out a new exchange of prisoners,"" she wrote in a post on Telegram. ""Fourteen of ours are coming home, seven military and seven civilians. One of the military women is five months pregnant."" She did not say how many Russians had been transferred. The two nations have swapped prisoners several times during the conflict that began with Russia 's invasion on February 24, and on Thursday Ukraine said Russia had handed over 33 soldiers so far. In an interview with the BBC on Friday, Vereshchuk accused Russian forces of deporting large numbers of civilians into Russia and using them as ""hostages."" ""That's why they captured all these hostages - civilians, women, employees of local councils, to try and use them,"" she was quoted as saying. ""We know there are more than a thousand hostages there - including almost 500 women,"" she said, adding that they were being held in prisons and pre-trial detention centres. She said it was particularly difficult to secure the liberation of female prisoners in the exchanges. ""Now we refuse to hold an exchange with no women in the list,"" she added. ""That is how we try to somehow rescue our women and civilians."" There have been widespread reports of sexual violence against Ukrainian women in the months since the invasion began, with girls as young as 14 being targeted by soldiers. One female victim was murdered and branded with a swastika after being ""tortured"" and raped, a politician said in April. The UK government has been accused of ""standing by"" and letting the violence happen, with only up to £60million of the promised £220million in humanitarian aid having been delivered to Ukraine so far.

However, 1,000 civilians are still trapped beneath with some suffering from rotting wounds, as gangrene sets in. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant became the last Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged southern port city. Ukrainian forces defended the site against Russian forces and Putin declared it should be surrounded so “not even a fly comes through”. Russian state media outlets claimed that 25 civilians have been evacuated from the plant yesterday. But the deputy commander of the Ukrainian forces holding out inside, disputed the number, saying it was only 20. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said that 19 adults and six children were brought out but gave no further details. About 100,000 civilians remains in the bombed city which has seen some of the worst Russian air attacks during this war. A church, serving as a shelter for at least a 1,000 people, was bombed, killing hundreds, even though they had written ‘children’ in Russian outside it. Similarly, a maternity and children’s hospital was bombed in the city. At least 1,000 people are still trapped beneath the Soviet-era steel plant according to Ukrainian officials. United Nations workers have continued to try and broker an evacuation from the area. Footage from filmed inside the steel works showed the defiant fighters inside, but also the wounded they were protecting. Unidentified men were covered in stained bandages whilst others had open wounds or amputated limbs. The videos were shared by two Ukrainian women who said their husbands were among the fighters holding fast there. They said there was a skeleton medical staff who were treating at least 600 wounded people and said that some of the wounds were rotting with gangrene. In the video the soldiers said they eat just once a day and share as little as a litre and a half of water among four people as supplies run low. The video also revealed the warren of underground pathways beneath the facility where the Ukrainians are hiding. One wounded man described the injuries he had suffered including two broken ribs, a punctured lung and a dislocated arm that ""was hanging on the flesh"". He added: ""I want to tell everyone who sees this: If you will not stop this here, in Ukraine, it will go further, to Europe."" The fighters are still holding fast as Russian seeks to conquer Mariupol. If Moscow were to take the southern city, it would give it a land bridge between Russian controlled territories in the east of Ukraine and the conquered Crimea peninsula. This would allow it to better resupply troops as Vladimir Putin has recently launched the next stage of his invasion of Ukraine, focusing his troops and resources on the east of the country. This comes after the Kremlin failed to take any of the cities of major urban centres, including the capital Kyiv. Russian troops pulled back from areas in the Kyiv oblast, leaving behind evidence of the atrocities it committed such as in Bucha, where civilians were butchered in the street.

They attacked the soldiers in a field hospital northwest of Bucha, reports state as the barbaric action in Ukraine continue. The fighters, known as Kadyrovtsy, allegedly killed their own comrades and have turned a glass factory into a chilling 'torture chamber'. The deputy commander in Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces spoke to local witnesses on his recent visit to Borodyanka. Artem Hurin reportedly said Kadyrovtsy would 'shoot dead' wounded Russian soldiers on the spot. He was first to visit the town after Vladimir Putin's soldiers retreated last month. Mr Hurin said: ""They would bring heavily wounded Russian soldiers to a big hospital they had there, and those who were very heavily wounded, they would just shoot them. No one other than the Kadyrovtsy did this. ""They didn't allow them to do anything. There they just killed people through binoculars for example. They just shot them."" They had executed people as early as March 5, residents said. The Daily Beast reports that he said he saw evidence of horrifying stories. He claims residents were tortured and raped by lawless Russian troops. The commander says they also 'executed civilians' who were found lifeless on the street. One woman also recalled how she endured four days of torture by one Kadyrovtsy soldier and another from Belarus. They brutally shot her husband in the head, she said. Autopsies have been carried out on mutilated corpses from Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka, The Guardian reports. Many showed signs of torture, with some having bullet holes in the back. Some of the bodies were so badly disfigured investigators have been unable to identify the victim. Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor who carried out the autopsies, told The Guardian : ""We already have a few cases which suggest that these women had been raped before being shot to death. ""We can't give more details as my colleagues are still collecting the data and we still have hundreds of bodies to examine."" He added: ""There are many burnt bodies, and heavily disfigured bodies that are just impossible to identify - the face could be smashed into pieces, you can't put it back together, sometimes there's no head at all.""",13,3.2023257570566988,7.026442409452598,-3.8241166523958996,22

Each year Russia celebrates its triumph over Nazi Germany in 1945 at the end of the Second World War on May 9, and this year it has extra significance. Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what he called a “special operation to de-Nazify” the country and it was widely expected that he wanted to use this year’s celebrations in May to announce a success in that mission. But with Russia having faced stiff resistance from Ukrainians the invasion has not gone to plan and they have been forced to concentrate their attacks on the east of Ukraine having failed to topple Kyiv. This year considerable effort has been put into the victory parade with regular rehearsals using heavy military being taken through the streets of Moscow and St Petersburg in an intended show of strength. State media has been showing the military convoys and on Thursday night there were vast numbers of soldiers marching through Palace Square. It comes as UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said that he would not be surprised if Putin now instead uses the May Day parade to declare a war on the West. Russia’s defence ministry published an interactive map on Friday of the parade which showed 33 marching columns of Russian troops, cadets and members of security agencies, reported the Moscow Times. Armaments on display included T-14 tanks, S-400 air defence systems, rocket launchers and infantry fighting vehicles. The air division showed off 77 aircraft including Tu-22M3 long-range bombers, Su-57 stealth fighters as well as attack and transport helicopters. There are expected to be further rehearsals on May 4 and 7 before the big day for Putin’s regime. This year with Russia facing global isolation, there have been no foreign dignitaries invited. Mr Wallace has said that Putin may declare a war on the West and start “mass” mobilisation of Russians to fight in Ukraine, during the May Day celebrations. He told LBC : “I would not be surprised . . . that he is probably going to declare on May Day that ‘we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people’.” He continued: “Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he's got . . . and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country. We have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.”",14,5.891195979638088,2.220799896800328,3.6703960828377595,25

Chechnya's ruthless warlord leader Ramzan Kadyrov is a longtime and fervent ally of Vladimir Putin and has deployed troops to support the Russian tyrant and his brutal war in Ukraine. According to state media, around 12,000 volunteers from the Russian republic have been recruited to fight for Moscow, the Daily Express reports. In the TikTok clip, the unnamed Chechen commander is heard boasting about his troops' successes on the battlefield against Ukrainian forces. Rating their performance as ""five-plus"", he claims just one member of the unit was injured. But as he finishes his sentence, a shell explodes beside him, clouding the screen with a searing orange glow - and bringing the braggart's broadcast to a sharp halt. Social media users speculated that his mobile phone signal may have made him an easy prey for a targeted missile attack. One wrote: ""That thing was basically giving anyone watching with the right equipment a 10-digit grid to his location. ""He basically called that round in on himself."" The Chechens have a reputation for brutality and have faced repeated accusations of committing war crimes. The war in Ukraine has presented Kadyrov with a perfect opportunity to prove both his loyalty and ongoing usefulness to Putin. The Chechen leader owes his position and power to the Kremlin, which bankrolls his regime. In exchange for ensuring stability in Chechnya, Kadyrov receives huge subsidies from Russia's federal budget. However, in recent years a decline in violence and insecurity in the region has led some inside Putin's administration to question whether Moscow should be sending the Chechen strongman so much money. Kadyrov has proved a useful Kremlin tool in eliminating internal political dissent in Russia over the years. Chechen forces are suspected to be involved in the assassination of the leading opposition figure, Boris Nemstov. His commander in Mariupol Ruslan Geremeyev is believed to have organised the cold blooded shooting of the opposition leader right by the Kremlin walls in 2015. Geremeyev was injured in late March while fighting Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. Last Saturday, the warlord - who is said to be personally leading the devastating blitz on Mariupol - predicted the entire city would fall by Thursday. Russian forces currently control most of the city with the final defences centred around the Azovstal steel plant. Mariupol would be the biggest city to be seized by Russia since invading Ukraine in an attack that has taken longer than some military analysts expected, seen over five million people flee abroad and turned cities to rubble. The last defence in the city is said to be centred on the Azovstal steel plant, along with about 1,000 civilians who are in hiding. Mariupol, once a prosperous seaside city of 400,000, is now a wasteland where corpses lie in the streets as Russia slams the Azovstal steel plant with bunker-buster bombs, the government in Kyiv said.",17,3.9999929114151476,4.8198073606532255,-0.8198144492380779,6

The country's defence ministry claimed to have carried air strikes today that also destroyed 23 vehicles. Officials did not provide specific details on where these targets were, but Ukrainian officials said strikes had been carried out in the south and east of the country. Russia made no mention of an attack on Odesa airport which the local governor said had been hit by a Russian missile, putting the runway out of action. Moscow has turned its focus toward Ukraine's south and east after failing to capture the capital Kyiv in a nine-week assault that has flattened cities, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than five million to flee abroad. Its forces have mostly occupied the eastern port of Mariupol and have captured the town of Kherson in the south. West of Kherson in Odesa, which has so far been relatively unscathed in the war, a Russian missile strike launched from Crimea destroyed the runway at the main airport, said Maksym Marchenko, Odesda's regional governor. ""Thank God no one was hurt. Anti-sabotage measures are being carried out in the region,"" Marchenko said. Ukraine's military said the airport could no longer be used. Earlier Ukraine's military said Russian planes had continued to launch strikes on the besieged city of Mariupol, focusing on the Azovstal steelworks where troops and civilians are sheltering. In a Facebook post, the general staff of the armed forces also said the Ukrainian military had regained control over four settlements in the Kharkiv region.

The team will arrive in Poland next month and support the Ukrainian government as the West builds a case to prosecute Vladimir Putin and his generals in the International Criminal Court. They will include experts in conflict-related sexual violence, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who travelled to the court in The Hague for talks today with its President, said the west must “call out rape as a weapon in war - it’s done to subjugate women, to destroy communities, and we want to see it stopped.” She added: ""We’ve seen appalling war crimes committed, the use of rape and sexual violence. ""We will be sending in a British evidence-collecting team working with Ukrainian authorities, working with the ICC.” It’s understood only four to six experts will be sent at first but more could follow. Officials could not say when or whether they would move on from Poland to Ukraine, for security reasons. Ms Truss rebuffed calls for an additional Nuremberg-style tribunal as called for by many campaigners, saying it might distract from core work. It comes two weeks after Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine were declared war crimes in an interim report ordered by 45 countries. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) said Russia’s attack that killed 300 people sheltering in the Mariupol Theatre was “most likely… an egregious violation” of humanitarian law and “those who ordered or executed it committed a war crime”. It also dismissed Russia 's claims that its attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol was “fake news”, saying the attack “must have been deliberate”. The Foreign Office today said the report “found credible evidence of torture, rape, the killing of civilians and the forced deportation of more than half a million people in Ukraine.” The report only covered up to April 1 so excluded the mass graves discovered in Bucha, an atrocity Boris Johnson said “doesn’t look far short of genocide”. Yesterday Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence issued photos of the ‘despicable ten’ Russian soldiers it accused of taking part in the Bucha massacre. Ukraine today accepted it was taking heavy losses in Russia’s attack on the east of the country - but insisted Russia’s losses were worse. US President Joe Biden called on Congress to send as much as $33bn to help Kyiv withstand the attack. Russia fired two missiles at the capital Kyiv during a visit on Thursday by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres - which Ukraine called an attack on the United Nations itself. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace yesterday warned Putin could declare a new ""war"" on the western world as part of a May 9 Victory Day next week. Mr Wallace told LBC Radio: “I would not be surprised and I don't have any information about this, that he is probably going to declare on this May day that we're now at war with the world's Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people. “Which is actually a pathetic attempt to cover the fact that actually his generals have sent thousands of men to their deaths because of their incompetence and arrogance and his ego.” The Russian President has described his enemies as the West as Nazis. Mr Wallace insisted he was not “rattled” and the “deluded” Russian leader was “outgunned and outnumbered” by Nato forces. He added Britain was doing everything it could to avert a third world war, saying: “I mean, the sabre-rattling is actually quite consistent. “He might use different words, but he's been banging on like that for a good few weeks now. “I think that's what he's teeing up because actually, to mass mobilise the Russian reserves is an admission of failure, you know, from a man who thought he'd get Ukraine in a couple of days. “So he's going to try and link it, I think, with the Second World War.”",13,4.219653194977518,4.191283890909002,0.028369304068515788,22

Last night, there was a direct hit by an aerial bomb on the shelter of the military hospital. ""I can say that the city is beyond the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe. It has been totally erased from the face of the earth. The Ukrainian garrison of Mariupol is holding defence lines at the Azovstal works and on the approaches to it. The rest of the territory is controlled by Russian troops."" He said that there had been continual strikes on the steel works and that tanks and other firearms have been hitting residential buildings from point blank range. Major Volyna said: ""The operation room was completely destroyed, just field conditions, we can no longer operate on the wounded. The situation is critical. Medical support is absent. The conditions in which servicemen and civilians, children and the elderly are trying to survive are simply horrible."" It comes as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres met with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv where they focused in part on evacuating Ukrainian fighters and civilians holed up inside the steel plant. Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed in principle to UN and Red Cross involvement in evacuating the plant during separate talks in Moscow with Guterres on Tuesday. Ukrainian officials worry Russia wants to capture those trapped inside, an allegation Moscow denies. The West believes battles for Mariupol and other eastern and southern areas may determine the war's outcome. Russian forces are now entrenched in the east, where Moscow-backed separatists have held some territory since 2014, and also hold a swathe of the south they seized in March. Ukraine's general staff said Russia was stepping up its military assault in the Donbas. ""The enemy is increasing the pace of the offensive operation. The Russian occupiers are exerting intense fire in almost all directions,"" it said.",17,4.047290732712188,4.771080644271864,-0.7237899115596758,26
2022-04-29,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-declare-new-world-26828251,"Vladimir Putin may declare new world war in days, says UK defence secretary","Vladimir Putin could declare a new world war in the coming days, the UK defence secretary has warned. Ben Wallace said that the Russian leader may start a “mass” mobilisation and use May Day to announce a war on the world’s “Nazis”. Putin started the Russian invasion of its neighbour on February 24 saying that it was a special operation to rid Ukraine of Nazis. Since then Ukrainian cities have been pummelled by shelling in a battle which government minister Liz Truss has said could go on for 10 years. And in the face of the West providing money and armaments to Ukraine, Russia has referred to its nuclear capabilities in threats to not get involved. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the “danger is serious” of a nuclear war. Now Mr Wallace told LBC that Putin having ""failed"" in most of his objectives in the war with Ukraine may declare war on the ""world's Nazis"". He said: “I would not be surprised . . . that he is probably going to declare on May Day that ‘we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people’.” He continued: “Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he's got . . . and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country. We have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.” At the same time around 8,000 British Army troops are to take part in exercises across eastern Europe to combat Russian aggression in one of the largest deployments since the Cold War. Dozens of tanks will be deployed to countries ranging from Finland to North Macedonia this summer under plans that have been enhanced since the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Wallace said the ""show of solidarity and strength"" will see UK service personnel joining with NATO allies and those from the Joint Expeditionary Force alliance, which includes Finland and Sweden, for the exercises. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the action had been long planned, but that it had been enhanced since Russia invaded its neighbour in late February. Aircraft, tanks, artillery and armoured assault vehicles will join the exercises across Europe, with the UK deployment expected to build to a peak of around 8,000 personnel operating between April and June. Commander Field Army Lieutenant General Ralph Wooddisse said: ""The UK makes a significant contribution to the defence of Europe and the deterrence of Russian aggression. The British Army's series of exercises is fundamental to both. ""The scale of the deployment, coupled with the professionalism, training and agility of the British Army, will deter aggression at a scale not seen in Europe this century."" Troops from the Queen's Royal Hussars have been deployed for embedding in an armoured brigade in Finland, which shares an 830 mile land border with Russia. Exercises alongside American troops are also taking place in Poland. Mr Wallace said: ""The security of Europe has never been more important. These exercises will see our troops join forces with allies and partners across Nato and the Joint Expeditionary Force in a show of solidarity and strength in one of the largest shared deployments since the Cold War.""",29,3.9730149163919934,6.422072347398295,-2.4490574310063016,10

Kherson was the first big city to be captured by Vladimir Putin ’s forces following the invasion started on February 24 and it remains in Russian hands despite local protests and counter-attacking from the Ukrainian military. Now the deputy chairman of the region’s administration Kirill Stremousov has reportedly told the news agency RIA-Novosti that the ruble will be introduced during a transition taking four months. During the in-between period both the ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia will be used, he added. In the news bulletin from RIA-Novosti it said that Russia is carrying out a “special operation to denazify and demilitarise Ukraine.” At the same time, Russian forces used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a pro-Ukraine rally in the occupied city of Kherson on Wednesday, Ukraine's Prosecutor General said. Local authorities say Russia appointed its own mayor of Kherson on Tuesday after its troops took over the administration headquarters in the regional capital. Some residents have staged occasional anti-occupation rallies and crowds gathered in the centre again on Wednesday, the date Kyiv had said Russia planned to stage a referendum to create a breakaway region like those in eastern Ukraine. ""During a peaceful pro-Ukrainian rally on Freedom Square in the city of Kherson, servicemen of the Russian armed forces used tear gas and stun grenades against the civilian population,"" the office of Ukraine's Prosecutor General said in a statement. It said it was investigating the incident, and that at least four people were wounded. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the protests, saying in a late night address that: ""I am grateful to everyone who has not given up, who is protesting, who is ignoring the occupiers and showing the marginal people who have become collaborators that there is no future for them"". Shortly afterwards, RIA news agency cited a security source as saying Ukraine had fired three rockets at the city centre but Russian occupying forces shot down two of them. On Tuesday, Russia said it had gained full control of the Kherson region, which is strategically important as it provides part of the land link between the annexed Crimea peninsula and Russian-backed separatist areas in the east. Kherson regional governor Hennadiy Laguta on Tuesday said the occupation meant his administration had no choice but to leave. Thousands of people have fled Kherson to Ukraine-controlled territory, according to the local authorities, who report power and water outages, severe shortages of food and medicines and cellphone network issues in some occupied areas. Footage shared on social media of the protest on Wednesday showed people rushing away from a square filled with drifting smoke. A loud boom rang out and a thick plume of white smoke rose into the air. Coughing could be heard and one person could be seen clasping their hands over their eyes. Two people, who told Reuters they had participated in the rally, said people were waving Ukrainian flags, chanting ""Glory to Ukraine"" and singing the national anthem when a large number of Russian forces turned up. Speaking by phone, former factory worker Ihor, 33, said some of the Russians first fired in the air. ""There wasn't panic until they threw the tear gas grenade,"" said 18-year-old student Mykyta. Both men, who gave only their first names for security reasons, said they had not seen any sign of the planned referendum being held. Ihor said those who remained were ""depressed. People understand that they can't really do anything. The police are everywhere, people are stopped everywhere,"" he said. ""Many Kherson residents are afraid,"" he said. ""All the same, Kherson residents do not give up, they quietly go to rallies. They've hung up flags, blue and yellow ribbons, all in support of Ukraine.""",17,5.247275013124491,5.186586269605956,0.060688743518534594,1

Around 25,000 packets of the emergency contraception medication have already been shipped into the war-torn country by International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). But volunteers are scrambling to gather more. The Russian invasion has seen local supply chains destroyed, amid an increase in sexual assaults. A hotline for rape and sexual assault victims of Russian troops - set up by Unicef - has received 400 calls in just two weeks between April 1 and April 14. Lyudmyla Denisova, the Ombudsman for Human Rights in Ukraine, said the five psychologists who man the phones ""cannot cope with the load"". Children are among those attacked, while in some cases terrified relatives have been forced to watch as their loved ones are assaulted by armed soldiers. As invading troops withdrew from the areas around Kyiv last month - having failed to take the capital - they left a trail of devastation. This included alleged evidence of mass atrocities in towns and villages under siege. Piles of murdered civilians are said to have been found in graves or strewn in the streets, while others have spoken of sex attacks. In Bucha, 25 victims aged 14 to 25 were ‘systematically’ raped while being held captive in a basement. Nine are now pregnant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there had been hundreds of rapes recorded, including of a baby. Russia has denied using rape as a weapon of war. Julie Taft, of IPPF, told the Guardian : ""The timeframe for treating victims of sexual violence is really essential. ""If a woman is seen within five days of an event, then that medication should automatically be given to her."" Taft said the IPPF was also sending medical abortion pills, which can be used up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Joel Mitchell from Paracrew, a humanitarian aid organisation delivering food and medical equipment to Ukraine, told the newspaper the issue mostly affects hospitals in the east, such as Kharkiv and Mariupol. He said: ""As soon as we made contact with hospitals in those regions, we had standing orders for that medication."" It's not clear how many of those receiving such medications are victims of sexual assaults. However, Paracrew volunteer told the Guardian while delivering to a hospital in a town north of Kyiv staff told him there were several rape victims being treated. Meanwhile, postmortem examinations on bodies in mass graves also around Kyiv showed evidence that some women had been raped before being killed by Russian forces, according to reports. Referring to the rape helpline, Ms Denisova told the Daily Mail : ""I asked Unicef to almost double the number of psychologists, to ensure that the care is of good quality and that there is no burnout, including those psychologists who receive such appeals day and night. ""And these cases are very terrible.""",13,5.347568429218412,5.053363735988217,0.2942046932301947,22

Today the Ukrainian Government has published photos and named soldiers they have described as the ""despicable ten"". The Ministry claims that they are part of the 64th brigade, which was honoured by Vladimir Putin for the part it played in Bucha. After Russian troops pulled out of Bucha more than 410 corpses were discovered of civilians, many of them with their hands tied and executed with a bullet to the head. Torture chambers, where men were brutally beaten before being killed, were also discovered, along with the bodies of women and children. The remains have been removed from the town and are being examined by forensic experts preparing to present evidence in future war crimes trials. ""The despicable 10,"" the Ministry of Defence tweeted this afternoon. ""Ten Russian butchers from the 64th brigade have been identified and named suspects responsible for committing Bucha Massacre. ""This unit had been awarded for its atrocities, and returned to the battlefield. Justice for war criminals is inevitable."" Earlier this month Putin awarded an honorary title to the brigade widely thought to be responsible for war crimes and mass killings in Ukraine. Citing “mass heroism and valour” but making no mention of Russia's war in Ukraine, Putin signed a decree honouring the 64th Motorised Infantry Brigade. He did so as a mass funeral for those slaughtered in the Kyiv Oblast town was held by Andrii Holovine, priest of the Church of St. Andrew Pervozvannoho. He had previously said the bodies had been moved to a burial site out of town after reports that the rotten corpses were being feasted upon by dogs in apocalyptic scenes. Last week the Government announced new sanctions against Putin's ""war leaders"", as the Foreign Secretary vowed to crack down on those with ""Ukrainian blood on their hands"". The move will target those ""commanding the front line"" to commit ""heinous"" acts in Ukraine, according to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). The UK is also taking action against individuals outside Putin's military, who are ""actively supporting his illegal invasion"". Meanwhile, the Department for International Trade said the Government has banned imports of caviar and other high-end products from Russia. The import ban is being extended to cover silver and wood products while tariffs on imports of diamonds and rubber from Russia and Belarus are being increased by 35 percentage points. The ""key leaders in Russia's army"" targeted as part of the new wave of sanctions include Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, a commanding officer with involvement in the Bucha massacre, the FCDO said. Also sanctioned by the UK are Colonel General Andrey Serdyukov, commander of airborne forces; Major General Valery Flyustikov, commander of special operations forces; and Colonel General Nikolay Bogdanovsky, first deputy chief of the general staff. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted: ""Today I announce new sanctions on those with Ukrainian blood on their hands including the commander of the unit which occupied Bucha and other individuals and businesses supporting Putin's military. ""We are relentless in support of Ukraine."" The Foreign Secretary accused Russia of deliberately going after civilian targets as she condemned the invasion. ""The depravity of Russia's assault on the people of Ukraine is plain for all to see,"" Ms Truss said. ""They are deliberately targeting hospitals, schools and transport hubs in Mariupol and beyond - just as they did in Chechnya and Syria."" In a statement the FCDO said: ""Since March 10, 2022, Russian bombers have repeatedly dropped munitions on civilian infrastructure, including civil government buildings, hospitals, schools and transportation nodes. ""The UK Government conclusion is that this is intentional targeting based on the types of civilian targets struck, frequency of strikes, volume of munitions and the repeated targeting of the same locations on consecutive days.""",13,5.007960199720448,4.790697204139234,0.21726299558121376,11

One of the missiles struck the lower floors of a residential building, injuring at least three people, Ukrainian officials said. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said the blasts had hit a central part of the city and three people were taken to hospital. Svetlana Vodolaga, press secretary of the State Emergency Service, said the other missile had hit an unnamed facility near the residential building. Both Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said these were Russian missiles. Eyewitnesses had earlier reported the sound of two blasts. Today, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in Kyiv visiting sites that had been destroyed in the conflict. He later gave a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""The day before he was sitting at a long table in the Kremlin, and today explosions are above his head.""

He said: ""As we keep pushing for a full-scale ceasefire, we will also keep striving for immediate practical steps to save lives and reduce human suffering. ""Effective humanitarian corridors. Local cessations of hostilities. Safe passage for civilian and supply routes. ""Today, the people of Mariupol are in desperate need for just such an approach. Mariupol is a crisis within a crisis.

Earlier today, Mr Guterres was seen walking around Kyiv and later shared an image on Twitter with the caption: ""War is evil"". Mr Guterres' visit to Kyiv comes after he sat face to face with Putin in Moscow. Mr Guterres said they discussed ways to provide humanitarian assistance and evacuation of civilians from conflict zones, specifically Mariupol. Mr Guterres also spoke with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about finding ways to come to a ceasefire.

A pro-war Telegram channel called Rybar with almost 400,000 subscribers claimed the 99 men and one woman were part of the “International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine”. It is also known as the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. “On April 5 we said that there were less than 700 people there, excluding employees of PMCs [private military companies],” said a report from the pro-Putin Russian channel. “Now you know their names, dates of birth and ID numbers.” It is unclear where the list came from but Rybar suggests it was obtained via the offices of the governor of Mykolaiv region, Vitaliy Kim. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It is also unclear how authentic it is. The names do not include British fighters Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, recently detained by the Russians in Mariupol. Nor does the list include Scott Sibley, named today as killed in Ukraine. Stooges for the Russian Government have previously insisted Aslin and Pinner were 'mercenaries', however claim has been widely rejected. Former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk, who is now chairman of the Centre for Defence Strategies think tank, said the pair were legitimate members of Ukraine's armed forces. Mr Zagorodnyuk added that there is no “legal mechanism” in Ukraine allowing mercenaries to be recruited. Meanwhile, Russia has used its own mercenaries in the invasion, with 3,000 members of the Wagner Group private military company thought to have died in the conflict, according to Bellingcat. Aslin's brother said he is optimistic Russia will free him after he appeared in a video asking to be part of a prisoner swap. Nathan Wood said the fact the Brit looked unhurt showed Moscow was keen to exchange him for pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, held by Ukraine. Nathan, 25, said: “The Prime Minister is aware Aiden has been taken prisoner of war. It gives us a bit of hope but it is now a waiting game. “There needs to be a positive outcome and now the Russians are talking about him potentially being freed in a prisoner swap, he is hopefully being with humanity. “They have made their demands clear. Hopefully they are treating him like a prince, they don’t want to show him with scratches and bruises because it could harm their chances. “This could all takes, days, weeks, months but the Ukrainian and Russian governments appear to be talking and now we need Britain to offer some support.” An earlier clip showing a bruised and handcuffed Aiden being interviewed has been removed from YouTube following claims he was being interviewed under duress for propaganda. Social care worker Nathan added: “We have to be patient but we feel more confident now that Aiden will be released.” Both Britons had been living in Ukraine before it was invaded and were serving in the Ukrainian marines when they were captured in Mariupol. They have since appeared in separate videos pleading to be swapped for pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk. Aiden was heard saying: “Diane, my wife, I want you to know, I love you. I hope the British Government is able to push this prisoner exchange through so I can return to you and we can build our life in Britain.” Nathan confirmed that the couple are not yet wed but had hoped to marry this summer. His future sister-in-law fled Ukraine and is now safe in another country, thought to be Hungary.",13,5.304731412587191,5.196560310265719,0.10817110232147265,23

Polish and Bulgarian officials have said Moscow is withholding natural gas deliveries after they refused to meet Vladimir Putin ’s demands to pay for it in roubles. The Deputy Prime Minister told Sky News: “We will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Polish friends and allies. “They've said they can deal with this but of course [cutting gas supplies] will have a very damaging effect on Russia as well. “Because it is becoming further and further, more and more not just a political pariah but an economic pariah and that will put the squeeze ultimately on Vladimir Putin. The plans have been labelled as “blackmail” by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Mr Raab also said that Russia’s threat of a “proportional response” to the use of British weapons for Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil would be “unlawful.” He said: “We're entitled, all states are entitled to provide military support to any state exercising the right of lawful defence against an aggressive invasion. “Frankly if Russia starts threatening other countries it only adds further to their pariah status and will only further the solidarity and consensus in the international community that they must be stopped.” Russia’s threats of a “proportional response” came after Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said it was “not necessarily a problem” if Ukrainian airstrikes on Russian infrastructure used British weapons. No specific targets were mentioned, but British diplomats could be at risk if Britain’s Kyiv embassy is attacked. Boris Johnson had announced last week that the embassy would be reopened, “dependent” on the security situation. A Kremlin spokesperson said: “As we have warned, the Russian armed forces are in round-the-clock readiness to launch retaliatory strikes with high-precision long-range weapons at decision-making centres in Kyiv.” The UK’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, is poised to become one of the first diplomats to return. Ukraine’s response to Russia’s brutal invasion has led to massive flames and plumes of smoke overnight in Russian regions near the border. Explosions were heard in the city of Belgorod and an ammunition depot in the province was on fire, but regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said that no civilians had been hurt in the fire. When asked about Ukraine’s chances of victory over Russia, Mr Raab said that the “conflict is in the balance.”",17,5.049618461108147,4.275029525312128,0.774588935796019,29

The teenager, from Bucha, plans to keep the child after doctors warned if she had an abortion now she may not be able to have children again, the report said. Her story has been told by psychologist Oleksandra Kvitko, who workson the ombudswoman's hotline for psychological assistance, with the consent of the victim's parents. The psychologist is said to be working with the young girl to learn how to accept her child. Kvitko now works with five girls between the ages 14-18 who allegedly became pregnant after being raped by Russian soldiers. The youngest victim she works with is only 10. Kvitko told Radio Svoboda : ""Girls aged 14, 15, 16 are often raped. After the war, there will be many pregnant teenagers in Ukraine"". Victims include women, men and young children.

It has dealt a huge blow to Vladimir Putin who lost his 35th colonel in Moscow last week during the Ukraine war. Col Mikhail Nagamov, 41, from the sixth engineer-sapper regiment from the Yaroslavl region, died on April 13 ""while performing a combat mission"" in Ukraine. American officials said the US helped Ukraine target Russian forces by sharing intelligence on when missiles and bombs were intended to strike. ""From the get-go, we leaned pretty heavily forward in sharing both strategic and actionable intelligence with Ukraine. ""It’s been impactful both at a tactical and strategic level. There are examples where you could tell a pretty clear story that this made a major difference,"" one official told NBC News. The agreement was part of a huge, unprecedented intelligence sharing operation with a non-NATO partner. US officials say it has played a crucial role in Ukraine's success so far against a larger and better-equipped Russian military. More than 20,000 troops have already lost their lives to Putin's invasion, according to estimates. Major General Vladimir Frolov, deputy commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army, became the latest general to be laid to rest earlier in another major blow to his war effort. “There has been a lot of real-time intelligence shared in terms of things that could be used for specific targeting of Russian forces,” an ex senior intelligence official told NBC. This includes commercial satellite images and other intelligence such as where certain types of Russian units are active, they added. The publication has agreed to hold back some details about the operation at the request of the US military amid concerns it could help Russia close down important sources of information. Officials said fighters in Ukraine were able to hit a Russian transport plane near Kyiv thanks to coordinates supplied by the US. The strike proved crucial in the battle for the capital as it weakened Putin's troops who were forced to use the road instead of the airfield. Another official told of certain instances where Ukraine was able to move aircraft and air defences just in time. ""The Russian military has literally been cratering empty fields where air defences were once set up,"" they said adding that this has had an ""enormous"" effect on Russia's ground troops. While another claimed that the CIA aims to help protect Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky and is in communication with the country on ""how best to move him around.""

Kyiv was heavily pumelled by Russian shellings during the early stages of the invasion with images showing people huddled in metro systems, while millions of people have fled the country. But ferocious defending of the capital by Ukrainians prevented a quick victory for Vladimir Putin ’s forces as they tried to encircle Kyiv. And at the start of April, Russian troops began to withdraw from northern areas of Ukraine, in what appears to have been a regrouping, before their new attack on the east of the country. With the intensity of bombing having eased on Kyiv, people have been heading back outside to enjoy the spring weather. Parents could be seen in parks and play areas with children in very different scenes to only just a few weeks ago. At the same time foreign leaders have also been to Kyiv to show their support for the country and the relatively reduced threat of shelling. Ukrainian authorities on Tuesday dismantled a huge Soviet-era monument in the centre of Kyiv meant to symbolise friendship between Russia and Ukraine, a response to Moscow's invasion, according to the city's mayor. The eight-metre (27-ft) bronze statue depicted a Ukrainian and Russian worker on a plinth, holding aloft together a Soviet order of friendship. The statue was located underneath a giant titanium 'People's Friendship Arch', erected in 1982 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Union. ""We now see what this ""friendship"" is - destruction of Ukrainian cities ... killing tens of thousands of peaceful people. I am convinced such a monument has an entirely different meaning now,"" Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said. Workmen started by removing one of the two bronze heads, which fell to the ground with a hollow clang. As a crane lifted the monument off its moorings and gradually lowered it to the ground, a crowd of around 100 people cheered and shouted ""Glory to Ukraine"" and other slogans. ""Russia invaded Ukraine ... Can we be friends with Russia? What do you think?

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, launched on Feb. 24, has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than 5 million people to flee abroad.

2022-04-27,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-huge-explosions-rock-russian-26807788,Huge explosions rock Russian cities near Ukraine border in fiery counter attacks,"Massive flames and plumes of smoke have lit up the night's sky with a series of enormous blasts reported across various Russian regions close to the Ukraine border in the early hours of Wednesday. Explosions were heard in the city of Belgorod, said regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov, and an ammunition depot in the province was on fire. The province borders Ukraine's Luhansk, Sumy and Kharkiv regions, all of which have seen heavy fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine two months ago. Gladkov said no civilians had been hurt by the fire which broke out at a facility near Staraya Nelidovka village. He said on Telegram: ""At approximately 03:35 I woke up from a loud bang that sounded like a blast. As I was writing this post, three more blasts were heard. ""According to preliminary information, an ammunition depot is on fire near the village of Staraya Nelidovka.” Russia this month accused Ukraine of attacking a fuel depot in Belgorod with helicopters and opening fire on several villages in the province. Suspected attacks from a more assertive Ukraine were also seen in Voronezh and Kursk regions. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of Russia's Kursk province, which also borders Ukraine, said that explosions had been heard in the city of Kursk early on Wednesday which were most likely the sounds of air defence systems firing. In Kursk there were unconfirmed reports that Russian air defences had downed Ukrainian military drones. Explosions were heard in the cities off Kursk and in Oboyan were locals have said they heard military planes flying overhead. In Voronezh region, there were reports Russian air defences were active to fend off an attack on strategic Baltimore military air base. Ukraine's general staff said in an update early on Wednesday that Russian forces had captured some settlements in the northeast and the east and a Russian assault on Ukrainian forces holding out in the Azovstal steel plant in the southern city of in Mariupol was still going on. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told Russia's foreign minister on Tuesday that he was ready to fully mobilise the organisation's resources to save lives and evacuate people from Mariupol. British military intelligence said Ukraine retained control over most of its air space and Russia had failed to effectively destroy Ukraine's air force or its air defences. Ukrainian authorities on Tuesday dismantled a huge Soviet-era monument in the centre of Kyiv meant to symbolise friendship with Russia, according to the city's mayor. ""We now see what this 'friendship' is - destruction of Ukrainian cities ... killing tens of thousands of peaceful people,"" Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said. It comes as the UK has backed Ukraine if it wants to attack targets on Russian soil. Defence minister James Heappey said it is “entirely legitimate” for Kyiv’s forces to use western-supplied weapons to launch strikes over the border. A large fire erupted in the early hours of April 25 at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk, 100 miles into Russia over the Ukrainian border. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed the risk of a third world war was “considerable”, saying according to his ministry: “I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it. ""NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" Mr Heappey told the BBC that claim was “nonsense and Lavrov knows it”, as weapons have been donated directly by western countries and not by NATO itself.

Defence minister James Heappey said it is “entirely legitimate” for Kyiv’s forces to use western-supplied weapons to launch strikes over the border. It comes after a large fire erupted in the early hours yesterday at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk, 100 miles into Russia over the Ukrainian border. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed the risk of a third world war was “considerable”, saying according to his ministry: “I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that.

Mr Heappey told the BBC that claim was “nonsense and Lavrov knows it”, as weapons have been donated directly by western countries and not by NATO itself. Yesterday Britain announced it will send Stormer armoured vehicles equipped with anti-aircraft rocket launchers to Ukraine . To date the UK has provided more than 5,000 anti tank missiles, five air defence systems with more than 100 missiles, 1,360 anti-structural munitions, and 4.5 tonnes of plastic explosives. Britain has also sent over 90,000 ration packs, 10 pallets of medical equipment, 3,000 pieces of body armour, 77,000 helmets and 3,000 pairs of boots. Asked if the UK would support Ukraine striking targets on Russian soil, Mr Heappey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The question is, is it acceptable for our weapons systems to be used against legitimate Russian military targets by the Ukrainians… “It is entirely legitimate to go after military targets in the depth of your opponents to disrupt their logistics and supply lines. “Just as, to be frank, providing the Russians don’t target civilians which unfortunately they’ve not taken too much regard for thus far, it’s perfectly legitimate for them to be striking targets in Western Ukraine to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines. “That is very much a part of war and the Russians and Ukrainians are quite legitimate in going after those targets.” He also told Times Radio “of course” Britain supports Ukraine hitting targets on Russian soil. He said: “The fact is that Ukraine was a sovereign country that was living peacefully within its owner borders and then another country decided to violate those borders and bring 130,000 troops across into their country. ""That started a war between Ukraine and Russia, and in war Ukraine needs to strike into its opponents depth to attack its logistics lines, its fuel supplies, its ammunition depots, and that's part of it."" He added that it is ""completely legitimate for Ukraine to be targeting in Russia's depth in order to disrupt the logistics that if they weren't disrupted would directly contribute to death and carnage on Ukrainian soil"". He said it is ""not necessarily a problem"" if British-donated weapons are used to hit sites on Russian soil after accepting that weapons now being supplied by allies to Ukraine have the range to be used over borders. ""There are lots of countries around the world that operate kit that they have imported from other countries, when those bits of kit are used we tend not to blame (the country) that manufactured it, you blame the country that fired it.""",14,3.8980498645572523,3.4272382814310065,0.4708115831262458,8
2022-04-26,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/horrifying-images-show-dozens-battered-26797659,Horrific images show dozens of 'battered bodies of Russian soldiers sent to die',"Horrific video footage reported to show dozens of disfigured bodies of dead Russian soldiers who ""have been sent to die"" in the invasion of Ukraine, has been shared online. A Ukrainian YouTuber has put the video on his Telegram channel as he claims to try and show Russians how the battle in Ukraine is really going with the corpses which are being kept in mobile morgues. Russians are used to hearing positive information from the invasion of Ukraine on patriotic state television and are lapping up Vladimir Putin's rhetoric that Russian speaking people in their neighbouring country are being victimised. Putin is saying that the war in Ukraine is a success and so the video is intended to show parents a different story when their sons go off to fight. There are white bags piled close together in the clips, kept in mobile morgues where specialists examine the dead for clues about their identities, so they can be returned later to grieving relatives. In this unit alone, there are 50 corpses, and there are many such “refrigeration wagons” used to preserve Russian servicemen slain in a war started by Putin to “deNazify” Ukraine. “This video is recorded for those who say that there are very few dead, or practically none,” said Ukrainian YouTuber Volodymyr Zolkin on a Telegram channel. “Here you see ... these are the refrigerators, and there are many, many of them. Every day multiple people work with the corpses, with dead Russian army soldiers.” An aim of the broadcast is to reach Russian people to show them the scale of the losses in Ukraine, which have been hidden by a state-controlled media in Moscow. Some scenes include badly dismembered or mutilated bodies from fighting in the war. “Tattoos and notebooks are found which [later] will help relatives identify the dead if they wish to do so,” said Zolkin. So are watches and other personal possessions. “This is one of the refrigerated wagons, with 50 dead. A lot of work is being done with each (body). You will understand what we are talking about if you want to watch the full video, said Zolkin. Estimates suggest Russia has lost as many as 30,000 in the first two months of a war Putin was expected to win within days. He is believed to have lost eight generals and at least 35 colonels among his top brass. The toll also includes some of Russia’s most elite special forces fighters from GRU military intelligence and other services. In other broadcasts, Zorkin has interviewed “pale” and “nervous” captive Russian troops. He asks their permission then seeks “an account of their military background and the events that led to their capture, along with their thoughts on the war”. He said: ""The prisoners are then asked to call their family and friends at home. The reasoning is that the mothers of captured soldiers would listen to what their sons were saying about the truth about the war.” It is necessary to try to counter disinformation about the war from Russian state broadcasters, he added.",13,6.612542217808286,5.174625164533518,1.4379170532747683,21
2022-04-26,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-mariupols-factory-horrors-survivors-26800590,Troops endure amputations in Mariupol's 'gruesome' factory of horrors,"Ukrainian soldiers are running low on anaesthetic for a make-shift clinic inside their country's last outpost in Mariupol. Despite relentless ground and air assaults from the Russian forces, the Ukrainian troops stuck inside the Azovstal steel plant are refusing to surrender. With many of the fearsome Azov Battalion among their number, what's left of the Ukrainian army in the southern port city has managed to launch counteroffensives against the Russians and hold their defensive line despite the overwhelming odds against them. It is unclear how many civilians and soldiers remain alive and within the steel plant, which is owned by the country's richest man Rinat Akhmetov. According to Major Serhiy Volyna of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, who is in Azovstal, 500 soldiers are wounded. He said the situation inside had quickly become ""critical"" and ""tragic"", and many of the wounded were being left to ""rot"" in the basement as supplies of medicine run out. Another army officer, speaking to the New York Times, painted a similarly bleak picture. ""They're taking colossal losses. they won't say how many people are left alive, but they do have more than 500 wounded,"" reporter Michael Shwirtz said. ""One of the troops took a short video of their clinic. It's a gruesome scene with a lot of troops in there with absolutely ghastly injuries. ""They don't have medicines, they're running low on anaesthesia. ""They're having to conduct amputations in really disastrous conditions. It is pretty grim inside. ""They say they want the outside world to help, but there is an acknowledgement there is very little that can be done."" Russian forces attempted to storm the steel plant on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite President Vladimir Putin claiming the complex did not need to be taken last week. Ukraine's armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russians were firing and performing ""offensive operations"" in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting air strikes on civilian infrastructure. Konstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognised as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet TASS on Sunday. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych wrote on Facebook that ""Russian troops are trying to finish off the defenders of Azovstal and more than 1,000 civilians who are hiding at the plant"". Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, with many pro-Russian supporters of the war claiming that troops stuck inside the plant are using human shields. Ukrainian officials have denied Russian claims that a safe route out of the steelworks has been provided. If the defending forces were to surrender, they would be taken as prisoners of war, Russia has claimed. It is unclear what would happen to the civilians stuck inside. Video taken from inside the factory by the Azov Battalion shows a number of children hidden several stories underground. The basement room is filled with the belongings of those living there, who are wrapped in several layers of clothes to keep the cold out. The steel plant has been under constant bombardment for weeks, with Russian ships hammering it with shells from the Azov Sea. Drone footage released at the end of last week shows how badly damaged the vast complex has become. Smoke can be seen rising from the metal work's towers while the shells of gutted out buildings stand in ruin and rubble. Russia’s defence ministry had said on Monday that it would open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the huge Azovstal steel plant where they are holed up with Ukrainian fighters and are under Russian attack. In response on Monday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “Today, the Russian side once again announced the existence of a corridor for civilians to leave Azovstal. This could be believed if the Russians had not destroyed humanitarian corridors many times before. “It is important to understand that a humanitarian corridor opens by the agreement of both sides. A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor.” Separately, Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian forces were continuing to attack the steelworks on Monday. “The enemy continues to attack our defences in the area of the Azovstal plant, using aircraft, artillery … firing with tanks and trying to advance with assault groups, violating the order of their own supreme commander,” Arestovych said in a video address.",17,4.540291846511553,4.771205767442821,-0.23091392093126828,26

The Sukhoi jet was seen spiralling out of control before hitting the ground in a giant fireball. White parachutes of two Russian Su-34 pilots can be seen in the sky after Ukrainian forces struck the jet while on a bombing mission. It is unclear what happened to the pilots, but some reports have suggested they were rescued by a Russian helicopter to prevent the Ukrainians from capturing them. It is thought the jet was shot down near Balakliia, in the Kharkiv region, which is a key railway junction. The footage comes on the same day as reports that Vladimir Putin has launched a new attack on Ukraine after shelling five train stations in the space of an hour. According to the head of Ukrainian Railways, Alexander Kamyshin, the targets in central and western Ukraine were attacked on Monday morning which had caused 16 passenger trains to be delayed. Mr Kamyshin also added the attacks were all coming within an hour of each other, with footage posted to social media showing black smoke rising from the site. He believes Ukrainian railways are being targeted. “Russians keep destroying Ukrainian railway infrastructure,” he said. According to Maksym Kozytskyi, head of the Lviv region, a missile hit an electrical substation at around 8.30am local time, he posted on the Telegram messaging app. Meanwhile, it is not known yet which towns were targeted with Russia not immediately commenting on the claims. Previously, train stations have been targets during the conflict with a Russian missile strike at a station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk earlier this month killing at least 50 people, including children. He said: “There is no information about casualties yet."" A station in Krasne, east of Lviv, is said to be among those hit as further details are to be released. However, the footage showing Putin's plane going down in a ball of flames comes as another blow to the Kremlin chief's war effort. It is as yet unclear how the Ukrainians downed the Su-34 but it is believed to have been a surface-to-air missile. A pro-Ukrainian report said: ""Information from eyewitnesses. Two helicopters flew to the area of the hit plane, and one of them landed twice. ""It looks like they took away pilot killers.""",17,4.090719848434908,3.515215086519156,0.5755047619157523,16

Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey criticised the standard of weapons offered so far. The Labour opposition member said: “What is needed now is no longer old spare weapons from the Soviet era, but new Nato weapons that Ukraine will need for Putin’s next offensive against Odesa or Kyiv.” Mr Wallace said to date more than 2,000 Russian armoured vehicles have been destroyed or captured in Putin's botched initial invasion. This includes at least 530 tanks, 530 armoured personnel carriers and 560 infantry fighter vehicles, as well as more than 60 helicopters and fighter jets, he said. ""The offensive that was supposed to take a maximum of a week has now taken weeks,"" he added. He confirmed British Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles have now been used in the field for three weeks. Mr Wallace reiterated Russia has so far ""failed in nearly every one of its objectives”.

The Druzhba pipeline, operated by Transneft, is the world's longest oil pipeline and one of the biggest oil pipeline networks in the world.

The oil storage depot is likely to be vital for supplying Russia’s troops in their surge to take control of the Donbas. Residents were being evacuated from homes in the vicinity of the burning oil depot. A fire was also reported at the military site, but was not confirmed by the Russian authorities. Russia’s Emergencies Ministry initially posted details of a fire in the areas of the military facility on Moskovsky Ave - then withdrew it. But Telegram channel Voenny Osvedomitel reported that the second fire was presumably at the 120th arsenal of the Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate. Oil storage tanks caught fire at the oil depot in Bryansk, TASS reported early today. ""The Emergency Situations Ministry has confirmed there’s a fire,"" the government’s press office said. ""There’s also a confirmation that it’s the fuel tanks."" First responders were at the scene. The cause of the fire or fires was not initially confirmed. Reports of the blaze come just days after another huge fire at the Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation in Tver. Footage showed the fire at the building on April 21 as a death toll of up to seven was declared. But more recently it has been claimed at least 25 died, believed to include some of Russia ’s leading missile scientists. Two days after the fire, a search was still underway amid the rubble, it was reported. At least five people were rushed to hospital and administered into intensive care. The huge blaze was at the secret Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation in Tver.

Ahead of an expected visit to the capital Kyiv by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the Department of State spokesperson Ned Price told the BBC : “This is going to be a victory for Ukraine; it is going to be a strategic defeat for Russia.” Despite a hoped-for truce over the weekend for Orthodox Easter celebrations, Russian planes continued to drop bombs on the Azovstal steelworks plant in besiegd Mariupol - where the city’s last Ukrainian defenders are holed-up Although Putin’s forces have been strategically moved away from Mariupol for the new focus on the Donbas, units hunkered down inside tunnels underneath the vast plant are still being targeted. Hundreds of civilians are also trapped inside, and will be starved to death, in a plan announced directly by Putin last week. “Naval artillery and cannons are being used, tanks are firing, and there are infantry attempts to storm,” said Svyatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of the Azov regiment, in a video address sent out from the tunnels. While many Ukrainians across the country were celebrating Easter, in Mariupol “the enemy is dropping bombs on the heads of innocent children”, he added. The Azov regiment, along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers, are now the last Ukrainian defenders left in the strategic city on the Sea of Azov coast. Meanwhile, efforts to help up to 100,000 civilians escape the devastated south-eastern city through a humanitarian corridor collapsed once again, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereschuk said. Earlier, she accused Russia of plotting to run its own parallel pathway out of Mariupol that would have conducted citizens to Russian territory. It comes as Ukraine’s President Volodymr Zelensky said that his country would abandon peace talks with Moscow if Russia kills any of Mariupol’s last defenders. He said the same would apply if it held a staged independence referendum in the occupied city of Kherson, as happened in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. The Ukrainian president praised Britain’s efforts in training his military amid accusations the UK blocked requests to strengthen Kyiv’s defences after Russia’s first strike eight years ago.

In a phone call earlier on Saturday, he personally thanked Boris Johnson for Britain providing training on home soil, with Ukraine’s armed forces being taught how to use armoured vehicles that are being given to boost the war effort in eastern Europe. But a former defence secretary accused previous Downing Street operations of being reluctant to support Kyiv in the aftermath of Russian president Vladimir Putin ’s annexing of Crimea in 2014. Michael Fallon claimed that, when serving under former Conservative prime minister David Cameron, he was told to turn down requests for assistance in upgrading Ukraine’s defences despite the Ministry of Defence wanting “to do more”. “We were stymied and we were blocked in Cabinet from sending the Ukrainians the arms they needed,” Mr Fallon said. “Some in the Cabinet felt extremely strongly that we should do nothing to further provoke Russia. I felt that was absurd. The Russians didn’t need any provoking. They were already there, sending people across the border.” Today Russia’s defence ministry said its high-precision missiles struck nine Ukrainian military targets overnight, including four arms depots in the Kharkiv region where artillery weapons were stored. In an Orthodox Easter message President Zelensky vowed that no “wickedness” will destroy the country and prayed that God returns happiness to children and brings solace to grieving mothers. Standing inside one of the country’s best known landmarks, the 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, he declared: “Today, we still believe in the new victory of Ukraine and we are all convinced that we will not be destroyed by any horde or wickedness.

The Ukrainian city has been the focus of Russian aggression in recent weeks, with the Azovstal steel factory now the only area not under the control of invaders. Ukraine has said Vladimir Putin's forces have launched an assault on the plant, where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering - with the Russian leader blocking supplies to starve out those inside. A clip released by Ukraine's Azov regiment shows one woman saying that there are more than 15 children hiding in the room, which has a rabbit warren of tunnels around it. A young boy pleads: ""I want to see the sun because in here it's dim, not like outside. ""When our houses are rebuilt we can live in peace. Let Ukraine win because Ukraine is our native home."" And a girl who said she fled her home in February states: ""We haven't seen the sky or the sun... We want to get out of here very much. ""We want it to be safe for us, so no-one is hurt, and then live in safety."" She added: ""I want to get out… to be in safety. I don't want to risk getting out only to be hit by bomb fragments, for example."" It is believed that many of the families inside the plant had been inside since the Russian invasion commenced. Signs reading 'Children' in red paint are shown on the walls. Moscow has claimed it has taken control of the port city in southern Ukraine. But Ukraine says Russia has been unable to take control of the steelworks, which remains the last stronghold in the battle against Putin's invaders. Russia has made seizing the city a key aim and civilians have endured weeks of bombardment, with a maternity hospital and a theatre sheltering civilians among the buildings destroyed in bombings. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed in an Orthodox Easter message today that no ""wickedness"" will destroy the country and prayed that God returns happiness to children and brings solace to grieving mothers. Standing inside one of the country's best known landmarks, the 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said in a video address that Ukraine will overcome the darkness that the war has brought upon it. ""Today, we still believe in the new victory of Ukraine and we are all convinced that we will not be destroyed by any horde or wickedness,"" Mr Zelenskiy said. ""We are overcoming dark times and on this day I - and most of us - are not in bright clothes, but we are fighting for a luminous idea."" At least 213 children have been killed in the war so far, including a 3-month-old infant in strikes yesterday in the southern city of Odesa, local officials said.

2022-04-23,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-investigates-rumours-british-sas-26781774,Russia investigates rumours of British SAS troops on the ground in Ukraine,"Russia has warned British “mercenaries” that they face death if they remain in Ukraine fighting Vladimir Putin’s troops. The warning was made in a chilling video on social media, as Moscow announced it was launching a formal probe into the alleged role of Britain's SAS on the ground in Lviv. The Investigative Committee [IC] - seen as similar to the FBI in charge of major criminal cases - will examine claims that British “sabotage” experts are on the ground. The claims come following the capture of Britons Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28, by Moscow’s forces after they were caught siding with Kyiv in Donbas. But a new video posted on ""patriotic"" Russian social media channels warns comrades of the two Brits, their fate will be “in the hands of the winners”. “War is not a TV series or a computer game - everything is real here.” “Go home before it’s too late” the clip urges. It highlighted foreign “mercenaries” who faced death as soldiers of fortune. Calling Pinner and Aslin “mercenaries” - who Russian refuses to recognise under the Geneva Conventions - it claimed Britain is trying to spin a false PR story that the pair were “almost Ukrainians” serving as defenders. “But it’s not like that,” said the video which also claimed the SAS was training Ukrainian forces in Kyiv. Today (April 23) the IC announced its probe into alleged reports of British SAS troops in Ukraine, attempting to sabotage the invasion. “The Investigative Committee of Russia will investigate the facts of the activities of British SAS saboteurs in Ukrainian regions,” reported state-controlled news outlet RIA Novosti. The IC claimed that “at least two groups of specialists in sabotage and guerrilla warfare from the British Special Air Service (SAS) have been sent to the Lviv region”. An IC source claimed SAS operatives in Ukraine “are specialists in sabotage and partisan activities, recruiting and training agents to work in hostile territory”. Russia appears to base its investigation on information allegedly received from captured Ukrainian troops. The SAS is “considered one of the most highly qualified in the world in organising coups d'etat, mass protest rallies, contract killings of political figures, recruiting agents, including those in the highest echelons of power, and preparing terrorist attacks”, said the RIA Novosti report. ”This is no ordinary special force - these are intellectuals, in each group there is always an ideologist, you can say a professor, and the rest are particular specialists,” said a Russian law enforcement source. The report claimed that the SAS often work in war zones under cover of medical workers. “With a high degree of probability, these specialists arrived in order to improve the skills and efficiency of the Ukrainian special services in coordinating the activities of sabotage groups in the territories of Ukraine controlled by Russian troops,” said the IC source. The committee is headed by Russia’s top criminal investigator, Alexander Bastrykin, who was a university classmate of Vladimir Putin ’s. The Times reported from Ukraine on April 16 that SAS troops have trained local forces in Kyiv for the first time since the war began.",13,6.37433606314627,5.41538554870247,0.9589505144438002,3

A woman told a local news outlet how she was lucky to survive after she opened up the milk container which was connected to an explosive device that fortunately didn't detonate. Ukrainians have developed a deep mistrust of the invading Russian forces following their attacks on civilians and claims that they have gone as far as to booby trap corpses in northern areas of the country before they withdrew. There has been evidence of torture notably in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, and claims of women being raped. Many Ukrainians in cities under siege are reportedly scared to give themselves up to Russian troops as they fear what will happen to them. The retired woman in Kherson is reported to have taken the booby-trapped milk carton home despite warnings that it is dangerous. More people are resorting to aid packages from the Russians down to desperation. The woman thought that the milk carton looked as though it had been opened, said her son. ""My mother saw that the twist in the milk was not airtight, she thought that someone had already drunk it, that it could be spoiled,"" he told a local news outlet, reported Newsweek. ""She carefully unscrewed it and saw something like a thread, she showed it to me."" While this woman was lucky there have also been reports of Ukrainian civilians dying of food poisoning from aid packages. Russian troops pulled back from northern areas of Ukraine at the start of this month in what was widely seen as a strategy to reorganise before striking again. And now the battle has begun in the east with Ukraine's general staff saying Russian forces aimed to establish full control over the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson regions. A Russian general said on Friday that Moscow wants to take full control over southern Ukraine, which the government of the invaded country says shows that Russia's previous assertions, that it had no territorial ambitions, was a lie. Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to Transnistria, a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west.

Russia has launched what is seen as a second phase of its invasion of the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine after pulling back from its attack on the north which began on February 24. And a Russian general said on Friday that Moscow wants to take full control over southern Ukraine, which the Ukrainian government says shows that Russia's previous assertions, that it had no territorial ambitions, was a lie. But Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is convinced that Ukraine will come out on top in the conflict. ""We are absolutely sure that Ukraine will win in this war and victory will be in (a) very short period,"" Denys Shmyhal told CNN, when asked about Mr Johnson's comment. The UK prime minister had been asked about the possibility of the war dragging on until next year and for Russia to win, which Mr Johnson said was a ""realistic possibility"" during a press conference in India. Mr Johnson said: “The sad thing is that that is a realistic possibility. Of course Putin has a huge army, he has a very difficult political position because he has made a catastrophic blunder. “The only option he now has is to continue to use his appalling, grinding approach, led by artillery, trying to grind the Ukrainians down.” But he added: “I think no matter what military superiority Vladimir Putin may be able to bring to bear in the next few months - and I agree it could be a long period - he will not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people."" At the same time the UK has offered to send tanks to Poland so it can supply its own heavy weaponry to Ukraine for its battle with Russia. The Government has resisted sending its own tanks straight to Ukraine over fears it would escalate tensions with Russia but it is understood that sending equipment to Warsaw is regarded as the quickest way to support Ukraine. The plan would allow Poland to then send on Soviet-era T-72 tanks, which Ukrainian troops are trained to use, to Kyiv. Western allies are also preparing to offer security guarantees to Ukraine so it is ""impregnable"" to a future Russian invasion, the PM revealed. At a press conference in New Delhi today, the Prime Minister said: “We are looking more at what we can do to backfill in countries such as Poland, who may want to send heavier weaponry to help defend the Ukrainians. “We are looking at sending tanks to Poland to help them as they send some of their T72s to Ukraine.” Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said allies were finally delivering the weapons Kyiv had asked for. President Joe Biden said on Thursday he had authorized a further $800 million in military aid for Ukraine, including heavy artillery, ammunition and drones. Canada said on Friday it had provided more heavy artillery to Ukraine. Ukraine's military said Russian forces had increased attacks along the frontline in the east and were attempting an offensive in the Kharkiv region, north of their main target, the Donbas. Ukrainian military commands in the south and east said they had repelled 11 Russian attacks, killing up to 130 soldiers while destroying 12 tanks and 27 other armoured vehicles. Russia's defence ministry said its forces had captured a large arms depot in the Kharkiv region. It also reported hitting dozens of targets in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions on Friday.

The so far unsuccessful war effort has caused appalling losses on Russia’s behalf, with recent claims suggesting Moscow has lost over 30,000 troops since February 24. Since the invasion began, it was reported that Putin has been told there have been 23,655 deaths among troops, and a further 6,902 mercenaries having died. Russia has not come clean on the scale of its war losses, and has hidden the return to the motherland of coffins and funerals. Whilst it began an official death count early on in the invasion, it quickly ended this after a few days. Online source General SVR today claimed that Putin has been told of a total of 30,557 deaths among the armed forces and privately-hired combatants. This claim could not be verified but a number of other estimates put Russia’s death toll at well over 20,000 people. One example of how Moscow avoids confronting the number of dead publicly is its failure to ever confirm how many died on the sinking of the Moskva, its Black Sea Fleet flagship. As the body’s pile up for Russia, the elite of its fighting force continue to be picked off in fighting, amidst reports Ukraine has been targeting majors, generals and other senior staff. A number of elite paratroopers appeared to be buried at a graveyard in the Tver region. As well as that, there are also new graves at a burial site called the Alley of the Paratroopers, in the Stavropol region. At least some of the dead are GRU military intelligence special forces officers, indicated by the flag with a bat and parachute prominently displayed. It reportedly belongs to the 10th Separate Order of Zhukov Special Purpose Brigade. On top of this, the Kremlin has lost eight generals and 35 colonels as its war effort has struggled so far. Among the most recently buried graveyards, flags beside the dead show that those who are dead are among Russia’s most elite and highly trained paratroopers and special forces. GRU Spetnaz officer Major Sergey Kashanskiy, 32, from Siberia, was killed in the ongoing fighting in Ukraine and is one of the latest high-ranking military men Russia has lost. Governor of Krasnoyarsk region Alexander Uss offered his “deepest condolences” to the family. Alongside him two other majors died, adding another blow to Putin’s war effort. Major Sergei Averyanov, 36, commander of an engineering battalion, was announced dead today by Ukraine and this was confirmed by the officer’s relatives in Russia. A VW-fanatic, he had served two tours of duty in Syria before dying in Ukraine. Major Alexander Shepel, 35, battalion commander of the second motorised rifles, was blown up by an anti-tank mine, according to reports. A memorial to him said: “You are our hero, we will not forget. We will not forgive, we love, we mourn ... You are forever in our hearts.” He died in a battle in Popkova village, in Ukraine, say reports.",14,5.736809648578315,6.259245236346654,-0.5224355877683395,11

After moving some troops away from Mariupol - where hundreds of Ukrainian marines are bunkered down in a defiant last stand - the Russian leader is said to be focused on taking total control of the Donbas. The reports come after a senior Ukrainian official said Russian troops were massing in the self-declared republic of Transnistria and preparing to carry out ""provocations"" along the border. Ukraine fears Russian troops in Transnistria - believed to number around 1,300 - could open another front in the war. It comes after Putin savagely ordered his army to seal off all routes out of the vast Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol “so that even a fly cannot pass through”, effectively condemning those inside to their deaths. In a new interview, Captain Svyatoslav Palamar from the Azov Battalion holed up in deep tunnels in the plant insisted: “I always say that as long as we are here, Mariupol remains under control of Ukraine.” He went on: ""All the buildings in the territory of Azovstal are practically destroyed. They drop heavy bombs, bunker-busting bombs which cause huge destruction. We have wounded and dead inside the bunkers. Some civilians remain trapped under the collapsed buildings."" Mariupol's mayor says there are still 100,000 people stuck in the shattered city and their lives are in Putin's hands. Today a photographer who visited Mariupol this week revealed how dead bodies are being “chucked” into craters left by Russian airstrikes. Describing the scenes in the devastated city, Max Clarke said: ""It just keeps getting worse. ""When I first described the situation on the ground, there were bodies in impromptu graves but towards the end there were bodies chucked in craters left by airstrikes. ""I saw one which had 15 bodies chucked in."" Photographs taken today showed members of the Chechen special forces, and Russia's State Duma member Adam Delimkhanov, walking near the Azovstal steelworks. Meanwhile the World Bank has estimated that the physical damage to Ukraine's buildings and infrastructure from Russia's invasion has reached roughly £46bn. According to an official statement from the Kremlin, Russia is now also focusing on securing a land bridge between Ukraine and Crimea, which it seized in 2014. Tonight it emerged that Russian forces took 40 villages in east Ukraine on Thursday. A hospital was hit in the town of Lyman, north-east of Slovyansk, which had been targeted by Russian artillery and rockets overnight. But Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky says these and other gains are only temporary. After a series of catastrophic defeats, British military intelligence has revealed that the Russian military has now resorted to returning inoperable equipment back to base for repair. Ukraine says it remains hopeful for peace despite Russia rejecting a proposed truce this weekend over the Orthodox Christian Easter period.

Orthodox Easter takes place this weekend with Good Friday celebrated on April 22 and Easter Sunday taking place on April 24. In the footage, a Ukrainian drone apparently locates a hidden Russian base with armoured vehicles and crates of ammo in the forest. Ukrainian defenders blast the target and a series of explosions is seen in the tree line as ammo is reportedly detonated by the flames. According to the Ukrainian military, the footage was shot by a drone after it had been used for reconnaissance operations in the area. Earlier this week, the Ukrainian military said that the 30th Mechanized Brigade had attacked a Russian convoy of trucks delivering supplies to invading troops. After the Russian convoy was destroyed in the attack, the Ukrainian brigade said ammo detonated inside the burning vehicles. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin called a ""special military operation"". Today marks the 58th day of the invasion. From February 24 to April 22, the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at 21,200 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 838 battle tanks, 2,162 combat armoured vehicles, 397 artillery systems, 138 MLR systems, 69 anti-aircraft systems, 176 warplanes, 153 helicopters, 1,523 vehicles, 8 vessels, 76 fuel tank trucks, 172 operational-tactical level UAVs, 27 units of special equipment, and four mobile SRBM systems. The United States has provided a large number of Javelin anti-tank missile systems to Ukraine. Russia has also been hit hard by international sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine, with its tank production chain said to be plagued by supply shortages. Meanwhile, Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the UN, has called for a four-day pause in fighting in Ukraine to mark Orthodox Holy Week and allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid and civilian evacuations. He said: ""Humanitarian needs are dire. People do not have food, water, or supplies to treat the sick or wounded or simply to live day-to-day. ""Inspired by the Holy Week, I urge all parties, and all champions of peace around the world, to join my Easter appeal. ""Save lives.

Human Rights Watch researchers yesterday published an extensive report documenting a catalogue of apparent war crimes committed during the occupation of the city. On March 5, Russian forces shot a nine-year-old girl as she was running from the Kremlin's troops with a man, witnesses told HRW. Neighbours took the girl into the basement of a nearby building to try and treat her wound, but she rapidly deteriorated. Victoria, an emergency nurse who was interviewed by HRW, said when she went to the girl she was near death and her arm tissue was dying. She was taken to the hospital to have her arm amputated. Her identity and current condition are not known. The report makes clear they didn't independently verify Victoria's claim, but two other witnesses interviewed by HRW say they witnessed the shooting and observed a massive bloodstain on the pavement where it happened. It is just one of the series of horrific examples of alleged war crimes committed by Putin's forces in Bucha. Human Rights Watch researchers found a catalogue of apparent war crimes committed during the Russian's occupation of the city when they managed to visit from April 4 to 10. The organisation's extensive report detailed evidence of execution, unlawful killings and torture. Richard Weir, a crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: ""Nearly every corner in Bucha is now a crime scene, and it felt like death was everywhere. ""The evidence indicates that Russian forces occupying Bucha showed contempt and disregard for civilian life and the most fundamental principles of the laws of war.” The Russian Defense Ministry has previously denied allegations that its forces killed civilians in Bucha as the report includes harrowing stories from witnesses contracting their claims. Loved ones who were rounded by Russian forces under the pretence they were ""hunting Nazis"" were later found dead in ""streets, in yards, or in basements"" and with ""signs that they had been tortured"". The report added: ""Ukrainian de-mining authorities said they found victim-activated booby traps placed on at least two dead bodies."" On April 15, Bucha’s chief regional prosecutor said that more than over 600 bodies had been found across the Bucha district, but this figure has not been independently verified. One woman told the HRW how she found her husband's body following an alleged execution by troops. Iryna, 48, was at home with her husband, Oleh Abramova, and her father, Volodymyr, when Russian forces started shooting at their house last month. She said her husband begged the soldiers to stop and insisted they were peaceful civilians. Iryna said told HRW: ""The soldiers accused us of killing people in Donbas. “They concluded that we were guilty and should be punished.” While one soldier questioned Iryna, another took Oleh further away out of view. One soldier then told her that ""Oleh will not return"". Minutes later, Volodymyr and Iryna found Oleh's body. She said: ""I saw that he was lying with his face down, and blood was pumping out of his left ear. “The right side of his face was missing, and brain tissue and blood were coming out of his wound.” She added that she saw soldiers standing nearby “watching the event as if they thought it was theatre.” Oleh's body remained in the courtyard for another two days before they could bury him as Russian forces reportedly spent their time cooking in the same place. Iryna also told the HRW she saw the body of a woman lying next to a bicycle near her house not long after her husband was killed. HRW said it is ""most likely the same woman whose death was captured on aerial footage"" and reported in international media. It comes as Putin 's army was ordered to blockade the Mariupol steelworks “so that not even a fly can escape.” Up to 2,000 soldiers and civilians, including many terrified children, are holed up in the plant, which has a series of underground tunnels and basements. They are living in terrible conditions and are running out of food and water. And there are growing fears some of the weak and injured could starve to death. They are desperate to escape, but Putin has slammed the door shut on any planned evacuation.",13,5.779589296276258,5.421493625749751,0.3580956705265077,22
2022-04-21,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/putin-could-still-win-ukraine-26767349,Putin could still 'win' Ukraine war as troops battle in the Donbas,"Western officials believe Russia could still “win” its war in Ukraine - despite seven weeks of military reversals. They admitted Vladimir Putin might be able to claim victory, having reset his aims for the conflict - and could even launch a fresh bid to storm the capital. Forces are fighting in the long-awaited Battle of the Donbas after Kremlin troops began their assault on the breakaway region in eastern Ukraine. They are thought to be better prepared for the attack than for their initial invasion on February 24 - prompting Ukraine’s allies to send fresh waves of arms and equipment to bolster Ukrainian resistance. A Western official said tonight: “Putin has clearly failed in meeting his initial, pre-war objectives but he is still in a position to win.” They added: “The Russians have concentrated sufficient force such that if they were to use it intelligently they might be able to surround and destroy a very significant portion of Ukraine’s armed forces - some of its best forces - and make territorial gains which would then be very difficult to dislodge. “In a really worst case scenario they may be able to look again at whether they could revisit some of their pre-war objectives, potentially renew an attack on Kyiv or to attempt to take Odesa and deprive the rest of Ukraine from access to the sea.” “Any one of those things could certainly be described as a success.” However, Kremlin forces have failed to learn lessons over positioning vehicles in long lines - making them targets for ambushes by Ukrainian fighters. “They have not solved all of their problems - they continue to operate in relatively long convoys on single roads and make themselves vulnerable and in parallel, the Ukrainians continue to fight in a very smart way,” said an official. “While we see some improvement, it is as yet not a force transformed.” Allies are braced to support Ukraine, including by sending weapons, equipment and cash, “for a prolonged period of conflict, through perhaps much of the rest of this year - at least we have to plan for that eventuality”, warned the official.",14,4.829126676663938,4.920582212811523,-0.09145553614758484,29

Four military scientists were reportedly forced to jump out of windows from the burning institute in Tver which develops new space and weapons systems. The blaze was at the Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. Initial reports said the fire started on the second floor of the top secret research institute. The cause was not clear but there were reports of “poisonous bluish-black smoke” and dramatic photos show thick plumes of dark smoke rising from the flames. It was unclear if there were chemical releases before the fire or as a result of the raging inferno. Flames quickly spread throughout the building due to the wooden flooring, reports said. Eyewitnesses report that because of the smoke, people who were in the room could not evacuate and had to jump from the windows. The death toll was first reported as one but has since risen to seven. Just hours after the Ministry of Defence fire, a second huge blaze broke out in one of Russia's biggest chemical plants.

Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has told Vladimir Putin that the southern port city has been taken, news agency Interfax reported this morning. If his claims are true, then Russia will have gained a major strategic advantage, as holding Mariupol would allow Putin's forces sea access and a potential route to Kyiv from the south. It will be the first major city that Putin's men have captured during the war. Shoigu said that 2,000 people remained in the Azovstal plant, a vast steelworks where the Ukrainian forces had gathered, but that they were blockaded in. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky likened the Russian's actions to ""terrorism"" and said that women and children were currently stuck in the steelworks. Russia-backed separatists began advancing into the plant on April 19 with “attack groups formed for storming the facility.” Today Putin ordered the Russian military to cancel plans to storm the Azovstal plant and said he wanted it to continue to be securely blockaded instead. Russia will now attempt to force the remaining troops in the steelworks to surrender by enforcing a complete blockade of the plant. With no chance of supplies getting into Azovstal, those inside will not able to hold out indefinitely. Carefully reading his words to Putin who sat close by across a small desk, Shoigu said: “As of today, all of Mariupol is under the control of the Russian Army. ""The people's militia of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Azovstal plant with the remnants of nationalists and foreign mercenaries is securely blocked.” Putin has said blockaded the plant was preferable to engaging in combat, which he described as ""unreasonable"", and claimed that those who surrender would be given medical help. ""I consider the proposed storming of the industrial zone unnecessary,"" Putin told Shoigu in a televised meeting at the Kremlin. ""I order you to cancel it."" ""There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities. ""Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot not pass through."" Putin claimed that Russian efforts to ""liberate"" Mariupol - which lies in smouldering ruins - had been successful. Shoigu said that the situation in Mariupol was now ""calm"" after Russia evacuated 142,000 civilians to safety. His claims have yet to be independently verified and come after evacuation efforts from the city were widely seen as a failure. Western reports suggested just a few dozen people were able to escape Mariupol yesterday. Yesterday Zelenskiy has said an estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering at the steel works. Today he warned that Ukrainian forces in Azovstal may be able to hold their positions for several hours more. ""The people who are in the factory today and do not allow us to capture this small part of the ruined city are our border guards, the National Guard and the police, there are about a thousand locals, women who are hiding with children who are just afraid to leave, so that the locals who came out were killed by shells,"" he said of the situation in the plant. ""There (in Mariupol) everything was destroyed, 95-98% of all building. There is bombing from planes, artillery and missile damage. And they shoot everywhere, all over the city, and therefore a large number of people - they are afraid to even come out (from the shelters). Zelensky added: ""It's more like not a war, but such a terrorist operation by Russia against Mariupol and the people of this city."" While avoiding a full-out battle at the steelworks may make strategic military sense for the Russians, it robs Putin of being able to make a full and much needed declaration of victory. Over the past week the situation in Mariupol had become increasingly desperate after the Russians concentrated their assault on the south and east of Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers, including the controversial Azov Battalion, remain in the city having previously ignored calls to surrender. Viktor Macha, a Czech industrial photographer who visited the Azovstal steelworks in 2016, believes the Ukrainian forces chose the the plant as a base because of the “badass bomb shelters” built beneath it. Before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the plant employed more than 10,000 people. The city has endured some of the worst tragedies in the course of the war so far. In March a maternity hospital was destroyed by Russian shelling there, claiming the lives of several people including mothers and a child. Despite a large written warning that children were sheltering inside, the Russians bombed a Mariupol theatre, trapping more than a thousand people inside for days and claiming up to 300 lives. In recent weeks the food and medicine situation has become increasingly desperate for those trapped in the city as Russian forces encircled its perimeter. Mariupol, once a prosperous city of 400,000, is now a wasteland where corpses lie in the streets and Russia was hitting the Azovstal steel plant with bunker-buster bombs, the government in Kyiv said. Large black clouds of smoke billowed from there on Wednesday as evacuees queued to get onto buses, some clutching luggage or carrying small pets in their arms. Pensioner Tamara, 64, said she was going to stay with her sister in Zaporizhzhia after leaving the city with her husband, daughter, son-in-law and grandson yesterday. ""It is a pleasure...to leave after this nightmare. We lived in basements for 30 days,"" she said tearfully. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk accused Russian forces of failing to observe a local ceasefire agreement long enough to allow large numbers of people to leave.",17,4.316111519549731,2.989798927174823,1.3263125923749075,26

As Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine continues towards the end of its second month, a statement from an adviser to the Mariupol Mayor accused them of the latest atrocity. The Kremlin’s troops have reportedly built several mass graves near a bypass road in the besieged southern Ukrainian port city, and are dumping bodies packed inside plastic bags into the holes. Petro Andriushchenko shared the statement on Telegram, writing: “Mariupol. Right now. War crimes. After a long search and identification of the mass graves of the dead Mariupol residents, we have revealed the fact of building mass graves for the dead in the village of Manhush. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here “Near a bypass road, the occupiers built several mass graves, up to 30 meters each. They use trucks to deliver the bodies of the dead and simply throw them in bulk.” He claimed the bodies were all stuffed into plastic bags. He added: “This confirms our previous information that they are accumulating the bodies of the dead elsewhere within the industrial area in Mariupol. “This is direct evidence of war crimes and their attempts to hide them.” It is the latest reminder of the kind of atrocities Russia has committed so far in this war. A US satellite firm similarly identified a mass burial site containing about 200 graves near the same city. Maxar said its images showed the graves were growing in size and that they had begun towards the end of March. Local Ukrainian officials accused Russia of burying slaughtered civilians there. The alleged mass grave is near a village called Manhush, around 12 miles west of Mariupol. Mariupol has seen some of the fiercest fighting of the invasion so far. The city is strategically important and if taken by Russia, would be the first major city to fall and give them a land bridge between Russian controlled territories in the Donbas and Crimea. As things stand Putin’s troops control most of the city, with the remaining Ukrainian forces holed up in a massive iron and steel factory. The Ukrainian forces, led by Major Serhiy Volyna of the 36th Separate, are trapped in the factory with around 500 dead and hundreds of civilians. However Putin told his generals not to storm the factory but “block it so a fly can’t pass”.",17,4.378218396512172,3.232216596921522,1.1460017995906497,26

They are living in terrible conditions and are running out of food and water. And there are growing fears some of the weak and injured could starve to death. They are desperate to escape but Putin has slammed the door shut on any planned evacuation. As well as the 2,000 in the steelworks an estimated 120,000 remain trapped across the city. In a televised meeting, across a small table from his defence minister, Putin said there was “no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities”. Instead, he called for his forces to “block off this industrial area so that not even a fly can escape”. He added it would be “impractical” to storm the huge industrial area - which is four square miles in size. He claimed his decision was being made to safeguard the lives of Russian soldiers. Putin said that Russia would offer the Ukrainian defenders still in the plant the chance to surrender and lay down arms. He said: “The Russian side guarantees their lives and decent treatment in accordance with the relevant international legal acts. “All those who are injured will receive qualified medical assistance.” Putin also hailed Russia’s “liberation” of Mariupol after Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told him Russian forces now controlled the Ukrainian port city apart from the plant. It emerged tonight that more mass graves have been found in a village near Mariupol. City mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said “trenches” had been discovered in the village of Manhush, in the Donetsk region. He claimed Russian forces had been collecting the bodies in trucks and dumping them there. Speaking via video link from an undisclosed location, he said Russian soldiers were “mopping up their crimes”. “This is the second week in a row it’s totally closed. No one is allowed to enter. They are mopping up the place,” he said. “They are hiding the crimes committed by the Russian Federation in Mariupol. “According to our assessments, more than 20,000 civilians have been killed by enemy artillery and missile strikes in the streets of our city. “We also have evidence from municipal services in the city. They’ve seen those bodies in person and now we see those bodies disappearing. “These are war crimes and they are hiding these war crimes.” Mr Boichenko also said there were many incidents where residents had been “tortured and mistreated”. Ukraine ’s deputy prime minister has demanded that Russia allow an immediate humanitarian corridor for civilians to escape the steelworks in Mariupol where many are said to be hiding. Iryna Vereshchuk said: “There are about 1,000 civilians and 500 wounded soldiers there. They all need to be pulled out of Azovstal today.” In a separate development Britain set out 26 new sanctions yesterday targeting Russian military generals responsible for what it called “atrocities” in Ukraine, as well as individuals and businesses supporting the Russian armed forces. The so-called “Butcher of Bucha”, Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, is among them. Omurbekov led a unit that occupied the town, near Kyiv, where hundreds of bodies have since been discovered. He now faces a travel ban and asset freeze along with several fellow commanders. Other supporters of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have also been hit, including Oleg Belozyorov, the chairman of logistics company Russian Railways. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: “The depravity of Russia’s assault on the people of Ukraine is plain for all to see...Today’s new wave of sanctions hits the generals and defence companies that have blood on their hands.”",17,4.081393499861024,4.298709436673155,-0.21731593681213113,26

The Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant describes itself as the largest producer of butyl acetate and industrial solvents in Russia and Eastern Europe. It is also the supplier of a wide range of chemical and petrochemical products in Russia and in the world.

Fighting in the southern port city of Mariupol has been some of the worst of the entire Russian invasion of Ukraine. The city has seen relentless Russian air strikes on a number of civilian targets, including a theatre which sheltered over a thousand people. Now one of the city’s last strongholds, an iron and steel factory, is being subjected to a never-ending barrage of fire but the Ukrainian commander inside has vowed to never give up, The Washington Post reported . The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works is the last holdout of Major Serhiy Volyna of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here His forces have been holding out against Russian troops who vastly outnumber them as they shelter hundreds of civilians and hundreds of injured. In one of his most extensive interviews so far, he has revealed what it is like inside the factory and vowed to never lay down his weapons and keep fighting as long as he received orders. Volyna has fought in Mariupol since the beginning of the Russian invasion and has hundreds of civilians, including women and children, sheltering in the metal works plant - although the exact number varies across reports. Local officials said earlier this week that as many as 1,000 civilians were taking shelter inside. Russia Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had previously told Putin that 2,000 people remained in the plant but were blockaded in by Moscow's forces, as Putin ordered him not to storm the factory but to ""block it off"". The Major described the Russian shelling as “round the clock” but said morale remained high amongst him and his troops. Volyna said Putin’s forces constantly used a mixture of air attacks, artillery both from the land and sea as well as tank and infantry assaults to try and penetrate their defences. He revealed the plant held at least 500 people wounded, including civilians. He said: “It’s in the basement where people just rot. There is no medication,”. The Ukrainian troops and civilians were using an underground system of tunnels that allowed them to keep sheltered from Russian attacks, the Post reported. Volyna described the situation as “tragic” and “critical” as he appealed to US President Joe Biden for help either through military or diplomatic means. The Soviet-era plant is one of the largest metallurgic factories in Europe and stretches over four square miles along the waterfront. Before it became a key battleground in Russia ’s invasion it was the lifeblood of the city’s economy and employed tens of thousands of people. Cut off from the world, Volyna only sleeps for two or three hours a night in a damp basement along with his troops. He said: “We save water together, we support each other, try to help each other as much as possible. Everyone is ready to continue as one.” “We are aware of everything, and we understand everything calmly and we continue to carry out combat missions.” The Russian Ministry of Defence previously issued a deadline for Ukrainians to give up their arms and exit. But Volyna told The Post he refused to trust Russian guarantees of safe passage, and repeat the mistakes of others. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that as many as 20,000 civilians had been killed in Mariupol since the Russian invasion began on February 24. Volyna described the city as “demolished from the face of the earth” with countless dead buried under destroyed houses and buildings. Makeshift graves have been popping up across the city and Volya described the horrors as “beyond basic human comprehension”. The capture of Mariupol would be a significant victory for Putin’s forces who have failed to achieve a number of key objectives so far. Russia failed to take the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and later retreated from around the northern city, refocusing its efforts on the east of Ukraine. On top of that it lost its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva. However, the capture of Mariupol would give the Kremlin a land bridge between the Russian controlled territories of Crimea and the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine.",17,2.7315173889437383,4.031300638881955,-1.299783249938217,26

The top ally of Vladimir Putin said Russian forces will seize the last main stronghold of resistance in the besieged city today after Ukraine proposed talks on evacuating troops and civilians there. Mariupol would be the biggest city to be seized by Russia since invading Ukraine eight weeks ago in an attack that has taken longer than some military analysts expected, seen over five million people flee abroad and turned cities to rubble. The last defence in the city is said to be centred on the Azovstal steel plant, along with about 1,000 civilians who are in hiding. Kadyrov, the head of Russia's republic of Chechnya, whose forces have been fighting in Ukraine, said: ""Before lunchtime, or after lunch, Azovstal will be completely under the control of the forces of the Russian Federation."" A few dozen civilians managed to leave the strategically important southeastern port on Wednesday in a small bus convoy, escaping the fiercest battle of the war. A Ukrainian marine commander, Serhiy Volny, said fighters at the steel works may not be able to hold out for much longer. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering there. Mariupol, once a prosperous seaside city of 400,000, is now a wasteland where corpses lie in the streets as Russia slams the Azovstal steel plant with bunker-buster bombs, the government in Kyiv said. The deputy commander of the Azov Regiment in Mariupol, Svyatoslav Kalamar, said several bunkers under the plant still held about 80-100 civilians each. Black smoke billowed from the plant on Wednesday as evacuees queued to get onto buses. Pensioner Tamara, 64, said she was going to stay with her sister in Zaporizhzhia. She was leaving with her husband, daughter, son-in law and grandson. ""It is a pleasure ... to leave after this nightmare. We lived in basements for 30 days,"" she said tearfully. Ukraine accused Russian forces of failing to observe a local ceasefire agreement long enough to allow large numbers of people to leave. Moscow denies targeting civilians and has blamed Ukraine for the failure of earlier attempts to organise humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol. If Russia captured Mariupol it would link territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014. Kyiv has proposed swapping Russian prisoners of war for safe passage for trapped civilians and soldiers. It was not known if Russia had responded to the offer of special negotiations. Fighters remain holed up in the plant and have ignored an ultimatum by Russia to surrender. Fewer civilians than hoped left on Wednesday. Ukraine said it had so far held off an assault by thousands of Russian troops attempting to advance in what Kyiv calls the Battle of the Donbas, a new campaign to seize two eastern provinces Moscow claims on behalf of separatists. Russia's forces had carried out strikes on dozens of military facilities in eastern Ukraine and had shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter near the village of Koroviy Yar, its defence ministry said. Meanwhile, Putin has said a first test launch on Wednesday of Russia's Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new and long-awaited addition to its nuclear arsenal, would ""provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country.""

Colonel Mikhail Nagamov, 41, was from the sixth engineer-sapper regiment from the Yaroslavl region and died in Ukraine on April 13. It was said the colonel died “while performing a combat mission in Ukraine ” and was reported by his local village of Suslonger in the Russian Republic of Mari El. The commander is now among at least eight generals and 35 colonels who have been killed during Putin's war. Putin's forces continue to suffer heavy losses to their high-ranking officials amid the Kremlin's claim the “special military operation” is going according to plan. The overall Russian losses since the war began on 24 February are believed to be 20,000-plus but Moscow has failed to give accurate figures. Col. Nagamov will be buried tomorrow at the federal military memorial cemetery in Mytishchi, Moscow region. Four days ago it was revealed that Major General Vladimir Frolov, deputy commander of Russia's 8th Combined Arms Army, was killed in Ukraine and buried in St Petersburg. He was the eighth general known to have died in Putin’s campaign in Ukraine. It comes after other deaths of top Russian colonels have reportedly already happened. Six days ago the Mirror wrote that Russia has reportedly lost its 40th high-ranking officer. Lieutenant Colonel Denis Mezhuev, commander of the 1st Guards Motor Rifle Sevastopol Red Banner regiment, died in battle according to reports in both Russia and Ukraine. Another high ranking Russian military officer, Colonel Alexander Bespalov's, was reportedly killed and his body taken back to his home, according to news released on April 9.

His death comes after Ukraine said it had killed Colonel Denis Kurilo, who was commander of the 200th motorised rifle brigade, in fighting near Kharkiv. Earlier this week it was reported Colonel Ivan Grishin was killed amid intense fighting. The commander of the 49th anti-aircraft missile brigade died from abdominal wounds from shrapnel. He was killed in fighting near the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.

2022-04-20,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukrainian-commander-begs-world-help-26758303,Ukrainian commander begs world for help as civilians trapped in steel plant,"Ukrainian soldiers and hundreds of terrified civilians remained holed up in a Mariupol steel works last night as a commander begged for help to save them in what he called “our last address to the world”. Children and pensioners were among those trapped in a basement at the plant, the final site of Ukrainian resistance in the beseiged and battered city. The plea for international evacuation by Major Serhiy Volyna came as there was a partial evacuation of Mariupol during a temporary ceasefire. Elsewhere Moscow upped the ante by claiming to have test-launched its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile – also known as Satan II. Vladimir Putin said the weapon, capable of firing 15 warheads in a single strike, would “provide food for thought” for countries opposing his invasion. Russia also claimed yesterday it had hit 1053 Ukrainian military facilities. And there were reports Putin’s forces had started using “bunker buster” bombs in Mariupol. Despite the ongoing onslaught, Major Volyna vowed his troops would not surrender, but he pleaded for international assistance for the 500 wounded soldiers and hundreds of women and children said to be hiding with them. “This is our last address to the world. It may be our last ever,” he said. “It is possible we have just days or hours left. “We call on world leaders to help us. We urge them to organise an extraction to take us to a third country.” The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - covers four square-miles. Major Voyna declined to say how many Ukrainian troops were left in the vast plant but said they had “good fighting spirit” despite the situation for the injured being “very bad”. He added: “They are in a basement, they are rotting there.” President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the situation across Mariupol was worsening and he was ready to exchange Russian PoWs for the safe passage of civilians and troops. Yesterday’s evacuation effort had limited success according to regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. “People gathered at the meeting points, but few of them got on to the buses,” he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson meanwhile backed calls for YouTube to remove a video of a British prisoner of war Aiden Aslin, captured by the Russians while serving with the Ukrainian marines. MP Robert Jenrick, MP for Newark where Aiden lived before moving to Ukraine, told the Commons his “illegal” treatment by Russia breached the Geneva Convention. He also slammed British filmmaker Graham Phillips, who works for Russian TV, and shot the 44-minute film. It includes a claim Aiden was a mercenary, which his family rubbished as propaganda. Mr Jencrick said at Prime Minister’s Questions: “This is a flagrant breach of the Geneva Convention, that treating any prisoner of war in this manner is illegal.” He added: “Graham Phillips, is in danger of prosecution for war crimes, and any platform, such as YouTube, which hosts propaganda videos of this kind should take them down immediately.” The PM said: “I thoroughly echo the sentiments [Mr Jenrick] has expressed about those who broadcast propaganda.” In the video, Mr Phillips claimed the interview would abide by the convention and YouTube rules. In a statement earlier this week, Aiden’s family blasted Russia’s claims about his status. They said: “In 2018 Aiden moved to Ukraine where he met his girlfriend. Aiden decided to join the Ukrainian marines and has served for nearly four years. “He is not, contrary to the Kremlin’s propaganda, a mercenary or spy. “Aiden was making plans for his future outside the military but, like all Ukrainians, his life was turned upside down by Putin’s invasion.” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres yesterday asked Putin and Mr Zelensky to receive him to discuss peace steps. The UN also said the number of refugees who have fled Ukraine had now exceeded five million. More than half are children.",17,4.759841643615964,4.048420152504571,0.711421491111393,26
2022-04-19,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/lethal-darts-rarely-used-modern-26749257,Lethal darts 'rarely used in modern wars' fired into Ukrainian city by Russia,"Locals in the Ukrainian city of Bucha have told of how their homes were showered with lethal darts, which burst out of artillery shells during Russia's attack on the city last month. The sharp, finned projectiles called fléchettes, which experts have said are rarely seen or used in modern conflict, rained over the city prior to the Russians’ withdrawal late last month. The deadly mini-arrows, which were about three centimetres in length and look like tiny arrows, were found in the streets by Washington Post reports. Local woman Svitlana Chmut told them of how the sharp projectiles embedded themselves into her car and showered down into her garden in the shelling last month, on March 25 or 26. ""If you look closely on the ground around my house, you will find a lot more of them,"" said Ms Chmut, 54. Fléchettes have a lengthy history in war, with a version of them having been dropped from aeroplanes in World War I and used by the US in Vietnam. The arrows are typically packed into shells, which are primed to explode over infantry formations and spit out the fléchettes in a conical pattern. Some versions of such shells have the ability to disperse fléchettes across an area three football fields wide. Ms Chmut said the Russian soldiers had set up artillery positions and parked tanks near her home, though they would move into civilian houses at night. Fléchettes did not pose a danger to people inside buildings. Neil Gibson, a munitions expert at the UK-based Fenix Insights group, said fléchettes are narrowly shaped to achieve aerodynamic stability. The arrows recovered from Chmut's yard likely came from a 122 millimetre 3Sh1 artillery round, he said, which is among a few Russian munitions designed in such a way to carry the projectiles. Major Volodymyr Fito, a spokesperson for Ukrainian land forces command, claimed the Ukrainian military does not use shells with fléchettes. Use of the arrows has been decried by some human rights groups who call them “indiscriminate weapons” which could strike civilians even if they were aimed at military formations. While they were not banned by international conventions, they should “never be used in built-up civilian areas,"" Amnesty International has said. Fléchettes were also generally less useful, Mr Gibson said, because they were mostly appropriate for specific circumstances such as striking troops in the open gathered across a large sea. Ms Chmut has told of the chaos seen in Bucha during Russia ’s failed bid to take the capital. As shelling caused fires all around her hometown, she said acrid smoke and gunpowder overpowered the senses and you could no longer see the sun. Russian troops swarmed the neighbourhood, raiding civilian houses for food, electronics and liquor, while a sniper perched on a construction crane killed several people trying to flee the town.",17,4.763656650902593,4.794910836871079,-0.031254185968485615,17

Russian state TV made the explicit threat after the pair were paraded on Kremlin-controlled television following their capture in ruined Ukrainian city Mariupol. In a blow to their worried families, It was implied they could be jailed in Russia for a number of years. Yesterday captured Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28, made what appeared to be carefully scripted appeals to the PM to arrange an exchange for politician Viktor Medvedchuk, seen as Putin’s longtime man in Ukraine. Dubbed the 'Prince of Darkness', he was arrested by Ukraine after escaping house arrest. In the latest appeal Russia’s state channels described the pair as mercenaries, and not serving members of Ukraine’s army. As a result they do not qualify to be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention, according to the Kremlin, despite their families denying they only fight for money. State broadcaster Rossiya 1 said: “Aiden and Shaun are well aware of how uncertain their future is. Mercenaries may face trial. “It is unknown when they will return to their homeland.” Channel 1 - the country’s largest TV station - told viewers: “The two British mercenaries, who surrendered in Mariupol along with hundreds of Ukrainian troops, called on their Prime Minister Boris Johnson to influence Volodymyr Zelensky to exchange them for opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk. ""Not a single army in the world takes mercenaries prisoner in battle. “They are not covered by the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war, so they can be said to be lucky. “Legally, they are not subject to the Geneva Convention rules on the treatment of prisoners of war, since they are mercenaries who signed a contract to fight for money. “But both Britons admit they are being treated correctly and humanely.” The men are being used to echo false Russian narrative about the war in Ukraine. Channel 1 continued: “Both were shocked by the attitude of the Ukrainian military and the Nazis from the Azov [unit] to the civilian population. ""Aiden Aslin is well aware that Kyiv has been violating peace agreements for eight years and killing Donbas civilians with impunity.” Relatives of the men have called for them not to be classed as ‘mercenaries’. Pinner is a former Royal Anglian soldier and has made clear he considers Ukraine his second country, where he relocated in 2018 and married a local. A statement issued by Pinner’s family said: “Shaun was a well-respected soldier within the British Army serving in the Royal Anglian Regiment for many years. He served in many tours including Northern Ireland and with the United Nations in Bosnia. “In 2018 Shaun decided to relocate to Ukraine to use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military. “Shaun enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country over the last four years. During this time, he met his Ukrainian wife, who is very focused on the humanitarian needs of the country. “He progressed into the Ukrainian Marines as a proud member of his unit.” “We would like to make it clear he is not a volunteer nor a mercenary, but officially serving with the Ukrainian Army in accordance with Ukrainian legislation. “Our family is currently working with the Foreign Office along with the family of Aiden Aslin, who is also being held by the Russian Army to ensure their rights as prisoners of war are upheld according to the Geneva Convention.”",13,5.165587511710049,3.9295896940525585,1.2359978176574904,23

After withdrawing from the north of Ukraine, Russian troops are now believed to be starting a new offensive in the east in what is being called the ""Battle of Donbas"".

Ukrainian officials have called on the United Nations to investigate his alleged illegal deployment of child soldiers’, reports the Daily Star. Human rights organisations claim youngsters are being recruited from patriotic clubs which sprang up in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine, following its 2014 invasion, as part of a campaign to promote the country's culture in Luhansk and Donetsk. They are said to be undergoing military training and could be sent to the frontline against their will. Some have already been thrust into action and died fighting. Badges and insignia of Russian military cadets - who are not supposed to be deployed to war zones - have also been found on battlefields in Ukraine. The Ukrainian parliament commissioner on human rights, Lyudmyla Denisova, said children who participated in the so-called 'patriotic clubs' are being mobilised into illegal weapons formations’. She said: ""They have been doing military training and there have been deaths among these teenagers. ""Now they are promoting the entry into the army of civilians, including children in the temporarily occupied territories. ""In doing so the Russian Federation has violated the laws and customs of war provided by the 1949 Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and the rights of children. ""The recruitment of children is a violation of international law.’’ Russian commanders have shown little regard for international law during the Ukraine conflict. British-born Aiden Aslin, a former care worker from Nottinghamshire who has been captured while fighting to help defend Ukraine, has been cruelly paraded on a Russian TV propaganda broadcast. Aiden’s MP, Robert Jenrick, said: ""I am very concerned for the safety of my constituent. Using images of prisoners of war for propaganda is wrong and in contravention of the Geneva Convention."" The 1949 Geneva Convention, to which Russia was a signatory, specifies that exploitation of prisoners of war for propaganda purposes, be it through political rallies or exposing them on television or social media, is against international law.",14,3.6552272232993728,3.74986485003211,-0.09463762673273735,23

Russia has failed to make the quick inroads into Ukraine that were widely anticipated given the size of its army and the armaments at its disposal during the invasion which began on February 24. Under the inspirational leadership of Volodymyr Zelinsky, Ukrainian forces have fought for every inch of ground which has frustrated Russia’s advancement.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded with the West for greater firepower as Putin's war machine begins a new phase of its bloody invasion with a full-scale offensive to take control of the mostly-Russian speaking Donbas in the east. And now Britain will soon send armoured Stormer High Velocity Missile (HVM) launchers, the Sun reports, with the Ministry of Defence demonstrating them for Ukrainians on Salisbury Plain two weeks ago. It is understood the 13-tonne vehicles can be flown to the war on C-17 transport planes in days. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Dr Alan Mendoza, of security think tank the Henry Jackson Society, told the Sun: “These vehicles are the best kit yet sent to Ukraine and will leave Russian pilots quaking. “The UK is putting Putin on notice that Russian aggression, war crimes, and rocket strikes will no longer be tolerated. The UK should wear Putin’s inevitable angry and overblown reaction to this as a badge of pride.” But Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British troops in Afghanistan, told the paper that UK's major boost to Ukraine's forces risks further angering Moscow, with the threat of retalitation coming in the form of ""cyber attacks, sabotage, assassination or other covert attacks for which his intelligence services have proven capability, including in the UK.” The Stormer is manufactured by BAE Systems, needs just three people to operate it and and uses Starstreak missiles, which can be used to take down low-flying aircraft and leave pilots terrified of attempting low-level attacks. It comes as Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said a ""significant part of the entire Russian army"" was concentrated on an offensive in the east in the mostly-Russian speaking Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have declared two independent republics that have been recognised by Russia. Mr Zelensky has been pleading for Western powers to give him greater firepower to fight back, with Boris Johnson saying on April 7 that he was ""certainly looking at what more military assistance we can give"" amid reports the UK could send armoured vehicles. On the same date, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK was ""stepping up"" the supply of arms, as she joined Nato counterparts in Brussels to hear the demands from Ukraine for more equipment. US President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved 800 million dollars (£610m) in military assistance for Ukraine, including artillery and helicopters, to bolster its defences against the expected Russian offensive in the country's east.

Vladimir Putin 's war machine has commenced its bombardment of the east with chilling footage posted on social media showing the night sky lit-up amid the relentless fresh shelling of cities. Kremlin forces launched their long-anticipated offensive through the east of Ukraine in what is being seen as the second phase of the conflict, beginning from Monday night. Confirming Russia's intent, the Kremlin's defence minister Sergei Shoigu said today its forces are ""methodically carrying out"" plans to ""liberate"" two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Footage on social media appears to show repeated heavy shelling centred in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk while Ukrainian media reported some powerful explosions in the cities of Marinka, Slavyansk and Kramatorsk. Ukrainian officials and media also said explosions were heard in Kharkiv in the northeast of Ukraine, Mykolaiv in the south and Zaporizhzhia in the southeast. The Donbas region has been the aim point of Russia's campaign to destabilise Ukraine since 2014, when Moscow set up separatist ""people's republics"" in Luhansk and Donetsk. Air raid sirens were also going off in main centres near the front line.

There was also fresh fears for Mariupol as Russia launched an offensive against the Azovstal steelworks, said to house the last remaining Ukrainian freedom fighters in the besieged city. Ukraine's top security official, Oleksiy Danilov, said Russian forces attempted to break through Ukrainian defences ""along almost the entire front line of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions"". Shoigu was quoted as saying: ""The plan to liberate the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics is being methodically carried out. ""The United States and Western countries it controls are doing everything to drag out the special military operation asmuch as possible. ""The increasing volume of foreign arms supplies clearly demonstrates their intentions to provoke the Kyiv regime to fight to the last Ukrainian standing."" It comes amid claims by Russia it has hit more than 1,000 targets in Ukraine with missiles and airstrike while on the ground its troops have engaged in street fighting, bringing terror to the Donbas region. Driven back by Ukrainian forces in the north, Russia has refocused its ground offensive in the two eastern provinces known as the Donbas, while launching long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital, Kyiv. Donbas has been the focal point of Russia's campaign to destabilise Ukraine, starting in 2014 when the Kremlin used proxies to set up two separatist ""people's republics"" in the ex-Soviet state. It is also home to much of Ukraine's industrial wealth, including coal and steel. Russia's defence ministry said it had hit hundreds of military targets in Ukraine overnight. At the same time the governor of the Russian province of Belgorod said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces have struck a village near Russia's border with Ukraine, wounding one resident. It was not immediately clear whether the strike on the village of Golovchino that figured in posts by governor Vyacheslav Gladkov on messaging app Telegram was carried out by artillery, mortars, missiles or was an aerial attack. This month, Russia accused Ukraine, which it invaded in late February, of a helicopter attack on a fuel depot in Belgorod, as well as of shelling villages there several times, and firing missiles at an ammunition depot.

The Kremlin leader will want to be able to announce the 'success' of the war by the time the ceremony takes place next month. Russia was compared to ""an oversized North Korea but worse"" on Twitter where clips of the event have been circulating. Thousands of troops took part in the rehearsals along with tanks and military equipment. In a statement, the Russian Defence Ministry said: ""In total, 11,000 military personnel, 131 units of modern weapons and military equipment, and 77 planes and helicopters are involved in the preparations for the parade on Red Square."" Victory Day is celebrated in Russia on May 9 to mark the country's triumph over Nazi Germany in World War 2. It was on this day in 1945 when the Soviet government announced the victory after the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender just after midnight in Berlin. Annual celebrations include a military parade of the Russian Armed Forces at the Red Square in Moscow with the president as the guest of honour and a keynote speech. This year’s celebration will have added significance, as it comes during Russia’s shelling of Ukraine in an attempt to force them into submission. Taking centre stage during rehearsals was an enormous intercontinental missile. The RD-24 missile launcher is said to be a show of force and a reminder of what is at stake as tensions continue to simmer between Russia and the West. It can send up to 10 nuclear warheads to targets in Europe or the United States simultaneously. The rehearsal took place in the village of Alabino near Moscow, according to reports. Students and cadets from military educational institutions of the Ministry of Defence attended the practice, according to Pravda. Security agencies, officers, sergeants and soldiers from forces and military units of the Western Military District were also in attendance, it added. Students from the Nakhimov and Suvorov military schools, the cadet corps, and ""Young Army"" members were said to be among those in training. Typhoon off-road vehicles, T-14 Armata tanks and Kurganets-25 infantry fighting vehicles reportedly featured in the parade rehearsals along with Tornado-G mobile short-range ballistic missile systems. It comes after Ukraine announced that Russia is starting a new offensive in the east of the country with explosions along the front lines and attacks in other regions on Monday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his forces will fight on as Russian troops struck along the eastern front line on Tuesday. The Ukrainian leader called it the ""Battle of the Donbas"" meaning the long-awaited second phase of the war. A ""very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive,"" Zelenskiy said in a video address overnight. ""No matter how many Russian troops they send there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves."" Zelenskiy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, assured Ukrainians their forces could hold off the offensive. ""Believe in our army, it is very strong,"" he said. Meanwhile in the besieged city of Mariupol, Russia gave the last Ukrainian defenders holed up in a giant steel works an ultimatum to surrender by noon or die. ""All who lay down their arms are guaranteed to remain alive,"" the defence ministry said. Russian-backed separatists said the pro-Moscow forces were preparing to storm the Azovstal factory, believed to be the last base of Ukrainian troops who have survived the longest and most brutal siege of the war. Driven back by Ukrainian forces in March from an assault on Kyiv in the north, Russia has poured troops in to the east to regroup for a ground offensive in two provinces known as the Donbas. It has also been launching long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital. Ukrainian media reported explosions, some powerful, along the front line in the Donetsk region, with shelling taking place in Marinka, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.

They launched a massive offensive across a 300-mile front in their attempts to take the eastern province. A couple of towns were lost but tonight it appeared the front was remaining firm and defiant. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai said: “Street fights are taking place.” Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said: “I believe that we will defend the city. We will not give the Russian aggressor a chance to take it.” He said the Russians were advancing from the north, saying: “As far as I know, there is fierce fighting and the Ukrainian forces are rebuffing the enemy well.” President Volodymyr Zelensky warned a “very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive” in the Donbas. He added: “No matter how many Russian soldiers are driven there, we will fight, we will defend ourselves. We will do it every day.” There are now an estimated 70,000 Russian troops massed on the Donbas border. As the battle intensified concerns grew for two Brits, Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28, who were captured while fighting for Ukraine and paraded on Russian TV. They have been taunted by claims they could face the death penalty. Updating MPs, Boris Johnson pledged to “intensify our support for President Zelensky”. Predicting the war will become an artillery conflict, he said it was at a very “perilous” stage. Vowing to send more heavy weapons, he warned: “It is vital now we don’t allow Putin to gain momentum in the Donbas, as he well could.” Earlier, Mr Johnson spoke with US President Joe Biden, French Premier Emmanuel Macron, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and the leaders of the EU, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy, Poland and Romania. During the video call, he spoke of the “critical need” for further military support for Ukraine. A Downing Street spokesman said: “The leaders agreed to work together to find a long-term security solution so that Ukraine could never be attacked in this way again. “They discussed the need to increase pressure with more sanctions, as well as further diplomatic isolation. The allies agreed to work closely together in the weeks and months to come.” President Biden said the US will send more artillery to Ukraine. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said the PM told the Cabinet that President Vladimir Putin was “angered by defeats but determined to claim some sort of victory regardless of the human cost”. A senior national security official told the Cabinet the next phase of the war was likely to be “an attritional conflict that could last several months”. The spokesman added Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told ministers that allies were “expanding military aid to Ukraine and the UK continued to play a leading role”. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is expected to update the Commons on sending fresh supplies this week. Former UK Joint Forces Command chief General Sir Richard Barrons told the Commons Defence Select Committee Putin’s “goals have changed because of the fundamental lack of success in the campaign to date”. He told MPs: “It has become clear he can’t remove, currently, the regime in Kyiv, he’s a very long way away from dismantling the military and he’s still embarked on trying to seize the Donbas.” Ukraine needs heavy artillery from allies, he said. Raising the spectre of a new Cold War, Gen Sir Richard warned: “We are now clearly looking at a confrontation for the rest of this century.” Lieutenant General Lance Landrum, deputy chairman of the military committee at NATO headquarters in Brussels, said allies were sending heavier hardware. “What we’ve seen is a huge fighting spirit from the Ukrainian forces,” he said at the Invictus Games. Russia will not use nuclear arms, its Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted in a TV interview. ­“Conventional weapons only,” he said. Lavrov said the war is entering a new phase, echoing comments from ­Ukraine. He said: “The operation in the east is aimed, as was announced from the very beginning, to fully liberate the Donetsk and Luhansk republics. This ­operation will continue.” Ukraine said the new Russian assault had led to the capture of Kreminna, an administrative centre of 18,000 people in Luhansk. Meanwile, an unnamed European official said Mariupol could fall within days. It came as about 120 civilians living beside steel works in the port city have left via humanitarian corridors, reports quoting Russian state TV said. Four people were killed and 14 injured by Russian strikes in Kharkiv, regional prosecutors said. Russian businessman Oleg Tinkov condemned what he called Moscow’s “crazy war”, saying 90% of his ­countrymen did not support it. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a four-day pause in fighting to allow for safe passage of civilians and humanitarian aid. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny today claimed Russian soldiers had killed a 60-year-old man in Bucha because he shared his last name.",14,2.214169104074264,3.3069802153166847,-1.0928111112424208,28

Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were both captured within days of each other while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in the besieged city of Mariupol. Both men appear to have been paraded on Russian state TV speaking about their captures. Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner are both still being held as their families plead with the Russian military to see them as prisoners of war as opposed to mercenaries. Vladimir Putin 's war machine has commenced its bombardment of eastern Ukraine with chilling footage posted on social media showing the night sky lit up amid the relentless fresh shelling of cities. Kremlin forces launched their long-anticipated offensive through the east of Ukraine in what is being seen as the second phase of the conflict, beginning on Monday night. Footage on social media appears to show repeated heavy shelling centred in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk while Ukrainian media reported some powerful explosions in the cities of Marinka, Slavyansk and Kramatorsk. Here's everything we know about Mr Aslin and Mr Pinner. Mr Aslin is a 28-year-old from Newark, Nottingham, who was already living in Ukraine when the war broke out. In 2018, he joined Ukraine's armed forces as a marine and has since applied for citizenship there. Before the war broke out, he was living in Ukraine with his fiancée and was building a house and a life there. He previously fought alongside the Kurdish YPG against Isis in Syria in 2015 and 2016. The former care worker has dual citizenship. His mum Angela Wood recently told Sky News her son should be treated as a legitimate prisoner of war because he's a Ukrainian marine. It comes after Russian media suggested he was a mercenary - or a soldier for hire. She said: ""They have put him on their TV... he is alive, but they are now accountable. ""He's not a mercenary, he's not a volunteer, he did not go out there in the last month and think 'I'm going to fight, I'm going to get glory'. ""He has been out there four years and he is a legitimate Ukrainian marine."" She added: ""Aiden's fiancée is Ukrainian and his life is there. ""He's a proud Ukrainian citizen, so seeing him called a mercenary is hurtful."" Last week, the Kremlin state broadcasted footage of the Brit with a gash on his forehead, sparking concerns about his treatment in captivity. The Brit was forcibly interviewed by a Russian journalist who asked him various questions about his time in Ukraine. The interviewer asked him ""Tell me, did you kill people?"", with Aiden replying ""I don't know"". He then added: ""I didn't do any fighting."" When asked if he saw how people were killed, Aiden looked off camera before answering 'no'. Mr Pinner is a 48-year-old from Bedfordshire and a former Royal Anglian soldier. The Brit moved to Ukraine four years ago before joining the Ukrainian marines in hopes of passing over the expertise he picked up while in the British Army. His family say he was due to complete his three-year contract in the military by the end of 2022 with future plans to move to a humanitarian role within Ukraine. During a video shown on Russian TV channel, he said: “Hi, I’m Shaun Pinner. I am a citizen of the UK. ""I was captured in Mariupol. I am part of the 36 Brigade First Battalion Ukrainian Marines. “I was fighting in Mariupol for five to six weeks and now I’m in Donetsk People’s Republic.” When asked if he wished to address the British Government and speak directly to Boris Johnson, Mr Pinner added: “Yes, I’d like to appeal to the Government to send me back home. I’d love to see my wife again. ""Mr Boris Johnson. Obviously I’m Shaun Pinner. ""A lot’s gone on over the last five or six weeks that I’m not fully aware of. ""Obviously I understand that Mr Medvedchuk has been detained and we look to exchange myself and Aiden Aslin for Mr Medvedchuk. “Obviously I would really appreciate your help in this matter and pushing this agenda. ""Myself, I’ve been treated well. Fully understand the situation that I’m in. ""We’ve been fed, watered, and that’s all I can really say, but I beg on my behalf and Aiden Aslin’s behalf for help us in an exchange for Mr Medvedchuk.” His family has issued a plea of their own for Mr Pinner to be treated as a prisoner of war as he is a serving Ukrainian soldier. In a statement released by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) on behalf of Mr Pinner’s family, they go into more detail on how he recognises Ukraine as “his adopted country”. They said: “Shaun was a well-respected soldier within the British Army serving in the Royal Anglian Regiment for many years. ""He served in many tours including Northern Ireland and with the United Nations in Bosnia. “He progressed into the Ukrainian Marines as a proud member of his unit. ""At the end of 2022, his three-year contract is due to end and he was planning to enter a humanitarian role within Ukraine. “Our family is working with the Foreign Office along with the family of Aiden Aslin to ensure their rights as prisoners of war are upheld according to the Geneva Convention."" They added: ""Shaun is a funny, much-loved, well-intentioned husband, son, father, brother and friend to many. “Our hearts go out to all those caught up in this horrific conflict.” A Foreign Office source said it was aware of the detention of two British nationals and had been in touch with their families to support them, adding that it was advising against all travel to Ukraine. The Foreign Office called on the Kremlin to treat prisoners humanely. A source from the department condemned ""the exploitation of prisoners of war for political purposes"". Viktor Medvedchuk is a close friend of Putin, who is godfather to his daughter. The pro-Russian Ukrainian politician Mr Medvedchuk appealed in a video released by Ukraine's security service on Monday to be handed over to Moscow in a prisoner swap for Ukrainian forces and civilians trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol. He led the most prominent pro-Russian political coalition, Opposition Platform – For Life until he was arrested and charged with treason in May 2021. The charges he faces relate to alleged sale of military secrets to Russia and exploitation of the natural resources of occupied Crimea. Mr Medvedchuk denies the charges and maintains the arrest was politically motivated. He was under house arrest in Ukraine when Russia invaded on February 24, but escaped and disappeared soon afterwards. He was recaptured by Ukraine’s security service on April 12 and Ukranian President Volodymr Zelensky immediately suggested exchanging him for Ukrainian prisoners.",13,5.129802970163841,6.045767774158843,-0.9159648039950028,23

The soldier was in the trenches as gunfire and explosion raged overhead on the Ukrainian frontline. In the dramatic incident, firing is heard nearby from what is believed to be Russian forces. This is poised to be lifesaving story for generations of Ukrainians to come. Legends tell of soldiers being saved by by Bibles or coins in their pockets. But having your life saved by a mobile phone will be up there for those in a new digital era. And the Ukrainian soldier is likely to keep safe the sometimes annoying modern distraction that saved his life. A video has gone viral where the astonished soldier is seen producing the phone from his clothing and passing it to his fellow fighter as the pair take cover. The case of the mobile phone has bullet lodged in it and hole with a sharp piece of metal sticking out. Russian forces are believed to have fired the ammunition, but there is no detail on what type of phone the fighter was using. Many posters joked online joked about the indestructibility of old-fashioned Nokia phones. No name can be seen on the device but many thought the soldier was saved by a Samsung mobile. One user on social social networking platform Reddit said: ""There’s no way that a smartphone + a thin layer of steel can stop a direct hit from 7.62x39mm at typical firefight range. A user called Visibly thumbled bullet supported this claim. But added: ""Still lucky though. Even a significantly slowed down tumbling bullet can wreak havoc."" A further poster on Reddit said: ""Such a lucky fluke that can change the future, never loose [sic] that phone. ""I have a British half-penny that saved my great grandfather’s life from a sniper, without that penny in his pocket I would not be typing now."" The Mirror told earlier how Vladimir Putin still believes he is winning the battle in Ukraine, despite Russian troops suffering heavy losses. His forces are said to have withdrawn from northern areas of the country, according to the last Western leader to meet with him. Russia has failed to make the quick inroads into Ukraine that were widely anticipated given the size of its army and the armaments at its disposal during the invasion which began on February 24. Under the inspirational leadership of Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian forces have fought for every inch of ground which has frustrated Russia’s advancement. Putin’s troops have withdrawn from large areas of the north of Ukraine, including around Kyiv, while they appear now to be focusing on completing an invasion of the east of the country.

2022-04-19,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/ukraine-war-entering-bitter-new-26745473,"Ukraine war entering bitter new phase set to last 'several months', UK warns","The war in Ukraine is entering an ""attritional"" phase which could last several months, ministers were warned today. Boris Johnson told the weekly Cabinet meeting Ukraine's position remained ""perilous"" - with Russian President Vladimir Putin ""angered by defeats but determined to claim some sort of victory regardless of the human cost"", the Prime Minister’s spokesman said. The Cabinet was briefed by a senior national security official who, according to the PM's spokesman, told them: “Putin was focusing his attention on Donbas region and that the next phase of the war was likely to be an attritional conflict which could last several months. “ Russia would aim to exploit its troop number advantage but Ukraine had already shown this was unlikely to be decisive on its own. “There were some signs Russia had not learned the lessons from previous setbacks in northern Ukraine and there was evidence of troops being committed to the fight in piecemeal fashion. “Reports of poor Russian morale continued, with claims that some soldiers and even units were refusing to fight.” Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told ministers allies were “expanding military aid to Ukraine and the UK continued to play a leading role,” the spokesman said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is expected to update the Commons on sending fresh supplies to the Ukrainians this week. Lieutenant General Lance Landrum, deputy chairman of the military committee at NATO headquarters in Brussels, said allies were sending heavier hardware. “We have seen an increase in heavier type weapons, defensive weapons, to help them in their fight, particularly in the east as the fighting escalates in the east,” he said at the Invictus Games in The Hague. He added: ""What we've seen is a huge fighting spirit from the Ukrainian forces. ""We've seen them be creative, and we've seen innovation and we've seen a lot of courage. ""They know their home terrain and they're fighting for their homes and their own families, and their own citizens. ""I think that that spirit is something that is really unpredictable from an adversary's point. ""I think maybe they were underestimated. There has been some support from outside nations, but the fighting spirit of Ukraine has really saved the day for them, and we are with them as they continue the fight in the east."" Earlier, former UK Joint Forces Command chief General Sir Richard Barron, who briefs MPs later, said Kremlin troops had “learned some lessons from the first 54 days of this war” as Russia launched the Battle of the Donbas. But he added: “Their morale won’t be any stronger from the battering they have had. “The Ukrainians should be very confident, if they are in well-prepared, defensive positions.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned a “very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive,” pledging: “No matter how many Russian soldiers are driven there, we will fight, we will defend ourselves. We will do it every day.” Former UK Joint Forces Command chief General Sir Richard Barrons today told the Commons Defence Select Committee Putin’s “goals have changed because of the fundamental lack of success in the military campaign to date”. He told MPs: “The original objectives were assessed to be to remove the regime in Kyiv, to dismantle the Ukrainian military so that Ukraine represented no military threat at all to Russia and to secure, at least, the full extent of the Donbas. “It has become clear that he can’t remove, currently, the regime in Kyiv, he’s a very long way away from dismantling the military and he’s still embarked on trying to seize the Donbas.” Ukraine needs heavy artillery from Western allies to help it resist invaders, he said. But he predicted a stalemate in the eastern region bordering Russia within weeks. “More likely than not this battle dissolves into some sort of stalemate - nobody has won and nobody has lost and nobody is going anywhere,” he said. “Stalemate may occur by late spring which no-one knows how to unstick. “In those circumstances we will have choices to make but we would be supporting an insurgency, we will be supporting the resistance on what will have become some sort of line of demarcation, where there is a ceasefire or not.” Raising the spectre of a new Cold War between Russia and the West, Gen Sir Richard warned: “We are now clearly looking at a confrontation for the rest of this century, I think, in which we are going to have to stand up for our security, our prosperity and our values in ways we have not had to do for a generation.” But he feared NATO was not ready to intervene in Ukraine, even if Kremlin troops took the capital. “At which point we will have a call to make and that call would be easier if we had made any preparations at all to act in those circumstances at the speed required - and frankly we have not,” he added. “The main reason that we are keen to avoid a war between Russia and NATO is that NATO isn’t ready, and one should be ashamed of that.”",14,2.9464085529583075,3.033074246671849,-0.08666569371354171,4

Well-known journalist Vladimir Solovyov alleged that images and reports about invading troops committing genocide in Ukraine are being shown in the UK to prepare the British public. He claimed the images of tortured and people and destroyed homes and towns were simply to sway public opinion in the UK against Moscow. The BBC's Francis Scarr, who works in the Monitoring department, said the claims were broadcast on the highly-controlled state TV on Monday night. Mr Solovyov tells the guests in the studio: ""It's the perfect option for the West. ""Not America as it would be a pity for them [to be hit in retaliation], but Britain strikes the country which is guilty of genocide, and which is upsetting poor, unhappy Zelensky. ""It also becomes clear that we've taken out a load of British instructors in Ukraine. ""And Britain, which possesses nuclear weapons, strikes us with tactical nukes."" He is asked by a contributor on the show if Britain can do it on its own, without the Americans. Mr Solovyov insisted: ""They have their own nukes. Britain and France have their own nuclear weapons and carrier vehicles for them. You know, hypothetically. ""And for America, it's the perfect option. First, they rid themselves of Britain. ""And then, well we wouldn't be supposed to touch them in retaliation."" He then adds a dig at the British Prime Minister: ""Can anyone understand what's going on in Johnson's head?"" Today, Russian forces tried to push through Ukrainian defences along almost the entire frontline in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, launching what President Volodymyr Zelensky called the ""Battle of the Donbas"". Speaking in his nightly address the Ukrainian president said a ""very large part of the entire Russian army"" is now focused on the offensive. ""No matter how many Russian troops they send there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves."" Zelensky's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, assured Ukrainians their forces could hold off the offensive. ""Believe in our army, it is very strong,"" he said. The coal and steel producing Donbas region has been the focal point of Russia's campaign to destabilise Ukraine since 2014. Ukraine's general staff said Russian forces aimed to establish full control over the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson regions, while intensifying missile strikes in west Ukraine. Russia has also been trying to take full control of the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has been besieged since the war's early days. Tens of thousands of residents have been trapped in the city with no access to food or water and bodies littering the streets. Ukraine believes more than 20,000 civilians have died there. Major Serhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine's 36th marine brigade which is still fighting in Mariupol, appealed for help in a letter to Pope Francis. ""This is what hell looks like on Earth...

Giving evidence to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Christo Grozev, executive director of the Bellingcat investigative website, said 3,000 members of the private military company were thought to have been killed on the battlefield. He said sources within the group - the largest of three mercenary groups involved in the conflict - had told them that the numbers fighting alongside Russian forces had been ""much higher"" than had been expected. They included 200 personnel sent to Kyiv before the conflict in a failed mission to ""scout out and assassinate"" political figures, while a ""large number"" were deployed with convoys which advanced on the capital from Belarus. He said they had also been present in Bucha, where some of the worst evidence of alleged war crimes had been discovered. Mr Grozev said they had been told by one former group member that some chose to fight because they enjoyed killing. ""He said that about 10% to 15% are sociopaths, people who go there just because they want to kill. They are bloodthirsty, they are not just adrenalin junkies,"" he told the committee. Dr Sean McFate, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and professor at the US National Defence University, said the group's brutality in the conflicts such as the Syrian civil war was ""part of their selling point"" as far as Russian president Vladimir Putin was concerned. ""If you look at Bucha and others, there is the same pattern you saw in Syria, where they would interrogate, torture and behead people,"" he said. ""One reason I think it has become one of Putin's weapons of choice is it allows some plausible deniability between excesses on the ground, failures on the ground, and policy."" However Dr McFate said that to date, western countries had not taken the threat of the group very seriously, and had not tracked the movements of its members. ""This has emboldened them (Russia) to use this as a stratagem for national expansion, national interests,"" he said. ""We have not done a good enough job in tracking them. We see them as cheap Hollywood villains, but in fact they are not."" Mr Grozev said that while imposing more sanctions on the group's head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as ""Putin's chef"", would have little impact, it may be more effective targeting individual group members who like to holiday abroad with their families. ""The knowledge that they do is a cause of ridicule about western sanctions because this spreads through the rumour mill,"" he said. ""So stopping all of these people being able to travel internationally, at least to the western world, might be much, much bigger than slapping one more sanction on Prigozhin.""",13,4.119746428181066,4.172927168872089,-0.05318074069102341,29

The besieged port city has been pulverised after seven weeks of near constant shelling, killing around 20,000 residents. Roughly 100,000 are managing to survive with its last-known pocket of resistance fighters holed up in a four-square mile steel plant. Over the weekend Russia gave them until Saturday to give up- a demand which was ignored. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said troops in Mariupol were still fighting despite a Russian demand to surrender by dawn. ""The city still has not fallen,"" he told ABC's ""This Week"" programme, adding that Ukrainian soldiers continue to control some parts of the city. Russia said on Saturday it had control of urban parts of the city, with some Ukrainian fighters remaining in the Azovstal steelworks overlooking the Sea of Azov. Capturing Mariupol, the main port in the southeastern region of Donbas, would be a strategic prize for Russia, connecting territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014. After failing to overcome Ukrainian resistance in the north, the Russian military has refocused its ground offensive on Donbas while maintaining long-distance strikes elsewhere including the capital, Kyiv. About four million Ukrainians have fled the country, cities have been shattered and thousands have died since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24. ""The occupiers will be responsible for everything they did in Ukraine,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on his Telegram account, posting images of destruction he said were akin to the ""terrible times"" of World War Two. Drone footage carried by the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti on Sunday showed mile after mile of shattered buildings in Mariupol. In this morning’s briefing the Ministry of Defence claimed Mariupol’s ongoing resistance is slowing the invader’s advance in the rest of Ukraine. It read: “Russian commanders will be concerned by the time it is taking to subdue Mariupol. “Concerted Ukrainian resistance has severely tested Russian forces and diverted men and materiel, slowing Russia’s advance elsewhere. “The effort to capture Mariupol has come at significant cost to its residents. Large areas of infrastructure have been destroyed whilst the population has suffered significant casualties. “The targeting of populated areas within Mariupol aligns with Russia’s approach to Chechnya in 1999 and Syria in 2016. “This is despite the 24 February 2022 claims of Russia’s Defence Ministry that Russia would neither strike cities nor threaten the Ukrainian population.” It comes as Russia struck with several missiles in the city of Lviv on Monday. The Kremlin has stepped up attacks in the wake of the sinking of its flagship Moskva last week. Russia said on Sunday it had attacked an ammunition plant near Kyiv overnight with precision-guided missiles, the third such strike in as many days. Explosions were also reported in Kramatorsk, the eastern city where rockets earlier this month killed at least 57 people at a train station crowded with civilians trying to evacuate ahead of the Russian offensive.",17,4.299734092804693,4.670172499206402,-0.37043840640170966,25

Ukraine’s secret services captured pro-Kremlin politician and Vladimir Putin ally Medvedchuk after he went AWOL from house arrest three days into the invasion. Dubbed the Prince of Darkness, he is the leader of Ukraine's main opposition party Opposition Platform For Life and has been described as the Russian President's right-hand man over the border. Medvedchuk had 55 homes and 26 cars seized when he was captured by Ukrainians. Russian TV journalist Stanislav Kucher told CNN: ""Medvedchuk is a guy who is considered by a lot of Russians and Ukrainians as a great master of con."" Pinner was previously paraded by state TV after his capture and spoke of the moment he was taken prisoner.

His family said: ""Shaun enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country over the last four years. During this time, he met his Ukrainian wife who is very focussed on the humanitarian needs of the country. “He progressed into the Ukrainian Marines as a proud member of his unit. At the end of 2022 his three year contract is due to end and he was planning to enter a humanitarian role within Ukraine.

2022-04-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-russias-shameless-propaganda-museum-26736608,Inside Russia's shameless propaganda museum detailing NATO's ‘cruelty’,"A shameless propaganda exhibition has opened in Moscow which claims to lay bare NATO 'cruelty' amid the Ukraine invasion. NATO: A Chronicle of Cruelty is live this month at the Museum of Modern History, a short walk from the Kremlin in Russia's capital city. While President Vladimir Putin directs the slaughter of soldiers and terrified citizens across the border in the neighbouring nation, back home his people are told lies and brainwashed to his own ends. No more so than at the exhibit, where juxtaposing images and artefacts are often crammed together in an effort to present NATO, an intergovernmental military alliance between 30 member states, as the aggressors. There are also plenty of shoehorned-in Nazi references relating to Ukraine, the eradication of which Putin had said was one of the driving forces behind the war. Russian military ""trophies"", supposedly from the current invasion, are on display, including an American flag riddled with bullets and a helmet emblazoned with 'SS' - standing for The Schutzstaffel, a major paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler. The display claims the two items were taken from a soldier in the Azov battalion, a union of Ukrainian National Guard. The exhibit is backed by Putin's ministry of defence, the culture ministry and key state news agency Rossiya Segodnya. A display at the start of the exhibit reads: ""NATO is infamous to the modern world as one of history’s most aggressive military-political alliances."" Visitors are told the history of NATO military campaigns in Iraq, Syria, and the former Yugoslavia. There are also images from US nuclear attacks on Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The display fails to clarify that both incidents took place several years before Nato was formed. The exhibition's launch comes on the heels of atrocities in towns and villages around Kyiv, allegedly committed by Russian troops. After weeks of struggling to better defences around the Ukrainian capital, Moscow forces retreated and the attack has now shifted focus to the Donbas border region in the east, as well as strategic port city Mariupol. The hope is that a Russia-occupied land corridor can be forged connecting the Donbas and previously reclaimed Crimea. But invading troops left behind a trail of devastation, including hundreds of massacred civilians, some buried in mass graves and others left strewn in the street in the likes of Bucha. Western leaders have accused the troops of war crimes, something the Kremlin denies. It described such claims as ""monstrous forgery"". Irina Velikanova, the museum’s director, also dismissed suggestions of war crimes, which include rape and torture. She told the Times, it is rather Nato, and in particular the US, that is guilty of ""systemic"" cruelty towards civilians. She cited the Vietnam War. ""Violence and cruelty, in principle, are not characteristic of the Russian people,"" she said, insisting any wrongdoing by Russian soldiers is always swiftly investigated and violations severely punished. Ms Velikanova said the idea for the exhibition came last year, inspired by Putin's demands that Nato withdraw forces from central and eastern Europe and stop its expansion east. He also warned Ukraine must never be offered membership. These demands were refused, and with Putin having always considered Ukraine a part of Russia - despite the country's shift to the west - and seemingly keen to return to some sort of neo-USSR regime, he invaded. Ms Velikanova added: ""We are not a news agency, of course, but we considered it important to organise such an exhibition. ""The topic was very relevant.""",29,4.266917914776679,5.112984500087176,-0.8460665853104974,22

He said: “We can now confirm that Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas, which they have been preparing for a long time. “A large part of the Russian army is now dedicated to this offensive. ""No matter how many Russian soldiers are brought here, we will fight. We will defend ourselves."" His comments came in a video address that followed a number of reports of Russia stepping up its attacks. Zelensky's chief of staff said that the assault on Donbas marked the ""second phase"" of the war. Ukraine's top security official also said that Russian forces had attempted to break through almost the entire frontline in Donetsk, Luhansk and the Kharkiv region. His comments follow warnings from senior officials in Ukraine and the West that Russia was redirecting troops and resources to towards the country’s east. Initially, Russia claimed it was pulling troops out of parts of northern Ukraine, especially around the capital Kyiv, as apart of the ongoing efforts to reach a diplomatic solution. However, it quickly became apparent, Putin and the Kremlin were trying to reorganise their troops and resources after stoic Ukrainian resistance and poor tactics led to their invasion stalling. This led to them focusing their troops in the East of Ukraine, where there is heavy pro-Russian sentiment. And now fighting there, could end up looking like the Second World War, Ukraine's foreign minister has warned. Dmytro Kuleba told NATO allies sent out the terrifying warning in the days before the second wave of attacks begun. Speaking after talks with NATO foreign ministers at the alliance’s Brussels headquarters on April 7, he said: “The Battle for Donbas - and I regret to say it but this is true - will remind of the Second World War with large populations, manoeuvres, involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.” This comes after Western Officials warned that Putin may have looked to double or even triple the number of Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region ahead of the assault. One official told reporters on April 4: “I would imagine that, at outside estimates, what you’re looking at is a force which is probably the Russians looking to double or even treble the amount of force that they bring into that Donbas area. “But I would note that that is going to take some considerable time to bring them up to that sort of number."" So far the conflict has displaced nearly five million Ukrainians and taken tens of thousands of lives. After an initial push to seize Ukraine's cities and urban centres, Moscow pivoted to relentless air attacks and bombings on civilian targets. Only today, Ukrainian offiicals have said at least 17 people have died. This included seven in the western city of Lviv, which had been largely untouched until now.",14,3.9894667153397916,4.668544036865368,-0.6790773215255768,25

The incident reportedly took place in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, one of the spots hit by missiles on Sunday night. The clip captures the woman walking across a road holding what appears to be two bags of shopping, before the missile hits the street ahead of her, causing a fiery explosion and filling the scene with plumes of dark grey smoke. She appears to stop in her tracks, crouching over before popping her head up to see if the carnage is over. A second small explosion to her left causes another burst of flames and a second plume of smoke, covering what was once a rubbish bin. Incredibly, the woman gets up and walks away just seconds later. Two other people in the background can also be seen narrowly avoiding being hit by the explosion, which was reportedly caused by Russian attacks. The footage, which appears to be a clip from a CCTV reel, was shared by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence with the caption: ""Kharkiv. Two months ago, no one in Ukraine could have imagined something like this. ""Now it is becoming commonplace for many Ukrainians."" The video was also shared by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The clip showed a ""strike on a strategic military trash can"", the group said. According to Ukrainian authorities, no one was killed in the footage. Publication of the chilling video comes as fighting in Ukraine shifts to the east of the country, The Sun reports. There have been reports of civilian fatalities overnight, with authorities reporting that six people have so far died and 13 more injured in Kharkiv alone. The victims were said to have included a child. Russia has intensified shelling across Ukraine in recent days, as it enters a new phase of the war with a ramped up bid to achieve its goals. Latest attacks by Russia have focused on major cities including Kyiv and Lviv. Six people have reportedly been killed in Kviv on Monday following a missile strike, which has left eight more people wounded. The Kremlin has come under huge pressure to step up its military advances, following the humiliating sinking of the Moskva flagship in the Black Sea. Vladimir Putin appointed a new general, Aleksandr Dvornikov - the so-called Butcher of Syria - a move the UK Ministry of Defence has described as an “attempt to centralise command and control”.",17,5.019916599949725,5.2977678544050395,-0.27785125445531467,16

Colonel Ivan Grishin is the latest of Russia ’s top ranking military officials to die during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The commander of the 49th anti-aircraft missile brigade died from abdominal wounds from shrapnel. He was killed in fighting near the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Aterm Malaschchenkov, an MP from Smolensk, the pro-Putin United Russia political party said: “Sleep well, dear friend, your death will not be in vain. “The men will continue your work and fulfil all the tasks of the special military operation. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here “I have no words for how hard it is to lose friends. Ivan was a real colonel - in the brigade his name was ‘Dad’.” A memorial claimed he was an “honest, sympathetic and very strong-willed person. A real colonel and a good family man.” He is the latest top brass to die among the Kremlin’s forces The Kremlin has already lost at least eight generals and a further 35 colonels, but true numbers may be higher due to issues around reporting. Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was the first high-ranking Russian officer to die. He was reportedly kill by sniper fire on February 28, only four days into the invasion. A number of key Russian military commanders have been killed since then. There have been claims that Ukraine is specifically targeting Russia’s top brass to undermine morale in Putin’s forces. All of this comes as Roman Akimov, 18, died during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, making him one of Russia’s youngest soldiers to have been killed in fighting. His body was only identified by his DNA and it took three weeks before his parents were informed of his death. His parents Evgenia and Ivan were handed his posthumous Order of Courage, awarded on the instructions of Putin. ""The last time we called him was on 15 March,” said his sister Natalia. “He said he was alive and well. And then we lost contact. Only on 10 April did we learn that Roman had died on 17 March. “This was confirmed after the DNA was taken.” His bereft mother posted his picture and a poem saying: ""I will never forget you, I swear, I promise. I had no time to say so many words to you. Forgive me for all the bad things. I wish I could hug you tightly. “I wish I could say goodbye to you properly, looking into your eyes for the last time.

He told the world ""we must prepare for"" the bleak scenario and get hold of medicine which would help curb radiation sickness. Zelkensky made the grim warning in an interview before sharing the clip on his Telegram channel on Saturday evening. On Friday he made a similar announcement, and said nuclear weapons could could not be ruled out with Vladimir Putin considering the move as Russia's war with Ukraine stalls. Putin ramped up his offensive after the sinking of the Moskva battleship on Thursday and attacked eight towns including Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv. A British fighter, meanwhile, was paraded on TV after being captured by Russian forces in Mariupol. Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, told CNN an interview Moscow would use a nuclear deterrent on Ukraine in the event of an ""existential threat"". Russia's policy appears to be ""escalate to de-escalate"" and this could include launching a small nuclear weapon to gain the upper hand in the war, according to the nation's military doctrine. Zelensky said: ""We shouldn't wait for the moment when Russia decides to use nuclear weapons... We must prepare for that."" More air raid shelters and anti-radiation medicines would would be needed, he said. The Ukrainian president added the Russians ""can use any weapon, I'm convinced of it"". Six Ukrainian news websites broadcast the interview. On Thursday the Mirror reported how Russia's flagship in the Black Sea had been severely damaged after being hit by missiles, according to Ukrainian officials. Unconfirmed reports say up to 500 Russian sailors who were aboard may have died. The Kremlin claims the Moskva missile cruiser was seriously damaged after ammunition on board the ship blew up, but Ukraine says it was struck by two Neptune missiles. There are conflicting reports from Ukrainian sources if the ship has been sunk. Michael Petersen, director of the Russia Maritime Studies Institute at the US Naval War College, told the Radio 4's Today programme about the news that the Russian vessel the Moskva has been seriously damaged. He then said it was too early to know what happened but it appears to look like the ""Ukrainians have managed to pull off a not-insignificant victory at sea"". Mr Petersen said: ""I think it's one that has symbolic and military value as well. ""This is the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, and it's getting a bit long in the tooth but it is the symbol of Russian naval power in the Black Sea."" He went on to explain that the Ukrainians had lost most of their navy to the Russians during the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and that this attack was ""important symbolically"".",17,5.068012739521481,4.584482559044017,0.4835301804774641,20
2022-04-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-drop-nuclear-bomb-ukraine-26732521,Khrushchev's great-granddaughter warns Russia may drop nukes on Ukraine,"The great-granddaughter of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev has warned Vladimir Putin could resort to nukes in the war with Ukraine. Nina Khrushcheva added she believes Russia ’s president is prepared to do whatever it takes to claim victory. Her great-grandad stepped back from the brink when the Soviets and the US seemed on the verge of using nuclear weapons against each other during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. But Ms Khrushcheva fears the circumstances are different now. The professor of international affairs said: “I think Putin plans to win at any cost. If he needs to declare victory and he may need to use tactical nuclear weapons – I’m not predicting that – that could be one of the options the Russians may be prepared to use.” Tactical nuclear weapons are less powerful than the longer-range missiles that resulted in the crisis in 1962 when Khrushchev led the Soviet Union. But Ms Khrushcheva – a Russia scholar at the New School university in New York and a long-time critic of Putin – fears Moscow could use them to devastating effect in Ukraine. She said her great-grandad and the then US president John F Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis within days because they were “freaked out” by the prospect of mutual annihilation. Ms Khrushcheva, who was five when Khrushchev died in 1971, said previously: “Now look at it today. Putin is not freaked out. In fact, he has said he has opened the nuclear arsenal.” In his daily video update, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky also warned about Russia’s nukes. He urged nations to build air raid shelters and to stock up on anti-radiation medicine. Mr Zelensky added: “We shouldn’t wait for the moment Russia decides to use nuclear weapons – we must prepare for that.” He said in another interview that if Russia over-runs the Donbas region to the east, Putin may again try to seize Ukraine’s capital Kyiv. Mr Zelensky said: “I don’t trust the Russian military and Russian leadership. That is why we understand that the fact we fought them off and they were running away from Kyiv, from the north, from Chernihiv, it doesn’t mean if they are able to capture Donbas they won’t come further towards Kyiv.” There remained confusion last night over a deadline in the besieged seaport of Mariupol. Russia had told the remaining Ukrainian troops in the city to surrender or they could be killed. With communications difficult in the Black Sea port it was impossible to confirm what the situation was there. An estimated 100,000 people remained in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings, which are reported to be largely under Russian control. Mr Zelensky called the situation there “inhuman”, adding it remained “as severe as possible.” He said: “Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone in Mariupol.” Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, said on social media that despite Russia’s “surrender corridor” for the remaining troops in the city, “our defenders continue to hold the defence”. He added the hostilities from Russia have not been limited to the Azovstal steel plant, where Ukrainian soldiers are stationed. He said: “During the fighting, the occupiers shelled private residential houses with heavy artillery again.” Russia targeted other military installations in Ukraine overnight including a missile factory on Kyiv’s outskirts. Moscow has confirmed another shattering blow to morale with the death of the deputy commander of the 8th army, Vladimir Petrovich Frolov. St Petersburg governor Alexander Beglov said the general had “died a heroic death in battle with Ukrainian nationalists... [and he] sacrificed his life so children... in the Donbas would no longer hear bomb explosions”. Other Russian generals have also been killed during the war. It is unusual for such high ranking officers to get so close to the battlefield. Western sources think they have done so to take control of operations which have stalled in many areas. The death comes following the blow of Russian warship Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, sinking after being damaged by an explosion. It is claimed new footage shows the head of Russia’s navy, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, meeting surviving crew members in Sevastopol in Crimea.",17,3.9083893454254452,4.844791093184463,-0.9364017477590174,29

Shaun Pinner, 48, was taken prisoner in Marupil and transferred to Donetsk, where the Russians released a video of him confirming who he is. Now the family of the soldier, who served in tours of Northern Ireland and Bosnia before relocating to Ukraine in 2018 where he met his wife, have released a statement. Correcting previous reports suggesting he was a mercenary and confirming he is serving within the Ukrainian Army, they said: “Shaun was a well-respected soldier within the British Army serving in the Royal Anglian Regiment for many years. “Shaun enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country over the last four years. During this time, he met his Ukrainian wife who is very focussed on the humanitarian needs of the country. “He progressed into the Ukrainian Marines as a proud member of his unit.

""We are hoping for a quick resolution to allow Shaun and Aiden to return safely to their families and we ask for privacy at this difficult time. “Our hearts go out to all those caught up in this horrific conflict.” They added they are working with the Foreign Office alongside the family of Aiden Aslin, the first Brit taken as a POW by Russia, to ensure their rights are being upheld by the Russians. In a sickening propaganda video released by news outlet Axiom, Shaun can be heard saying: ""Hi I'm Shaun Pinner, I am a citizen of the UK, I was captured in Mariupol I am part of the 36 Brigade First Battalion Ukrainian Marines. ""I was fighting in Mariupol for five-six weeks and now I'm in Donetsk People's Republic."" Aiden, from Newark, Notts, has also appeared in a video being taunted by Russians with injuries on his face. Aiden’s mother, Ang Wood, previously said : ""It's Aiden I can't deny it.

""I now hold Vladimir Putin to the terms of the Geneva Convention. “Aiden is a serving member of the Ukrainian armed forces and as such is a prisoner of war and must be treated with humanity.

Kira Obedinsky, 12, lost her mother when she was a baby and her father Yevhen was killed as enemy forces fought their way into the city in March. Shortly afterwards, the youngster and her father’s partner Anya attempted to flee the city in which 21,000 civilians have been killed by relentless Russian shelling. Before they could reach safety Kira was injured in a landmine blast and taken to hospital in Donetsk, which is controlled by Ukrainian separatists. Now her grandfather, Oleksander, fears he will never see her again. The Guardian reported him saying: “She was in a hospital bed, she had shrapnel wounds around her ear and face and her legs, but she seemed OK. “I was so relieved. But she told me she’s in Donetsk, and it seems like she’s on her own. She told me they’re taking her to a Russian city.” An official had said the grandfather could come and collect her from the hospital, which is impossible because of the invasion. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky previously told CNN Kremlin soldiers are forcing people fleeing Mariupol into Russia. He said: “Several thousand, tens of thousands, were forced to evacuate in the direction of the Russia Federation and we don't know where they are, they've left no document trail. ""And among them are several thousand children, we want to know what happened to them. ""Whether they are in good health. Unfortunately, there just isn't any information on this.” Unicef says more than half of Ukraine ’s 7.5 million children have now been forced to flee the ongoing violence in the nation. The Ukrainian Ombudswoman for Human Rights says more than 121,000 children have been ""deported"" by the Russian government. Lyudmila Denisova said in a statement on Facebook : “I appeal to the UN Commission for Investigation Human Rights Violations during Russia's Military Invasion of Ukraine and the expert mission set up by the OSCE participating States under the Moscow Mechanism to take into account these violations of Ukrainian children's rights, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.” Mariupol has been a target of the Russian government since the outbreak of war in February owing to its position on the coast. The city has been without food, heating and power for weeks, with more than 100,000 people still calling it home existing in a desperate situation. Despite overwhelming odds Ukrainian soldiers still fighting for its survival resisted a Russian ultimatum to lay down arms on Sunday in the pulverised port. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said troops in Mariupol were still fighting despite a Russian demand to surrender by dawn. Russia said on Saturday it had control of urban parts of the city, with some Ukrainian fighters remaining in the Azovstal steelworks overlooking the Sea of Azov.

Ex-British Army soldier Shaun Pinner, 48, was a mercenary fighting with Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol - which has now been destroyed by Russian shelling. He claims to have been there for five to six weeks before appearing on the broadcast with no visible wounds, giving information about his service. During the interview with Andrey Rudenko on a Russian military TV channel, the state-aligned journalist told Shaun his unit didn't have a ""single chance of reaching safety"", the Daily Star reports. Rudenko added: “The servicemen of the 36th brigade say their command specially sent them to be killed in order to make heroes out of them later."" Shaun himself said in the interview: ""I am Shaun Pinner. I am a citizen of the United Kingdom. I was captured in Mariupol. I am part of the 36th brigade, 1st Battalion Ukrainian Marine. ""I was fighting in Mariupol for five to six weeks and now I am in the Donetsk People's Republic."" The propaganda clip posted on Twitter carried the caption: ""Another mercenary was caught in Mariupol. Shaun Pinner is an English mercenary. ""He says that he no longer needs the war and he wants to go home. He won't make it home."" It was announced on Saturday that Pinner now faces interrogation by the Russian Investigative Committee, but he has allegedly told Russians ""he doesn't want war and wants to go home."". Concerns were raised for his safety as it was feared he could be treated as a spy. His fate remains in the hands of Russian officials. The fighter appears to be the second British soldier to be captured by the Kremlin after a former care worker Aiden Aslin was seized on April 12. The 28-year-old, who was also quizzed on TV, was forced to surrender along with the rest of the Ukrainian 36th Marine Brigade unit when they ran out of ammunition and food. Looking drained, and with a nasty-looking gash on his forehead, Aiden was quizzed about his combat service.

When asked if he saw how people were killed, Aiden looks off-camera before answering ""no"".

In Ukraine, all men between the ages of 18 and 60 are barred from leaving the country and have been urged to enlist in the armed forces to battle against Vladimir Putin's troops. Border guards working near the port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine say they seized a 26-year-old man who was trying to cross into neighbouring Moldova by taxi. In bizarre footage posted on social media, the man can be seen clad in a long black jacket and leopard print hat as he is questioned by guards, the Daily Star reports. The bemused officials then point to the boot of an open taxi which is packed with luggage. Taking to Twitter, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said: ""In the Odesa region, border guards together with the Troops found a 26-year-old Ukrainian in a taxi at a checkpoint. ""The traveller in women's clothing planned to get to Moldova. He also had a temporary conscript's certificate with him."" The incident comes after the UN urged Ukraine to have a more relaxed approach to their martial law restrictions. Speaking in March, Matthew Saltmarsh, head of news and media at UNHCR, the UN refugee agency said: “We recognise that states have a right to self-defence under both the UN charter and customary international law and that states may also require their citizens to perform military service under certain criteria and conditions, in line with international law. “At the same time … we appreciate these are very challenging circumstances and we would urge a compassionate and humane approach to those who are seeking to flee and are in need of safety and protection.” It comes as US defence officials have warned that a new horrific phase of Russia's invasion could begin this weekend. They believe Russia may start moving forces back into Ukraine within the next couple of days, after retreating from Kyiv within the last two weeks. The new offensive could begin before Russian troops have had a chance to regroup, NBC News reports. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has previously warned of an new offensive approaching, telling reporters: ""Ukraine won the battle for Kyiv.

2022-04-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-loses-eighth-general-26728442,Vladimir Putin loses eighth general in Ukraine as Russia prepares new offensive,"Vladimir Putin has lost his eighth general fighting in Ukraine, in another major blow to his war effort. Major General Vladimir Frolov, deputy commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army, was laid to rest with full military honours in St Petersburg. It is unknown how he died or where he met his demise. His unit is believed to have been deployed in the area around besieged Mariupol. Alexander Beglov, the governor of St Petersburg, said at his burial: “A true patriot, a brave and brave man, he honestly and to the end fulfilled his military and human duty. “The people will not forget their heroes. Eternal memory to him.” He claimed Frolov had “fallen a heroic death in battle with Ukrainian nationalists”, following Russia's twisted portrayal of the invasion. His death followed seven other Russian generals killed in the war, although the Kremlin has only publicly acknowledged the death of one, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, who was believed shot by a sniper. Last month experts revealed there are a catalogue of reasons why several senior Russian officers have fallen in the invasion. It comes amid reports of unreliable equipment and electronics amongst Russian forces, as well as subordinates being too terrified to make quick decisions. Former US army general and CIA director David Petraeus said Ukraine also has ""good snipers"" which are able to target key individuals when a Russian chain of command breaks down. He said: ""The communications have been jammed. The column gets stopped, and an impatient general goes forward to see what’s going on. ""There’s no initiative, no non-commissioned officer corps, no sense of initiative at junior levels. They wait to be told what to do, and the Ukrainians have very, very good snipers."" An anonymous diplomat also told Foreign Policy that generals were ""struggling on the front line to get their orders through"". Russia has also lost another colonel, Miras Bashakov, a tank battalion commander, according to reports today. He was the 34th colonel known to have died in a war that has haemorrhaged Putin’s battlefield top brass. The scale of the high ranking death toll defies Vladimir Putin ’s claim that his “special military operation” is going according to plan. The overall Russian losses since the war began on 24 February are believed to be in the region of 20,000 but Moscow has failed to give accurate figures. Analysts believe Russian commanders are now suffering a higher casualty rate than in any conflict since World War Two.",14,5.916142394110857,6.021315092899771,-0.10517269878891433,11

In the footage, Shaun Pinner, 48, explained he had been taken as a POW in the besieged city of Mariupol and then transferred to Donetsk. Earlier this week, fellow Brit soldier Aiden Aslin, 28, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, was plastered across Russian TV after also being captured. The south-eastern Ukrainian city and region of Donetsk declared itself 'independent' just prior to Vladimir Putin launched his catastrophic invasion in late February. Moscow-backed separatists captured Donetsk and Luhansk before they were declared People's Republics. Having failed to take Ukrainian capital Kyiv, despite weeks of bombardment and allegedly losing up to 20,000 troops, Russian forces have pulled out and re-focused on the eastern border regions already held. Southern port city Mariupol has been close to obliterated by Kremlin missiles, with Shaun saying he had been fighting there for five or six weeks in the chilling video shared by news outlet Axiom. He says: ""Hi I'm Shaun Pinner, I am a citizen of the UK, I was captured in Mariupol I am part of the 36 Brigade First Battalion Ukrainian Marines. ""I was fighting in Mariupol for five-six weeks and now I'm in Donetsk People's Republic."" He had previously been filmed fighting alongside Ukrainian troops. Reports from Moscow had claimed he had been killed during the siege of Mariupol but it is understood he was only injured and in a field hospital. Chris Garrett, who previously fought alongside Shaun in the Donbas in 2014, told the Sun: ""He was wounded by shrapnel from a tank round in Mariupol and is in a military hospital. ""I'm told right now he's not dead and I trust the people who have told me. They're also British. ""I hope their information is right. It's entirely possible that the photocopy of his passport that the Russians were hawking around were looted from another place and used for propaganda."" Aiden, a former care worker, was pictured handcuffed and bruised on Thursday. The wife of Putin ally Viktor Medvedchuk, leader of Ukraine's opposition party, who was re-captured by secret service agents after escaping house arrest, has called for her husband to be swapped for Aiden and Shaun. Aiden had surrendered after his unit ran out of food and ammunition. Oxana Marchenko made a video address calling for the swap. ""I, Oxana Marchenko, spouse of opposition politician, people’s deputy of Ukraine Viktor Medvedchyuk, address the relatives of captured citizens of Great Britain Aiden Aslin and of Shaun Pinner,"" she says. “It is in your power to ask the PM of your country Boris Johnson to influence Ukrainian leadership and to achieve Aiden’s and Shaun’s release by their exchange for….my husband Viktor Medvedchyuk.""",13,4.3147384175443575,3.9270900654623775,0.38764835208198,23

They believe Russia may start moving forces back into Ukraine within the next couple of days, after retreating from Kyiv within the last two weeks. The new offensive could begin before Russian troops have had a chance to regroup, NBC News reports. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has previously warned of an new offensive approaching, telling reporters: ""Ukraine won the battle for Kyiv. ""Now, another battle is coming: the battle for Donbas.” It is predicted that Russian troops will try and encircle Ukrainian forces between Donbas and the rest of the country, a senior defence official said.

""Flights are available, the whole thing can be organized, we can do all the logistics."" A new offensive could signal a redefinition in Russia's war aims, with Putin's sights now set on only conquering the eastern provinces rather than Ukraine as a whole. This would put Ukrainian forces in eastern parts of the country in greater danger of being overwhelmed. Donbas has seen fighting on and off since 2014, with more than 13,000 people killed so-far.

Images of the destruction wreaked by the elite fighting squad shows the column of armoured vehicles reduced to charred remains. The convoy had been moving from Kharkiv in the east of the country to Izyum, about 80 miles away, earlier this week when it was attacked. A huge explosion triggered by SSO operators stopped the vehicles in their tracks, the Ukrainian Ground Forces said while releasing images of the destruction. Having learned of the route the Russians planned to take, Ukrainian saboteurs planted TNT at key points along the road and underneath a bridge before detonating it as the armoured machines rolled above. Several vehicles were destroyed in the blasts, after which SSO operators and members of the Ukrainian army swept in to fight surviving Russian troops. The attack comes as fighting continues to rage in the east and south of the country, after Russian forces abandoned their efforts to take control of Kyiv. They have now focused manpower on taking control of Kharkiv in the east and Mariupol in the south. The invading forces enjoyed a major breakthrough on Wednesday when 1,026 soldiers of Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, surrendered in Mariupol, Russia claimed. Russian television on Wednesday broadcast clips of what it said was the surrender. In the footage, unarmed men in military fatigues were visible walking with their hands up along a grass- and tree-lined path towards masked soldiers cradling assault rifles. In one clip, four marines walked away from a damaged industrial building carrying a wounded person on a stretcher. One of the four carried a makeshift white flag as well. Wounded men were loaded onto a yellow bus. An unidentified Russian soldier said: ""You may be scared or not, but it is necessary to surrender anyway. The choice is not a big one. First, the encircling is tight enough. ""Second, there are at least five echelons (of troops), so it is not that simple to exit if someone would think that he can easily leave."" More than a dozen solders were lined up in formation in a dark room, where an unidentified prisoner of war said in Russian: ""I was in a group of 13 to 15 men who moved together and survived. We had to surrender as we had been encircled."" The main Sea of Azov port is the biggest target in the eastern Donbas region that Moscow now calls the focus of its campaign. If captured, it would be the first major city to fall since the war began. Its capture would help secure a land passage between separatist-held eastern areas and Crimea, which Russia seized and annexed in 2014.",14,3.9278059129500287,3.1639913730834115,0.7638145398666172,25

Earlier this month, Kremlin forces retreated after weeks of trying to breach the defences of the capital city and have since been regathering for attacks in the east. But on freeing the towns and villages from their occupation, the horrifying alleged war crimes committed by invading soldiers were laid bare. Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv’s regional police force, said today bodies were left on the streets or given temporary burials. He said that data indicates 95% died from gunshot wounds. ""Consequently, we understand that under the (Russian) occupation, people were simply executed in the streets,"" Mr Nebytov said. More bodies are being found every day, under rubble and in mass graves, he added. ""The most victims were found in Bucha, where there are more than 350 corpses,"" he said. A war crimes prosecutor has vowed to catch the unimaginably barbaric Russian troops behind the massacres. As he watched four more corpses being removed from a mass grave of over 100 dead in stricken Bucha, War Crimes Prosecutor Andrii Turbor told the Mirror: “No matter how long it takes, time does not matter, we will catch those responsible for killing these innocent people. “This was unimaginable barbarism resulting in the deaths of so many people who were harmless, children, elderly people, women, civilians. “These people were Ukrainians and I am a Ukrainian - this is a matter of personal respect to do justice for these poor people. “This morning we found a 75 to 80 year-old woman here. Who can imagine killing such a person? I cannot imagine it.” It comes after Moscow troops' attacks on civilians in Ukraine were officially declared war crimes in a devastating international report ordered by 45 countries. Vladimir Putin's forces' attack that killed 300 people sheltering in the Mariupol Theatre was “most likely… an egregious violation” of humanitarian law and “those who ordered or executed it committed a war crime”, the report said. It also dismissed Russia 's claims that its attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol last month was “fake news”, saying the attack “must have been deliberate”. It added: “This attack therefore constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law and those responsible for it have committed a war crime”. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) interim report ran to nearly 100 pages and said Russian forces have intentionally targeted healthcare sites. The report only covers the conflict up to April 1, which means atrocities uncovered as Russian forces pulled back from Kyiv in recent weeks have not yet been fully analyse. Grim evidence of the killing of civilians in Bucha shocked the world, as well as the recent rocket attack on a train station in Kramatorsk where people were trying to flee. There were “several credible reports” of Russian forces “arresting civilians, including journalists, without any procedure, and ill-treating them by methods that amount to torture. This constitutes a war crime,” the report said. The report noted there have been “allegations of rapes, including gang rapes, committed by Russian soldiers in many other regions in Ukraine "". And it said: “Russia is failing to agree to evacuations or is violating such agreements through attacks on those trying to leave. “Intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival… constitutes a war crime.” The report concludes: “Violations occurred on the Ukrainian as well as on the Russian side. ""The violations committed by the Russian Federation, however, are by far larger in scale and nature.”",13,6.297263512004422,5.6440840240376495,0.6531794879667725,22

Air raid sirens have been going off across Ukraine overnight with powerful explosions heard in the Capital and other cities. Blasts were also heard in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, on Thursday night. Social media videos have shown the sky above Kyiv lit up by explosions in what appear to be the most serious attacks since the Russian army began to withdraw from the area earlier this month. Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko said that there had been three explosions in Kyiv and believes the attacks are a response by Vladimir Putin to the sinking of the Moskva, the pride of the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. She tweeted: ""3 explosions in #Kyiv right now. One after the other. The air raid warning has been on for an hour. Most likely #putin gone livid because of the #Moskva sinking. Oh well, we’ll just keep standing to #Russia’s annoyance."" She earlier wrote: ""Sirens in every single region of #Ukraine. This means again that #Russia launched missiles and fighter jets. All over #Ukraine. Concentrating in the east of course."" Another Twitter user in Kyiv filmed what appeared to be a missile in the sky and said that lights have gone out in the city. They wrote: ""After a powerful explosion, something important is on fire and the light went out in part of Kiev."" Russia's defence ministry said it had struck a military target on the edge of Kyiv with cruise missiles overnight and promised more and bigger strikes against the Ukrainian capital. It claimed the strikes were in response to ""sabotage"" on Russian territory, and that Russian forces had taken control of the Ilyich Steel Plant in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Russia said on Wednesday that 1,026 soldiers of Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had surrendered near the steel plant. It comes after the country admitted its lead warship in the Black Sea sank on after an explosion and fire that Ukraine claimed was caused by a missile strike. It is a blow to Moscow as it readied for new attacks that were likely to determine the conflict's outcome. The Moskva, Russia's flagship in its Black Sea fleet, sank as it was being towed to port in stormy weather, Russian news agencies quoted the defence ministry as saying. Russia said earlier that over 500 crew aboard the Soviet-era missile cruiser were evacuated after ammunition on board exploded. Ukraine said it hit the warship with a Ukrainian-made Neptune anti-ship missile. Russia, which has not acknowledged an attack, said the incident is under investigation. ""While the cruiser 'Moskva' was being towed to the destination port, the ship lost stability due to damage to the hull from the fire,"" the defence ministry said. ""In the stormy sea conditions, the ship sank."" Russia's navy has been bombarding Ukrainian cities on the Black Sea nearly 50 days after it launched the invasion. Residents of Odesa and Mariupol, on the adjacent Azov Sea, have been bracing for new Russian attacks. Russian forces have pulled back from some northern parts of Ukraine in the past couple of weeks after suffering heavy losses and failing to take the capital Kyiv. Ukraine and its Western allies say Moscow is redeploying for a new offensive in the eastern Donbas region. Russia's navy has fired cruise missiles into Ukraine and its Black Sea activities are crucial to supporting land operations in the south and east, where it is battling to seize full control of the port of Mariupol, its main target in the Donbas. Russia said on Wednesday more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines from one of the units still holding out in Mariupol had surrendered. Ukrainian officials did not comment. If taken, Mariupol would be the first major city to fall to Russian forces since they invaded, allowing Moscow to reinforce a land corridor between separatist-held eastern Donbas areas and the Crimea region it seized and annexed in 2014.",17,4.83582853906426,5.386342206425377,-0.5505136673611171,20

Mariupol has been devastated by Russian shelling, leaving the city in rubble and there has been evidence to suggest war crimes have been committed with hospitals and train stations among the buildings hit. Ukrainians have vowed to fight on in Mariupol with food and water dwindling in a city with strong strategic interest for Russia. It has been heavily under siege since the start of the invasion on February 24 and Russia is now claiming to have taken the city's port with Ukrainian fighters running out of ammunition. But the Ukraine government is so far denying that Mariupol's port has fallen. Russian state television has shown what appears to be Ukrainian soldiers surrendering at a steelworks and walking with hands up. Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday said 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had surrendered in Mariupol, which has been besieged for weeks, and that the port was fully under its control. Capturing its Azovstal industrial district, where the marines have been holed up, would give the Russians full control of Ukraine's main Sea of Azov port, reinforce a southern land corridor and expand its occupation of the country's east. Ukraine's general staff said Russian forces were attacking Azovstal and the port, but a defence ministry spokesman said he had no information about any surrender. ""Russian forces are increasing their activities on the southern and eastern fronts, attempting to avenge their defeats,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Wednesday night video address. Reuters journalists accompanying Russian-backed separatists saw flames billowing from the Azovstal area on Tuesday, a day after Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade said its troops had run out of ammunition. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, an ardent supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, urged remaining Ukrainians trapped in Azovstal to surrender. ""Within Azovstal at the moment there are about 200 wounded who cannot receive any medical assistance,"" Kadyrov said in a Telegram post. ""For them and all the rest it would be better to end this pointless resistance and go home to their families."" Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol and accuses Russia of blocking aid convoys to civilians marooned there. Its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said Russia had brought in mobile crematoria ""to get rid of evidence of war crimes.""

Vast apartment blocks are now charred, hollowed-out wrecks, with most windows blown out, and barely a single structure on the skyline is still intact. Smoke can be seen rising in the distance, an indication that the unrelenting shelling of civilian areas is ongoing, with Russian troops on the brink of overcoming staunch Ukrainian resistance in the key strategic port. It comes amid growing signs that Russia could be on the brink of capturing devastated Mariupol, which had a population of 450,000 before the conflict started.

They were said to be trapped in the Azovstal iron and steel works on the city’s shoreline, and had been cut off from their supply line. Local politicians, however, denied the reports, insisting that the elite troops had actually joined another battalion based in the same area.

Mariupol’s mayor says 21,000 civilians have been killed during weeks of intense Russian bombardment, while 100,000 people are still waiting to be evacuated as humanitarian corridors have been repeatedly targeted by Vladimir Putin ’s forces. Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine, including the appalling bombing of a theatre in Mariupol in which children were sheltering, were officially declared war crimes in a devastating international report ordered by 45 countries. The attack on the Mariupol Theatre, in which 300 civilians died, was “most likely… an egregious violation” of humanitarian law, according to a new report for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE). In its interim findings, the report accused Putin and his generals directly of breaching international law, stating “those who ordered or executed it committed a war crime”. The OSCE also dismissed Russia’s claims that its attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol last month was “fake news”, saying the attack “must have been deliberate”. It added: “This attack therefore constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law and those responsible for it have committed a war crime.” The interim report ran to nearly 100 pages and said Russian forces have intentionally targeted healthcare sites. The report only covers the conflict up to April 1, which means atrocities against civilians uncovered in towns like Bucha and Irpin as Russian forces pulled back from Kyiv in recent weeks have not yet been fully analysed. Neil Bush, head of the UK’s delegation to the OSCE, said: “This report is just the first of likely many. “We must, as an international community, hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities that have been committed in Ukraine, including military commanders and other individuals in the Putin regime. “Soldiers and commanders who issue or follow illegal orders need to understand that their actions will be documented, and they will be held to account. Justice will be served.” The chief prosecutor from the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, visited Bucha today, and observed bodies being exhumed for identification from mass graves. He described the Kyiv suburb, where more than 400 civilians died, as a “crime scene”, and confirmed investigators “have reasonable grounds to believe the crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed”. “We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,” he went on International forensic investigators painstakingly recovered remains from the mass graves in a churchyard to identify the victims, who include many women and children. Overnight, US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a “dictator”, accusing him of genocide in Ukraine for the first time. In his strongest criticism of the Kremlin leadership since the war began, President Biden warned Putin was trying to “wipe out the idea of even being a Ukrainian”. Ukraine has claimed Russia has used mobile crematoriums in occupied regions to dispose of dead civilians. Officials also claim they were used to hide the real losses of Russian troops. Meanwhile a senior Ukrainian politician has warned there is a high likelihood that Russia will use chemical weapons against civilians. The mayor of Kharkiv said seven civilians in the city have died in the last 24 hours - including a two-year-old child. He also added that 22 have been injured following missile strikes on the besieged city. It comes as foreign intelligence sources suggested Russia is planning to muster a force that will outnumber Ukrainian troops by five to one when it launches a renewed assault on the Donbas region in the east. The redeployed force, consisting of tens of thousands of troops brought in from other areas, could begin its assault as early as the end of this week. Some of Putin’s staunchest supporters in Russia believe he will still ultimately invade the whole of Ukraine, despite pulling back troops from Kyiv to concentrate on all of the Donbas. They envisage Ukraine being wiped off the map and replaced with statelets obedient to the Kremlin - or submerged into the Russian Federation. Loyalist Russian MP Anatoly Wasserman - born in Ukraine - has given a chilling vision of the plan of Putin’s hardline backers, using the leader’s euphemistic term “de-Nazification” to justify the barbaric attacks on innocent civilians. “As long as Ukraine is independent, it remains a source of increased danger, first of all for itself, and then for everyone around,” he claimed. “I know for sure that the de-Nazification of Ukraine, while maintaining its formal independence from the rest of Russia, is impossible. As long as Ukraine is listed as independent, it is forced to follow the Nazi programme of turning its Russian majority into something anti-Russian. “So I am quite sure that the set goals of demilitarisation and deNazification will be achieved.”",13,4.502206532130741,3.7866650858891227,0.7155414462416188,22

The huge pit containing the remains of hundreds of dead civillians was discovered after Russian troops withdrew from the town, which sits just outside Kyiv, at the start of April. Karina Yershova, 16, who was described as ""bright and talented"", was shot in the back of the head before she was thrown in the ""trash"", according to a family friend. Olesya Vasylets, a friend of Karina's mother, wrote on Facebook of her ""terrible pain"" over losing Karina before detailing the horrific circumstances of her death. Olesya wrote: 'Friends, terrible news. Racists killed my friend's daughter Karina Yershova. The pain is terrible. ""She was mocked, raped, and then shot in the trash. Today my mother found out that she was killed and created a help group. ""Please help me bury her, I knew this kid for years, taught her English, she was a very bright and talented girl."" Karina had been missing for over a month after being last seen on ""energy workers street"" in Bucha. On March 10, her distraught mum asked social media to ""help me find my daughter"". She added: ""I really hope for help, thank you."" Karina's death was also announced today by Ukrainian lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko. She tweeted: ""16 y.o. Karina raped by #Russia soldiers and shot in the head. ""Her mother’s search for her ended as her tortured body was found in #Bucha"" It's currently unknown why Karina was targetted by Russian forces.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Among the accusations of war crimes is a sickening report of a Russian soldier, Alexei Bychkov, raping an infant before sharing footage of the horrifying attack with a comrade online. Soldiers have also been accused of raping an 11-year-old boy in front of his mum, who was tied to a chair. Other accusations include drawn-out ordeals of sexual violence, with one woman, Elena, claiming she was raped for 12 hours, while Natalya, 33, said she was repeatedly attacked by the vile soldiers for hours after her husband was executed. One group of women, aged between 14 and 25, say they were held captive by the troops and systematically raped. Nine of them say they are now pregnant. Ukraine ’s Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova said today that five soldiers also sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl, who had fallen pregnant as a result of the atrocity. Denisova said on April 8 that Russian soldiers had kidnapped more than 120,000 Ukrainian children. A number of these children had reportedly been raped and thousands had allegedly been smuggled over the Russian border. The same day, Ukrainian official Oleksandr Vilkul told of another act of barbarism, claiming that Putin’s forces had raped a 16-year-old girl and an elderly woman. News of the latest horrific rape story comes as Putin’s soldier Bychkov was reportedly arrested in Ukraine, following the publication online of the video showing an infant being raped. Bychkov was detained in his home country on Saturday, after the sickening clip emerged on social media. It was not known exactly when and where the footage was filmed. Bychkov was also alleged to have shared other videos of child abuse with his friends and colleagues. The soldier was said to have been born in 1997, near Stavropol in southwestern Russia, and lives near Krasnodar. If the video is verified, it would be the latest war crime allegedly carried out by Russian soldiers. Today saw first official international designation of actions carried out by Russian troops as war crimes. A devastating international report ordered by 45 countries ruled the attack that slaughtered 300 people sheltering in Mariupol Theatre was ""most likely... an egrerious violation"" of humanitarian law. It went on to say that whoever ordered or executed the attack ""committed a war crime"". Another incident, where Russian troops shelled a maternity hospital in the city last month, was branded a war crime by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation and Europe's (OSCE) interim report. The report only covers atrocities committed up until April 1 - which was around the same time that Russian troops abandoned several towns and cities to refocus efforts on the pro-Russia east. While the report didn't fully address the sickening crimes reported over recent days, it did acknowledge there have been ""allegations of rapes, including gang rapes, committed by Russian soldiers...""",13,4.315917351607836,3.17016126890381,1.1457560827040258,22

The Russian leader wants tens of thousands of soldiers in the Donbass region to ensure victory after failing to take capital Kyiv and being driven out of the region. Experts believe Moscow’s forces are now regrouping but could soon outnumber their Ukrainian counterparts by as many as five to one - which would tip the scales of battle overwhelmingly in their favour, The Times reported. Images captured by orbiting satellites have shown the build-up of troops and equipment on the border - just as they did in the days leading up to the brutal invasion of Ukraine. Should Mariupol finally fall to the invaders, as many as six thousand troops could be freed up to join the effort to take the east in the Belgorod and Voronezh regions. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former British military chief, said : “[The Russians] will try to put more ground forces in the face of the Ukrainians at once to get the force ratios right, knowing the Ukrainians in the east are in very well-prepared positions. “The Ukrainians are going to need weapons of great range and lethality.” He added the Russians will try to encircle their enemies, forcing them to leave their well defended positions they have held since fighting began with pro-Russian separatists in Donbas since 2014. It comes as Britain’s top soldier warned Ukraine and Russia are set for a “stalemate” as they prepare for a major battle in the Donbas. Chief of the General Staff General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith predicted the looming fight for the key eastern region bordering Russia is expected to be hampered by wet, boggy terrain. Kremlin forces are “at an operational pause right now as they regroup for a renewed offensive down in the south east”, the head of the Army told the Policy Exchange think tank. He added: “Whether that proves to be the decisive battle or not - at the moment we are measuring this campaign in days. “I think we ought to expect to measure it in months if not, in the scheme of things, years. “Probably at this rate, the most likely, immediate and interim outcome is a military, tactical stalemate in the Donbas with a Russian regime able potentially to claim some measure of success, and that potentially acting as a possible launch point for a subsequent campaign. “I don’t think the international community and Europe is going to be able to live comfortably with a frozen conflict in Ukraine at all.” He estimated between 10,000 and 15,000 Russian troops had been killed since war broke out on February 24, with between 20,000 and 30,000 injured. Meanwhile Putin said the invasion aimed to protect people in parts of eastern Ukraine and to ""ensure Russia's own security"".",14,5.594838074750011,5.9931303881377875,-0.3982923133877767,25

Grim evidence of the killing of civilians in Bucha shocked the world, as well as the recent rocket attack on a train station in Kramatorsk where people were trying to flee. There were “several credible reports” of Russian forces “arresting civilians, including journalists, without any procedure, and ill-treating them by methods that amount to torture. This constitutes a war crime,” the report said. The report noted there have been “allegations of rapes, including gang rapes, committed by Russian soldiers in many other regions in Ukraine "". And it said: “Russia is failing to agree to evacuations or is violating such agreements through attacks on those trying to leave. “Intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival… constitutes a war crime.” The report concludes: “Violations occurred on the Ukrainian as well as on the Russian side. ""The violations committed by the Russian Federation, however, are by far larger in scale and nature.” Western officials said it was the first independent report into the atrocities committed in Ukraine - and there would be more to come. They pointed to ""clear patterns"" of human rights violations by Russian forces, and said there was evidence of use of human shields and ""double tap"" attacks - where forces target a site and then again when the emergency services arrive to cause maximum devastation. Neil Bush, head of the UK's delegation to the OSCE, said: ""This report is just the first of likely many.

In a desperate attempt to paint Ukraine as the aggressors, a propaganda video with BBC-style credits has been spread on social media showing images from the attack in Kramatorsk saying the missile serial number was similar to those fired by the Ukrainian army.

The clip starts with a graphic image of bodies scattered on the ground - something that the BBC is unlikely to air (and which the Mirror has chosen not to show). It goes on to show missiles and claims the serial numbers are similar to the ones fired by the Ukrainian military. The text continues: ""When the missile factory numbers hit social media, the Ukrainian media stopped covering this topic. ""Military experts stress that Ukraine has often started using fake news to promote its position."" In another part of the video, the text refers to the Ukrainian president ""Zelenskyy"" when the BBC website spells his surname as ""Zelensky"". Russia's propaganda machine has repeatedly claimed they have not been responsible for horrific attacks on civilian infrastructure including hospitals and schools. Last Friday, a missile blast at a train station in Ukraine targeted thousands of civilians who were trying to evacuate to safety as Russia focuses its troops on eastern Ukraine. Zelensky accused the invading troops of ""cynically destroying the civilian population"" and called it ""an evil without limits"". However, Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk claimed Ukrainian forces were responsible. In response, the Russian Defence Ministry said its Army did not have any targets assigned in Kramatorsk at the time of the attack. It claimed the type of missile involved is only used by Ukrainian forces. A spokesperson from the BBC told The Mirror: ""We are aware of a fake video with BBC News branding suggesting Ukraine was responsible for last week’s missile attack on Kramatorsk train station.

The chilling 30-second clip was posted on the Security Service of Ukraine ’s Telegram channel. It was released after President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian brutes of carrying out “hundreds of rapes”, including sexually assaulting young children. In the clip, titled 'SECURITY SERVICE INTERCEPT: Wives of Russian invaders allow their men to rape Ukrainian women', a woman is heard saying: “So yeah, do it over there. Ukrainian women there. Rape them. Yeah. “Don't tell me anything, understand.” A man is heard answering: “So I should rape and not tell you anything?” When she confirmed he eagerly replies: “Can I really?” She says yes but told him to wear protection. The SBU says at the start of the horrifying clip the interception shows the “moral values” of the occupiers and their relatives back home. President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier said: “In areas freed from the occupiers, the recording and investigation of war crimes committed by Russia continues. ""New mass graves are found almost daily. Testimonials are being collected. Thousands and thousands of victims. Hundreds of cases of torture. Bodies continue to be found in drains and cellars. ""Hundreds of cases of rape have been recorded, including those of young girls and very young children. “ Even of a baby. ” At the end of last month Russian soldiers in Ukraine were heard speaking of “raping girls” and “eating dogs” in horrifying audio clips from intercepted radio communications. It comes amid reports of an 11-year-old boy allegedly raped by Russian troops who forced his mother to watch from a chair she was strapped to. Russian troops were claimed to have raped the boy in the town of Bucha, which has been under siege. Ukraine ’s Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova said five soldiers also sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl, who had fallen pregnant as a result of the atrocity.

In a stinging attack over the Russian assault he said that Putin was 'just trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian.' The comments came on Tuesday as Biden gave a speech at an ethanol plant in Iowa and he later stood by his words as he prepared to board Air Force One. He told reporters: ""Yes, I called it genocide because it has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian and the evidence is mounting. ""We'll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me."" Biden has repeatedly called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal, but Tuesday marked the first time he accused Russia of committing outright genocide in Ukraine. He had said at an event in Iowa on fuel prices: ""Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide a half a world away."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan have both stopped short of describing Russia's assault as a genocide in recent days. ""Based on what we have seen so far, we have seen atrocities,'' Sullivan told reporters last week. ""We have seen war crimes. ""We have not seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide.'' Shortly after Biden's remarks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted, ""True words of a true leader @POTUS. ""Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil."" Under international law, genocide is an intent to destroy - in whole or in part - a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. According to U.N. convention, this includes through killings; serious bodily or mental harm; inflicting lethal conditions and measures to prevent births, among other means. Biden has made a handful of statements about the war that U.S. officials have later had to walk back. The president stirred controversy on a recent trip to Poland when he ad-libbed a line at the end of a speech and said that Putin should not be allowed to remain in power. The White House clarified that U.S. policy was not to seek regime change. Genocide, considered the most serious international offense, was first used to describe the Nazi Holocaust. It was established in 1948 as a crime under international law in a United Nations convention. Since the end of the Cold War, the State Department has formally used the term seven times. These were to describe massacres in Bosnia, Rwanda, Iraq and Darfur; the Islamic State's attacks on Yazidis and other minorities; China's treatment of Uighurs and other Muslims and this year over the Myanmar army's persecution of the Rohingya minority.

A video appears to show the Moscow troops blowing up one of their own armoured vehicles from just yards away in an alleged friendly fire incident. It was filmed by a Ukrainian drone in the village of Dmytrivka, just to the west of capital Kyiv, as Kremlin forces prepared to pull out of their stuttering advance. The bunched up Russian tanks are seen being suddenly attacked by a litany of blasts and explosions thought to be by enemy drones and artillery. The clip, filmed on March 31, shows the Kremlin vehicles marked with the distinctive 'V'. One of the tanks fires its main canon at another tank from almost point blank range. It could be that this was done intentionally if the tank had been disabled during the skirmish to rend it useless should Ukrainian forces capture it. According to reports, the incident saw Kyiv forces hit seven BMP-2 and one BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicles, as well as six T-72 main battle tanks. Eight soldiers were said to have been killed. Five weeks into the invasion, Russia began pulling out of its advance on Kyiv. It is thought President Vladimir Putin is now massing his forces in the country's east in an effort to record a battlefield win in the Donbas border region. Critics say it's a face saving exercise in time for the country's Victory Day parade on May 9 when Russia celebrates defeating Nazi Germany in the Second World War. The retreating troops have left behind a trail of devastation in the towns and villages around Kyiv, leading to allegations of war crimes. Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating civilian massacres in northwestern suburbs such as Bucha, Makariv and Borodyanka. The Prosecutor-General's Office also said yesterday it is looking into events in the Brovary district in the northeast. It comes as the body of a Ukrainian teen, who was allegedly raped and shot in the head by Russian soldiers, has been discovered among 400 corpses in a mass grave in Bucha. Karina Yershova, 16, who was described as ""bright and talented"", was shot in the back of the head before she was thrown in the ""trash"", according to a family friend.

UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the UK would step up its support for Ukraine’s Army as he warned “all options are on the table” if Russia is found to have carried out a chemical attack. Mr Heappey told LBC Radio: “There’s 120 armoured vehicles that are in the process of being made ready. “And the Ukrainian troops that will operate them will arrive in the UK in the next few days to learn how to drive and command those vehicles.” Radio host Nick Ferrari told him: “That’s tremendous, so we’re going to be training Ukrainian blokes and women on our kit here in the UK?” “Yes,” replied Mr Heappey. The UK has already been helping train the Ukrainian Armed Forces since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Speaking to the BBC Mr Heappey added: ""There are more shoulder-launched anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles that we are sending as well as loitering precision munitions, and as you heard the Prime Minister say at the weekend, we're also sending an anti-ship capability as well."" He spoke of the ""importance of upholding that the use of chemical weapons is a line that the international community simply won't tolerate"". Mr Heappey claimed Ukrainian troops can defeat Russian forces in the Donbas because of Vladimir Putin ’s “hubris”. The Russian President’s reported push for a military triumph in the fiercely-contested eastern region ahead of Moscow’s traditional May 9 Victory Parade bolstered Kyiv’s chances of winning, according to the Armed Forces Minister. Spring fighting conditions meant Kremlin soldiers risked becoming bogged down in the battle, he warned. Asked if the UK Government believed Ukrainian forces were able to repel Putin’s troops, Mr Heappey said: “We absolutely do. “There is hubris in the Russian plan for the next phase - you can conduct military options in Ukraine either in the dead of winter when the ground is frozen solid or in the summer when the ground is dry and hard. “The mud of Ukraine in the springtime has brought the Nazis to a standstill in Operation Barbarossa and Putin’s desire to have a May 9 Victory Parade through Moscow is just characteristic of the hubris and utter disregard for loss of Russian life that he has shown so far.” Terrain conditions meant Russian armoured convoys would be forced to remain on roads, making them “pretty easy pickings” for Ukrainian defenders, he added. It comes as Britain is “working urgently” to verify reports that Russian forces may have launched a chemical attack in Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss became one of the first Western senior politicians to speak out last night - as Mr Heappey warned “all options are on the table” if chemical weapons are confirmed. He said: “The use of chemical weapons is abhorrent, does cross a line, and all options are on the table for how we respond.” Asked if that could mean direct NATO involvement, Armed Forces minister James Heappey told the BBC: “All options are on the table”. However he did also point he could not unilaterally pledge NATO involvement, and any response could also happen separately to the alliance. Last night there were unconfirmed reports from the besieged port city of Mariupol, whose mayor said more than 10,000 civilians have died in weeks of fighting. On Monday evening, Ivanna Klympush, a Ukrainian MP, tweeted: "" Russia 1.5hr ago used unknown substance in #Mariupol. ""Victims experience respiratory failure, vestib.-atactic syndrome. Most likely chem.weapons! ""This is red line beyond which must destroy economy of despotism. We demand full embargo on all fuels from #RU &heavy weapons 2UA now!"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby added from the US government: “We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely. “These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia's potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine.""",14,5.622202141345827,3.117990940914775,2.5042112004310524,28

The officers are said to be from the FSB security service, which is the successor to the KGB, with some removed while others were reportedly arrested. All of those ousted were said to be employees of the Fifth Service, a division that was set up in 1998, when Putin was director of the FSB to perform operations in former Soviet Union countries. Col-General Sergei Beseda, 68, head of the 5th Service of the Federal Security Service (FSB), was one who is under house arrest. He has now been placed in pre-trial detention in notorious Lefortovo Prison, suggesting he will face major charges for intelligence failings, it is claimed. The purge was reported by Christo Grozev, executive director of Bellingcat, an investigative news organisation. He claimed the officer had been dismissed for “reporting false information to the Kremlin about the real situation in Ukraine before the invasion”. Grozev told Popular Politics, a YouTube channel about Russian current affairs: “I can say that although a significant number of them have not been arrested, they will no longer work for the FSB.” Putin had been convinced by secret services briefings that his troops would be welcomed by many Ukrainians, and achieve a speedy victory. In reality they have faced implacable opposition. The move will be seen as a warning to other senior Putin aides who are expected to take the blame for the huge Russian death toll in Ukraine. Beseda’s case is being investigated by the Military Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee, said Russian intelligence expert Andrei Soldatov, who revealed the Lefortovo move. Beseda, in charge of FSB intelligence and political subversion in the ex-USSR, had been on a trip to Ukraine shortly before he was detained. Putin is said to fear that moles leaked invasion plans to the West, and Beseda was detained along with his deputy Anatoly Bolyukh, but had been held under house arrest until now. Beseda had been a long time trusted Putin secret services official, and was in his role as head of the 5th service of the FSB since 2009. The current status of Bolyukh is unclear and Russia has not confirmed his arrest of detention. Last month Putin also fired the deputy head of the Russian national guard.",3,4.883168820749187,3.75734732727674,1.125821493472447,3

The move comes as warmongering president Vladimir Putin told his enemies that they will face ""consequences"" if they ""worsen the situation"" in Ukraine. Claims their fearsome missile system have now been shifted amid a further NATO row will do little to ease tensions. Video has today emerged showing two Russian coastal defence missile systems driving ominously towards Finland's capital Helsinki, which sits on a peninsula in the Gulf of the country. Russia has warned both the Finns and Sweden against joining the intergovernmental military alliance, arguing the move would not bring stability to Europe. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her nation is still considering applying to join NATO by the summer following growing support. Putin today insisted that his stalling invasion of Ukraine would still prevail as he chillingly threatened world starvation as a result of Western sanctions against Moscow. The faltering attack, which has seen Russian troops retreat from Ukrainian cities and turn their attention on the Donbas region, is still going to plan, the flagging dictator insisted. Now the missile systems - understood to be the K-300P Bastion-P mobile coastal defence system - has been seen on the move. The deadly machine is designed to take out ships and aircrafts, military experts say. US defence officials said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been a ""massive strategic blunder"" - and is likely to lead to NATO enlargement. They expect both the Nordic neighbours to bid for membership in the months ahead. Twisted Putin vowed that troops will use ""weapons of unprecedented characteristics"" as he refuses to back down and admit his attempts to seize Ukraine are failing. He was surrounded by security officers as he touched down in the far eastern region of Amur this morning to visit a space port in commemoration of the Soviet's first manned space mission. His latest promise comes amid claims that Russian soldiers deployed illegal chemical weapons in the besieged city of Mariupol - where thousands of innocent civilians have been slaughtered. In recent weeks reports have emerged of Putin's rising paranoia, with him terrified of assassination or a coup carried out by the country's top military chiefs. War lord Putin is currently mainly living in a massive underground city protected from potential nuclear attacks that can house up to 100,000 people, it has also been claimed. The academic who first alleged the Kremlin leader is seriously ill alleges the Russian president has retreated to a vast nuclear bunker as he lives in fear of his enemies. Professor Valery Solovey, 61, also claims the dictator is unlikely to remain in politics beyond the end of this year due to poor health. The UK's armed forces minister James Heappey made his own veiled threat to the Kremlin today. He said ""all options are on the table"" if it's proven that Russian troops used chemical agents in Mariupol, which has not yet been verified by British intelligence.",29,4.490021763040675,3.9689256956458925,0.5210960673947822,29

The looming fight for the key eastern region bordering Russia is expected to be hampered by wet, boggy terrain, Chief of the General Staff General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith predicted. Kremlin forces are “at an operational pause right now as they regroup for a renewed offensive down in the south east”, the head of the Army told the Policy Exchange think tank. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox. Sign up for the free Mirror Politics newsletter “Whether that proves to be the decisive battle or not - at the moment we are measuring this campaign in days. I think we ought to expect to measure it in months if not, in the scheme of things, years,” Gen Sir Mark said. “Probably at this rate, the most likely, immediate and interim outcome is a military, tactical stalemate in the Donbas with a Russian regime able potentially to claim some measure of success, and that potentially acting as a possible launch point for a subsequent campaign. “I don’t think the international community and Europe is going to be able to live comfortably with a frozen conflict in Ukraine at all.” He highlighted seasonal conditions which could derail Moscow’s latest plan to seize the military advantage. “‘General Winter’ is busy handing over to General Mud’,” Gen Sir Mark said. “It’s just another way in which the Russian planners have been loose and casual with some of the practical realities of the campaign they have been embarked on. “It’s cost them momentum, it has cost them a lot of casualties and it’s led them into this operational pause and a major reappraisal as to the objectives of the operation.” His American counterpart, US Army Chief of Staff Gen James McConville, backed up warnings about the weather. “It's raining, it's wet … armoured vehicles - how they operate that type of terrain that’s very wet and boggy, they tend to spend a lot of time doing recovery operations and that’s going to force them to stay on roads,” he said. “When they stay on roads that gives the defenders an awful lot of opportunities to inflict (damage) on them. “It takes away the ability that an offensive force would like to manoeuvre on.” Gen Sir Mark accused Russia’s troops of failing to learn lessons from the UK’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Comparing the Kremlin’s assault on Ukrainian cities with the relentless pounding of Chechen capital Grozny two decades ago, he said: “I had assumed they had taken a different body of lessons from our own experience of our interventions over the last 20 years, and they had carefully constructed a hybrid playbook matched with a lethal and impressive inventory of conventional capability. “They had experimented with it in Syria, Libya, the Caucasus - I assumed that if they were to pursue their strategy in Ukraine, they would do so in a more indirect, asymmetric manner. “The fact they went all in with a strategy that really resembled Grozny as opposed to keyhole surgery has been a surprise.” Gen Sir Mark admitted he was “surprised” Kremlin forces had not performed better during the invasion - highlighting the “myriad of mistakes they have made”. He said the battle plan “execution has been poor”, citing “inadequate intelligence and information preparation”. “Their commanders have struggled to administer and resupply the force, and they seem to lack low-level initiative so when Plan A clearly came unstuck it has taken them sometime in order to reconfigure themselves,” he said. “We are about 47/48 days into a war they assumed might have taken five or seven.” He estimated between 10,000 and 15,000 Russian troops had been killed since war broke out on February 24, with between 20,000 and 30,000 injured. But Gen Sir Mark said the conflict showed the era of major battles on land was not over. “Many have prophesied potentially the end of land manoeuvre as being a viable instrument of warfare,” he said. “But I think land warfare, we are discovering today, has not actually been an aberration.” But, the senior military officer added: “The economics of the battlefield do seem to be changing in relation to emerging technologies. “What we can see in Ukraine today is a modernised and lethal, conventional inventory of Russian capability finding itself vulnerable - very expensive, quite exquisite, virtually-irreplaceable platforms being destroyed by very much cheaper, disposable capabilities. “Clearly there is something for both the defence industry and armies of the future.”",14,3.5090374963349866,3.6573758566738452,-0.1483383603388586,4

Viktor Medvedchuk - dubbed the Prince of Darkness - had escaped house arrest before going AWOL just three days after Russia launched its invasion on February 24. The 67-year-old is the leader of Ukraine's main opposition party Opposition Platform For Life and has been described as the Russian President's right-hand man over the border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky published a photo of the captive sitting on chair in handcuffs and looking tired on Tuesday. He has suggested swapping rival Medvedchuk with POWs stuck in Russia. Kyiv hopes he can prove a strong bargaining chip amid stalled negotiations with Moscow. The Kremlin, however, says photos of Medvedchuk in cuffs might be fake, though has failed to back such claims up with evidence. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman said: “There are a lot of fakes coming from Ukraine. This needs to be checked first.” He was last year detained by the SBU after a treason case was opened against him. Medvedchuk denies any wrongdoing. The former lawyer and oligarch has been branded the 'Grey Cardinal' and 'The Prince of Darkness' due his influence in business and politics. The Ukrainian security services said in an online post: ""You can be a pro-Russian politician and work for the aggressor state for years. You may have been hiding from justice lately. ""You can even wear a Ukrainian military uniform for camouflage. ""But will it help you escape punishment? Not at all! Shackles are waiting for you and same goes for traitors to Ukraine like you."" The post cited Ivan Bakanov, head of the secret services, as saying his operatives had ""conducted a lightning-fast and dangerous multi-level special operation"" to arrest Medvedchuk but did not give details. Last month Zelensky said Opposition Platform For Life and several other smaller political parties with ties to Russia had been suspended. Medvedchuk's lawyer has denied the allegation that he had escaped, instead claiming his client was forced to move location due to threats from nationalist groups. “In connection with the real danger to life, as well as the need to ensure his protection, Viktor Medvedchuk was evacuated to a safe place in Kyiv,” the lawyer Larysa Cherednychenko said. Medvedchuk claims Putin is godfather to his daughter and he describes him as ""a personal friend"". In an interview with the Independent last year he stated that, unlike Putin, he sees Ukraine and Russia as two separate ""Slavic nations, with intertwined histories, religion"". ""I tell him this all the time. I don't think it's one nation. You simply can't say this."" He also claimed he ""often"" discussed Ukraine with Putin. In May last year, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine accused him of treason and attempted looting of national resources in Crimea. Months earlier, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine included Medvedchuk and his wife, Oksana Marchenko, on the Ukrainian sanctions list, due to alleged financing of terrorism.",13,4.924152314117315,4.652234456579599,0.2719178575377157,2

Warlord Ramzan Kadyrov - leader of Chechnya and a lieutenant-general in the Russian national guard - also called on Putin not to abandon his aim of seizing Kyiv despite the current pullback. Outspoken hardliner Kadyrov, 45, claims to be personally involved in the war especially with Chechen forces around decimated Mariupol.

Vladimir Putin recently unleashed white phosphorus weapons in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. White phosphorous is used to cause rapid fires due to the aggressive way it combusts with oxygen. The use of the chemical is not banned under international convention when it is used as a smokescreen, but as an incendiary weapon in civilian areas, it is forbidden under the Geneva convention. The Ministry of Defence warned this morning of the ""possibility"" of Russian troops potentially using the weapon in Mariupol. In an intelligence update for April 11, the ministry said: ""Russian forces prior use of phosphorous munitions in the Donetsk Oblast raises the possibility of their future employment in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies."" Mariupol, with its strategic location on the coast of the Sea of Azov, has been battered by Russian strikes since the invasion began on February 24. Last week, dramatic footage showed the moment Ukrainian soldiers appeared to wipe out a Russian armoured personnel carrier in Mariupol. Another video from the scene shows the bodies of at least six Russian infantry troops. Putin has withdrawn his troops from Kyiv after fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces and large losses in troops and military equipment. However, Putin is not pulling out of his unjust war as he appears to continue his shelling in other parts of the country. It comes as Putin has turned to personnel from those who were discharged from service in 2012 to replace military personnel with the Russian death toll at almost 20,000 according to Ukraine. Putin is also said to be recruiting troops from Moldova, which has been classed as an occupied territory of Russia by the Council of Europe. Over the weekend, satellite images showed an eight-mile-long Russian convoy is making its way towards under-siege Ukraine marking a new phase in the conflict. Images from space showed the mass of military vehicles and artillery travelling in the direction of the eastern part of the war-torn country. Maxar technologies took the satellite images which showed the heavy military build-up as it made its way through Velykyi Burluk.

Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station. ""Now, we are returning to life, but during the occupation we had our 'hotspots', many civilians died,"" Didych said. The number of bodies found in the grave in Buzova, which for weeks was occupied by Russian forces, was yet to be confirmed. The report was not able to be immediately verified with local officials. The corpses found in the graves appeared to be dressed in a mix of civilian and military clothing. One devastated woman was seen peering down into the manhole before breaking down. As she clawed at the earth she wailed"" ""my son, my son"". As Russian forces were engaged in an offensive against Kyiv in the first weeks of Moscow's invasion, a number of communities surrounding the capital, including Makariv, Bucha, Irpin and Dmytrivka remained under constant fire. In early April local media reported casualties found in and near Buzova, with about 30 bodies found at the time. With most of the towns and villages around Kyiv now seized back, discoveries of mass graves and civilian casualties have triggered a wave of international condemnation, in particular over deaths in the town of Bucha, northwest of the capital. On Saturday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that while the threat to Kyiv had receded, Ukraine was preparing for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country. Ukrainian officials have called on people in the east of the country to flee, as an eight-mile long Russian convoy was spotted making its way towards the country. The renewed ambush marks a new phase in the conflict. Images from space showed the mass of military vehicles and artillery travelling in the direction of the eastern part of the war-torn country. Maxar technologies took the satellite images which showed the heavy military build-up as it made its way through Velykyi Burluk. After fierce resistance from Ukraine, Russian forces withdrew from around Kyiv last week and are believed to be regrouping for a new Donbas offensive. Yesterday it was revealed Russia is trying to expand its depleted army with retired old soldiers, having suffered almost 20,000 deaths. It is thought to be recruiting soldiers from Moldova, which has been classed as an occupied territory of Russia by the Council of Europe. President Zelensky has warned the world that Russia's use of violence was a “catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone.” So far, according to Iryena Venediktova Ukraine ’s Prosecutor General, Kyiv authorities have discovered as many as 500 war crime suspects, along with 5,600 alleged war crimes.",14,3.8764693454672945,3.266012507856221,0.6104568376110735,22

Russian troops invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin is calling a ""special military operation"". Today marks the 46th day of the invasion. From February 24 to April 8, the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at an estimated 19,000 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

It is an all-volunteer infantry military unit and has an estimated 900 members. It has far-right origins and a minority of its members are still said to have far-right tendencies. In latest news, at least 39 people have been killed and dozens injured after rockets hit a train station in the city of Kramatorsk, in the Donbas region, eastern Ukraine, according to the country's authorities. Donbas is where Russia is believed to be stepping up its offensive as it withdraws from the north of Ukraine. Parts of Donbas have been under pro-Russian separatist occupation since 2014. The so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics were recognised as independent states by Russia just days before the invasion was launched.",14,3.160829637922584,5.025538869684963,-1.864709231762379,8

If true it would be the latest Russian abomination to shock the world with Kremlin troops repeatedly accused of war crimes and genocide. The video has been shared on Telegram and other social media sites although few details about it have been confirmed. Ukraine media reports the man sent vile images and videos to a fellow soldier and it disseminated from there. On Saturday Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to the Ukraine capital Kyiv where he spoke with President Volodymyr Zelensky and walked the city's streets. Mr Johnson said that while Russian forces attacking Kyiv had suffered a defeat, their withdrawal was ""tactical"" as they prepared to refocus their military efforts on the east. He strongly condemned the ""war crimes"" being uncovered in the wake of their departure, with scores bodies of civilians who have been shot and killed being reported by the Ukrainian authorities. ""I think what Putin has done in places like Bucha and Irpin, his war crimes have permanently polluted his reputation and the reputation of his government,"" he said. Mr Zelensky welcomed the UK's ""decisive and significant support"" for his country as he urged other Western allies to intensify the pressure on Moscow. Earlier this week at the UN Mr Zelensky showed a short video of burned, bloodied and mutilated bodies, including children, in Irpin, Dymerka, Mariupol and Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing hundreds of civilians. Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia then told the Security Council that Russian troops are not targeting civilians, dismissing accusations of abuse as lies.

The mayor of Makariv in Kyiv Oblast said the bodies were found with bullet wounds. About 40% the town has reportedly been destroyed after Ukrainian troops recaptured it on March 22, the Mail reports. The reports come as Russian soldiers continue to be accused of carrying out war crimes. More than 20 people from villages and towns close to Kyiv spoke to Amnesty, several of whom had witnessed or had direct knowledge of horrifying violence committed by Russian forces. They repeatedly told of deliberate killings, unlawful violence, and widespread intimidation by Russian forces against unarmed civilians across the Kyiv region. Secretary General of Amnesty International Agnès Callamard said: ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes. “Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality. “The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime. These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command.” To date, Amnesty International has obtained evidence that civilians were killed in indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv and Sumy Oblast, documented an airstrike that killed civilians queueing for food in Chernihiv, and gathered evidence from civilians living under siege in Kharkiv, Izium and Mariupol. The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected accusations it has committed war crimes and has called allegations that its forces executed civilians in Bucha a ""monstrous forgery"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday Russian forces appeared to have committed war crimes by targeting civilians in Ukraine, but she said lawyers must investigate the alleged incidents.

""Borodyanka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about (the number of) victims,"" she said. Moscow says one of the aims of its military campaign is to ""liberate"" largely Russian-speaking places such as the southern port of Mariupol from the threat of genocide by Ukrainian nationalists, who it says have used civilians as human shields. Zelensky has rejected those claims, saying they are a baseless pretext for Russia's invasion. Moscow has denied targeting civilians and says images of bodies in Bucha were staged by the Ukrainian government to justify more sanctions against Moscow and derail peace negotiations.

Ukraine's defence ministry shared a heartbreaking photo of a woman in front of a destroyed building, waiting for the bodies of her family to be pulled from the rubble. It said many of those underneath the collapsed buildings were heard groaning for a week. In an update on Twitter the ministry wrote: ""A woman waits for her family to be unearthed from under the rubble. ""Occupiers did not allow local residents to dismantle houses they destroyed during the assault. ""According to local residents, judging by the groans, many of those buried alive were dying for a week."" Resident Vadym Zagrebelnyi told Reuters as he watched rescuers digging through the rubble of a collapsed building: ""My mother, my brother, brother's wife, his mother and father-in-law, are still there, as well as other people who were there in the basement."" It comes days after Russian forces were accused of genocide after bodies were found lying in the streets in nearby Bucha and mass graves filled with dozens of bodies were discovered. Russia has denied targeting civilians and claimed that the victims were killed after troops left - but satellite images clearly expose thi s as a lie. The Ukrainian Parliament posted on Twitter : ""The destruction in Borodyanka was considered even worse than in Irpen and Bucha. The world will soon learn about the atrocities of the occupiers there, but now only one thing is clear - the village in ruins. ""Of the 29 high-rise buildings, 21 were damaged, 8 of them were completely destroyed. Rescuers have been dismantling the debris for several days now, so the horrific finds will soon be known to everyone."" Mr Zelensky said in a video shared on Telegram: ""The work to clear the rubble in Borodyanka has begun ... It's significantly more dreadful there. Even more victims from the Russian occupiers."" Ukraine's Prosecutor General has accused Russia of using cluster bombs and multiple rocket launchers to target civilians. Iryna Venediktova posted on Facebook : ""Just in the rubble of two apartment blocs, 26 bodies were recovered. ""Only the civilian population was targeted: there is no military site here."" She added that it was ""impossible to predict"" how many more bodies would be found in the town. She added: ""Evidence of the Russian forces' war crimes is at every turn. ""The enemy treacherously shelled residential infrastructure in the evenings, when there was a maximum amount of people home.""",17,3.7778215628049336,3.2690261823362654,0.5087953804686682,24

The militia group, called Rusich, has been spotted on the Russian-Ukrainian border near to where Vladimir Putin's forces are expected to launch their next offensive. The unit is linked to private military company, the Wagner Group, which is backed by the Kremlin and is said to currently have 1,000 soldiers operating in eastern Ukraine. Rusich was founded nearly a decade ago in St Petersburg by Red Army paratrooper Aleksei Milchakov, 30, and Yan Petrovsky, 33 - after the pair met at a white supremacist event. It quickly gained notoriety in 2014 during fighting between Moscow-backed separatists and Ukrainian military. Milchakov has previously posted horrific pictures of himself slicing off the ears of dead soldiers on social media, reports The Times. On his Vkontakte account he has also shared snaps of him carving the kolovrat, a Slavic far right swastika. And has previously boasted about being a neo-Nazi and claims he ""got high from the smell of burning human flesh"". His account also features a photo of him as a teen cutting off a puppy's head. Milchakov met co-founder Petrovsky through the Russian Imperial Movement. Their mercenary group is thought to consist of several hundred soldiers who wear a white supremacist valknut insignia on their uniforms. Rusich has published a cartoon of a Russian soldier returning home with gifts for his wife and son, covered in blood and stolen from Ukrainians. The caption reads: “If you are a real man and a Russian, join our ranks. ""You will spill litres of blood from vile Russophobes, and become rich and cool."" Earlier this week, the sadistic mercenary unit was pictured crossing into Kharkiv in military vehicles marked with 'Z'. Ukrainian defence officials are bracing for a renewed attack in the region. It comes after invading Moscow forces began pulling out of areas around capital Kyiv, after weeks of failing to occupy the city. But in doing so they've left behind evidence of alleged atrocities, including the massacre of women and children. Some members of the Wagner group are thought to have also served with Rusich. Both organisations share far-right political beliefs and have ties to neo-Nazism, with both fighting side by side in Syria for Bashar al-Assad. The Wagner Group is thought to have been set up by Russian ex-special forces commander Dmitri Utkin.

Following the savage attack, which happened at Kramatorsk as hundreds of families queued to evacuate, images emerged appearing to show the lettering on the side of a Tochka U missile. The bombing has been described as ""evil beyond limits"" by Ukraine's President, as the list of war crimes Vladimir Putin's forces are accused of continues to grow. More than 85 people were injured in the attack, many of them seriously, authorities said. Sharing a picture of the missile, UK ambassador to Ukraine Melinda Simmons wrote: ""Marking a missile “for children” and then aiming it at fleeing civilians inc children at #Kramatorsk, is an unspeakably brutal Russian depravity."" Lithuanian former foreign minister Linas Linkevicius posted on Twitter : ""Another horrific war crime. "" Russia ’s missile with ‘for children’ written on it hit #Kramatorsk train station killing at least 39 with children among them. ""Madness and cynicism have no borders. They are really convinced that no one will judge them. World must make them wrong."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack demonstrated ""evil beyond limits"" by Russian invaders. Mr Zelensky said: ""The inhuman Russians are not changing their methods. ""Without the strength or courage to stand up to us on the battlefield, they are cynically destroying the civilian population. ""This is an evil without limits. And if it is not punished, then it will never stop."" The Governor of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region accused Russian forces of firing cluster munitions in the sickening bombing. Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said: ""They wanted to sow panic and fear, they wanted to take as many civilians as possible."" He said that thousands of people had been at the station at the moment when the rocket struck. Mr Kyrylenko claimed the rocket that struck the station contained banned cluster munitions, which explode in mid-air, spraying small lethal bomblets over a wider area. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace today said Russia may have committed another war crime by targeting civilians with precision missiles. Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was ""appalled"" by the reports, adding: ""The targeting of civilians is a war crime. We will hold Russia and Putin to account."" Mr Wallace, visiting Romania for talks, said the strike was a repeat of the Russian president and his generals targeting civilians. Speaking at a press conference in Constanta, he said: ""Not very far away this morning in a place called Kramatorsk, what appear to be Russian missiles struck civilian people queuing for trains to seek a safer place from the war. ""The striking of civilians and critical infrastructure is a war crime. These were precision missiles aimed at people trying to seek humanitarian shelter."" The U.S. embassy in Ukraine described the attack as ""one more atrocity"" committed by Russian troops. On Twitter it said: ""The Russian missile attack on the Kramatorsk railway station, a hub for civilian evacuations, which left dozens of people killed and more than 100 injured, is one more atrocity committed by Russia in Ukraine. ""The world will hold (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to account."" Russia denies targeting civilians and its defence ministry has said its forces were not behind the Kramatorsk attack.",17,4.805055501388873,2.7995452089749664,2.0055102924139065,0
2022-04-08,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/zelensky-accuses-russia-lacking-strength-26671312,Ukraine's fields of dead bodies as 50 slaughtered at station with hundreds hurt,"Horrified villagers described fields of dead bodies, their faces burned off today - as Russia shelled a train station killing at least 50 more civilians. Even as north Kyiv emerged from the rubble of battered communities news of the latest barbaric shelling out east was spreading throughout Ukraine. Kramatorsk train station, 430 miles east of us , was hit by missiles - one marked “For What Has Been Done To The Children,” killing at least 50, including five children, and injuring up to 300. President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russians of “…lacking the strength and courage to face us on the battlefield and cynically destroying the civilian population.” Today's depraved Kramatorsk shelling was matched by the horrors locals were revealing in communities north of Kyiv. In the blitzed village of Andriivka, north of Kyjv city, father-of-three Piotr Kachenko, 66, was sitting by the side of the road, amid the devastation. This quietly-spoken elderly man told us: “They ran into the basements of private homes, spraying them with bullets. It is unbelievable. “They came here and killed a lot of people , mostly young men, burning their faces when they were dead, after pouring petrol on them. “They had their hands tied and then they were taken into the fields and shot dead - then burned so that they cannot be recognised.” It seems everybody here knows someone who has disappeared in this field, where at least 48 young men were executed, their faces mutilated with petrol. Today his friend and neighbour Anton, 24, was buried, according to Piotr but he is confused and exhausted by the nightmare that descended upon his village. The Russians have gone now, retreating hastily north to Belarus or east to be re-deployed in the contested Donbas region, where Moscow is preparing a massive offensive. But they have left behind a legacy of murder and depravity that is etched on the bullet-pock marked walls, blackened ruins of Ukraine’s communities and the faces of everyone we meet. A middle-aged lady called Tania, approaches us next to Piotr, crying that her house was marked “children” but that did not stop the Russians. Still shaking with fear she tells us: “There were nine of us hiding in the basement and we were trying to be quiet as the Russians came into my yard. “They opened the door of the cellar and a soldier sprayed downwards with bullets, one of which hit my daughter’s back pack and scratched her smart phone. “It was a miracle we all survived but it was truly terrifying. “But we had the word ‘children’ painted on the gate so clearly they either do not care or they just want to kill everybody, who knows?” One man, aged 24, is recovering in Kyiv hospital from a bad bullet wound in his arm from the basement attack and he was the only person hit. She refused to be photographed since she is terrified the Russians, who left more than a week ago, will return to kill her. In her back garden she shows us a 12ft deep pit she heard the Russians digging, which they were shouting was to “bury dead bodies.” There is no way of knowing if this was true as it could equally have been to hide once of their tanks, even though the area was totally secluded. Houses in Andriivka are riddled with bullets, shell holes and huge blast marks and holes, unexploded shells lying discarded on the ground, at the side of the road. Ten miles away the mostly destroyed town of Borodyanka looks like a monster has trampled through it breathing fire onto everything in its path. Entire apartment blocks are smashed in half, reduced to rubble by wave after wave of airstrikes and then tank shells and small arms. As marauding Russians came into town at the beginning of the now six weeks-long war they sprayed almost every home with bullets, leaving as many as 200 people below the rubble. Today we watched as rescue teams sifted and dug through several mini “ground zeros,” having found 26 corpses the previous day. Some wounded survivors have been found but hope is now fading for those who fled underground and were unfortunate to be crushed to death or buried alive. In Borodoyanka Eugene Yenin, Kyiv’s First Deputy to the Minister of the Interior, was meeting devastated locals to discuss their future. Afterwards he told us: “What you see here and elsewhere in Ukraine is a lot of tears and horror. “We are here to reassure and support the locals that we are here to help with the infrastructure and their future, water, power.” And then he made an astonishing claim, that Russian soldiers marked murdered civilian’s homes with a Soviet-era code for “dead bodies.” He said the troops marked the number “200” on the gates of houses to denote that “dead bodies” were inside. It is a throwback to Soviet era Afghanistan when the 200 mark meant a dead body or bodies were nearby. Asked if he meant “civilian bodies” he replied: “Yes - civilians. “This is to say the Russians are telling other troops ‘we have already visited here.” He added: “This is a remote village or town, where people are not well-to-do and they need help as you can see. “Around 20 bodies were found yesterday and another six in a different apartment block. “We are discovering in some places where the Russians have been booby-trapped washing machines, with a grenade inside. “There are the bodies of people who have been shot randomly. “It is a terrible situation but there will be a future here.” Today Kramatorsk’s hospitals were struggling with the numbers of wounded as Ukraine officials said no military personnel were nearby at the time of the attack. The governor of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk accused Russian forces of firing cluster munitions at the station, where thousands were at the time. Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said: ""If at the beginning they exclusively ... targeted railway tracks, then now it's not only tracks, but also firing a missile containing cluster munitions which are meant for people. “This is absolute confirmation that this (strike) was intended against civilians."" British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Russia may have committed another war crime and vowed to ""do everything"" to ensure Vladimir Putin fails in Ukraine and predicted the war would backfire for the Russian president. Mr Wallace, visiting Romania for talks, said: ""The striking of civilians and critical infrastructure is a war crime. “These were precision missiles aimed at people trying to seek humanitarian shelter.""",17,3.3795735163352,3.343413466947903,0.03616004938729711,0
2022-04-07,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/intercepted-russian-radio-hears-soldiers-26662592,Intercepted Russian radio hears troops 'talk about killing civilians' in Ukraine,"Intercepted Russian radio heard soldiers discussing gunning down and killing civilians, Ukrainian intelligence has claimed. One of Moscow’s commander’s allegedly was heard screaming “kill them all” after soldiers said they had innocent civilians in their sights. Kyiv’s intelligence claimed they hacked a call during the ongoing battle of Mariupol, where an estimated 150,000 people remain trapped in the city where at least 5,000 people have been killed so far. In the intercepted call, a Russian soldier told his commander he could see two people wearing civilian clothing. The commander then responds: “Take them all out! Kill them all!” The soldier replies: “Understood.” The commander follows up with: “What are you waiting for?” He’s told “it is a village of civilians” before the Russian commander yells: “Shoot the civilian cars.” The clip was released by Ukrainian intelligence and has not been independently verified, but a BBC investigation suggested it was shot on or before March 29, west of Kyiv. This is far from the only intercepted communications that seem to have exposed Russian atrocities during the ongoing war. Germany’s spy agency picked up radio transmissions in which Russian soldiers chatted about carrying out the murders of several Ukrainians. BND officials presented the country’s parliament with the update on Wednesday after making the interception. News magazine Der Spiegel reported the chatter related to the deaths of people in the town of Bucha, the town occupied by Russian soldiers for more than a month and where 300 people were killed. But a source said they could not be sure. They said: “It's true that the federal government has indications of Russian perpetration in Bucha. ""However, these findings on Bucha refer to satellite images. The radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" In one of the transmissions a Russian is heard telling another how he shot someone on a bicycle, with some connecting it to an image of a dead body seen next to a bike in Bucha. In another a soldier says: “Firstly you question the soldier, then you shoot them.” Last month in intercepted radio transmissions Russian soldiers were heard talking of “raping girls” and “eating dogs” in horrifying audio clips. In audio obtained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SSU), Russian soldiers can be heard nonchalantly speaking in their native language about the vile acts to others over the radio. “We have three tank guys here,” a man can be heard saying in the first clip. “They raped a girl.” A woman’s voice interrupts, to ask “who did?” “The three tankers,” the man responds. “She was 16 years old.” The woman asks if he’s talking about “our guys”, to which the man responds “yep”. The next audio clip opens with a male voice asking another man “are you eating okay at least?” In response, the second male voice responds, “not too bad”. “We had Alabay (dog) yesterday”. It comes as Vladimir Putin' s flunky Dmitry Peskov insisted no war crimes have been committed in Ukraine on the same day Russia was kicked out of the UN Human Rights Council. Putin's press secretary branded the claims the Russian military was shelling civilians as ""fake"" and went as far as to say the atrocities in Bucha were a ""well-staged simulation"". Speaking to Mark Austin on Sky News this afternoon from his office in the Kremlin, Peskov reasserted his leader's position that the Russian invasion was a ""special military operation"", claiming his country was under a security threat. Mark challenged Peskov on if what was happening in Ukraine was really going to plan if they were withdrawing. Peskov said the troops are really withdrawing as ""an act of goodwill between Russia and Ukraine"" to ""lift regional tension"" and ""show Russia is ready to create comfortable conditions"". Peskov said: ""We insist that Bucha is a well-staged simulation...those people you see...they are not victims of Russia."" When faced with graphic images of the massacre in Bucha, Peskov double-down saying they were fake and staged after the Russian military had withdrawn, despite Mark insisting they have been verified and geolocated. He said: ""I will tell you it's fake.” Earlier today Russia followed Syria in 2011 in being suspended from the UN Human Rights Council after a vote of the UN General Council.

The US-led push came after harrowing reports of violations from Vladimir Putin’s bloody invasion of Ukraine, including in the northern town recently liberated from Russian soldiers who are accused of massacring hundreds. Russia was kicked out after a vote this afternoon was approved with 93 votes in favour, 24 against and 59 abstentions from member countries. The resolution expressed “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine”. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, put forward the proposal earlier this week following horrifying accounts from Bucha of Russians torturing and murdering Ukrainian citizens. She said during a visit to Romania: ""Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce. ""It is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the UN General Assembly vote to remove them. ""My message to those 140 countries who have courageously stood together is: the images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us to now match our words with action."" Among those opposing Russia's suspension were China, Belarus and North Korea. Earlier this week Russia made a veiled threat against the UN, suggesting that should it be suspended it would interpret countries voting it out as support of a US plan to ""isolate"" the nation. Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, earlier described the attempt to exclude Russia from the council as ""unbelievable"". He added: ""This is again unprecedented and this will not facilitate or encourage or be helpful to what is happening between Russia and the Ukrainian peace talks."" An investigation into allegations of rights violations, including possible war crimes, in Ukraine since Russia began its invasion in February was opened by the council last month. Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said he was ""grateful"" to UN members for suspending Russia from the council. He wrote on Twitter: ""War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. ""Grateful to all member states which supported the relevant UNGA resolution and chose the right side of history."" Suspensions from the council are rare with the only other country suffering the fate was Libya in 2011 after violence against protesters by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi. It comes after Ukrainian officials vowed to hunt down the ""butchers of Bucha"" after hundreds of dead civilians were discovered. Kyiv intelligence sources have named Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade which occupied the region - as the commander in the area. Growing evidence points to barbarism in Bucha with local women and children raped and shot and demands are growing for accountability over atrocities by Vladimir Putin's forces. Zelensky has warned that worse evidence of mass killings of civilians by Moscow will emerge as the Russian president repositions his troops to the south-east.

Peskov said: ""Mariupol will be liberated from nationalists battalions and we hope it happens sooner than later."" He continued: ""The hospital was a fake and we have very serious reason to believe it was a fake."" Mark continued to challenge Peskov on civilian casualties and asked about the horrifying reports from Bucha. Peskov chillingly said: ""We insist that Bucha is a well-staged simulation..those people you see..they are not victims of Russia."" When faced with graphic images of the massacre in Bucha, Peskov double-down saying they were fake and staged after the Russian military had withdrawn, despite Mark insisting they have been verified and geolocated. He said: ""I will tell you it's fake. Peskov added: ""We know pretty well the company that has provided these satellite images they work with the pentagon...its interesting to know that they don't have exact dates on their images so it's impossible to locate an exact date of those satellite pictures...we insist they were made after Russian troops had withdrawn."" Mark then showed a video of a civilian woman who was killed by Russian tanks, and Peskov continued to deny the allegations even as he was faced with images of Russian tanks. Mark showed the tanks have a 'V' marking on them, which is seen on Russian tanks. Peskov said: ""Those are not the tanks that were shooting. What you are showing right now is not the right tank...you have to be careful what you are showing."" When pressed on branding these claims as fakes, Peskov said: ""Well of course it can be a play of fakes, you can attach any date to an image that was made through satellite we have to doubt something..you cannot be without an investigation...you can't blame everything on Russia."" Peskov shockingly tried to blame the atrocities in Mariupol and Bucha by Ukrainian nationalists. He said: ""We have an even bigger amount of eyewitnesses of people who took part in these various situations in Mariupol and Bucha that were telling us the terrible stories of that nationalist battalion people...torturing people and not letting them leave the town."" However, he contradicted himself when saying he would be open to an independent investigation but said Russia has a ""bitter history"" with international investigations. Russia withdrew its membership from the International Criminal Court in 2016. Earlier today , Russia was suspended from the UN Human Rights Council after a vote of the UN General Council was called following the horrific scenes of death reported in Bucha. Russia was kicked out after a vote this afternoon was approved with 93 votes in favour, 24 against and 59 abstentions from member countries. Among other hard denials made by Peskov, came more shocking allegations. He claimed Ukrainian nationalists are not allowing civilians to leave and are using them as human shields against the Russian military. Peskov said: ""It's about Ukrainian nationalist personnel trying to use civil people as a shield so they are covering themselves with civil people and not letting them leave...at the start we were never shelling civil objects we were attacking military infrastructure."" It comes as NATO's Secretary-General warned that Russian forces are getting ready for a “major offensive” in eastern Ukraine - and NATO needs to be “prepared for the long haul"". Jens Stoltenberg said talks would focus on what extra military equipment members can provide to Kyiv as Ukrainian troops battle to repel Kremlin invaders.

Tetiana Oleksiienko, 69, said she was horrified when sick soldiers threatened her while digging in her garden - explaining how she stared death in the face. Fearing for her life under the threats of the sadistic soldiers, Oleksiienko fled her village if Andrivka, situated 70km outside Kyiv. She then hid in a neighbour's cellar with her terrified daughter and grandchildren.

""I asked them: ‘What is this pit in my garden?’ And the soldiers said: ‘This is a cemetery.’ That’s what they said: ‘This is a graveyard for you.’"" She went on to say Putin's thugs were digging the pit with a view to use it as a mass grave. Oleksiienko added: ""They only failed to fill it because the Ukrainians took back control."" It comes as Russia is accused of carrying out a string of war crimes across Ukraine. Hundreds of civilians were slaughtered in the city of Bucha - with Ukrainian authorities branding Russian killers the ""butchers of Bucha"". Earlier horrifying reports also said Ukrainian women are resorting to cutting off their hair in an attempt to stop Russians from raping them, according to a town’s mayor. The world has been sickened by recent allegations suggesting invading troops are using sex attacks as a weapon of war in the under siege country. Horrifying stories have emerged from several towns and cities of troops raping women and girls in front of their families. In one account two teenage girls were raped in Ivankiv, a small town recently liberated from Russian occupiers. Deputy mayor Maryna Beschastna said the town's women are cutting off their hair to be “less attractive” to the troops, ITV reported. She said: “There was a case in one village, two sister were raped… girls of 15 and 16… children. “Women were pulled by their hair out of their basements, so that they could abuse them. ""Girls started cutting their hair short to be less attractive, so no one looks at them anymore.” The claim comes as testimony uncovered by human rights groups have ramped up calls for troops to be held accountable for their actions. Charity Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had uncovered evidence of ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence"" against Ukrainian civilians, and said these must be investigated as war crimes.",13,2.472330760096524,4.625499875277777,-2.153169115181253,22

""Off them all, f***!"" he can be heard shouting. Morale among Russian soldiers appears to be low in the leaked recording, with one soldier complaining they're hopelessly outnumbered by the Ukrainians. ""Their group has 150,000 soldiers and there's f***ing 3,000 of us... They are on the left, right, encircling us, f***!"" he can be heard saying. ""There's so many of them and few of us. We don't have any support, no aviation, not a f***ing thing!'"" Ukraine says it has been able to listen in on a lot of Russian communications because their military still relies on relatively unsophisticated technology or even walkie-talkies. The horrifying audio sheds new light on the merciless violence that has been inflicted on the Ukrainian people since Russia invaded on February 24. Mariupol, a port city located in the southeast between Crimea and the Donbas region, has been one of the central targets of Russian aggression with up to 90% of the city's infrastructure believed to have been destroyed in airstrikes in recent weeks. It had a population of about 400,000 before the war, and around 300,000 remain trapped in the city now under siege, although other estimates put this figure at somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000. Up to 5,000 people are thought to have been killed in Mariupol since the shelling began, with many deaths attributed to starvation after the city's water and electricity was cut off. On March 20 Russian forces brutally bombed an art school that was sheltering 400 women, children and elderly people, ignoring the word ""children"" that had been desperately scrawled on the ground outside. One local woman said the corpses of the dead are having to be buried in sandpits in the city's kindergartens because it is softer and easier to dig quickly between airstrikes. ""I saw so many bodies, no one was able to pick all of them up,"" she told the Independent after escaping to the city of Zaporizhzhia, 200km north of Mariupol. ""People are burying them in the sand pits on top of each other."" Ukraine security officials claim Russia is preparing a ""false flag"" attack on Mariupol, which they will allegedly use to blame Ukrainian soldiers of committing against their own people. ""The main task of Russian propaganda today is to divert the attention of the audience, both international and domestic, as much as possible,"" the SBU has said. ""According to existing data, the occupiers are preparing a large-scale falsification: They plan to collect the bodies of Mariupol residents killed by the Russians themselves, and present them as mass victims of the Ukrainian troops. ""For this reason, there have been false theses recently that Ukrainians use peaceful residents as human shields."" Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said of the attacks on Mariupol: ""To do this to a peaceful city... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come.""",17,3.8981771374063787,3.8420484844250455,0.05612865298133318,21

The hand in a heartbreaking picture has been identified as belonging to 52-year-old Iryna Filkina. Anastasiia Subacheva, a make-up artist from the nearby city of Gostomel, recognised the perfectly manicured fingers with red and white nail polish that had been photographed lying on the gravel. Subacheva said she felt her heart break the moment she spotted the lifeless hand on the street after Russian forces launched a barbaric attack on the city. She said: ""When I saw it, I felt physically like my heart started to break."" Ms. Subacheva, who has worked as a make-up artist in Bucha for five years, said she knew a lot of women there because she did their beauty treatments, reports the New York Times. Horrifically, her death appears to have captured in drone footage as she was pushing her bicycle home. The harrowing video suggests she was struck by a Russian tank, the armoured vehicle opening fire on the defenceless woman as she turned the corner. Her daughter - who fled Bucha before Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine - said that she pleaded with her mother not to cycle home on the day that she was killed. Iryna was a heating station operator who had reportedly reached out to Ms. Subacheva to inquire about makeup classes in a bid to follow her dream of becoming popular and increasing the number of her Instagram followers. It was earlier reported Ukrainian women are resorting to cutting off their hair in an attempt to stop Russians from raping them, according to a town’s mayor. In one account two teenage girls were raped in Ivankiv, a small town recently liberated from Russian occupiers. Deputy mayor Maryna Beschastna said the town's women are cutting off their hair to be “less attractive” to the troops, ITV reported. She said: “There was a case in one village, two sister were raped… girls of 15 and 16… children. It comes after Ukrainian officials have vowed to hunt down the ""butchers of Bucha"" after hundreds of dead civilians were discovered. Kyiv intelligence sources have named Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade which occupied the region - as the commander in the area. Growing evidence points to barbarism in Bucha with local women and children raped and shot and demands are growing for accountability over atrocities by Vladimir Putin's forces. Zelensky has warned that worse evidence of mass killings of civilians by Moscow will emerge as the Russian president repositions his troops to the south-east.

The men were from key airborne forces headquarters Pskov in northern Russia - with some now possibly facing criminal charges for the actions. The refusenik troops had been moved to Belarus as part of the invasion force but after their mutiny were sent in disgrace back to their base in Pskov. Some have been dismissed and branded “cowards” while others are set to face the Russian equivalent of a court martial with likely jail sentences. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu is reported to have sent one of his deputies to Pskov to handle the insubordination. Ukraine claimed that the 60 or so troops were elite paratroopers but this is not so far confirmed, even though they are from Pskov, a key HQ of Russia’s most elite airborne forces. Russian opposition outlet Pskovskaya Guberniya reported: “About 60 servicemen from Pskov refused to go to war on Ukrainian territory, according to our sources. “After the first days of the war, they were first brought to the Republic of Belarus, and then they returned to their base in Pskov. “Most of them are currently being dismissed, but some are threatened with criminal cases.” It is the latest of several cases of Russian troops refusing to obey Vladimir Putin ’s orders to invade Ukraine and “deNazify” the country. An earlier captive Russian soldier from Pskov, Vladimir Safronov, 23, told his Ukrainian interrogators about problems with rations, and how his officers were looting the civilian population. “Things are bad with food, we are constantly saving it,” he said. “Very often we have a situation that a ration for one person is shared between two people. “We are eating mostly what we find inside [civilian] houses [in occupied Ukraine]. He said: “There is a lot of looting, I’ve personally seen it. “I don’t support it, it was mainly senior sergeants and the commander who did it… “I saw civilians who were hiding, people who were unable to evacuate, who lived in constant fear. “I felt awfully sorry for them, it was scary to find them.” Earlier reports said that elite OMON special forces troops from Khakassia had refused to fight. In another case, troops from unofficial statelet South Ossetia reportedly went on foot back to their homes after refusing to participate on hostilities in Ukraine.",14,4.300545710084258,4.886211600069374,-0.5856658899851164,21

The footage shot from above and shared on Telegram, appears to show a Ukrainian T-64 tank ambushing a convoy of Russian BTR-82A armoured vehicles on a road in Nova Basan - 50 miles west of Kyiv. The operator fired several rounds at the Russian convoy and causing one BTR to alight on fire. The other armoured vehicles then started firing back at the tank, and appeared to fire at targets not seen in the shot as streaks of fire were seen going across fields. However, the tank pushed forward and continued shelling the Russian troops until artillery reinforcements arrived. It comes as NATO's Secretary-General warned that Russian forces are getting ready for a “major offensive” in eastern Ukraine - and NATO needs to be “prepared for the long haul"". Opening a two-day summit of coalition foreign ministers on Wednesday, Jens Stoltenberg said talks would focus on what extra military equipment members can provide to Kyiv as Ukrainian troops battle to repel Kremlin invaders. The war had reached a “critical phase”, said former Norwegian PM Mr Stoltenberg, as he predicted a battle for Donbas in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have battled Ukrainian soldiers since 2014. “ Russia is moving forces out of the north to reinforce them, to resupply them, re-arm them and then to move them into the east where we are expecting a major offensive,” said the Secretary-General. “Putin’s aim is to try to control the whole of Donbas.” He said it was still the Russian leader’s ambition to “rewrite the international order”, adding: “We need to be prepared for the long haul.” Alliance countries were playing a leading role in gathering evidence for potential prosecutions, said Mr Stotlenberg. He added: “Any targeting and killing of civilians is a war crime and therefore NATO allies are supporting the international efforts to establish all the facts, to investigate and to make sure that perpetrators are punished.” The possible entry of Finland and Sweden into NATO could be “quite smooth” if they applied to join the alliance, he added.",14,4.664379004640331,4.610902543890541,0.05347646074979018,8

Shane Matthew, 34, was in the war-torn country for around a month on Ukraine's frontline witnessing the horrors of the Russian invasion. The former British Army sniper has seen a lot of fighting since his arrival in the battle-ravaged country, as part of the Foreign Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine. The group was formed by President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, who urged foreigners to come to Ukraine to help repel Vladimir Putin's war machine. A fully qualified field medic, Mr Matthew started out in the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment based in Portsmouth before leaving to try his hand at private military contracting. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here He has combat experience in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, but described Ukraine as ""one of the most horrendous experiences of my life"". Mr Matthew, who works on Crimsham Farm in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, left his Chichester home last month to help Ukrainian nationals defend their home from Russian invaders. He ""snuck back home"" on Saturday night, having trained more than 1,000 Ukrainian volunteers in basic first aid and fundamental soldiering. Although impressed by the fighting grit of the Ukrainian people and optimistic about their chances against the Russians, Mr Matthew was horrified by what he saw. He said: ""We were stuck outside Bucha and I was fighting for four days. When we managed to get control of the city, we discovered what's being broadcast on the news at the moment. ""Streets littered with dead bodies. Children with their hands bound and their heads shot. It's beyond atrocious."" Determined to document the hardship, Mr Matthew plans to return to Ukraine in a few weeks time, taking a camera with him to get the truth out to as many people as possible. He added: ""I want to photograph what's happened and get it out in the public that war crimes have been committed. I want people to see exactly what's been going on."" Mr Matthew flew to Poland at the start of last month, before crossing the border and meeting a Ukrainian colonel, who agreed to ""arm him"" and 21 other volunteer fighters. From there the experienced sniper travelled to Ukraine's under-siege capital, transporting some 60kg of medical supplies that had been donated to him. The former military contractor hit the frontline, helping treat wounded Ukrainians and providing training for civilians rising up against Putin's forces. Since Russia forces retreated from Buch and Irpin, just outside Kyiv, harrowing images of the devastation caused by the occupation have emerged. Civilians shot dead with their hands tied behind their backs and mass graves were uncovered, along with allegations of women being raped and killed in front of their children. President Zelensky told the UN Security Council yesterday (Tues) there was ""not a single crime"" that Russian troops had not committed in Bucha. The International Criminal Court (ICC) launched an investigation into the claims of war crimes and could issue arrest warrants to bring the perpetrators to trial in The Hague.",13,3.3486365710327677,3.2355573815349548,0.11307918949781293,2

Health Secretary Sajid Javid expressed horror at the atrocities uncovered as Russian forces withdrew from towns around Kyiv and compared the scenes to the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia in 1995. Ukrainian troops have been showing journalists grim scenes of bodies of civilians, destroyed houses and burnt-out cars in the streets in Bucha. ""This is mass murder on an unprecedented scale in Europe. We haven't seen the likes of this I think since 1995,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""I don't want to be commemorating another genocide in Europe years from now. ""We have the power, the world has the power to stop this, and it must act."" Ukraine has compared the mass graves found outside Bucha, north-west of Kyiv, to the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995 when Bosnian Serb forces killed men and boys in what is regarded as Europe's worst atrocity since the Second World War. The UK Government has said it appears Putin's forces are committing war crimes but it has not gone as far as declaring the Russians have enacted genocide in Ukraine Former British Army chief Lord Dannatt said Russia's war in Ukraine increasingly looks ""like genocide that is plotted from the top"". He told Sky News: ""The war crimes are stacking up to the point that it looks like a concerted effort to reduce the Ukrainian population, and that is getting very close to the definition of genocide. ""It's absolutely right and proper that all these war crimes are being chronicled and evidence is being gathered. ""It is looking to me increasingly like genocide that is plotted from the top. The top, therefore, must bear responsibility and maybe one day, even if not in a physical court but in a court of history, be condemned."" Lord Dannatt was unsure if Vladimir Putin or his senior generals would face trial, but added that it is still possible. He told the programme: ""If you think back to the early, dark days of the Bosnian civil war, it seemed inconceivable that Milosevic (former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic) and Karadzic (Bosnian Serb former leader Radovan Karadzic) would find their way into court, but they did. ""It became perfectly possible to trace what had happened on the ground all the way up to them through this concept of command responsibility such that they were convicted.""

Alliance envoys, including Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and coalition Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, meet for negotiations at its Brussels headquarters as fighting continues in Ukraine. Ms Truss is set to use the two-day NATO summit to press for tougher sanctions against Russia.

The world has been sickened by recent allegations suggesting invading troops are using sex attacks as a weapon of war in the under siege country. Horrifying stories have emerged from several towns and cities of troops raping women and girls in front of their families. In one account two teenage girls were raped in Ivankiv, a small town recently liberated from Russian occupiers. Deputy mayor Maryna Beschastna said the town's women are cutting off their hair to be “less attractive” to the troops, ITV reported. She said: “There was a case in one village, two sister were raped… girls of 15 and 16… children. “Women were pulled by their hair out of their basements, so that they could abuse them. ""Girls started cutting their hair short to be less attractive, so no one looks at them anymore.” The claim comes as testimony uncovered by human rights groups have ramped up calls for troops to be held accountable for their actions. Charity Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had uncovered evidence of ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence"" against Ukrainian civilians, and said these must be investigated as war crimes. Melinda Simmons, British Ambassador to Ukraine, posted on Twitter : ""Rape is a weapon of war. Though we don’t yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine it’s already clear it was part of (Russian) arsenal. ""Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime."" A villager in Mala Rohan described a very similar account of a 27-year-old woman with a five year old daughter being raped by a teenage Russian soldier. The 55-year-old, named Sergei, told The Independent: “The soldier who did it was a young guy, 19 years old. He had been drinking all day before he raped the poor girl. ""He was out of control."" Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at the charity, said: “The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.” He continued: “ Russia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers. “Commanders should recognize that a failure to take action against murder and rape may make them personally responsible for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.”",13,4.142489988464027,2.088046644621368,2.0544433438426593,22

At least 410 were killed in and around Bucha, Ukraine said, with President Volodymyr Zelensky describing the slaughter as ""genocide"". Yesterday a mass grave of 57 bodies was uncovered in the city. Pictures taken on March 19 reveal dark objects found in the same places where rotting corpses were found after Russia withdrew. Private surveillance company Maxar Technologies also uncovered a 45ft trench where a mass grave was found in satellite images. Maxar spokesman Stephen Wood said in a statement: ""High-resolution Maxar satellite imagery collected over Bucha, Ukraine (northwest of Kyiv) verifies and corroborates recent social media videos and photos that reveal bodies lying in the streets and left out in the open for weeks."" The company previously said the first signs of excavation for a mass grave at the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints were seen on March 10. In a press conference Russian envoy to the UN Vassily Nebenzia falsely tried to pass the blame for the murders on Ukraine. She claimed the heartbreaking scenes were ""arranged by the Ukrainian information, information warfare machine"". Speaking from Bucha, Mr Zelensky vowed that Putin and his troops would be punished for the alleged war crimes. He said: ""It's very difficult to talk. It's very difficult to negotiate when you see what they did here. ""Every day we find people in barrels, cellars and everywhere else, some strangled, some clearly tortured."" He continued to reporters: ""These are war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide. You are here today and can see what happened. ""We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women, murdered children. I think it is more than ... this is a genocide."" Earlier today The Mirror reported that the Russian commander behind the atrocities in Bucha has been named and pictured. Kyiv intelligence sources have named Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade which occupied the region - as the commander in the area.

Heroic president Volodymyr Zelensky went into graphic detail about alleged atrocities committed by Russian troops in recently liberated towns and cities in Ukraine. He told the Security Council soldiers had slit the throats of non-combatants, raped and killed mothers in front of their children, and cut out tongues ""because they didn’t hear what they wanted to."" Mr Zelensky was referring to alleged war crimes committed in the town of Bucha - just northwest of Kyiv - which was recently abandoned by Russian forces after Vladimir Putin ordered the military refocus their brutal efforts in the Donbass region. The Ukrainian leader went on to say the atrocities were ""just for their pleasure"" and that soldiers ""cut off limbs"" and ""slashed their [civillian's] throats"". The president then compared Russia to ISIS during his address to the UN Security Council today. Mr Zelesnky, who visited Bucha yesterday, said there was ""not a single crime that they (Russian forces) would not commit"". Mr Zelensky said entire families had been slaughtered and troops tried to burn their bodies, and that people were shot in the street or thrown into wells. He said: ""This is no different from other terrorists such as Daesh who occupy some territories, and here it is done by a member of the United Nations Security Council."" He said: ""They support hatred at the level of the state and seek to export it to other countries through their system of propaganda and political corruption."" Though Bucha is the town that has become the focal point of the war crime allegations against Moscow, Mr Zelensky said it is ""only one of many examples"" of where Russian troops murdered, raped and mutilated innocents. During the meeting, convened by the UK, Mr Zelensky said: ""Today, as a result of Russia's actions in our country, in Ukraine the most terrible war crimes of all times, that we've seen since the end of World War Two, have been committed. ""Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes, they are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. ""They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from the hostilities. ""They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from air strikes. They are deliberately creating conditions in the temporarily occupied territories so that as many civilians as possible are killed there. ""The massacre in our city of Bucha is unfortunately only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days, and there are many similar cities, similar places, where the world has yet to learnt he full truth... dozens of other Ukrainians communities, each of them similar to Bucha."" Mr Zelensky then called for the UN to be reformed to combat Russian aggression. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has a veto with which it is able to block attempts to censure the Kremlin. ""This undermines the whole architecture of global security, it allows them to go unpunished so they are destroying everything that they can,"" he said. Ukrainian president Mr Zelensky said: ""Russia's leadership feels like colonisers in ancient times, they need our wealth, our people - Russia has already deported hundreds of thousands of our citizens to their country, they abducted more than 2,000 children."" He told the United Nations that Russia's forces were engaged in ""widescale looting"" from food to gold earrings ""pulled out and covered with blood"".

But there are mounting fears they are also prepared to commit even more barbaric war crimes in other areas of Ukraine to the east of the country. Ukrainian spies believe the notorious 64th Motorised Rifle Brigade will be sent into battle “hotspots” with little chance of survival, as the Kremlin scrambles to try and avoid them being alive for war crimes trials. Today Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence Agency said: ”Russian command will not rotate personnel in this unit and will throw them back to the frontline. “The Russian servicemen who committed atrocities in Bucha are being returned to Ukraine. “The 64th Motorised Rifle Brigade of the 35th All Russian Army whose servicemen committed mass murder and tortured civilians will be returned to Ukraine.” Sources said they believe Russia wants the men to be killed so there will be no living witnesses to the Bucha killings. They are thought to include “Butcher of Bucha” Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade. After his troops pulled out of Bucha more than 410 corpses were discovered of civilians, many of them with their hands tied and executed with a bullet to the head. Torture chambers have been found, where men were brutally beaten before being killed and the bodies of women and children have also been discovered. The remains have been removed from the town and are being examined by forensic experts preparing to present evidence in future war crimes trials. Today’s statement from intelligence chiefs added: “Another goal of the rapid return of the 64th Brigade to the territory of Ukraine is the rapid disposal of unnecessary witnesses. “That is redeployment to a section of the front where they will have no chance of surviving to make it impossible to testify in future courts.” It goes on to claim the disgraced troops have opposed the move but they have been ignored and will get just two days’ leave before going back into battle. Russia is under increasing pressure as its military has now suffered a death toll of almost 20,000 in almost six weeks of fighting. Moscow’s forces are continuing to suffer huge losses, retreating from major cities in central Ukraine, heading north from Kyiv and east towards Donbas. They have left dead bodies booby-trapped and trip-wires attached to grenades and mines in their wake, adding to the horror facing returning civilians. Luhansk governor Sergiy Gaiday said Russia is planning a major attack in the region as he ordered a mass evacuation. It is feared 60,000 Russian reservists are being called up to bolster a fresh offensive in the east in contested Donbas and possibly Kharkiv. Today Ukraine also revealed the Kremlin is planning more horrific “false flag” provocations - resorting to using the remains of Mariupol’s citizens. Kyiv’s SBU intelligence agency believes Kremlin spooks plan to pile more horror on the stricken port by claiming the dead were massacred by Ukraine. The agency - Ukraine’s equivalent of MI5- said: “According to available date the occupiers are preparing a large-scale falsification. “They plan to gather in one place the bodies of Mariupol residents killed by the Russians themselves and present them as mass victims of Ukrainian troops. “False theories have been circulating that ‘Ukrainians are using civilians as human shields. This is an outright delusion.” Sources have told the Daily Mirror that Ukraine’s intelligence agencies have had huge support from western intelligence, especially the UK and US. It has led to Moscow’s covert operations and false flag plans being leaked repeatedly as Ukraine has been able to second-guess the Kremlin. The Mirror understands that much of this intelligence has been hoovered up by British spy planes patrolling the region in the build-up to the invasion. Ukraine has also had constant updates from western allies on telephone conversations and other communications between Russian commanders. Today NATO warned of a fresh offensive by Russia in the east of Ukraine. The alliance’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: “We are seeing a new face of the war.” He added that Putin’s troops are being “remanned” and “rearmed” ahead of a “new, very concentrated Russian offensive in Donbas.” The Donbas region has been heavily contested between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists backed by regular Moscow troops for over eight years. The war in east Ukraine was triggered by the pro-European Maidan protests in 2014 which led to Putin ordering the annexing of Crimea and the arming of separatists. Moscow’s GRU spooks also spread lies via puppet media throughout the region and Russia about Kyiv’s government being supported by “fascists.” Putin’s argument for the invasion of “denazification” has been justified by the false narrative already spread about nazis being rife in Ukraine.",14,3.614457892687402,4.062919206838851,-0.44846131415144885,22

Bodies with bound hands, close-range gunshot wounds and signs of torture lay scattered across cities including Bucha and Hostomel causing global outrage. As Russian troops have eased back from their attacks on Kyiv and northern Ukraine, the extent of the devastation caused by the invasion is beginning to be fully understood. And there are reports of apparent torture and murder of civilians with bodies lying in the streets and claims of how people were randomly gunned down. Hostomel was the scene of intense fighting at the start of the invasion before Ukraine soldiers finally regained control of the strategically important airport. The Hostomel mayor Yriy Pzylyko was among those killed and his body was left with explosives to try and cause more death and destruction, reported The Times. Archpriest Piotr Pavlenko went to see the body of the mayor who was his friend but he was told not to touch the corpse as it would explode. It follows reports that bodies were left rigged with explosives in Irpin on top of the signs of torture taking place in Bucha. Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Yurchenko claimed the attacks on civilians in Bucha were especially disturbing. “Bucha was not so badly damaged as Hostomel but crimes were carried out deliberately on the civilians,” Yurchenko said, reported The Times. “Now we are discovering this is the case for so many places that the Russians occupied. In places where the fighting was intense, like Hostomel, probably more people have been killed. In occupied places like Bucha, women were raped, children were shot, people’s bodies were run over.” President Volodymyr Zelensky also hit out at the torture and claimed bodies were ""mined"". ""After what was revealed in Bucha and our other cities the occupiers were expelled from. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Corpses on the streets. Mined area. Even the bodies of the dead were mined,"" he said. ""The pervasive consequences of looting. Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers. Torturers. Rapists. Looters. Who call themselves the army. And who deserve only death after what they did."" Zelensky gave a message to Russians wanting mothers to know what the soldiers were doing to civilians in Ukraine. ""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed?"" he said. ""What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? ""How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible? ""Russian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers? You couldn't be unaware of what's inside your children. You couldn't overlook that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure.""",13,2.5119597275364614,3.9677519014657734,-1.455792173929312,22
2022-04-05,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/hundreds-dogs-found-starved-death-26636879,Hundreds of dogs found starved to death at shelter after Russian invasion,"Hundreds of dogs have died at an animal shelter in Ukraine after being locked in their cages since the start of the Russian invasion, according to reports. More than 300 dogs have reportedly died in Ukraine 's Borodyanka since February 24. Charity UAnimals said 485 dogs were locked in their cages as volunteers were unable to return to the shelter because of the war. When volunteers finally did manage to go back on Friday, they sadly found only 150 of the 485 dogs alive, CBS News reports. Oleksandra Matviichuk, lawyer and head of Ukraine nonprofit Centre for Civil Liberties, tweeted a video which appeared to show dead dogs piled up on the floor. She wrote: ""I have no words. Russians even killed dozens of dogs in Kyiv region. Why??"" The charity said 27 of the dogs which survived were in a critical condition and have been taken to clinics for treatment. UAnimals has taken in some of the dogs themselves while they are also offering a reward of 50,000 hryvnias (£1,293) for anyone willing to look after any of the others, the Independent reports. Last month it was reported that Ukrainians in Mariupol were forced to kill and eat dogs due to the lack of food. The southern port city was being bombarded for most of the month and became surrounded by Russian forces, which were stopping crucial supplies getting in. Dmytro, a businessman who left the city, said that people in Mariupol were resorting to desperate measures. “You hear the words but it’s impossible to really take them in, to believe this is happening,” he told the FT on claims that people were having to eat dogs. “It is hell on earth.” President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday Ukraine had no option but to negotiate with Russia to end fighting but that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin might not personally hold talks. Zelensky was speaking after accusing Russian troops of carrying out extra-judicial killings in the town of Bucha west of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the reports of civilian killings in Bucha were ""fakes"" aimed at discrediting Russia. Moscow said it would present ""empirical evidence"" to a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday proving its forces were not involved. ""All of us, including myself, will perceive even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge,"" Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian journalists broadcast on national television. ""The challenge is internal, first of all, one's own, human challenge. Then, when you pull yourself together, and you have to do it, I think that we have no other choice.""",17,3.0743237871992846,4.636532082445365,-1.5622082952460805,22

It comes as ""mounting evidence"" of war crimes committed by Russian forces in the city near capital Kyiv will be discussed by a United Nations Security Council today. The Ukrainian President - who was seen holding back tears as he visited the aftermath on Monday - will address the council, which is pushing to ensure ""justice is done"". Volodymyr Zelensky surveyed the alleged atrocities near capital Kyiv, describing the discovery of raped women and murdered children among the dead. He was accompanied by defending servicemen after invading troops had retreated from the area. US President Joe Biden called for Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to face a war crimes trial, adding he is now seeking further sanctions against Russia. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone's seen it,"" he said in an impassioned speech last night. Ukrainian officials have vowed to hunt down the ""butchers of Bucha"" after hundreds of dead civilians were discovered. Kyiv intelligence sources have named Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade which occupied the region - as the commander in the area. Growing evidence points to barbarism in Bucha with local women and children raped and shot and demands are growing for accountability over atrocities by Vladimir Putin's forces. Zelensky has warned that worse evidence of mass killings of civilians by Moscow will emerge as the Russian president repositions his troops to the south-east. It will be his first address to the Security Council, whose presidency is held by the UK, with members including Russia and China. The Ukrainian leader accused Moscow of committing ""real genocide"", as he appeared visibly emotional, flanked by his soldiers and wearing a bullet-proof vest. Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said Mr Zelensky ""will give all the evidence"" to the international community at the Security Council meeting. ""If these awful atrocities will not change the agenda of all the world, what will change?"" the adviser asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Zhovkva said Ukraine needs ""additional weapons"", including tanks and missiles, to ""liberate more cities"" from Russia control. Dame Barbara Woodward, Britain's UN ambassador, called images coming from Bucha ""harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide"". She cited hundreds of bodies being dumped in the streets or in mass graves and allegations of rape. Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs."" He added: “Irpen, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with this, and is it worth living at all? How do I explain this to myself, how? “They must cease to exist. They must all be destroyed, each and every one of them, turned into dust, into mud, into clay, all of them.” Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identified the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia - and a number of other Russian military units. Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: ""In Bucha there was a military unit 51460 from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region... “Soon all these murderers, rapists and looters will be known by name."" InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit 51460 of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha. In the city, too, according to the Ukrainians, were forces from the Fifth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of 36th army of the Russian Eastern military district, the 331st Parachute Assault Regiment of 98th airborne division, the 137th Parachute Assault Regiment of 106th airborne division, the 104th and 234th Air Assault Regiments of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division, 14 and 45 separate guard brigades of special purpose; the 63rd special operational regiments of the Russian national guard, and the 155th separate guards brigade of marines of the Pacific Fleet. So far no commanders have been named from these forces apart from Omurbekov. Russian sources have hit back claiming the Ukrainians were responsible for the atrocities in Bucha and other locations - and are the ones guilty of war crimes. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these false accusations.” He said: ”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March 30. “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself. ""I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces.ed Forces. On the contrary, our troops delivered 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. ""Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US. “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, said: “There are no doubts that it is a staging organised by Kyiv authorities. “And the fact that the West has picked it up and is hyping it makes it an accomplice of this cynical and immoral crime.” Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia. ""I think that the very fact that these statements were made minutes after these materials were released leaves no doubts as for who has contracted this story,"" she told state-run Rossiya-1 television channel. The West decided immediately Russia was to blame “based on the videos, seconds-long videos and several photos. “And they are ready to pour accusations. “No expert work done, no information from the other side throwing light on what is going on..."" She claimed the massacres were ""a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks. Also today, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will hold talks with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, during the second day of her visit to the capital, Warsaw. She has called for Russia to be hit with the ""maximum level"" of sanctions and for more weapons to be supplied to Mr Zelensky's forces to help repel the Kremlin's troops. ""The idea that we should wait for something else bad to happen is just completely wrong,"" she said, applying pressure to allies. ""The reality is that money is still flowing from the West into Putin's war machine - and that has to stop."" She pressed for a ""clear timetable"" to eliminate imports of Russian oil, gas and gold, and for a further crackdown on industries financing Moscow's invasion. Poland's prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for focusing on the ""voices of German businesses"" rather than the innocents slain in Ukraine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to urge Germany to set a date for phasing out Russian gas when he meets Mr Scholz in Downing Street on Friday.",13,3.011288036081056,4.170848514096095,-1.159560478015039,22
2022-04-05,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-pleading-60-year-olds-26637860,Russia pleading with 60-year-olds to 'volunteer' for army after heavy losses,"Russia has resorted to pleading with 60-year-old volunteers to sign up after suffering heavy losses since the start of its war in Ukraine. The military is recruiting former soldiers near civilian retirement in Chelyabinsk and Tyumen, two Siberian cities, according to Russian state media. It is understood that tank commanders, snipers and engineers are among the most sought after positions after a series of strategic blunders have left them short on the front line, The Times reported. It comes as Russia plunged to new desperate measures in an attempt to continue its brutal war with its neighbour by calling up 60,000 reservists, mainly from ethnic minority groups, as well as drafting some 134,500 new conscripts. The use of conscripts in the Russian president Vladimir Putin's bloody and violent war has been controversial with many inexperienced young men already killed or captured by Ukrainian forces. Conscripts are men aged between 18 and 27, who typically serve for one year but defence experts have said teenagers are being sent to the ""slaughterhouse"", prompting the Kremlin to U-turn and promise not to send new recruits into the heat of battle. However, it has since been reported that Putin plans to send 130,000 new conscripts to fight in Ukraine as Russia gets increasingly desperate for boots on the ground. A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “Putin has signed over 130,000 new conscripts into the Army. “The timing aligns with previous Spring drafts but we think that’s an unusually high number. “We do think there’s a realistic possibility these conscripts will be sent into Ukraine, even though the Russian MOD have said only professional soldiers will go to Ukraine.” They added Russia is deploying forces from Georgia, which it invaded in 2008. The official said: “Russia is redeploying elements of the forces that are in Georgia to reinforce the invasion of Ukraine. “We don’t think that this was planned, it’s a very odd thing for the Russian military to do. So we suspect it’s indicative of the problems they are having in Ukraine.”",14,4.528936323479984,4.72890254215616,-0.1999662186761757,4

Known only by the codename Charcoal, the decorated but masked woman returned to the frontline 35th infantry brigade of Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrogradsky with a pledge to ""take them all out"". This echoes Lyudmila Pavlichenko, a legendary Ukrainian sniper who manage to kill 309 Nazis during World War II and was given her country’s highest award, the Hero of the Soviet Union. Known as 'Lady Death of the Red Army', she's recognised as the most successful female sniper of all time, appearing on postage stamps and meeting the three Allied leaders Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin. Now, Charcoal - whose face remains partly covered to protect her identity - has followed in Pavlichenko's footsteps with her defiant stance. ""We must take them all out,"" she has pledged according to the Times. ""These people are not human beings. Even the fascists were not as vile as these orcs. We must defeat them."" She also vowed to fight Vladimir Putin 's invaders ""to the very end"". The sniper joined the Ukrainian marines in 2017 and has fought pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk, in the east of the country. The news comes as an elite Russian sniper believed to have killed dozens of people before being captured has been pictured relaxing between kills in war-torn Ukraine. Irina Starikova is understood to have been abandoned by her protectors after getting injured. The 41-year-old's capture will be a major new blow to Vladimir Putin, as the sharpshooter is alleged to have over 40 kills to her name. She is codenamed Bagheera after Rudyard Kipling’s black panther in The Jungle Book, but there have been misleading accounts of her true identity. The mother-of-two was found wounded on a battlefield in Ukraine, but she is not from Serbia as some accounts say, nor was she a nun-turned-sniper. In fact the captured sniper is originally from Donetsk and has two daughters - Valeria, 11, and Yulia, nine. She served with the Russian separatists in her home region - which had been fighting Kyiv since 2014. Ukrainian armed forces announced Starikova's capture saying she ""shot our prisoners in 2014"". Her capture has also been confirmed by Giorgi Revishvili, a researcher at the Department of War Studies at King’s College London. He tweeted “Ukrainian forces captured infamous sniper fighting on the side of ORDLO, call sign Bagira” - which refers to how the breakaway Russian-speaking regions are called. He added that she is allegedly responsible for “killing 40 Ukrainians including civilians”.",14,4.457952090925239,5.09398320307833,-0.6360311121530913,6

Volodymyr Zelensky accused his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin's forces of creating ""mass starvation"" and shooting and raping civilians during a graphic address to the United Nations (UN) Security Council on Tuesday. During the UK-convened meeting of the UN's most powerful body, whose membership includes Russia, Mr Zelensky called for those responsible to be ""brought to justice"" in a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials. Zelensky warned the world is yet to see the acts committed by the Kremlin's troops in other regions after evidence of atrocities was unearthed after their withdrawal from Bucha, near Kyiv. ""Today, as a result of Russia's actions in our country, in Ukraine, the most terrible war crimes we've seen since the end of World War Two are being committed,"" he said in the virtual address. ""Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. ""They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from the hostilities. ""They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from air strikes. ""The massacre in our city of Bucha is unfortunately only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days."" Mr Zelensky, in his first address to the council, accused Russia of ""wanting to turn Ukraine into silent slaves"" and its military of ""wide-scale looting"", stealing everything from food to bloodied jewellery. ""The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine,"" he said. ""Anyone who has given criminal orders and carried out them by killing our people will be brought before the tribunal, which should be similar to the Nuremberg tribunals."" Mr Zelensky played allies a video appearing to show bound, killed and burned civilians and mass graves in images from across his nation that the UK's ambassador to the UN Dame Barbara Woodward described as ""harrowing"". Meanwhile, on the second day of her trip to Warsaw, Ms Truss reiterated her vow to use Thursday's meeting of G7 and Nato allies to press for further sanctions. Having met Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and her Polish counterpart, she said economic actions so far are having a ""crippling impact"" and ""pushing the Russian economy back into the Soviet era"". She said the West has frozen more than 350 billion US dollars (£266 billion) of ""Putin's war chest"", rendering unavailable over 60% of the regime's 604 billion US dollars (£459 billion) of foreign currency reserves. But she said they must go further, to include further cracking down on Russian banks and ""going after industries that are filling Putin's war chest, like gold, and agreeing a clear timetable to eliminate our imports of Russian oil, coal and gas"". Mr Morawiecki has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for focusing on the ""voices of German businesses"" rather than the innocents killed in Ukraine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to urge Germany to set a date for phasing out Russian gas when he meets Mr Scholz in Downing Street on Friday. The UK, which currently holds the Security Council's presidency, convened the meeting to discuss seeking justice over the ""mounting evidence of war crimes"". Mr Zelensky made his address a day after visiting Bucha to witness the fallout and warning of further atrocities as the Russian president repositions his troops from around the capital to the south east. Russia's envoy to the UN Vasily Alekseevich Nebenzya also addressed the meeting, disputing the evidence of atrocities in Bucha, criticising Mr Zelensky and repeating baseless allegations of Nazism among Kyiv's leadership. However, the Kremlin's claims that the footage of bodies in the town has been ""staged"" has been contradicted by satellite images showing corpses in the street nearly two weeks before Russians fled the town. The Nuremberg trials were held to bring Nazi war criminals to justice following the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. The court cases, held in 1945 and 1946, tried the criminal actions of German professionals, industrialists, the SS, and the military officers tied to Adolf Hitler.",13,3.9379620107884508,2.89136832467074,1.0465936861177108,0

Footage shows what appears to be a decommissioned vehicle sent by London Ambulance Service go up in smoke under heavy fire from Russian tanks, in the southern Ukrainian city that has been under siege. It is yet another example of non-military targets that have been attacked by Vladimir Putin ’s invading army after atrocities came to light this week in cities on the outskirts of Kyiv that included claims of people being shot in the back of their head with their hands tied in Bucha. Ambulances packed with medical equipment were driven by 26 volunteers from the UK to Ukraine last week. Mykolaiv governor Vitaly Kim sarcastically suggested that the tanks were aiming at a robot that was put in the gardens of the children’s hospital for the benefit of the youngsters. He said: ""And then they were aiming at a super-modern robot on the territory of the hospital."" Head of the Mykolaiv Regional Council, Anna Zamazeeva, said on April 5 that the images showed ""yesterday's attack on a secret medical facility - an ambulance substation."" She added: ""The Russian occupiers yesterday again 'chaotically' fired rockets at Mykolaiv and Ochakov. But for some reason, most of the rockets flew to the area of hospitals, schools, nursery schools and residential areas... ""Unfortunately, yesterday, two children were injured from these shellings - a seven-year-old child in Ochakov and a fourteen-year-old child in Mykolaiv. ""Another child, unfortunately, died during the evening shelling. Sincere condolences to family and friends! We will never forgive the 'Russian world' for the suffering and death of our children! You will answer for everything!"" The siege of Mykolaiv began on the night of 26th February and is still ongoing. The city is a strategically important shipbuilding centre on the Black Sea as it lies en route to Odesa, which holds important status in Russian culture and history and is believed to be coveted by the Kremlin. Decommissioned ambulances are also being donated by South Central Ambulance Service with equipment to save hundreds of lives which have been collected by staff from bases across the south of England. Further lorry loads of vital items are set to leave from a base in Didcot, Oxfordshire, on Saturday, reported the Express. Kate Ellis, a paramedic team leader in Oxfordshire, said: ""The response we have seen throughout the organisation has been incredible from the very start and we have now ramped it up further with the donation of medical supplies and equipment which we know are so desperately needed in the conflict zones. ""This will help to ensure people can receive care for up to 24 hours while they await emergency surgery in hospital, meaning there is the potential for this work to help save hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. ""We estimate our volume of supplies will be able to supply one field hospital for up to two weeks and some of the equipment, such as the long boards and extrication devices, is of course reusable."" Will Hancock, chief executive of SCAS, said: ""We are all extremely proud of this work to support those most in need. ""The resolve everyone has shown to not only keep delivering in the day job after such a tough time of late but also drive forward with this outstanding voluntary programme is truly amazing."" Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement that its team witnessed Russian strikes during a visit on April 4 to a cancer hospital in Mykolaiv and managed to take cover and escape unharmed. ""Several explosions took place in close proximity to our staff over the course of about 10 minutes,"" said Michel-Olivier Lacharite, MSF head of mission in Ukraine.

A clip recorded next to the blitzed Russian military vehicle appears to show household items strewn on the ground after they were allegedly plundered when Vladimir Putin's troops scurried through civilian homes in Ukraine. Among the looted items on the video are cooking pans, electric drills, and even children's toys. In further signs that the Kremlin's chaotic invasion has descended into pandemonium, the troops were allegedly ambushed, in the northeastern town of Sumy, close to the Russian border. The footage was shared by German journalist, Julian Ropcke, who writes for Bild.de. He tweeted: ""These Russians stole pans, toys, drills. But for this group, the raid in Sumy ended in death."" A grim photo shows the corpses stacked on top of each other beside the armoured personnel carrier they went raiding in. Just days ago, Ukrainian sources claimed as many as 17,000 Russian troops have been slain during the five-week war. Estimates from NATO suggest the number is significantly lower, at between 7,000 and 15,000 soldiers. It comes after Moscow redrew its attack lines, ordering troops withdraw from areas of northern Ukraine to refocus efforts on the Donbass region. Over the past few days Ukraine has retaken over 30 towns and villages in the Kyiv region. As the Russian soldiers abandon the cities and towns, they've been leaving behind mines and booby traps, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And as journalists enter the ""liberated"" areas, evidence has emerged of alleged atrocities - including the rape of women and children, post-mortem mutilations of torture victims, and the extrajudicial slaughter of innocent civilians. The revelations of recent days come after Russia announced it was going to scale down military operations around Kyiv and refocus its efforts in the pro-Russia east. Some have speculated this was in an attempt to limit the country’s losses and reinforce its forces who are already stretched thin. In a video address released last week, President Zelensky said: ""In the north of our country, the invaders are leaving. “It is slow but noticeable. In some places they are being kicked out with fighting. Elsewhere they're abandoning the positions themselves. ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" But at the time, Zelensky was unaware of the full picture. In the days that followed, evidence of war crimes emerged from formerly occupied towns, like Bucha to the northwest of the capital. Zelensky today told the UN Security Council soldiers had slit the throats of non-combatants, raped and killed mothers in front of their children, and cut out tongues ""because they didn’t hear what they wanted to."" The Ukrainian leader went on to say the atrocities were ""just for their pleasure"" and that soldiers ""cut off limbs"" and ""slashed their [civillian's] throats"". After comparing the Russian soldiers to ISIS, he went on to add there is ""not a single crime that they (the Russian forces) would not commit"".",14,3.7666320086106824,3.130601152648808,0.6360308559618746,22

InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit 51460 of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha. Forces from several other groups are also suspected of being in the town, including those from the Fifth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of 36th army of the Russian Eastern military district and the 331st Parachute Assault Regiment of 98th airborne division. So far Omurbekov is the only commander to be named. Russian sources have denied that they are responsible for the massacre, claiming that the Ukrainian army slaughtered its own people. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these false accusations. ”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March 30. “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself. ""I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces. ""On the contrary, our troops delivered 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. ""Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US. “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia for the massacre, which she said was ""a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks. The unsupported claims from Russian officials are typical of those which have been heard throughout the invasion and clearly aim to sow doubt and division within Ukraine and its allies. The scale of the massacre and its depraved nature has prompted a response from Western leaders, while it has been reported that Boris Johnson will seek to galvanise a tough response from allies to the crisis. On its 73rd anniversary, the Prime Minister will hail Nato as the ""greatest security alliance in the history of the world"" - adding that it has a responsibility to support the Ukrainian people as they fight for freedom with ""every fibre of their being"". It comes after the PM condemned Russia's ""despicable attacks"" against Ukrainian civilians in Irpin and Bucha, adding that ""we will not rest until justice is served"". This week he will welcome the Polish and German leaders to Downing Street for discussions on Nato and how to support Ukraine as it stands up to Russian aggression. On Sunday, Mr Johnson said ""no denial or disinformation from the Kremlin"" can conceal that President Vladimir Putin is ""desperate"" and ""his invasion is failing"". An adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said dead civilians had been found on the streets of the small city of Bucha and the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, in what resembled a ""horror movie"". In Bucha, north-west of Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers used cables to drag bodies off a street - from a distance due to fears they may be booby-trapped - as Russian troops withdraw and focus attacks on other parts of Ukraine. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. In a statement, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""stepping up"" its sanctions and military support, and ""bolstering"" humanitarian help for those on the ground. He added: ""The UK has been at the forefront of supporting the International Criminal Court's (ICC) investigation into atrocities committed in Ukraine. ""The Justice Secretary has authorised additional financial support and the deployment of specialist investigators - we will not rest until justice is served."" Earlier on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said ""indiscriminate"" attacks by Russian forces against innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha must be investigated as war crimes. Ms Truss said the UK would ""not rest"" until those responsible for ""atrocities"" in Ukraine had faced justice, adding that Russia would not be allowed to cover up its involvement through ""cynical disinformation"". Mr Zelensky's spokesman Sergey Nikiforov said authorities in Ukraine had found what looked ""exactly like war crimes"", including the bodies of executed civilians and mass graves.",13,3.9264362450475536,2.6741849057620932,1.2522513392854604,22

Vladimir Putin's forces have been accused of genocide after evidence of summary executions, torture and rape was found in areas formerly under their control. Harrowing images from Bucha, on the outskirts of capital Kyiv, show bodies piled up in the street, with witnesses saying many appeared to have been shot while their hands were bound behind their backs. A bombshell report by Human Rights Watch yesterday said Russian forces had carried out ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence"" directed toward the Ukrainian population. Putin's troops have been accused of carrying out a ""massacre"" that ""could amount to genocide"" in Bucha, while allegations of violence toward civilians have been documented across the country. It is now feared that barbaric acts will be uncovered in cities such as Mariupol, which has been the focus of Russian invaders, with missiles raining down on the population for weeks. Tymofiy Mylovanov, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, warned that there could be worse to emerge. He posted on Twitter : ""The war crimes in Brovary and Chernihiv directions might be more heinous that those in Bucha. We have eyewitness accounts through friends, relatives and students."" Defence minister Dmytro Kuleba said he feared the situation in the besieged city of Mariupol would be even worse. He said: ""Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can."" These fears were echoed by Marie Yovanovitch, former US Ambassador to Ukraine, who said: ""I think it is clear what we're going to find [in Mariupol].. and it is going to be probably even worse than Bucha."" Yesterday Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba branded Russia ""worse than ISIS"", accusing invaders of killing ""out of anger and just because they wanted to kill"". He said: ""We understand they were killing civilians while leaving, while withdrawing, while staying there in this town of Bucha and also in other towns and villages in key regions, but also while withdrawing from them out of anger and just because they wanted to kill. ""There was no good reason for them. These were not guerrillas, they were not people opposing them. ""Russia is worse than ISIS, full stop."" Ukraine's defence ministry shared harrowing footage of the sight that greeted liberators in Bucha after the Russians withdrew, likening it to Srebrenica in Bosnia, where 8,000 Muslim men and boys were slaughtered in 1995. It said: ""New Srebrenica. The city of Bucha was in the hands of animals for several weeks. ""Civilians were being executed arbitrarily, some with hands tied behind their backs, their bodies scattered in the streets of the city."" Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said: ""The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians. ""They practically got a green light from Putin for a safari and they were shooting Ukrainian people.'' Human Rights Watch (HRW) has outlined several incidents relayed to them by witnesses. Witnesses who survived the brutal occupation before Russian forces withdrew have claimed that civilians including children, were tortured. Soldier Sergeiy Torovik told The Times he had been appalled by what he had seen in his hometown of Stoyanka, close to Kyiv. He described Russian troops as ""lower than animals"", recounting the horrific scenes he had encountered in a basement of a home, where he said 18 bodies were recovered. ""Some of them had their ears cut off,"" he said. ""Others had teeth pulled out. There were kids like 14, 16 years old, some adults. ""They just took the bodies away yesterday.” Jack Watling, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said that Russia would have planned its savagery toward civilians. He said: ""This was the plan, it was premeditated. ""If the Russian military had been more successful there would have been more towns like it."" Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at HRW, said: “The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.” He continued: “Russia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers. “Commanders should recognize that a failure to take action against murder and rape may make them personally responsible for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.”",13,2.4792198813573716,3.2010161029378486,-0.721796221580477,22

Vladimir Putin's war effort is ironically reliant on the manufacturing power of the nation he's invaded, with his warships, tanks, missiles and fighter jets needing components from the opposition, sources say. It comes as there is a desperate hunt for the Butchers of Bucha after women and children were raped and shot by Russians, according to Ukrainian sources. Deeply disturbing reports began emerging from the town over the weekend which the invading forces left in front of a trail of destruction. It is feared that local women and children have been raped and civilians shot mercilessly and left in the street to die. Moscow has said it will reduce military activity near primary targets Kyiv and Chernihiv amid peace talks - though such claims have been met with skepticism. Ukraine and the West fear the Kremlin is simply looking to regroup before moving its focus on the Donbas region, rather than to try and promote trust. Putin could also look to use the southern port city of Mariupol, which has been decimated by Russian bombs, to more easily ship fresh supplies for a second wave attack. Senior defence sources told the Telegraph the Kremlin's military stocks are ""pretty bad"" as the invasion effort continues to drag on beyond initial estimations. Soldiers are said to be running low on weapons, while the withdrawal from Kyiv has meant dozens of tanks being abandoned. Meanwhile, the likes of the T-72 tank, a key component in Moscow's arsenal, needs parts said to be made in the eastern Ukrainian city of Izyum, which invading troops have failed to capture. Some estimates suggest defending troops have taken or destroyed at least 2,000 tanks and armoured vehicles. Similarly, the Kh-55 cruise missile is said to be reliant on an engine manufactured in Kharkiv. Sanctions put on Russia in an effort to force Putin into abandoning his war mean he can't buy arms from the likes of France, a major supplier since the Kremlin's Crimea invasion in 2014. On the flip side, Ukraine is continuing to receive more modern weaponry from NATO countries. This includes 4,000 anti-tank weapons (NLAWs) and Javelin anti-tank systems, as well as anti-aircraft missiles. Reports also say the British designed Starstreak missile was used by Ukrainian forces to take out a Russian helicopter.",14,4.1398655985185435,4.547444611231317,-0.4075790127127732,8

Pictures show the grave site with an approximately 45-foot long trench in the southwestern section of the area near the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints in Bucha. Global outrage spread on Monday over civilian deaths in Ukraine including evidence of bound bodies shot at close range and a mass grave found in areas retaken from Russian troops, as artillery bombarded the country's south and east. Taras Shapravskyi, deputy mayor of Bucha, a town around 40km northwest of Kyiv, said 50 of some 300 bodies found after the Kremlin's forces withdrew late last week were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops. Reuters reporters saw one man sprawled by the roadside, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, though the agency could not independently verify those figures or who was responsible for the killings. Ukrainian authorities were investigating possible war crimes as Moscow said killings were ""staged"" to sully Russia's name. Pictures of the destruction and apparent killings of civilians sparked shock and condemnation and looked set to galvanise the United States and Europe into fresh sanctions against Moscow. But it was not clear how quickly a new package could come together or if it would include Russian energy exports. The atrocities were also set to overshadow peace talks between Russia and Ukraine due to restart by video link on Monday. Asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would be held accountable for the civilian killings , Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said others also shared the blame. ""I think all the military commanders, everyone who gave instructions and orders should be punished,"" he told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" news program. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the images as ""a punch in the gut,"" while United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation. ""Putin and his supporters will feel the consequences,"" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, adding that Western allies wouldagree on further sanctions in the coming days. Germany's Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union must discuss banning the import of Russian gas -a departure from Berlin's prior resistance to that idea. French President Emmanuel Macron said there were very ""clear clues pointing to war crimes"" by Russian forces and that newsanctions was needed, and Japan said it would consult with allies on that issue. Macron said new sanctions should include oil and coal. The UN Security Council will discuss Ukraine on Tuesday and will not meet on Monday as requested by Russia, said Britain's mission to the United Nations, which holds the presidency of the 15-member council for April. Russia had requested the Security Council convene on Monday to discuss what it called a ""provocation by Ukrainian radicals""in Bucha after Kyiv's accusations. Russia has previously denied targeting civilians and has rejected allegations of war crimes in what it calls a ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarising and ""denazifying"" Ukraine. Ukraine says it was invaded without provocation. Human Rights Watch said it had documented ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in the Ukrainian regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv. Ukraine's foreign minister called on the International Criminal Court to collect evidence of what he called Russian warcrimes. The foreign ministers of France and Britain said their countries would support any such probe.

In the footage, which has been circulated online by the Donate UA campaign group, people can be seen walking into a building in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast. According to a translation of the Ukrainian, one person explains that the Russians set up a barracks in the town. ""In the next room they were executing civilians, their bodies are still here,"" they tell the camera. The video then focuses on a row of bodies, kneeling down and slumped against the wall with their hands bound. ""(They) tied their hands and made them kneel facing the wall,"" the person continues. ""A shot to the head, and that's it. The person is no more."" The military said at least one victim’s kneecaps had been shot first before he received a bullet to the head. The video is just the latest piece of disturbing evidence to come out of Bucha, a town abandoned by Russian occupiers as they moved the war to the east of Ukraine. The invading forces have left a trail of destruction in their wake. Disturbing reports suggest that civilians were mowed down in the street and left to die on the floor, while there have been multiple accounts of women and children being raped. Ukraine said that 300 people who lost their lives in the town died as a result of ""extra-judicial"" killings. Independent journalists have confirmed that people have been bound and shot in the town in apparent executions. One man was found with no other injuries on his body and powder burns on his face - sometimes a sign that a person has been shot at close range. The cloth used to bind the man's hands appeared to be a white armband. Russian troops, while they were in Bucha, required that local residents wear the armbands to identify themselves, according to one woman who was still wearing hers. ""Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians,"" Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said. ""The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians.| The Russians have adopted a position of outright denial when pressed on deaths which likely amount to war crimes. The country's defence ministry said in a statement: ""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions."" Other senior Russian politicians have claimed, in line with much previous war propaganda, that the Ukrainian military is responsible for the killings.

The move ensured vital items could not reach Russian forces and restricted their movements. It also allowed military vehicles to be targeted and military units to be weakened by Ukrainian forces. The Command of the Special Operations Forces (SSO) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said the attack was a means of stopping Russian forces in their tracks. He said: ""This is how soldiers of the SSO of Ukraine are fighting to bring down the enemy. ""By cutting off the Russian occupiers from what is needed, we are weakening their units."" The SSO added: ""Effective ambushes to disrupt deliveries of supplies and fuel are one of the most important tasks."" The Ukrainian SSO did not mention where or when the attack on Russian supply lines took place. The footage shows a military tanker hit by what appears to be a rocket before bursting into flames. Ukrainian reports claimed yesterday, the Russian forces had lost more than 18,000 soldiers and officers, including seven generals, 644 tanks, 1,830 armoured combat vehicles. They also said military hardware had been taken out including 325 artillery systems, 105 MLR systems, 54 air defence units, 143 warplanes, 134 helicopters, 1,249 vehicles and seven warships. Additional Russian forces targets included 76 fuel tank trucks, 89 operational and tactical-level UAVs, 24 units of special equipment, and four mobile SRBM systems, it was claimed. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on 24th February in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"" to ""demilitarise and denazify"" the European country. The United Nations' International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands, has ordered Russia to stop its invasion and remove its troops from Ukrainian territory. Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said his government is prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia. The Mirror told last week how Chernobyl is back under Ukraine control after Russians forces formally give up the nuclear site. The Ukrainian state nuclear company said on Thursday most of the Russian forces that occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power station after invading Ukraine have left the defunct plant, and suggested radiation concerns had driven them away. Though Russian troops seized control of Chernobyl soon after the Feb. 24 invasion, the plant's Ukrainian staff continued to oversee the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel and supervise the concrete-encased remains of the reactor that exploded in 1986, causing the world's worst nuclear accident. State-owned Energoatom said these workers had flagged earlier on Thursday that Russian forces were planning to leave the territory. ""The information is confirmed that the occupiers, who seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and other facilities in the exclusion zone, have set off in two columns towards the Ukrainian border with the Republic of Belarus,"" it said in a statement. It said a small number of Russian troops remained at Chernobyl, but did not specify how many.

Ukrainian soldiers of the 128th Separate Mountain Zakarpattia Assault Brigade attacked the invading unit and damaged the truck's vehicles with grenades forcing its crew to flee. Inside they found a stash of laptops and cash reportedly belonging to residents of a nearby village where a battle had just taken place, according to the regiment. Villagers claim invading soldiers raided their homes and stole any valuables, including electronic devices, as well as household appliances, clothes, food and alcohol. Abandoned properties were also ransacked, with blankets, mattresses and curtains being removed. The Moscow troops are said to have threatened some who tried to stop them with weapons. It is unclear exactly where in the war-torn country the incident took place, though a photo posted to the regiment's website shows inside the vehicle with a laptop and a pile of money visible. Another shows the back of the tank marked with the letter 'Z'. Citizens of neighbouring Belarus, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, reportedly claim loot stolen amid the invasion is being sent back to Russia via a post office in Belarus. Earlier this month, Ukrainian troops seized a huge Russian KamAZ armoured vehicle fitted with a professional kitchen onboard. Its cupboards were stocked with just onions, potatoes and jars of pickles, according to a video. It came after it emerged invading troops were being fed out-of-date ration packs and questionably 'fresh' food - perhaps explaining why troops are stealing civilian food. Meanwhile, the Russian Army has been dubbed 'pathetic' after an army truck left soldiers behind in the snow. In a short piece of footage, soldiers are seen filing on to the back of truck with marked with 'Z' markings. The army vehicle is then seen in the video taking off without checking soldiers were properly on board.

The president said, ""I'll let you know"", when asked about the nature of those sanctions. Other countries have doubled down on their support for the war-torn nation after details of the alleged atrocities was made public.

She will hold talks with Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday and has also pledged a £10 million civil society fund for Ukraine, including support for organisations dealing with sexual violence following reports of Russian forces using rape as a way to terrorise the civilian population.

The Russian President signed a decree ordering 134,500 new conscripts into the army last week as part of his annual Spring draft. At the time, Russia ’s defence ministry insisted they would not be sent to any “hot spots”. But a Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “Putin has signed over 130,000 new conscripts into the Army. “The timing aligns with previous Spring drafts but we think that’s an unusually high number. “We do think there’s a realistic possibility these conscripts will be sent into Ukraine, even though the Russian MOD have said only professional soldiers will go to Ukraine.” They added Russia is deploying forces from Georgia, which it invaded in 2008. The official said: “Russia is redeploying elements of the forces that are in Georgia to reinforce the invasion of Ukraine. “We don’t think that this was planned, it’s a very odd thing for the Russian military to do. So we suspect it’s indicative of the problems they are having in Ukraine.” The order came five weeks into Russia's invasion, which has run into fierce Ukrainian resistance. The issue of conscripts' involvement in the war is highly sensitive. On March 9, the defence ministry acknowledged that some had been sent to Ukraine after Putin had denied this on various occasions, saying only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in, Reuters reported. Putin's spokesman said at the time that the president had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts. The annual spring military draft, which runs from April 1 to July 15, will affect Russian men between the ages of 18 and 27, Putin's decree said. Shoigu said on Tuesday that those called up would begin to be dispatched to their assigned bases in late May. ""Most military personnel will undergo professional training in training centres for three to five months. Let me emphasize that recruits will not be sent to any hot spots,"" he said in remarks published on his ministry's website. However, Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer representing several members of Russia's National Guard who refused an order to go to Ukraine, said that under Russian law conscripts could be sent to fight after several months of training. US President Joe Biden today called for a war crimes trial against Putin, and said he was seeking more sanctions after the reported atrocities in Ukraine. Biden told reporters earlier today: “He is a war criminal. “This guy is brutal, and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone’s seen it. “I think it is a war crime ... He should be held accountable.” At the press conference, Biden added that he plans to hit Moscow with additional sanctions for its conduct throughout the war - which began with Putin sending troops over the border into Ukraine on February 24. The president said, ""I'll let you know"", when asked about the nature of those sanctions. Shocking footage emerging from journalists in Ukraine showed charred bodies on a highway near Kyiv. Ukraine said 50 of some 300 bodies found in Bucha northwest of Kyiv were victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops. Satellite images showed a 45-foot (14-m) -long trench dug into the grounds of a church where a mass grave was found. Ukraine called for an International Criminal Court investigation that France and Britain said they would support, and rights group Human Rights Watch said it had documented ""apparent war crimes"". Russia said alleged ""crimes"" by its troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and no resident suffered. The UK has said Russia appears to be committing war crimes but has stopped short of describing the action as genocide, as it is called in Ukraine.

Western officials hope the International Criminal Court will be able to play the role of prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine.

2022-04-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukrainian-soldiers-blow-russian-target-26632970,Ukraine fires Javelin missiles at Russians and blow target sky-high,"This is the moment Ukrainian soldiers reportedly fired British-used Javelin missiles at a Russian target blowing it sky-high. The clip of the missile, which is thought to have been launched by the Ukrainian Ground Forces, was discovered this morning. Footage shows the missile careening toward its Russian target and as it hits, a massive flash from the explosion can be seen before the object is catapulted into the air. The Ukrainian military said the attack was carried out by members of the 5th Reserve Battalion of the 28th Regiment, known as the 'Knights of the Winter Campaign', using Javelin surface-to-air-missiles. The defending army shared the video with a message to their countrymen saying: ""Good morning Ukraine! During the night, the 5th Reserve Battalion of the 28th Regiment, named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, did a glorious job."" The military added: ""That's how the Javelin hits. Glory to Ukraine!"" In the footage, apparently filmed in the early hours of this morning, a glowing Javelin missile is seen speeding through the air at a low altitude before seemingly hitting the target, sparking a huge explosion. The Ukrainian Ground Forces did not say where the strike took place. The footage comes just over a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ""helping more"" than other leaders in the resistance against Russia. Mr Zelensky said France was more hesitant about sending weapons because it is ""afraid of Russia"" and that Germany ""was making a mistake"" in its attempt at a more balanced approach, due to its deeper economic ties with the world's largest country. Today marks the 40th day since Russian troops invaded Ukraine. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine says that the total combat losses of the Russian military in that time stand at about 18,300 personnel. They added that Russia has also lost ""647 tanks, 1,844 armored fighting vehicles, 330 artillery systems, 107 multiple launch rocket systems, 54 anti-aircraft warfare systems, 147 aircrafts, 134 helicopters, 1,273 motor vehicles, seven boats/cutters, 76 fuel tanks, 92 unmanned aerial vehicles, 25 special equipment units and four mobile SRBM systems"". News of the Russian Armed Forces' alleged losses come as shocking images of corpses of Ukrainian civilians in the city of Bucha, in Kyiv Oblast (province), have emerged, leading to widespread condemnation of Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron says there are clear indications that Russian forces have committed war crimes, while Boris Johnson has accused Russia of ""despicable attacks"". The Kremlin has denied the allegations and is claiming the footage has been faked.",14,4.491731179952767,6.029975563899132,-1.538244383946365,8

Dmytro Kuleba said besieged Mariupol is ""even worse"" than Bucha, near Kyiv, where images of charred bodies and mass graves emerged after Ukraine retook the area. Standing alongside UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss in Poland, he backed her call to expel Russia from the UN Human Rights Council and warned: ""Half measures are not enough any more."" He invited all Western leaders still dithering over sanctions to visit Bucha and ""stand in front of the mass grave. To see the bodies of dead Ukrainian women who had been raped before being killed and who the Russians tried to set on fire to hide the traces of their crimes.” Bucha's deputy mayor said on Sunday that 50 residents had been victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops. The Kremlin on Monday denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha. ""This information must be seriously questioned,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""From what we have seen, our experts have identified signs of video falsification and other fakes."" But Mr Kuleba told journalists in Warsaw: “The horrors that we’ve seen in Bucha are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by Russian Army in the territory of Ukraine so far. ""And I can tell you without exaggeration and with great sorrow that the situation in Mariupol is much worse compared to what we’ve seen in Bucha and other cities, towns and villages nearby Kyiv.” He said the ""horrors"" demand “serious G7 and EU sanctions”. He added: ""The West continues to fill the Russian war machine with payments for Russian fossil fuels, with trade still taking place between Russia and western countries. ""Half measures are not enough any more."" Calling for tougher sanctions he added: ""This is not the request of Ukraine’s Foreign Minister - this is the plea of the victims of rape, torture and killings, their relatives and the entire Ukrainian nation."" He invited people who still buy Russian gas, oil and coal - or who still doubt whether to block Russia from SWIFT or block Russian ships from their ports - to stand at a mass grave of raped women. He said: “I invite all of them to visit Bucha without any delay. “To visit a small village and stand in front of the mass grave. “To see the bodies of dead Ukrainian women who had been raped before being killed and who the Russians tried to set on fire to hide the traces of their crimes.” He added: “And I do this address to all foreign ministers who will be meeting this week at NATO, at the EU, at the G7 ministerial. If you have doubts, reluctance or arguments about the need to keep doing business with Russia, go to Bucha first, and then talk to me.” It comes as leaders of western nations prepare to gather in Brussels from tomorrow to discuss the latest response. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she would be pressing for a ""tough new wave of sanctions"" and said Russia had ""no place on the human rights council"" of the UN. She said the UK will be going after Russian ships, banks, gold, and seeking a ""clear timetable to limit our imports"" of Russian oil, gas and coal. ""Being tough is the only approach that will work. Putin has escalated this war,"" she said. After US President Joe Biden branded Putin a war criminal she added: ""We need justice done at the International Criminal Court."" She also called for further weapons to be supplied to Ukraine to combat Vladimir Putin's invasion.

2022-04-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mayor-husband-son-found-buried-26634101,"Mayor, husband and son found buried in shallow grave after being 'tortured'","The mayor of a Ukrainian village was shot and buried next to her husband and son in a shallow grave in further evidence of Russian war crimes, it has been claimed. Since Russian soldiers withdrew from towns and villages around Kyiv last week, Ukrainian troops have been moving in, showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces, destroyed houses and burnt out cars. Reuters could not independently verify who killed the family in the grave just outside Motyzhyn, west of Kyiv. Moscow has denied targeting civilians and has said similar reports of killings were ""staged"" to sully Russia's name. ""There have been Russian occupiers here. They tortured and murdered the whole family of the village head,"" said Anton Herashchenko, naming those killed as Olha Sukhenko, her husband Ihor Sukhenko and their son, Oleksandr. ""The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery. ""These scum tortured, slaughtered and killed the whole family. They will be responsible for this."" A Reuters reporter saw the bodies in a forest near a farm, which had been all but destroyed, just outside the village of Motyzhyn. Nearby a burnt out tractor could be seen and one of those buried in the sand had his head taped. The reporter also saw another body of a man in a well near to the burnt out farm, where black scorch marks climbed up its few remaining walls. He appeared to have been tied up. Vadym Tokar, head of the Makariv village council which neighbours Motyzhyn, told Reuters the family had been taken captive by Russian forces two to three days before the troops left. ""The bodies are still lying there, we can't get them out because there is a suspicion that they are mined,"" he said by telephone. Global outrage spread on Monday over civilian deaths in Ukraine including evidence of bound bodies shot at close range and a mass grave found in areas retaken from Russian troops, as artillery bombarded the country's south and east. Reuters reporters saw on Sunday several corpses by the roadside in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, one had his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation. On Sunday, Russia's defence ministry said in a statement all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging crimes by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Kremlin troops. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was seen speaking with townspeople during visits to the destroyed towns of Irpin and Bucha today. Bucha has become the focus of war crimes accusations against both Vladimir Putin and the Russian soldiers he ordered into neighbouring Ukraine. A group of twisted soldiers - dubbed the 'Butchers of Bucha' - are alleged to have raped and murdered both women and children in the town. On entering Bucha after its liberation, journalists found horrific scenes including corpses of women and elderly people - some restrained with their arms tied behind their backs, and others with gunshot wounds in the back of the head. But now Ukrainians in Bucha at the time of the Russian occupation have shared first-hand accounts of witnessing random passersby being shot, homes being looted, and residents being banned from leaving even during humanitarian corridor agreements. Mum Kristina said she spent 10 days trapped in a house in Bucha in ""terrible fear"" the Russian soldiers stationed in her own courtyard would murder her and her three-year-old daughter. Recalling the moment she finally got to safety among Ukrainian troops, she told the Insider: ""We are safe for now, but our psyche is blown, we have changed, nothing will be the same as before. ""We try to communicate normally, even joke around a bit, but when you close your eyes, you immediately see a road full of dead bodies, and how we froze with our hands raised, waiting for them to decide."" She went on: ""It's a blessing we managed to get out. But my soul and thoughts are with Bucha and with all the hero-cities, with the people who are trapped, with the children who should not be involved in the war at all."" Yekaterina, who said she evacuated Bucha on the second day, left her parents and sisters behind and they were held captive for four days. She accused the Russian army of using civillians as ""human shields"" and of murdering innocent civillians. She said: ""My dad stood in line to be shot. They miraculously got him out, while 10 other guys were stripped naked and shot.""",13,4.143737278852846,1.8056409222292187,2.3380963566236277,22

Footage from outside the Ukrainian capital shows long queues of traffic as residents rush to return home following the Russian invasion. The lines of cars stretch for kilometres at the entrance to the city, the BBC reports. Roughly 2 million people fled Kyiv during the first few weeks of Russia's invasion - about half the city's population. Now Russian troops are currently said to be withdrawing from around Kyiv and Chernihiv, with the Kremlin claiming they are retreating out of ""respect for ongoing peace talks."" Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned areas may still come under attack from above, while Russian troops could leave behind mines, abandoned equipment or ""even the bodies of those killed"". In Bucha retreating Russian troops have left behind significant evidence of war crimes. President Zelensky said: “It’s still not possible to return to normal life, as it used to be, even at the territories that we are taking back after the fighting. ""We need wait until our land is de-mined, wait till we are able to assure you that there won’t be new shelling."" Zelensky's words have been echoed by Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko, who urged people to take their time returning to the war-torn city. Klitschko said: ""The risk of dying is pretty high, and that’s why my advice to anyone who wants to come back is: please, take a little bit more time."" Today a mass grave containing the bodies of 57 civilians was found in Bucha, close to Kyiv, where Russian troops have been forced out. Ukrainian officials have said 410 civilians have been killed in the towns surrounding Kyiv, with 300 of them in Bucha alone. It follows reports of a group of Russian soldiers - branded the 'Butchers of Bucha' - allegedly raping and shooting women and children in the area. Visiting Bucha, Zelensky said it would be harder for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia after the scale of the alleged atrocities was uncovered. Becoming visibly emotional, he said: ""These are war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide. ""It's very difficult to talk when you see what they've done here. The longer the Russian Federation drags out the meeting process, the worse it is for them and for this situation and for this war."" He added: ""We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women and murdered children."" Russia has denied being behind the deaths, and has claimed that Ukraine has orchestrated the scenes for the media. Today US President Joe Biden called for a war crimes trial against Russian Preisdent Vladimir Putin over the alleged atrocities. He told reporters: “He is a war criminal. But we have to gather the information. ""We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight and we have to get all the detail so this could be – actual have a war crimes trial.

An emotional Volodymyr Zelensky again accused Moscow of ­genocide after he toured the devastated town of Bucha, where 300 residents were found dead, some bound and gagged. The Ukrainian President claimed ­thousands of people have been murdered and butchered by rampaging Russian troops since they invaded the country. As more mass graves were discovered, Mr Zelensky said: “It will be recognised by the world as genocide. We know of ­thousands of people killed and tortured, with their limbs severed, women raped and children killed.” Speaking about the massacre in Bucha, just outside the capital Kyiv, he added: “Hundreds of people were killed, tortured. Corpses on the street, mined areas. Even the bodies of the dead were mined. “Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers, torturers, rapists, looters who call ­themselves the army, and who deserve only death after what they did.” But shameless Moscow officials accused Ukrainians of staging the killings. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “From what we have seen, our experts have identified signs of video falsification and other fakes.” Mr Zelensky has set up a special body to ­investigate Russian war crimes – a call echoed by US President Joe Biden. He said: “I decided to create a special ­mechanism of justice in Ukraine to ­investigate and prosecute every crime of the occupiers in our country.” It will include “international experts, ­investigators, ­prosecutors and judges”. More than 100 corpses have been ­examined by forensic ­scientists preparing dossiers for future war crimes tribunals. Intelligence chiefs have a target list of Russian troops from 64 infantry brigades allegedly behind atrocities in Bucha. In Motyzhyn, to the west of Kyiv, the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range were seen in a pit. Boris Johnson branded the discovery “sickening”. Keir Starmer said Russian soldiers involved in war crimes in Ukraine should know “for the rest of their lives” they will be “chased down” and prosecuted. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss last night called for Russia to be kicked off the UN’s Human Rights Council over the ­atrocities. She said: “After these appalling crimes, Russia has no place on it.” As many as 22 schools daily have been hit by warplanes since the invasion started, Save The ­Children revealed. More than two million kids have fled while around 5.5 million remain. Up to 130,000 ­civilians are still unable to leave the besieged town of Mariupol. Grim ­statistics reveal 161 children have been killed and 264 injured. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the port city had suffered an even worse onslaught than Bucha. He added: “The horrors we have seen in Bucha are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.” An evacuation convoy escorted by the International Committee of the Red Cross was blocked in the town of Manhush as it attempted to reach Mariupol last night. Kharkiv resident Olena Kolesnik, who fled to Poland, said: “This is genocide. This is fascism.

Lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko - a member of the liberal Holos party - posted an image on Twitter of an exposed patch of torso with the Nazi symbol burned into the flesh. The lawmaker said it was scarred on the ""tortured body of a raped and killed woman"". The image - which has been pixelated due to its horrific nature - shows an area of bruised torso branded with the crude swastika, which appears to have been etched with repeated slashes and burns. Ms Vasylenko did not provide any information as to where the image was originally photographed but did accuse Russian soldiers of being responsible. Pro-Russian accounts claim the sickening torture was carried out by Ukraine's neo-Nazi Azov Batallion at a location near Mariupol, the MailOnline reports. But Ukrainian accounts dispute it was their countrymen, claiming instead that Russian troops mutilated the woman's corpse post-mortem. Ms Vasylenko added: ""Russian soldiers loot, rape and kill... Women with swastika shaped burns. Russia. Russian men did this."" In later tweets, the lawmaker heaped further accusations on the Russian enemy. One horrific allegation, which has been echoed by journalists entering liberated cities, claims 10-year-old girls are showing physical signs of having been violently raped. She wrote: ""10 y.o. girls with vaginal and rectal tears. Women with swastika shaped burns. Russia. Russian Men did this. And Russian mothers raised them. A nation of immoral criminals.""

Civilians in Izyum near Kharkiv have been fighting back against the Russians, who have destroyed great tracts of the city with relentless shell attacks. Locals baked cakes for the 3rd Russian Motor Rifle division, lacing them with poison, the Ukraine Defence Intelligence Directorate claimed. ""As a result, two invaders were killed at once, another 28 went to intensive care. Their current state is to be specified,"" the organisation announced. A further 500 soldiers from the 3 Motostrils Division are in hospital with ""heavy alcohol poisoning of unknown origin"", it was claimed. Despite their efforts, Ukrainian civilians have been unable to stop the Russians destroying their towns and cities. The suburbs of Izyum, a city of 50,000, have been flattened by both indiscriminate shelling and precision strikes. Schools have been destroyed, health clinics reduced to rubble by shelling and ordinary houses demolished by airborne assaults. Mykola Shaposhnyk, who lived in a village called Hrushuvakha, told Sky News: ""The planes fly low. They were bombing so slowly, not in a rush, not in a rush. ""He is erasing the population, maybe to try and make people leave the place. Destroying Ukraine, definitely. ""Even my father, who lived through the (second world) war, said the Germans didn't do this."" According to Valerii Marchenko, the city's mayor, roughly 20,000 people are currently stuck in Izyum. Many are hiding in air raid shelters, slowly running out of food and medicine. The decision of the invading forces to abandon efforts to take Kyiv and focus on the east of the country was seen as a sign of the strength of the Ukrainian resistance effort. Yet the grim reality is that the evacuating Russians are leaving a trial of misery and destruction behind them. The mayor of the liberated town of Bucha said 300 residents had been killed during a month-long occupation by the Russian army, and victims were seen in a mass grave and still lying on the streets. Reuters journalists saw bodies lying in the streets and the hands and feet of multiple corpses poking out of a still-open grave at a church ground. ""The bastards!""

Today the UK's ambassador to Ukraine said she was aware of reports of women and girls being raped in front of their families, describing it as a ""deliberate act of subjugation'. Heartbreaking testimony uncovered by human rights groups have ramped up calls for troops to be held accountable for their actions. Charity Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had uncovered evidence of ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence"" against Ukrainian civilians, and said these must be investigated as war crimes. Melinda Simmons, British Ambassador to Ukraine, posted on Twitter: ""Rape is a weapon of war. Though we don’t yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine it’s already clear it was part of (Russian) arsenal. ""Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime."" Describing her ordeal, a Ukrainian woman told Human Rights Watch that she was lucky to be alive after repeatedly being raped at gunpoint by a Russian soldier. The 31-year-old woman, identified as Olha - not her real name - told HRW she was targeted after Russian troops arrived in Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region of the country. Olha, who has a five year old son, was taken into a classroom in the school where she and her family were sheltering by a soldier, who told her he was 20. Describing her distressing ordeal, she said: “He told me to give him [oral sex]. ""The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more ‘motivation.’” The solider then proceeded to rape her, she told human rights workers. Olha continued: “While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was [name withheld] and that he was 20. ""He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with.” When she refused to get her possessions in order to stay with him in the classroom, he held a knife to her neck and raped her again, Olha said. He also hit her several times around the face. Olha, who was able to flee to Kharkiv and seek medical attention now plans to file a report with Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office, HRW said. Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at the charity, said: “The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.” He continued: “Russia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers. “Commanders should recognize that a failure to take action against murder and rape may make them personally responsible for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.” A villager in Mala Rohan described a very similar account of a 27-year-old woman with a five year old daughter being raped by a teenage Russian soldier. The 55-year-old, named Sergei, told The Independent : “The soldier who did it was a young guy, 19 years old. His name was Vladimir. He had been drinking all day before he raped the poor girl. ""He was out of control."" He said this was happening as there ""didn't seem to be much discipline"" among Russian troops. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba today accused Russia of carrying out a deliberate ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv and called on the G7 to impose ""devastating"" new sanctions on Moscow. ""We are still gathering and looking for bodies, but the number has already gone into the hundreds. ""Dead bodies lie on the streets. They killed civilians while staying there and when they were leaving these villages and towns,"" his ministry quoted him as saying on Twitter. Russia has so far not commented publicly on the claims.

2022-04-03,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/one-siberian-postcode-dozens-war-26623673,One Siberian postcode has dozens of war dead - but mysteriously none in Moscow,"A sinister postcode lottery relating to Russia's war dead raising questions about how many of Vladimir Putin 's troops have lost their lives. The worst-hit regions in terms of losses are, coincidentally, a long way away from the Moscow. This means the increasingly heavy flow of coffins from Ukraine to Russia may not be seen by those with their hands on the levers of power in the capital. Some estimates put the number of war dead at 17,000 soldiers in five weeks. A similar pattern is seen in the official records relating to St Petersburg, Putin’s birth city, where there is just one recorded death, and two captured troops. Moscow has sustained no announced deaths, while just ten servicemen from the capital were captured by the Ukrainians, according to the records. The region immediately surrounding the capital has similarly suffered far fewer fatalities than many places, with two reported dead, and 21 captured. The Leningrad region outside St Petersburg has seen one killed with two captured. Funerals are being held for those slain in the war in many regions - but not in main cities Moscow and St Petersburg. There is anecdotal evidence that a handful of burials of soldiers whose deaths were not announced have gone ahead over the past weeks. This contrasts sharply with the region of Buryatia, in Siberia, five time zones east of Moscow, where 64 have been reported killed in the war. Many of these are ethnic Buryats rather than Russians. The true toll here is almost certainly higher, not least because there is a time-lag in the release of information on the war dead. Pictures of some of the war dead highlight the appalling suffering in Buryatia, a Buddhist republic on the shore of Lake Baikal with a 972,000 population, some 12 times less than the city of Moscow. The Ukrainians have published numbers for Russian losses which have not been disputed by the Soldiers’ Mothers Committee in Moscow. More information has become available through social media tributes and the rising number of local reports of funerals. Taken together the available data show a striking pattern that far-flung Russian regions are worst hit by the crushing losses. Reports have highlighted Dagestan, close to the Caspian Sea, Tatarstan on the Volga River, Irkutsk in Siberia and Primorsky, on the Pacific coast, as suffering significant losses. Many of those killed from some of these faraway towns and cities are not ethnic Russians, and a large number of these men are young, in their late teens or twenties. Many of the military dead leave behind young families. Ahead of the war, when Russian officials maintained the pretence that service personnel were being sent solely for military drills, tens of thousands of forces were moved from across Russia, for example via the Trans-Siberian railway. Some travelled a week or more to regions surrounding Ukraine, or to Belarus, also used as a staging post for the war. Among those killed in Ukraine from devastated Buryatia was David Arutyunyan, 18, previously identified as the youngest Russian soldier to be killed in the war Also pictured are war dead Mikhail Garmaev, 34, paratrooper Naidal Tsyrenov, 23, Nikolay Ivanov, 33, Roman Kolosov, 29, a staff sergeant and boxer, Solbon Bolotov, 26, a corporal,22, Stepan Oseev, 31, Vyacheslav Sadykov, 22, Ivan Kargapoltsev, 28, Egor Khlystov, 23, Andrey Dandarov, 19, Zorigto Khotsaev, 21, Buryatia, Igor Chuposhev, 38, and reconnaissance technician Nima Oshorov, 45.",14,5.802419365924532,6.6986122778967045,-0.8961929119721725,12
2022-04-03,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/growing-list-war-crime-allegations-26623770,All war crime allegations as Russian troops branded 'worse than ISIS',"Russian forces have been branded ""worse than ISIS"" amid sickening allegations of civilians being executed, tortured and raped by soldiers. A bombshell report by Human Rights Watch today said evidence had been uncovered of ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence"" directed toward the Ukrainian population. Vladimir Putin 's troops have been accused of carrying out a ""massacre"" that ""could amount to genocide"" in the city of Bucha outside Kyiv after dozens of civilian bodies were found when Russia withdrew. Today Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba branded Russia ""worse than ISIS"", accusing invaders of killing ""out of anger and just because they wanted to kill"". These are the latest in a long line of war crime allegations against Putin's forces since the start of the invasion in February. Russian troops are already accused of targeting civilians in merciless bombing campaigns and failing to observe ceasefires. In the past two days devastating pictures have emerged showing bodies piled up in areas occupied by pro-Russian forces, with many victims said to have have had their hands bound when they were shot. The International Criminal Court is investigating a string of allegations, amid calls for Putin and his top team to be tried as war criminals. Today Mr Kuleba told Times Radio: ""We understand they were killing civilians while leaving, while withdrawing, while staying there in this town of Bucha and also in other towns and villages in key regions, but also while withdrawing from them out of anger and just because they wanted to kill. ""There was no good reason for them. These were not guerrillas, they were not people opposing them. ""Russia is worse than ISIS, full stop."" Here we look at some of the allegations made against Russian forces in recent days and weeks. At least 300 residents are alleged to have been killed in the month that Russian forces occupied the city of Bucha. Sickening images show bodies piled in a mass grave, with many still lying in the streets following the Russian retreat. Today the mayor of the city, on the northern outskirts of Kyiv, showed journalists dead bodies white cloth tied around their arms. One of these appeared to have his hands bound, and appeared to have been shot in the mouth. Anatoliy Fedoruk said: ""The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians. ""They practically got a green light from Putin for a safari and they were shooting Ukrainian people.'' HRW has outlined several incidents relayed to them by witnesses. A woman named Tatiyana told HRW: ""They took six men from three different families. ""One mother had both of her sons taken [and shot]. ""Another young man was in his early 20s, his name was Bohdan, I know his mother well, she told me that the soldiers told her to wait near her house while they took her son … to question him. ""They said the same thing to other families. Instead, they led these six men away, took them to the far end of the village, and shot them."" Today the UK's ambassador to Ukraine said she was aware of reports of women and girls being raped in front of their families, describing it as a ""deliberate act of subjugation'. Heartbreaking testimony uncovered by human rights groups have ramped up calls for troops to be held accountable for their actions. Melinda Simmons, British Ambassador to Ukraine, posted on Twitter : ""Rape is a weapon of war. ""Though we don’t yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine it’s already clear it was part of (Russian) arsenal. ""Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime."" Describing her ordeal, a Ukrainian woman told Human Rights Watch that she was lucky to be alive after repeatedly being raped at gunpoint by a Russian soldier. The 31-year-old woman, identified as Olha - not her real name - told HRW she was targeted after Russian troops arrived in Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region of the country. Olha, who has a five year old son, was taken into a classroom in the school where she and her family were sheltering by a soldier, who told her he was 20. Describing her distressing ordeal, she said: “He told me to give him [oral sex]. ""The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more ‘motivation.’” The solider then proceeded to rape her, she told human rights workers. Olha continued: “While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was [name withheld] and that he was 20. ""He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with.” When she refused to get her possessions in order to stay with him in the classroom, he held a knife to her neck and raped her again, Olha said. Witnesses who survived the brutal occupation before Russian forces withdrew have claimed that civilians including children, were tortured. Soldier Sergeiy Torovik told The Times he had been appalled by what he had seen in his hometown of Stoyanka, close to Kyiv. He described Russian troops as ""lower than animals"", recounting the horrific scenes he had encountered in a basement of a home, where he said 18 bodies were recovered. ""Some of them had their ears cut off,"" he said. ""Others had teeth pulled out. There were kids like 14, 16 years old, some adults. ""They just took the bodies away yesterday.” It is not an isolated allegation. Ivan Fedorov, mayor of the city of Melitopol, who was held captive by Russian troops for five days last month, said he had endured ""psychological violence"". He added: “I heard in the cells next, cries of the tortured, and I understood their degree of violence because human lives do not count for them."" Sonya Sceats, Chief Executive at Freedom from Torture, said: “As harrowing reports of torture, mass executions and the mutilation of corpses by Russian forces emerge, compassionate people across this country want the UK Government to do everything possible to help Ukrainians fleeing the conflict to reach safety and ensure perpetrators are held accountable."" Russia has repeatedly been accused of shelling civilian targets during its brutal assault on Ukrainian cities. These include a maternity hospital in Mariupol, as well as a theatre where civilians including children were sheltering. At least three people, including a child, died in the hospital attack, which was branded ""the ultimate genocide"". In a scathing statement accusing Putin's forces of war crimes late last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: ""Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded. ""Many of the sites Russia’s forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians. ""This includes the Mariupol maternity hospital, as the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights expressly noted in a March 11 report. ""It also includes a strike that hit a Mariupol theater, clearly marked with the word “дети” — Russian for “children” — in huge letters visible from the sky. ""Putin’s forces used these same tactics in Grozny, Chechnya, and Aleppo, Syria, where they intensified their bombardment of cities to break the will of the people."" Putin's forces have been accused of using cluster munitions in residential areas during its occupation of Kharkiv in late February. Witnesses and images strongly point to the use of Russian-made 9M55K Smerch cluster munition rockets, HRW said. Steve Goose, arms director at the campaign group, said in early March: “Kharkiv is under relentless attack from Russian forces and civilians are hiding in basements to evade explosions and debris. “Using cluster munitions in populated areas shows a brazen and callous disregard for people’s lives.” HRW said in a statement: ""Given the inherently indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions and their foreseeable effects on civilians, their use as documented in Kharkiv might constitute a war crime."" There have been several occasions when civilians attempting to escape besieged cities were seemingly targeted by Russian forces. During the Siege of Mariupol, it is claimed that shelling continued during a five-hour ceasefire. US Ambassador Michael Carpenter last month said that on March 5 and 6 evacuation corridors were bombed by Russia. Sickening drone footage on March 7 appeared to show a civilian with his hands up being shot close to the E40 highway near Kyiv. At least 10 more dead bodies, which had been burned, were later found along the highway.",13,2.68890064424572,3.8489315632459427,-1.1600309190002225,22

Mantas Kvedaravicius died yesterday in the besieged city whose fate he had spent years documenting. The Lithuanian film director’s death was confirmed by the Ukrainian Defence Minister and a colleague. A Lithuanian news agency, 15min, reported that Mr Kvedaravicius was rushed to a hospital but could not be saved. The ministry’s information agency tweeting today: ""While (he was) trying to leave Mariupol, Russian occupiers killed Lithuanian director Mantas Kvedaravicius”. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said: ""We lost a creator well known in Lithuania and in the whole world who, until the very last moment, in spite of danger, worked in Russia-occupied Ukraine.” The 45-year-old was best known for his conflict-zone documentary Mariupolis, which premiered in 2016 at the Berlin International Film Festival. It showed a city, a strategic port in a mostly Russian-speaking part of eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have clashed with Ukrainian forces since 2014. Mariupol was one of the main targets of Russia ’s invasion when it began on February 24. The city has spent weeks being bombed and reduced to rubble, with tens of thousands still trapped. ""Mantas Kvedaravicius, was murdered today in Mariupol, with a camera in his hands, in this s***** war of evil, against the whole world,"" Russian film director Vitaly Mansky, founder of the Artdocfest arts festival in which Kvedaravicius was a participant, said on Facebook. Kvedaravicius also won an award for his 2011 film ‘Barzakh’ which was shot in the Russian region of Chechnya, where the country fought two wars to put down rebellions between 1994 and 2009. Julia Duchrow, deputy secretary general of Amnesty International in Germany, said: ""The audience was taken into the villages, into the lives and souls of the people. ""Mantas Kvedaravicius has shown great courage for this: The film was shot without permission and at great personal risk. ""This courage, this unconditional will to show human rights violations and make them accessible to the public, distinguished Mantas Kvedaravicius."" Inside the terrorised city of Mariupol, civilians are almost entirely without food, water and electricity as temperatures plummet below zero at night. Many are unable to leave their shelters due to the ongoing Russian missile strikes and shelling and loved ones cannot let their family and friends outside know they’re still alive. The city has seen some of the worst Russian atrocities including the bombing of a maternity and children’s hospital, and of a theatre where thousands of innocents were sheltering. Mariupol’s residents even wrote ‘children’ in Russian outside the theatre in hope Putin’s forces would not attack it.",17,4.050298842561981,5.586750747675376,-1.5364519051133954,26
2022-04-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-russia-end-cooperation-international-26617295,Russia will end cooperation on the International space station over sanctions,"Russia has today announced it will end its long-held cooperation with Western countries on the International Space Station (ISS) until sanctions are lifted. Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin has announced that a timetable for completion of the ISS project will soon be submitted to the Russia's leadership. The announcement, prompted by international sanctions over the war in Ukraine, is a major blow for the future of space exploration. The space station needs constant maintenance to maintain a stable orbit, and without Russia's contribution could have to be decommissioned far sooner than originally planned. The announcement ends 23 years of international cooperation. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Rogozin said: ""Sanctions from the US, Canada, the European Union and Japan are aimed at blocking financial, economic and production activities of our high-tech enterprises. ""The purpose of the sanctions is to kill the Russian economy, plunge our people into despair and hunger, and bring our country to its knees. It is clear that they will not be able to do this, but the intentions are clear. ""That is why I believe that the restoration of normal relations between partners in the International Space Station and other joint projects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lifting of illegal sanctions. ""Specific proposals of Roscosmos on the timing of the completion of cooperation within the framework of the ISS with the space agencies of the United States, Canada, the European Union and Japan will be reported to the leadership of our country in the near future."" He said that Russia's cooperation on the project was ""of fundamental importance"" to ensure its ""safety"". The ISS is the largest single structure ever put into space by humans, and has been continuously occupied by a multi-national crew since 2000. Europe, the United States, Russia, Canada and Japan are joint owners of the station. The Russians waited until after the safe landing of a capsule containing a US astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts in Kazakhstan on Wednesday to make the announcement. The flight - carrying NASA's Mark Vande Hei and Russians Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov back to Earth - had been closely watched to determine whether escalating strife had spilled over into longtime cooperation in space between the two former Cold War adversaries. Russian space agency Roscosmos broadcast footage of the landing from the Kazakh steppe and said a group of technical and medical specialists had been dispatched to help the astronauts out of the capsule. ""The crew is feeling good after landing, according to rescuers,"" Rogozin wrote on Telegram messenger on Wednesday. It is not clear what will happen to cosmonauts Sergey Korsakov, Oleg Artemyev and Denis Mateev, who are currently on the ISS, according to NASA. Announcing U.S. economic sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's government on February 24, U.S. President Joe Biden ordered high-tech export restrictions against Russia that he said were designed to ""degrade"" its aerospace industry, including its space program. Rogozin of Roscosmos had then lashed out in a series of Twitter posts suggesting the U.S. sanctions could ""destroy"" ISS teamwork and lead to the space station falling out of orbit. The following week, state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti posted a video spoof depicting cosmonauts waving farewell to Vande Hei before Russia's ISS module detaches from the space station and flies away without him to the applause of Russian officials at mission control, leaving the rest of the station sinking lower in orbit. The clip, described by RIA Novosti as ""comic,"" plays out to the Russian-language love ballad ""Goodbye,"" by Russian vocalist Lev Leshchenko. The European Space Agency said last month it was suspending cooperation with Roscosmos over the ExoMars rover mission to search for signs of life on the surface of Mars. British satellite venture OneWeb said last month it had contracted with Elon Musk's SpaceX to send its satellites into orbit after calling off a March 4 launch of 36 satellites from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan because of last-minute demands imposed on it by Moscow.",3,6.901883664008499,6.813047857136024,0.08883580687247505,7
2022-04-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-leaving-mines-dead-bodies-26621135,Russia leaving mines on dead bodies as troops retreat claims Ukrainian President,"Russia is leaving behind mines and booby traps as their troops withdraw from areas of northern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed. As the Kremlin’s forces withdraw from areas around Kyiv or are forced back by Ukrainian counterattacks, they are sabotaging houses, roads and even bodies, it has been claimed. Over the past few days Ukraine has retaken over 30 towns and villages in the Kyiv region. This has happened since Russia ’s announcement this week that it was going to scale down its military operations around the capital and focus its efforts in the pro-Russian east. Some have speculated this is in an attempt to limit the country’s losses and reinforce its forces who are already stretched thin. In a video address released today, President Zelensky said: ""In the north of our country, the invaders are leaving. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here “It is slow but noticeable. In some places they are being kicked out with fighting. Elsewhere they're abandoning the positions themselves. ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" Due to these concerns, emergency services have told people in the newly liberated regions to be extra-vigilant. They have said more than 1,500 explosives have been found in one day of searching in the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital. Zelensky went on to say that efforts were ongoing to clear mines and make the area safe, but for now residents were advised against returning. He added: ""It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was,”. The shocking claims come amidst a surprise retreat from Russian forces. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. Moscow’s forces initially surged across Ukraine, attacking the country on multiple fronts and coming within a few miles of the capital. However, since then, reports have suggested that Russian forces have become stretched thin, with videos emerging showing armoured and personnel vehicles running out of fuel. On top of that, there have been numerous claims of low morale amongst Moscow’s troops and even mutinies. That has reportedly led to Russian generals and military commanders coming to the frontline, which has led to at least 13 top army leaders being killed already. After an objectively unsuccessful invasion so far, the move now comes as an attempt to shore up parts of the invasion in more pro-Russian areas, where they can have more reliable supply lines. This comes five weeks into Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. His country finds itself outcast on the international stage, with only China and India the major powers yet to denounce its actions. A series of economic sanctions have hit the nation hard, but some have argued they still haven’t gone far enough. Chelsea owner Roman Ambramovich was one of the Russian oligarchs hit by the economic actions. Despite previously threatening people with legal action over suggesting he had a close relationship with Putin, Ambramovich reportedly flew to Russia on the day of the invasion to speak to the Russian president in person, the FT reported . The paper was told another oligarch was surprised at how close the two were.",14,6.251964126550991,4.522900488434405,1.7290636381165863,14
2022-04-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-soldiers-hurl-stun-grenades-26620960,Russian soldiers hurl grenades and shots heard as they disrupt peaceful protests,"Russian soldiers violently broke up peaceful pro-Ukrainian protests as the Kremlin’s invasion continues into its sixth week. In Enerhodar, which lies on the Dnipro river in Southern Ukraine, Moscow’s troops reportedly opened fire on protestors who opposed the ongoing invasion. This comes as Vladimir Putin ’s invasion of Ukraine enters its sixth week, as Kyiv’s forces have begun making remarkable progress, taking territory back from Russia. Hundreds of people gathered for a peaceful rally in the centre of the town this morning. There the crowds sung the Ukrainian national anthem until Russian soldiers arrived to dispel the protestors. Some were reportedly arrested as Moscow’s forces were said to have thrown tear and stun grenades into the crowds and shots and explosions were heard. The town has been occupied by Russian forces since March 4. Local authorities shared a video of the violence on Telegram and later Emine Dzheppar, the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, tweeted out the video. She said: “Another video from #Enerhodar near #Zaporizhzhia, #Ukraine, where Russian occupants fire on brave Ukrainian protesters”. That came alongside the video which showed protestors fleeing from clouds of smoke, as gunfire and explosions rang out behind them. Early reports also accused Russian forces of shelling another part of the town on Saturday. This comes as the latest intelligence update from the Ministry of Defence highlighted the success Ukrainian forces were having with a number of counter-attacks. They coincided with Russian retreats around the capital Kyiv, as Russia claimed it was originally done to help peace talks, but intelligence in the US and Ukraine doubted this motive. Russian forces even retreated from Hostomel Airport, which saw fierce fighting from the first day of the invasion. But, reports suggested that Russia was instead redeploying these troops to eastern and southern parts of the country to support their troops there. It added: “Along the eastern axis, Ukraine has re-taken several villages. “In the east of Ukraine, Ukrainian forces have secured a key route in eastern Kharkhiv after heavy fighting. “This follows the liberation of Trostyanets, in the vicinity of Sumy, earlier this week.” On top of that, Ukrainian authorities said they were hesitant to let civilians back into the areas previously occupied by Russian troops over reports of mines and tripwires being left behind. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that retreating Russian forces were creating a “complete disaster” sabotaging homes and even bodies in their wake. His warning came this morning as concerns about the humanitarian crisis gripping Mariupol continue to worsen. The city is encircled by Russian troops and most attempts to get humanitarian aid into the civilians inside have been unsuccessful. This week, there were reports of an attack on a Russian oil depot which the Kremlin claimed was Ukraine’s first strike on Russian territory since the war began. Kyiv strongly denied the allegations and suggested Moscow negligence may be to blame. So far, during fighting, more than four million people, largely women, children and the elderly, have fled their homes in Ukraine to escape the fighting. The majority of the refugees entered Poland, but it is not known how many settled there or travelled on into other countries. Despite worries on the first day of the invasion, that Russia would sweep Ukraine and take the capital within days, the fighting has been severely prolonged. This was reportedly because of a mixture of fierce resistance from Ukraine and under-resourced, poorly equipped and led Russian troops.",17,4.9044817067690865,3.3327170151910526,1.571764691578034,19

Lt Col Vitaly Slabtsov, 43, was an elite paratrooper buried with full military honours, say reports. Reports suggest Slabtsov was killed during a special operation in Donbas, Ukraine, although not many details have emerged regarding his death. Slabtsov's funeral was held in Ryazan in central Russia, home of Russian paratroopers, on Friday. His body was placed in a closed coffin, indicating he had suffered devastating wounds in the war. A Russian flag draped the coffin as it was taken for burial, while Slabtsov was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. Pictures taken at the service show several Russian military personal in attendance, with one holding a picture of Slabtsov. Slabtsov served with the 83rd separate air assault brigade based in Ussuriysk, in the extreme east of Russia, and was one of Vladimir Putin's top Russian colonels. At the funeral, cemetery workers told reporters there are three rows of graves reserved for more victims, suggesting they are expecting another 70 funerals. The news comes after Lt Col Alexander Kornik, 39, was reported to have died alongside eight soldiers of his regiment, with 17 more injured, after they were hit while building a pontoon bridge in the Chernihev region. Six bodies of dead servicemen could not be removed from the water, and were carried away by the current on March 27, said senior Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsymbalyuk. However, separate accounts give the date of his death as March 2 and March 15. Additionally, it was announced this week that top Russian general Col Denis Kurilo had been ""eliminated"" along with 1,500 troops. The commander of the 200th motorised rifle brigade died in fighting outside Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, it was claimed. Just three days prior, Ukraine announced Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev, 48, was the seventh general and the second lieutenant general to be killed in the invasion. Sources in Kyiv said the commander, who previously claimed that the war would be over in a matter of hours, died in a strike close to Kherson city. Pictures show a funeral service held for Kornik in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg where he was given full military honours. Despite this, Russia has not officially announced his death in common with many soldiers killed in Ukraine. Putin has only acknowledged the death of one general so far, understood to be Major Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky, in a speech shortly after the war began. Ukrainian forces have also claimed to have eliminated Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, Major General Oleg Mityaev, Major General Vitaly Gerasimov and Major General Andrei Kolesnikov. Reports indicate that Kornik was chief of staff of the 40th Engineer Regiment. Russian troops have experienced severe casualties in the five-week war with Ukraine claiming as many as 17,000 killed. Between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have lost their lives in battle, according to estimates from NATO. The Kremlin has lost at least nine colonels and several more high ranking officers, according to reports. Putin ’s negotiators have said this week that Russian forces would ease back from attacks on Kyiv and northern Ukraine although shelling has continued and there is a fear that they are simply regrouping. It comes as Ukraine has managed to retake some territory taken from the Russians especially around Kyiv. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy said in a video address that the military situation in the east remained extremely difficult and Russia was preparing for new strikes in the Donbas region and the city of Kharkiv. He added that Russian troops in the north of the country were pulling back, slowly but noticeably.",14,6.215413348436815,4.213643855921754,2.001769492515061,11

An official from the invading country made the warning after the UK delivered Starstreak missiles to Ukraine. A video has emerged of what appears to be one of the high-tech munitions being used to down a Russian helicopter. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said that more weapons will be sent to Kyiv to aid Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia. The pledge, which was made after a conference held by military donors to the country, has not been met warmly by Russian ambassador Andrey Kelin. Mr Kelin told TASS news agency: ""All arms supplies are destabilising, particularly those mentioned by Wallace. ""They exacerbate the situation, making it even bloodier. Apparently, those are new, high-precision weapons. ""Naturally, our armed forces will view them as a legitimate target if those supplies get through the Ukrainian border."" Since Russia invaded Ukraine the UK has been providing it with military aid, including anti-tank weapons and the Starstreak. The latter is the UK’s most advanced manned portable missile system and hits targets with three kinetic darts. A video showing the tail of a Mi-28N helicopter being snapped off has been verified, reported the Times, with a Ministry of Defence source saying it showed a Starstreak in action in Ukraine. The source also said that the anti-air missile system has been used in Ukraine for almost a week. Mr Wallace hosted a conference of 35 nations helping Ukraine this week. He said that ""more lethal aid"" would go to the country. and that longer range artillery would be provided, along with anti-ship missiles. Mr Kelin warned against supplying more arms, saying that ""wrong decisions of this kind are very dangerous, because they are aimed at fuelling the conflict"". He added: ""They reveal the desire to do us as much harm as possible. He went on to claim that supplying more weapons will serve to fuel the idea ""that there's no need for negotiations at this point"". ""This is the position of an ostrich, an attempt to hide your head in sand in a fit of powerlessness and blind rage."" Kelin also looked to counteract claims that Russia is being pushed back by Ukrainian forces, suggesting that the West had been duped by unreliable intelligence. ""I have a feeling that London’s perceptions of what is going on in Ukraine from the military point of view are formed from overly positive reports of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry and the leadership of Ukraine,"" he continued. ""If we look at maps that are being published by papers and magazines here, they rely exclusively on Ukrainian sources. ""They still believe that the Azov battalion is about to liberate Mariupol, that the people’s militia forces have made no progress at all in the Lugansk region."" The ambassador may have been responding to comments Mr Wallace made yesterday, when he claimed Vladimir Putin ""is now a man in a cage he built himself"". As the Russian war against Ukraine entered day 37, the Defence Secretary said Russia's president no longer bore the ""force"" he used to. In an interview with Sky News, he said: ""President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. ""His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. ""The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. ""He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with the consequences of what he has done to his own army. ""We have seen it before. It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas."" The Chief of the Defence Staff earlier expressed similar sentiments. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said Russia's bid to take all of Ukraine during its invasion looks to have ""fallen apart"" as Mr Putin's troops retreat. The head of Britain's armed forces said the Russian leader had been ""misled"" about the effectiveness of his country's armed forces, with ""early indications"" suggesting Moscow was withdrawing troops - a move that has opened them up to counter attacks by Ukrainian defenders. In a speech and follow-on question-and-answer session at an Institute for Government (IfG) event, the Chief of the Defence Staff said Mr Putin was a ""weaker and more diminished figure today"" than he was before the invasion started on February 24. He announced that the UK was ""incredibly cautious"" about believing Russian claims of ground troops withdrawing from Kyiv but said there did appear to be signs the Kremlin was preparing to focus its efforts on the east and south of Ukraine.",14,4.469421661746191,4.185768699229698,0.2836529625164932,4
2022-04-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/elite-russian-regiment-seen-best-26617268,Elite Russian 'best of the best' regiment sees 39 members slaughtered in Ukraine,"A regiment of elite Russian fighters have suffered heavy losses at the hands of the fierce Ukrainian resistance, it has been reported. The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment are considered among the most fearsome and well-trained in the Russian army, having fought for the city of Ilovaisk in the Donbas in 2014. Their involvement in Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year, and fatalities they've suffered, is indicative of how the invasion hasn't gone as planned. The regiment's commanding officer, Col Sergei Sukharev, was killed in Ukraine on 13 March - a major blow for any military unit. His deputy Major Sergei Krylov was killed alongside him. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here According to the BBC, in the month since the invasion began, at least 37 other members of the 331st have lost their lives in Ukraine. The men had been part of a column that advanced into Ukraine from Belarus, led by Russia's airborne forces, that was tasked with capturing Kyiv. Like many other regiments they soon found themselves bogged down by intense resistance fighting and logistical difficulties. Videos circulating online show vehicles marked with VDV - the symbol for Russia's airborne forces - wrecked and abandoned in villages near the capital. While the Kremlin has not been forthcoming when it comes to announcing the deaths of its men in Ukraine, Russians have been posting tributes to fallen soldiers on social media site V'Kontakte. One has been set up Sergeant Sergei Duganov, a member of the 331st. ""Nobody knows anything,"" one woman wrote on it, the BBC reported. ""The 331st regiment is disappearing. Almost every day, photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What's happening? When will this end? When will people stop dying?"" The deaths of so many members of the 331st will come as a blow to the Russian military, in part symbolically due to their reputation. In a video posted online last May, a general tells soldiers of the 331st Parachute Regiment that they are ""the best of the best"". As well as serving in the Balkans, Chechnya and Donbas, they regularly took part in Red Square parades in Moscow. However many of their number have died, its clear that the 331st did not achieve their central mission of circling and then taking Kyiv. Earlier this week the Kremlin announced plans to focus the invasion effort on the east of the country in what has widely been interpreted as an acceptance that the army was stretched too thin. This morning Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that retreating Russian forces are creating “a complete disaster” by leaving mines in homes as they retreat to the east. “They are mining the whole territory,"" the Ukrainian president said. ""They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed. There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.” Zelensky went on to urge Russian families not to let their young men sign up for the army as the Kremlin’s annual military conscription drive began. “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains,"" he said. ""Don’t send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. Keep them at home."" According to the BBC the following members of the 331st have died: Klim Abramov, Cpl Artem Arbuzov, Oleg Bedoshvili, Capt (Co Cdr) Yurii Borisov, Snr Lt Ilya Chernyshev, Cpl Yuri Degtaryov, Konstantin Dobrynin, Sasha Dolkin, Sgt Sergei Duganov, Kiril Fedoseyev, Andrey Kovalevsky, Maj Sergei Krylov, Stanislav Kutelev, Cpl Yanosh Leonov, Sgt Alexander Limonov, Snr WO Sergei Lobachyo, Cpl Ivan Mamzurin, Cpl Ilya Martynenko, Lt Lev Ovchinnikov, Maksim Ovchinnikov, Cpl Leonid Panteleyev, Maj Oleg Patskalyev, Sgt Stanislav Petrutik, Sgt Roman Pomelov, Snr WO Pavel Rudenko, Snr Lt Alexander Shalygin, Sgt Nikolai Smirnov, Col Sergei Sukharev, Maxim Svetlenko, Snr Lt Nikolai Symov, Daniil Titov, Maxim Trokai, Ivan Turyev, Sgt Maxim Vorotyntsev, Capt Alexei Vyshegorodtsev, Alexei Yelimov, Cpl Artem Yergin, Sgt Ravshan Zhakbaev, Cpl Danila Zudkov.",14,4.393623433455969,4.226741220214182,0.1668822132417871,3
2022-04-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/horror-mass-killings-ukraine-men-26621558,Horror at genocide in Ukraine as civilians slaughtered and bodies lining streets,"Horrifying details are emerging of mass killings and civilians being slaughtered in the streets of Ukraine in previously Russian-occupied areas. As the Kremlin’s forces pull out of towns and villages around the capital Kyiv, Ukraine’s forces and journalists from the west are able to step foot back in them for the first time since they were taken early in the invasion. However, they have been greeted with horror scenes of dead bodies littering the streets. At least 280 people were found dead in the village of Bucha, after Russian forces left the settlement. A reporter for the AFP news agency in the village counted dozens of bodies and one man whose hands were tied. Their bodies littered the streets, greeting those who entered the village. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In the recaptured town of Bucha, reached by news agency Reuters, the sprawled remains of more than a dozen bodies lined one road. A mass grave in the grounds of a church was still open, with hands and feet poking through the red clay heaped on top. Bucha's mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said more than 300 residents had been killed and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “Indeed, this is genocide - the elimination of the whole nation and the people.” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was appalled by atrocities in Bucha and voiced support for the International Criminal Court's inquiry into potential war crimes in Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia on Sunday of carrying out a deliberate ""massacre"" in the town and called on the G7 to impose ""devastating"" new sanctions on Moscow. ""We are still gathering and looking for bodies, but the number has already gone into the hundreds. ""Dead bodies lie on the streets. They killed civilians while staying there and when they were leaving these villages and towns,"" his ministry quoted him as saying on Twitter. Other world leaders rushed to accuse Moscow or war crimes but Russia denies targeting civilians and rejects war crimes allegations. The photos show the widespread destruction and horrific actions of the Russian armies amidst fears this is only the beginning. A video believed to be of one such village shows Ukrainian troops having to slalom their trucks down the streets to avoid all the dead bodies that lay there. The haunting images show a significant number of dead, cast across the street and at the road side with no one to move their bodies. The video ends with two more bodies, of two people who died together. More horrifying reports are coming from the liberated regions around Kyiv and in Kyiv Oblast. Anastasiia Lapatina, a Ukrainian journalist, said: “Russians are shooting civilians after tying their hands behind their backs. “Dead bodies are all over the Kyiv oblast, on the streets, in cars, in people’s yards. Mass graves are full of unidentified bodies. ""Many families will never know what happened to their loved ones"". Another horrifying picture from Motizhin, in Kyiv Oblast, shows dead bodies half buried in what could be a mass grave. Faces and limbs are sticking out of the dirt and sand where the bodies were dumped. These shocking reports confirm the worst fears of many as the invasion continues into its fifth week. There have long been reports of Russian atrocities from occupied territories but the new pictures are proof of what many feared. BBC journalists found the bodies of civilians who were slaughtered by Russian troops in another part of Kyiv. In Mria and Myla, both in the Kyiv Oblast, they counted a total of 13 dead bodies along a stretch of road. It comes after Ukraine's troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages around Kyiv since Russia pulled back from the area this week, Ukrainian officials said. ""The whole Kyiv region is liberated from the invader,"" Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said. Ukraine's armed forces reported diminished Russian air and missile strikes on Saturday but said Russian troops retreating from near Kyiv were deploying mines. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in a video address: ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" Ukraine's emergencies service said over 1,500 explosives had been found in one day during a search of the village of Dmytrivka, west of Kyiv. However, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg feared the departure of Russian troops from around Kyiv was “not a real withdrawal”. He told CNN: “What we see is that Russia is repositioning its troops and they are taking some of them back to rearm them, to reinforce them, to resupply them.” Invading soldiers are thought to be regrouping after the Kremlin previously claimed they were concentrating on consolidating gains in eastern Ukraine and along the southern coast. Russian forces continued to pound the Black Sea port city of Odesa, the main base for Ukraine’s navy. If taken, it would give Russia a land corridor from Crimea to Transnistria - a Russian-speaking breakaway province of Moldova that hosts Russian troops. Serge Nykyforov told BBC1’s Sunday Morning show: “We found mass graves, we found people with their hands and with their legs tied up...and with shots, bullet holes, in the back of their head. “They were clearly civilians and they were executed. “We found half-burned bodies as if somebody tried to hide their crimes but they didn’t have enough time to do it properly.” He added: “It looks, I have to be careful with my wording, but it looks exactly like war crimes.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “Russia’s despicable attacks against innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha are yet more evidence that Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine. “No denial or disinformation from the Kremlin can hide what we all know to be the truth – Putin is desperate, his invasion is failing, and Ukraine’s resolve has never been stronger.”",13,5.173920155781498,4.145576165443453,1.028343990338045,22
2022-04-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-huge-blast-sends-smoke-26607975,Huge fire sends smoke into sky at Russian oil depot near Ukraine border,"A huge explosion with flames and smoke billowing up into the sky has taken place at a Russian oil depot after it was claimed to be struck by a Ukrainian air strike. Two helicopters from the Ukrainian armed forces fired at the storage facility in Belgorod causing the massive fire, claimed the governor of the region Vyacheslav Gladkov. He alleged that the helicopters entered Russian territory after flying at low altitude. Video images of the purported attack posted online showed what looked like several missiles being fired from low altitude, followed by an explosion. It comes two days after the province was rocked by blasts at an arms depot. Two people were hurt in Friday's fire, Gladkov said on Telegram, and residents of three city streets have been evacuated. But Russian oil firm Rosneft, which owns the fuel depot, said in a separate statement that no one was hurt in the fire, though it gave no information on the cause. Gladkov said this week that the arms depot explosions were believed to be a result of a fire, although he said the regional authorities were awaiting confirmation from the defence ministry. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for any of the incidents. Russian state media reported that Ukraine shelling struck the arsenal causing it to explode in the blast two days ago. There were at least four injuries although that may be downplaying the severity of the attack. Witnesses said the strike had come either “via drone or short range ballistic missile”. Video of the explosion shared to the social media platform showed a huge explosion illuminating the night sky in the distance of the scene being filmed. It seemed to cause the ground to shake, with the clip shuddering up and down as the videographer paned the scene. Vladimir Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine on February 24 for what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine. Western countries say Putin's real aim was to topple Ukraine's government. At talks this week, Moscow said it would reduce offensives near the capital Kyiv and in the north as a goodwill gesture and focus on ""liberating"" the south eastern Donbas region. Kyiv and its allies say Russia is instead trying to regroup after taking losses from a Ukrainian counter-offensive that has recaptured suburbs of the capital plus strategic areas in the north east and south west. Video footage from Irpin, on the western fringe of Kyiv, showed destroyed Russian tanks amid bombed out buildings and Ukrainian authorities removing victims in body bags. ""We knew they (Russians) were being pushed out but when our army came then I fully understood we have been liberated. It was happiness beyond imagination,"" said Irpin resident Lilia Ristich. In a late night address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of ""battles ahead"" in Donbas and the besieged southern port city of Mariupol. ""We still need to go down a very difficult path to get everything we want,"" Zelensky said. Peace negotiations are set to resume by video conference on Friday. Seeking to bolster its position, Moscow is redeploying forces from Russian-backed breakaway regions in Georgia to Ukraine, Britain's defence ministry wrote on Twitter. The reinforcements indicated Russia had sustained unexpected losses, it said. US and European officials say Putin has been misled by generals about his military's dire performance.",17,4.201139045884235,2.8578767593931635,1.343262286491071,16
2022-04-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/moment-ukraine-attack-helicopters-hit-26608588,Moment Ukraine attack helicopters 'hit Russian oil depot' sparking huge inferno,"An inferno burns into the night sky in shocking footage taken at a major oil depot in Russia, which has been blamed on an attack by an Ukrainian attack helicopter. The huge fireball was recorded at the site in border region Belgorod, with footage seeming to show missiles hitting the Freida industrial district of Belgorod city, causing a massive explosion, injuring two workers. The oil plant is around 25 miles from the Ukrainian border and firefighters are attempting to put out the flames. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of Belgorod region, claimed the depot was hit by a low altitude Ukrainian attack helicopter strike at around 5:50am local time, although there was no immediate confirmation. He said: “There are casualties. Two people. They're employees of the oil depot. They've been given first aid and their lives are not in danger. “We are starting to resettle the residents of Pochtovaya, Makarenko and Konstantin Zaslonov streets to a safer location.” Two days earlier Russia claimed Ukrainian forces had dropped a missile on a munitions depot some 12 miles from the border, also in Belgorod region. Six missiles hit the facility in Krasny Oktyabr with four soldiers wounded, according to Russian sources. If the attacks on Russian territory are confirmed as Ukraine, it would mark a significant escalation in the war, and a change of tactics from Kyiv. Until now, hostilities have been limited mainly to Ukrainian territory. On the earlier attack, Gladkov claimed: “Six cases of shells ... were registered. The most important thing is that there are no victims.” Meanwhile British military intelligence claim Ukrainian forces have retaken the villages of Sloboda and Lukashivka to the south of Chernihiv and located along main supply routes between the city and Kyiv. The Ministry of Defence said in its latest update: “Ukraine has also continued to make successful but limited counter attacks to the east and north east of Kyiv. Chernihiv and Kyiv have been subjected to continued air and missile strikes despite Russian claims of reducing activity in these areas, the ministry added. It comes as Britain's top military officer claimed Vladimir Putin has already lost the war and is weaker than he was a month ago. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said: “I think we will have to look and explore and understand what the events in Ukraine mean and what impact does that have on the Integrated Review, and I think that’s perfectly fair. ""I think it would be insane not to.”",17,4.174079983704981,4.30020594053214,-0.12612595682715888,16

They were left behind by retreating Russian soldiers in what has been dubbed the highway of death. The BBC report that the tragic people were found on the same stretch of road where Vladimir Putin's troops were caught on video executing a couple last month. The broadcaster claim 13 bodies were counted between Mria and Myla, villages whose Ukrainian names translate as Dream and Sweetheart. Two of the dead are confirmed as Ukrainian civilians. The others have yet to be officially identified. They were found yards from where a couple were killed while trying to escape last month. Emergency service members carried the bodies civilians killed by the Russian attacks and they were to be transferred to a mortuary. Maksim Iowenko, his wife Ksjena and their six-year-old son were part of a convoy driving down the road when a Russian tank opened fire. Their young son survived and a friend's mother, who was also in the vehicle when it came under fire from a Russian tank unit, was injured. The BBC say bodies were strewn along a 200-yard stretch of the E-40 motorway that runs into Kyiv from the west. Journalists accompanied Ukrainian troops say they are uncovering more evidence of war crimes carried out by Putin's soldiers Along the road full of burned out cars, petrol stations and a hotel were in ruins following the relentless shellings. It is around five miles south of Irpin, a city recently reclaimed by Ukrainian troops. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn had confirmed around 3,500 people had stayed in the city, but this week that up to 300 civilians and 50 'defenders' were killed during during attacked. It comes as Russia may cut off a third of Europe's gas supply today after governments rejected Putin's demand for payment to be made in roubles, with Germany calling it ""blackmail"". Putin said he has signed a decree that foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas and in a televised address claimed contracts would be halted if these payments were not made. It is the Russian leaders strongest response yet to massive economic sanctions that have been imposed by the West on the country following its invasion of Ukraine. And a senior Russian foreign official said that the European Union will be hit hard for the sanctions, reported RIA. ""The actions of the EU will not remain unanswered ... the irresponsible sanctions by Brussels are already negatively affecting the daily lives of ordinary Europeans,"" Nikolai Kobrinets told the news agency.",17,4.113058741024762,4.298157742405742,-0.1850990013809799,22
2022-04-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraines-attack-russia-fuel-depot-26614105,Ukraine's attack on Russia fuel depot may have been 'false flag' as war rages on,"Ukraine forces have been accused of dealing a blow to Moscow’s war plans by blowing up a key fuel depot just inside Russia. The daring dawn raid, apparently by two Ukrainian Mi-24 attack helicopters, is said to have sent a fireball shooting from the Belgorod complex, which was obliterated. Tonight there was also speculation it might have been a “false flag” or self-inflicted assault by Russia to excuse a major escalation in its war-crimes riddled invasion. It is possible Russia launched the attack themselves as they have the same helicopters and it was perhaps an attempt to scupper peace talks with Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba refused to confirm or deny whether it was a suspected Russian “false flag attack” or a successful Ukrainian military operation. There were also reports that two 25 pound unguided rockets smashed into the depot, setting off a blaze that was still burning throughout the morning. If it was a Ukrainian attack it is believed to be only the second time Ukraine has launched an attack inside Russia during the 37 day-long invasion by The Kremlin’s forces. Belgorod is just 25 miles north of the border with Ukraine and is 50 miles from Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, which has been battered by war. Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said: “The fire at the oil depot occurred as a result of an airstrike from two helicopters of the armed forces of Ukraine which entered the territory of Russia at low altitude. “There are no victims.” Previously it has been reported that Ukrainian troops hit another depot in Belgorod with Tochka ballistic missiles in a desperate bid to slow down the Russian military’s fuel supply chain. It has also been revealed that as many as 300 Syrian Army soldiers, recruited by Putin’s military to join the invasion effort, have arrived in Ukraine. They have fought alongside Kremlin troops in Syria, battling Islamic State, al-Qaeda factions and other terrorist organisation. They have been brought in as the spearhead force from President Assad’s troops and will be joined by hundreds more within days, sources said. In addition as many as 1,000 members of President Putin’s private military company The Wagner Group, a killer band of mercenaries, are also believed to be in Ukraine. Wagner fighters are believed to fighting in contested Donbas, in the east of Ukraine. On Friday there were reports Ukrainian troops were ambushing many Russian troops as they retreated towards Belarus from their positions north of Kyiv. And Ukraine accused Russian forces of using children as human shields in villages near Chernihiv. Sources said they used children as hostages to avoid locals being able to give their coordinates to Ukraine’s artillery teams. And a BBC team discovered 13 dead bodies on a stretch of road outside Kyiv, many of them civilians and possibly victims of more Russian brutality. As many as 17,500 Russian troops have been killed in brutal fighting in Ukraine, but the impact on civilians has been horrific, with thousands dead. During the day a Russian missile attack on a civic building in Mykolayiv killed 28 civilians, with the death toll expected to rise. As many as 153 children in Ukraine have been killed during the invasion, which is now in its sixth week, and 245 have been injured. Overnight air raid sirens blared throughout Ukraine and loud explosions went off in the capital Kyiv. It is thought some Russian troops have withdrawn from the northern outskirts of Kyiv and headed towards Belarus. But air-sorties on Kyiv and Chernihiv have increased since Russia said it would back off from the two cities as part of peace talks in Turkey.",17,2.7532619719143554,3.8894680285699685,-1.1362060566556131,19

Wali added: ""And thank you for leaving ammo and grenades behind after retreating. Some of my comrades are now even better armed than before you arrived. Thanks thanks!""

Anton and Alexei were both signalmen of the 150th Rifle Division and each leave behind partners, one of whom is pregnant. Their division, a World War-era unit that was reformed in 2013, was one of multiple Russian units to suffer heavy losses at the start of the invasion.

The city has been left a ghost town with remaining civilians hiding in basement bunkers after weeks of devastating shell attacks. Parliamentary Human Rights Commissioner Liudmyla Denisova said the vulnerable targets, as well as doctors, are being snatched by troops in the southern port city and taken to the Donbas or Russia. Speaking on her Telegram channel on Wednesday, she claimed more than 70 such people have already been kidnapped out of a maternity hospital in the Livoberezhnyi district. Denisova urged the world community to pressure captives to release the hostages by increasing sanctions on Vladimir Putin's country. ""Such enemy actions threaten the life and health of women and newborns, and violate their right to life, freedom and personal integrity, guaranteed by Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" she added. Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko has also confirmed that people had been kidnapped from Mariupol. He said troops also abducted Kira Obedynska, the 12-year-old daughter of water polo champion Yevhen Obedynskyi and taken her to the occupied city of Donetsk. Obedynskyi was killed in Mariupol. Kyrylenko said: ""After the death of her father, Kira was left an orphan, since she had lost her mother in infancy. ""Kira is in Donetsk now, she was deported there along with the people with whom she was hiding in a shelter. ""There is information that the Russians took the documents from all those with Kira.

NATO chief Jan Stoltenberg believes Moscow is double dealing after claiming it would withdraw from Kyiv and Chernihiv to build up trust during peace talks. He said Russia was regrouping its forces amid evidence that its troops have suffered huge losses and have been repeatedly pushed back north of Kyiv anyway. Mr Stoltenberg said: “We have heard the recent statements that Russia will scale down military operations around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine. “But Russia has repeatedly lied about its intentions. So we can only judge Russia on its actions, not on its words. According to our intelligence, Russian units are not withdrawing, but repositioning. “Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region. “At the same time, Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering.” It came after UK spy boss Sir Jeremy Fleming said Putin had “massively misjudged” the war. The GCHQ chief, in Australia, said in a rare public speech: “He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. “He overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory. “We’ve seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale – refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment, and accidentally shooting down their own aircraft. Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.” The White House confirmed that “Putin is being misinformed by his advisors”, while the head of Britain’s armed forces, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, said Russia’s bid to take all of Ukraine looks to have “fallen apart” and said that Moscow’s withdrawal leaves its troops open to counter-attacks. Further allegations of Russian war crimes emerged today. Ukraine’s SBU spy service released a tape of an intercepted call in which a Russian soldier said: “We have three tank guys here – they raped a girl.” The voice adds: “She was 16.” In another call a soldier “sick” of ready meals said: “We had dog yesterday. We just wanted some meat.” The recordings, being compiled for future war crimes trials, were released on Twitter. One Ukrainian responded: “Filth – they will burn in hell.” Some Russian troops retreating from nuclear disaster zone Chernobyl, north of Kyiv, are being taken to a clinic in Gomel, Belarus, to be treated for “acute radiation sickness”. Yaroslav Yemelianenko, from the Ukrainian state agency overseeing the exclusion zone, said Russian troops had disturbed radiated sites. He said: “There are rules for dealing with this area.. because radiation is physics – it works without regard to status or shoulder straps.” By the war’s 36th day, 148 Ukrainian children had been killed. And Ukraine claimed 400,000 locals had been abducted to Russia. Rescuers searching ruined areas of Kyiv were warned by police that corpses could be booby-trapped. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the nation’s defence was “at a turning point”, and asked for more help from the West with “tanks, aircraft, artillery systems”. A petition to try Putin at the International Criminal Court has almost 1.5million signatures globally. Accusations include the bombing of a Mariupol theatre sheltering refugees where the death toll has hit 300. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said crimes against humanity, are being “thoroughly documented”. Despite claims of a retreat, both Kyiv and Chernihiv suffered more air attacks in the last 24 hours.",14,4.057712133415407,3.0368566864640547,1.0208554469513524,4

Ukrainian officials say a new Freedom of Russia legion has been formed for demoralised troops turning their backs on the Russian invaders. It comes amid reports of plummeting morale among soldiers fighting the Kremlin's war - with some said to be refusing orders and even shooting down their own planes. The Russian armed forces personnel have already started training to fight alongside their new comrades, it is claimed. Pictures purportedly show Russians training alongside their new Ukrainian comrades. Yesterday the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said on its Telegram channel that commanders have been visiting captured and surrendered Russian troops ""in order to select those who wish to serve"". In a follow-up post it said that the ""first volunteers"" had already started individual additional training. The ministry stated: ""Today the legion's personnel, under the guidance of Ukrainian Armed Forces instructors, studied a NLAW grenade launcher. ""In addition, the commanders of the legion's subdivisions got acquainted with the operational situation on the fronts."" Members of the new legion have ""expressed a common desire on behalf of all the volunteers to conduct the first battle against the guard dogs of the Putin regime - the Kadyrovites"". Kadyrovites refers to Chechen fighters loyal to Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov, who has backed the invasion with troops. Ukrainian news site Bagnet says that ""several hundred"" Russians of all ranks had signed up for the legion. It says that prisoners need to apply in writing, and are vetted by security and counter intelligence services. It is claimed that more than 17,000 troops Russian troops have been killed since the invasion was launched five weeks ago, with several top-level commanders among the dead. In a rare public address the head of Britain's GCHQ spy agency said Putin's advisers are scared to tell him the truth about the progress of his Ukraine invasion. But Sir Jeremy Fleming said the extent of the Russian leader's ""misjudgements"" must be ""crystal clear to the regime"". He said: ""It's clear he misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people. ""He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. ""He under-played the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He over-estimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory. ""We've seen Russian soldiers - short of weapons and morale - refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft. ""And even though we believe Putin's advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what's going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime."" He added: ""It's become his personal war, with the cost being paid by innocent people in Ukraine and increasingly, by ordinary Russians too.""",14,3.983421708930032,3.5481741051254905,0.4352476038045414,6
2022-03-31,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/putins-misfiring-ukraine-invasion-worryingly-26602732,Putin's misfiring Ukraine war 'worryingly mirrors 90s Grozny comeback victory',"Vladimir Putin's 'misfiring' Ukraine invasion is actually mirroring Russia's successful occupation of Grozny in the 1990s, an expert has warned. Analysts are comparing the Kremlin leader to a misinformed and cornered rat who is more dangerous now than he was at the start of the war five weeks ago. The ex-KGB intelligence officer might begin to draw hope from his country's historical turnaround during the Chechen War in 1995, it is claimed. Leaked battle plans suggest Putin was confident his forces would conquer Ukrainian capital Kyiv within 48 hours when he declared his ""special military operation"" on February 24. But instead, the city has held strong and Moscow has seen catastrophic losses. On the face of it, Putin appears to have miscalculated many key points along the way. Ukrainian citizens haven't welcomed his troops as the saviours with open arms he was anticipating, and his opposing number, Volodymyr Zelensky, has not been defeated. He assumed Russia's economy was sanction proof, but it isn't. He counted on the support of China but they're hedging their bets. And his 'modernised' military is too riddled with mismanagement, low morale and old-fashioned equipment to bulldoze a plucky defence armed with high-tech NATO-supplied weaponry and a clear shared goal. The best obvious outcome at this stage is one in which Putin attempts to save face by accepting considerably smaller spoils and some sanctions are lifted, reports DNYUZ. Troops are already pulling back in certain areas. But such assumptions might be wrong, argues New York Times reporter Carlotta Gall, who covered the first Chechen war in the mid-1990s. In the early stages, Chechen fighters overcame an armoured Russian brigade - which went against Moscow's assumptions. But the invading troops regrouped and instead launched a sustained attack on Grozny from afar using artillery and air attacks, ending in Russian soldiers guarding a destroyed city on plastic chairs. “There is a whole next stage to the Putin playbook, which is well known to the Chechens,” Gall writes in NYT. She said that war began with a ""shocking display of Russian incompetence"", with a ""blundering"" army consisting of conscripted soldiers ignorant of the real state of play. An expected swift overthrow of local leadership turned into a dogfight with Chechen fighters wiping out an entire Maikop brigade in one night. The Chechens celebrated victory, but Gall recalls, the lull failed to last. A renewed bombardment from Russian forces saw the defending troops expertly use Guerrilla warfare to hold off invaders for weeks. But it didn't deter the invaders and they continued with ""brute force"", annihilating anything in their way with tactics that grew were more and more horrific - and seemingly out of control. ""There was much in the experience that echoes in Ukraine today,"" writes Gall. ""Even though nearly 30 years have intervened, it is staggering to see Russia employ many of the same tactics — and mistakes — in Ukraine."" But after three months, they finally had what they wanted in the capital Grozny. A Chechen commander, Muslim Cheberloevsky, who fought against the Russian army, said of Moscow: “They have stupid tactics from the time of the Russian empire, they have not changed. “Their most important tactic is throwing bodies into the battle. They do not care about their own soldiers."" However, there is also an argument this has all been a distraction, and Putin instead has had his eyes on the energy rich eastern regions of Ukraine, home to Europe's second-largest natural gas reserves. Added to that are Crimea - taken in 2014 - which contains huge offshore energy fields, and Luhansk and Donetsk, taken before last month's full-scale invasion, with their enormous shale-gas field. Putin is also bidding to take much of Ukraine's coastline. Canadian energy expert David Knight Legg said: “Under the guise of an invasion, Putin is executing an enormous heist.” His primary plan all along may well have been to simply secure Russia's monopoly on energy - putting it in a far stronger position in the long run when dealing with sanctions.",14,3.533779665848526,4.659944925562429,-1.1261652597139027,6

Lt Col Alexander Kornik, 39, was reported to have died alongside eight soldiers of his regiment with 17 more injured. Six bodies of dead servicemen could not be removed from the water, and were carried away by the current on March 27, said senior Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsymbalyuk. However, separate accounts give the date of his death as March 2 and March 15. News of Kornik's death comes the day after it was announced that top Russian general Col Denis Kurilo had been ""eliminated"" along with 1,500 troops. The commander of the 200th motorised rifle brigade died in fighting outside Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, it was claimed. Just three days prior, Ukraine announced Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev, 48, was the seventh general and the second lieutenant general to be killed in the invasion. Sources in Kyiv said the commander, who previously claimed that the war would be over in a matter of hours, died in a strike close to Kherson city. Pictures show a funeral service held for Kornik in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg where he was given full military honours. Despite this, Russia has not officially announced his death in common with many soldiers killed in Ukraine. Putin has only acknowledged the death of one general so far, understood to be Major Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky, in a speech shortly after the war began. Ukrainian forces have also claimed to have eliminated Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, Major General Oleg Mityaev, Major General Vitaly Gerasimov and Major General Andrei Kolesnikov. Reports indicate that Kornik was chief of staff of the 40th Engineer Regiment. The Russian troops were killed seeking to build the pontoon over the Desna River. Ukrainian sources say that five years ago he was barred from entry to the country and found carrying classified documents seen as military training manuals. They included blasting and de-mining instructions and guides on installing heavy machine guns on vehicles, as well as the construction of fortifications and defensive structures. He was accused at the time of supervising the training of gangs in the occupied territories of Ukraine.",14,7.36135644280099,7.397553447156858,-0.03619700435586726,11

The Pentagon confirmed Russian troops were pulling out of the irradiated nuclear wasteland, but an employee at the Public Council at the State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management said they were running away ""irradiated"". He said they were being transported by the bus load to a special radiation medical centre in Gomel, Belarus to help treat their radioactive poisoning. In a post on facebook, Yaroslav Yemelianenko, who worked to keep the site safe, said: ""Another batch of radiation irradiation of Russian terrorists who captured the Chernobyl zone, was brought to the Belarusian center of radiation medicine in Gomel today. ""Digging the trenches in the Rudu forest, bitches? Now live the rest of your short life with this. There are rules of handling this territory. ""They are mandatory to perform because radiation is physics - it works regardless of status or chases. If you have minimal intelligence in command or soldiers, these consequences could have been avoided."" He went onto quote a Belarusian TV channel which said ""about 7 medical PAZs arrived at the Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology. ""The photo shows that people are visible in cars. Let's note that Russian soldiers are brought to this centre on a regular basis"" This shocking revelation comes as US intelligence confirmed Russian soldiers have withdrawn from the site. It also comes days after Russian claimed it would 'drastically reduce combat operations' around Kyiv. Earlier this week, Moscow claimed it would take the significant step as a gesture to advance peace talks, but both Ukrainian and US officials expressed scepticism about Russian intentions. ABC News reported that the Pentagon said they had only seen “small numbers” of Russian withdrawals after Russia's first claim, but that these were repositioning of troops, not retreat. They challenged Russia characterising this as a move for peace, when in reality it was talked up military strategy. Then, the Pentagon said it believed those troops could simply be moved elsewhere such as to the Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, where Russia controls. In its most specific description of Russian forces moving away from Kyiv, the Pentagon said that ""less than 20%"" of the Russian contingent in the vicinity of the Ukrainian capital were starting to ""reposition"". Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said those that had begun to move away from Kyiv had been deployed in the vicinity of the Hostomel airport north west of Kyiv. He added, it appeared that the Russian troops being pulled away from the capital was in an effort to resupply and reorganise with their help elsewhere, not send them back to Russia. However, the move will be greeted as good news by many as early fighting around the infamous nuclear power station raised fears it could become damaged amid gunfire. It comes as earlier today the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned the occupying Russian forces that there was a danger of ammunition exploding at the site. In a video posted on Telegram, she said: ""We demand that the UN Security Council immediately take measures to demilitarize the Chernobyl exclusion zone and introduce a special UN mission there to eliminate the risk of the repeat of a nuclear catastrophe."" Only days ago, Russian troops trampled unprotected one of deadliest area, Chernobyl's 'Red Forest', kicking up radioactive dust. On the first day of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the site's workers quickly became trapped there at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. The workers were stuck there for more than 12 days under Russian guard, keeping the site working and safe. Even though it is no longer a functioning power station, Chernobyl was never abandoned and requires constant supervision to keep safe. It was this that Russia jeopardised early on. But now, it looks like as Russia's invading forces continue to be stretched thin, the Kremlin may have recalled the soldiers. This comes over a month into Moscow's deadly invasion of Ukraine. Early reports claimed Russia had intended to seize the capital in a 'lightning invasion', the Financial Times reported. Instead of seizing the capital and rampaging across the country, welcomed as victors, like some Russian troops reportedly expected, they are in the second months of staunch, bloody Ukrainian resistance. And instead of ousting comedian-turned-politician Volodymyr Zelensky's government, Russia are now negotiating with them.",14,3.420320647372952,3.539786533788164,-0.11946588641521227,19

The complex - clearly marked with the famous red cross and white background sign - was struck with artillery and targeted by warplanes. It was the latest possible barbaric war crime committed by Moscow’s troops amid growing doubt about Kremlin peace negotiations. The red cross building is in besieged port city Mariupol where officials warn a desperate humanitarian disaster is fast unfolding with thousands killed by Russia. Ukrainian ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said: “In Mariupol, the occupiers aimed at the building of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)."" She said that on Wednesday the building came under fire even though its roof is marked with an internationally recognised Red Cross symbol. The symbol marks out that the structure holds wounded or ill people, or civilian or humanitarian cargo and is clearly visible from the air. She added: “This is another war crime by the Russian Army in accordance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and a gross violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. “I call on the world community to condemn the barbaric actions of the occupying country in shelling the ICRC building and to take measures to end the bloody war on the territory of Ukraine as soon as possible.” There is overwhelming evidence now of apartment buildings, residences, hospitals, cultural venues, and shopping malls destroyed by Russian bombs. As many as 300 people have been slaughtered by Russian airstrikes and shooting in Irpin, near Kyiv before the town was snatched back by Ukraine this week. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn confirmed that he believed many bodies of victims still lie beneath the rubbled buildings. It was revealed by Ukraine today that 145 children have now died from Russian attacks and 232 have been wounded. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly counter-attacked Russian troops around the capital and in other cities throughout the country, driving them back. Many observers and analysts believe Russian claims of a withdrawal from Kyiv and Chernihiv coincide with Moscow suffering huge losses. A former western intelligence officer told the Daily Mirror: “This is not about the Kremlin seriously negotiating a peace deal with Ukraine. “It is about Russia regrouping, consolidating, re-arming and forming new battle plans to try and bring Ukraine to its knees, whilst leaving it ruined. “The Kremlin knows its forces have been hammered with losses of more than 17,000 and there is huge cynicism about their intentions to negotiate.” London-based security sources added that their counterparts in the United States were also “highly doubtful” about Russian sincerity regarding peace. Today a former Ukrainian national security adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky cast doubt on Russian pledges to stop attacking Kyiv and Chernihiv. Moscow negotiators had suggested they will partially withdraw from the two cities as a gesture to gain trust from Ukrainian peace negotiators in Istanbul, Turkey. But Kyiv suffered a massive cyber attack within hours and by morning Ukraine announced there was “no evidence” of a Russian withdrawal. The capital’s Ministry of Defence reported a “massive” and “ongoing” cyber attack on its official website - with Russian hackers being prime suspects. Oleksander Danylyuk said the sound of shelling this morning had confirmed his fears. He added: ”This is just regrouping,” and he added that Russia is “not going to ease their grab” on Kyiv and Chernihiv – “this is just words.” He continued: “As always there are military and diplomatic KGB games all combined, this is just one game.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed fears that Moscow is not serious about de-escalating as peace talks continue. He said: “Yes, we can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive. But those signals don’t silence the explosions of Russian shells. “Of course we see the risks. Of course we don’t see any basis for trusting the words voiced by those or other representatives of the state that is continuing to fight for our destruction.” Mayor of Ukrainian city Ivano Frankivsk Ruslan Martsynkiv, told the Daily Mirror: “I do not believe the Russians intend to stop this attack - not at all. “Even if there was a peace deal negotiated, they will start the war again within a year, maybe even sooner. Nobody believes them and why should they, given what they are doing?” Negotiations resumed this morning, five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead, almost four million Ukrainians fleeing the country and nearly ten million displaced. UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said UK sanctions against Russia will remain in place until the invasion of Ukraine is “withdrawn.” He added: “The sanctions are there to tighten the grip on Putin’s war machine.”",17,3.9490480589776995,4.12203513304342,-0.17298707406572067,15

Ukraine has announced that Colonel Denis Kurilo, commander of the 200th motorised rifle brigade, had been ""eliminated"". He is claimed to have died in fighting outside Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine. The Ukrainian army claims Kurilo's brigade had lost around 1,500 troops since the start of the war, while overall 17,200 members of Putin's forces are claimed to have died. In a statement it said: “During battles near Kharkiv, the enemy’s 200th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade lost two battalion and tactical groups and the brigade’s commander, colonel Denis Kurilo. ""The losses of the 200th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade came to more than 1,500 troops.""

Roman Hrybov was based on the tiny Snake Island in the Black Sea with 13 other soldiers when he refused to give up despite being outnumbered and being bombarded from sea and air by the Russians. On being told to put down their weapons, the response from Hrybov by radio that “Russian warship, go f*** yourself”, was broadcast around the world. Initially it was feared that the soldiers had died as the radio recording suddenly cut out but it was later revealed that some had survived and were taken prisoner. President Volodymyr Zelensky said at first that all the soldiers would be given posthumous medals. He later said in an interview that “some of the soldiers died, some were taken prisoner”. Now Hrybov, from the city of Cherkasy, has been returned in exchange for sailors on a Russian ship that was captured on March 25 by Ukrainian forces. A video by Cherkasy’s Regional State Administration has shown him being given an award from the head of of the regional administration Igor Taburets. Hrybov said: ""I want to say a big thank you to the Ukrainian people for such support. We strongly feel this support, it inspires us."" Also, Taburets said that the border guard was ""an example"" to other Ukrainians. ""I think that Ukraine should really know its heroes and Cherkasy should know its heroes,"" he said. ""The most important thing is that he survived, in spite of moral pressure, in spite of everything, and he will be an example for our Ukrainians and the people of Cherkasy."" The news of the Hrybov refusing to surrender along with other early acts of heroism, including a soldier who blew himself up along with a bridge to slow the advancement of Russian tanks, have inspired Ukrainian resistance despite being outnumbered by the Russians. Cities like Kharkov and Mariupol have been left in ruins from Russian shelling but people are refusing to surrender. Latest reports from Mariupol are that thousands of civilians may have died, according to the head of the United Nations human rights mission on Tuesday. Those who remain are suffering with little food and water. ""We are eight people. We have two buckets of potatoes, one bucket of onions,"" said Irina, an engineer, in her apartment where windows had been blasted out.

The boy named Adam - one of Kadyrov's 12 children - was seen on footage of the feared ruler, a close ally of Vladimir Putin in the ravaged Ukrainian city. Kadyrov said he wanted him “to learn first hand about the successes and needs of our comrades-in-arms”, and also made clear he disagrees with Russia moves to lessen the military pressure on Kyiv, instating vowing to lead an invasion of the capital. Kadyrow was promoted to the rank of Lt-General in the Russian national guard and claimed that he had been briefed by Andrey Mordvichev, one of the senior commanders that the Ukrainians claimed to have killed, the country's military claimed said on Saturday, March 19. On footage taken before this, Kadyrov was seen introducing the boy to the Russian army general, saying: ""Here is my Adam”. Mordvichev replies: ""Hi, well done!"" Kadyrov tells him: ""Adam is 13.” Records of the boy’s age show him to be 14 and the minimum age for soldiers to go to war in Russia is 18. In one sequence the child, dressed in military uniform, is shown with his father visiting the hospital bedside Kadryrov’s henchman commander Ruslan Geremeyev. Geremeyev is a suspect in the murder of Russian liberal politician Boris Nemtsov, a leading Putin foe and former deputy prime minister, gunned down close to the Kremlin in 2015. Even the Russian Federal Security Service, once headed by Putin, has been unable to locate and quiz Geremeyev over the political assassination, say reports. Geremeyev sustained relatively minor injuries in fighting Ukrainian defenders, according to Chechen TV. Kadyrov - accused of using medieval torture on his enemies in Chechnya - has been called “the son Putin never had” for his devout loyalty to the Kremlin leader. Adam was earlier at the centre of controversy over his expensive watch collection - including a Richard Mille original reported to cost more than £263,000. “I met with the commander of the 8th Guards Combined Arms Army, Lieutenant General of the Russian Armed Forces Andrey Mordvichev,” said Kadyrov. “ [Mordvichev] reported on the significant successes of the fighters in critical areas and mentioned the approximate dates for the capture of Mariupol by the Russian army.” As well as his son Adam, other Kadyrov relatives are in Ukraine in his entourage, several of them ministers in his government in the oil rich region in the TransCaucasus. ""A special military operation in Mariupol to cleanse the city of Bandera [Ukrainian nationalists], Nazis and rabid shaitans without family or tribe is proceeding in accordance with the developed plan.” He vowed to fully bring Mariupol to heel before seeking to grab the Ukrainian capital. “We will honourably carry out the order of our Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Russian President Vladimir Putin,” he said. “He entrusted us with one of the most important and difficult areas, and we will justify his trust 100 percent. “Very soon we will complete the assigned tasks in Mariupol and report to the President of the Russian Federation on our readiness to take Kyiv.” In Chechnya, Kadyrov, 45, is accused of human rights abuses and torture against his political opponents and gay activists. It was unclear how Geremeyev was wounded. Earlier Kadyrov had posted: ""The most difficult section in Mariupol was assigned to him, and the commander coped with the task brilliantly. “In the same way, he always showed himself during the Chechen campaign in battles with shaitans - he was the first to ask for battle and perform the most difficult task. “This time too he justified his name as an experienced and fearless commander.”",14,4.867497145672492,6.085040180977103,-1.2175430353046108,6

It comes as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russian troops are murdering officials in cities throughout the country Speaking from Kyiv, he accused Moscow’s forces of kidnapping Mayors and then leaving them dead or missing. Early in the war Ivan Federov, mayor of Melitopol, was abducted by Russian troops, sparking mass protests by Ukrainians. Ten masked soldiers are said to have entered the town’s crisis centre, put a bag over his head and marched him away to an unknown location. Days later Yevheniy Matvieyev, head of the southern town of Dniprorudne, was also abducted by Russian troops, leading to accusations made against Moscow of “systematic war crimes” by Ukraine’s military. Zelensky said: “They are kidnapping the mayors of our cities. They killed some of them. We can’t find some of them. “We have already found some of them and they are dead.” The shocking claim comes amid fears Russian troops are compensating for their disastrous invasion by resorting to deliberately targeting civilians and executing officials. Ahead of peace talks the Ukrainian leader said his country could declare neutrality and offer security guarantees to Russia to secure peace “without delay”. Some 17,000 Russian troops have been killed in the invasion and 586 tanks blown up in ferocious fighting.

Professor Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert, urged Western leaders to 'bolster' preparations for a biological and chemical attack following the suspected attack. The University of Minnesota academic warned that Vladimir Putin could also target political foes with his arsenal of deadly illegal weapons. It comes after Russian oligarch Mr Abramovich was allegedly poisoned alongside two Ukrainian peace negotiators earlier this month. The trio suffered symptoms including red eyes, painful tearing and peeling skin following their meeting in Kyiv. The professor warned that chemical weapons could also be used by Russia to break the stalemate in Ukraine. He added: ""However implausible a biological or chemical attack once seemed, the United States and its NATO allies need to game out the worst-case scenarios, take inventory of the resources they have at their collective disposal to deal with biological and chemical attacks, and swiftly bolster those resources. ""Just a few weeks ago, the notion that Russia might use such weapons in its campaign in Ukraine would have seemed unduly alarmist. That is no longer the case."" Prof Osterholm added that Putin also 'seemingly has no compunction' about using banned weapons against his political enemies. The academic said biological and chemical weapons can achieve in war what bombs and bullets cannot - by reaching civilians hiding in shelters. He warned that poisonous gas could leave areas of Ukraine uninhabitable, while weaponised diseases could spread across the world. It comes after Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with Novichok - just like former Kremlin spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The father and daughter were attacked in Salisbury in 2018, while Mr Navalny was poisoned in 2020. In 2006, Putin critic and ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko died in London after being poisoned with radioactive polonium-210. Now Chelsea owner Abramovich, 55, has allegedly been poisoned while taking part in Ukraine peace talks. The suspected attack has been blamed on hard-liners in Moscow who wanted to foil talks to end the war. It remains unclear what has caused the symptoms, which may have been triggered by a chemical or biological agent, or a form of electromagnetic-radiation attack. An investigation into the incident was launched by Christo Grozev and a German forensic team was brought in to perform examinations. However, too much time passed between the initial poisoning and these tests, so the suspected poison was unable to be detected. Mr Grozev concluded that the attack was a warning rather than an attempt to kill negotiators. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine?

Ramzan Kadyrov, known for his love of using cruel mediaeval tortures against his enemies, has been promoted to Lt-General in the national guard. In the past the West has suspected him of ordering a number of extra-judicial killings outside Russia, which he has always denied. His crimes are said to include human rights abuses and torturing his political opponents and gay activists. The tyrant has now taken charge of Russia’s mission to wipe port city Mariupol - once the home of around 500,000 people- off the map. Operativnye Svodki Telegram channel reported on March 28: ""Sources close to the Chechen leader's entourage say that Ramzan Kadyrov is in Mariupol and personally leads the special operation."" A video shows him meeting and embracing General Andrey Mordvichev who was the fifth of Putin’s leading soldiers to die in Ukraine in the war, according to the Defence ministry of Ukraine. Ruslan Geremeyev, a senior officer with the Chechen Interior Ministry, suspected of involvement in the 2015 assassination of Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, is also said to be taking part in Russia ’s ""special military operation"" in Mariupol. Kadyrov credited him with a key role in the mayhem that has seen much of Mariupol destroyed. He said: “My dear brother Ruslan Geremeyev always completes tasks entrusted to him. “He was assigned the most difficult sector in Mariupol and the commander completed the mission with flying colours... “This time too, he lived up to his name of an experienced and fearless commander.” Around 100,000 people are still trapped in Mariupol, which has been 90% destroyed after being pulverised by air and artillery strikes. Surrounded by Russian forces, those doing their best to survive in the city have had no power, water or heat for more than a month. Shops have been emptied of supplies and bodies of those killed in the incessant bombing raids either litter the streets or have been buried in makeshift graves. It is feared as many as 5,000 have been killed in Mariupol where hundreds of corpses have been dumped in mass graves ordered by its council. Mayor Boichenko said on national television: “The situation in the city remains difficult. People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe.

The unconfirmed report from Kyiv's Ministry of Defence said that the un-named commander of Russia ’s 13th tank regiment – part of the “4th tank division of the Russian Federation” shot himself on discovering 90% of his tanks could not be used. It is claimed that materials from the tanks had been stolen, reported the Daily Star. Bill Browder, a businessman who was for many years the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia, says that financial corruption has crippled the Russian army. “My estimate is that 80% of the military budget is stolen by Russia’s generals, because 80% of all budgets in Russia are stolen by the officials in charge,"" Browder told the Wall Street Journal. Because their wages are skimmed by their superiors, the rank and file troops are reduced to selling the fuel from their tanks on the black market to supplement their income. Ukraine ’s Ministry of Defence said in a Telegram bulletin that that some of the tanks’ vital electronic equipment, which contains gold and other precious metals, had been stripped. It claimed Russia is “is trying to put into operation a significant amount of equipment coming from long-term storage facilities,” and “the condition of this equipment is mostly extremely unsatisfactory, which makes its full use impossible”. Ukraine reportedly said that Russia’s plans to transfer equipment from storage facilities and into battle have collapsed because so much of the kit has been stripped and sold by servicemen. The corruption comes from the top, says Browder, with Russian leader Vladimir having a personal fortune “north of $200 billion” hidden away in secret bank accounts – often in the names of his oligarch cronies. That figure would put the Russian leader's net worth close to that of the official richest man in the world, Elon Musk. But, he adds, Putin’s incredible wealth could be taken from him if he were to be deposed by a Kremlin rival. “The moment he’s not in power, none of these handshake deals with the oligarchs will be respected,"" he said. It’s because of Putin’s need to be seen a strongman within Russia that the invasion of Ukraine was triggered, claimed Border. “Putin believed he needed a good war.

Russian state media reports that Ukraine shelling struck the arsenal causing it to explode. There are at least four injuries although that may be downplaying the severity of the attack. Witnesses said the strike had “presumably” come either “via drone or short range ballistic missile”. Video of the explosion shared to the social media platform shows a huge explosion illuminating the night sky in the distance of the scene being filmed. It seems to cause the ground to shake, with the clip shuddering up and down as the videographer pans the scene. The attack comes as the latest blow to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who is currently said to be hiding away at a top secret nuclear bunker east of Moscow. Movements of planes used by top Kremlin officials show that Putin could be spending some or all of his time at the hideaway near Surgut in western Siberia, it is claimed. The use of the high security bunkers, if confirmed, is alarming and suggests Putin may be preparing to deploy nuclear weapons, and move that would lead to inevitable reprisal. Putin's defence minister Sergei Shoigu is also believed to be in a bunker near Ufa in the Urals, 725 miles east of Moscow, according to investigative journalist Christo Grozev. The Kremlin said it will be withdrawing troops from the Kyiv area of Ukraine after days of stalemate at the Ukraine capital. The UK's defence ministry Ben Wallace said earlier that Ukrainian forces had succeeded in pushing back Russian troops from a number of positions.

Some soldiers claimed that they were unaware they were heading for all out war, instead suggesting that they thought they were headed on a training exercise. The country is now littered with the bodies of Russian soldiers and conscripts, many of them teenagers, and the burnt out remains of tanks and armoured vehicles. The miserable state of the war, which is being waged in the Ukrainian winter, has led some Russian soldiers towards mutiny.

A Russian soldier swapped sides and handed over a tank to his opponents for £7,500 and Ukrainian citizenship, it is claimed.

He added: “More precisely, what is happening there has the characteristics of a war crime, a crime that can only be qualified by a court, which has no statute of limitations, no amnesty in Ukrainian or international law.” Russia has separately opened a criminal investigation into the “extreme cruelty” of Ukrainian “nationalists” in their treatment of Russian military captives. “Footage appeared on the Internet in which Ukrainian nationalists treat prisoners extremely cruelly,” said a statement from the Russian Investigative Committee. “A video circulating on the net shows how captured soldiers were shot in the legs without medical assistance. “According to some reports, illegal actions took place at a base of Ukrainian nationalists in the Kharkiv region.” Ukraine’s military commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhniy did not specifically deny the authenticity of these videos but claimed Russia “produces and shares videos with inhuman treatment of alleged ‘Russian prisoners’ by ‘Ukrainian soldiers’ in order to discredit Ukrainian defence forces.

This weekend the group published another video in which their bearded commander aims slurs at Vladimir Putin and boasts of stealing Russian military equipment. ""This is a captured equipment and this is destroyed equipment,"" he tells the camera, according to one translation, before gesturing to both burned out and intact tanks. ""But most importantly there are a lot of trophies. Not only here but over there and there."" The camera man then asks the soldier, who is carrying a large machine gun and has the Ukrainian blue tied around his arm, whether he was scared of Russia's military firepower. ""No not at all,"" he responds. ""Not scared because truth and freedom is with us."" The Belarussian division joined the Ukrainian resistance effort at the beginning of March, following President Volodymyr Zelensky's plea for foreign fighters to help defend his country. Yan Melnikov announced that he is heading the first unit of foreign volunteers in the Ukrainian armed forces with more than 50 recruits from his country. ""We urge every Belarusian who has a desire to fight shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians for the common ideals of freedom and the value of sovereignty to join us,"" he said in a video released by the nationalist Azov Battalion. The group is fighting for Ukraine despite the sentiments of the government of Belarus, which has sided with Russia. President Alexander Lukashenko allowed Russian troops and tanks into Belarus ahead of the invasion, giving Putin a key route from the north towards Kyiv. It is unclear where the Belarussian public in general stand on the Russian invasion, given how brutally the country's police crack down on protests. Zelensky called on foreign fighters to help Ukraine on February 27 - the day the war officially began. A day later, he signed a decree waiving visas for any foreign nationals wishing to join the Ukrainian army, while the foreign affairs ministry launched a website providing details about how to apply. Over the following fortnight Ukrainian authorities said that some 20,000 people from 52 countries have applied to join the legion. Among them is a British garage owner with no military experience who has vowed to fight ""to the death"". Adam Ennis, 35, signed up to an international platoon in Kyiv. The amateur fighter's extraordinary and terrifying mission began when he boarded a £40 one way flight from Edinburgh to Krakow with just a gym bag on his shoulder. He escaped death after leaving a base near the Polish border just days before it was destroyed by Russian bombs. Adam told the Daily Record how he has since been on daily patrols in Ukraine and witnessed active combat with firing on Vladimir Putin's soldiers.",14,3.789568294132594,4.304159455013325,-0.5145911608807312,19

Irina Starikova is said to have told her captors that Russian forces left her to die after she was wounded in battle. She served with the Russian separatists in the Donestk region of Ukraine - which had been fighting Kyiv since 2014. Ukrainian armed forces announced Starikova's capture saying she ""shot our prisoners in 2014"". Her capture has also been confirmed by Giorgi Revishvili, a researcher at the Department of War Studies at King’s College London. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine?

He added that she s allegedly responsible for “killing 40 Ukrainians including civilians”. Starikova is originally from Serbia and has been hunted by Ukrainians since 2014, according to reports. Ukraine’s Obozrevatel news website quotes a soldier named Vlad Ivanov who said Starikova was given medical treatment when captured. The sniper is also quoted as saying that “they left, knowing that I was injured and had the opportunity to pick me up…hoping that I would die”. Starikova was a sniper of 11th Specialized Special Operations Division, it has been reported. Her background is shrouded in mystery as some reports say she is a former handball player named Daniela Lazovic, who has a conviction for drug trafficking. It has also been alleged that she was a nun at one point in her life. It comes as an elite sniper rumoured to have been killed by Russian troops after dropping into war-torn Ukraine said he was just in ""black-out mode"". The Canadian sharpshooter, known only as 'Wali', said he believes Moscow spread reports of his supposed death as part of its propaganda campaign. However, he said he has had some close calls of late, including surviving a tank shelling while hiding inside a house. Wali joined the war effort soon after Vladimir Putin ordered the attack on February 24 and had been keeping followers on social up to date with what he was doing.

The footage from the Russian invasion of Ukraine captures a weapon system targeting the armoured vehicle, which appears on the system's screen in a grainy image. A series of munitions are then seen striking the hull of the T-72B3 tank, and a few seconds later the vehicle explodes as the projectile detonates. The hand of a Ukrainian soldier operating the system can also be seen, as they guide in the precision weapon to hit the tank at close range. It is thought to be a Skif anti-tank guided missile. Ukrainian forces have inflicted heavy losses on Russian armour, using sophisticated anti-tank weaponry to cause heavy damage to Putin's armoured columns. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The Javelin missile system has been put to particularly devastating use by Ukrainian armed forces. This anti-tank weapon is used by infantry, and is capable of hitting targets both directly and indirectly, with the projectile being designed to plunge down on top of a tank from above where the armour is often weakest. The Javelin's distinctive sound when fired can also have a significant psychological impact on enemy soldiers, and its operators can change position frequently, making them difficult to track down. One Russian solider was even bribed into surrendering his vehicle, which he gave up in exchange for £7,500 and Ukrainian citizenship. Russian morale appears to be only getting worse, with one Russian solider even driving his tank over his commanding officer as a result of the awful losses the Russian army has suffered. At least fifteen senior Russian commanders have so far been killed during the invasion, with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky claiming that more than 16,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, as well as significant losses being inflicted on Russian military hardware. Observers of the invasion have highlighted Putin's abject failure to achieve the objectives of the invasion, despite the Kremlin's assertion that the 'special military operation' had achieved what it set out to. Nonetheless, despite the losses suffered by Russian forces, there has still been a devastating impact upon Ukraine, with some drawing harrowing parallels between the military and media tactics that Russia used during its intervention in Syria in 2015. Russian airstrikes continue to devastate urban areas, with reports of schools and even a maternity hospital housing expectant mothers being targeted, though Russia has denied the attack took place.

2022-03-28,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/murdered-putin-rival-tailed-suspected-26575637,Murdered Putin rival 'tailed' by hit squad agent suspect now besieging Mariupol,"A Russian agent linked to a Kremlin hit squad tailed a critic of president Vladimir Putin before he was murdered, a new investigation reveals. And in a fresh twist, the commander suspected of the murder has allegedly been spotted in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Putin rival Boris Nemtsov was murdered in 2015 after speaking out against Russia's first military action in Ukraine in 2014. Nemtsov had reportedly been shadowed by an agent who had links to a hit squad, and was later shot dead only metres away from the Kremlin. Seven years on and a new investigation from Bellingcat and the Insider - in partnership with the BBC - has revealed the main suspect in his killing is a former operative for the FSB, the Russian security service, Valery Sukharev. Sukharev reportedly tailed Nemtsov on at least 13 journeys during his time at the FSB. In a new development, prime murder suspect Ruslan Geremeyev has now been spotted in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, which is currently being mercilessly besieged by Russian forces. The intel was obtained from a database called Magistral, which is used by the FSB. Corrupt officials reportedly leaked the information, revealed through flight and train reservations, to investigators. The Magistral database tracks movements of both agents and the people they are following. Executive director of Bellingcat, Christo Grozev, told the BBC that corruption within Russia meant that a resource like Magistral would be a 'double-edged sword' because 'it allows people like us to actually go and tail these same spies, these same FSB officers'. Five men of Chechen origin were arrested and jailed in the wake of Nemtsov's murder. But this did not satisfy Nemtsov's family, who pushed for investigators to look into possible involvement of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Geremeyev had served as the commander of the unit of one of the individuals who was jailed, the Nemtsov family's lawyer Vadim Prokhorov also called for him to face questioning over Nemtsov's death. Prokhorov has even named Geremeyev as the person behind the killing, and he fled to Dubai after being declared a suspect so never faced questioning. The US treasury subsequently imposed sanctions on Geremeyev over the killing, as well as allegations relating to torture. Geremeyev has now re-emerged in a photo taken in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol alongside armed companions and shared on Telegram. The 43-year-old is said to be part of the Chechen contingent fighting there, as reported by the Times. Ukrainian officials have claimed that as much as 90% of the beleaguered city has been heavily damaged in a month of Russian bombardment. It was home to 400,000 people before the Russian invasion. The image of Geremeyev shows a Chechen flag flying behind the group, with the face of Ramzan Kadyrov displayed on it. Kadyrov has also described Geremeyev as 'dear brother', and said that he 'always gets the job done'. He added that: ""He was assigned the most difficult area of Mariupol, but in this task the commander has acquitted himself perfectly.”",13,3.5446452861398328,4.869839410332042,-1.3251941241922092,6

The claims were made by mayor Vadym Boichenko as the Ukrainian forces maintain their grip on parts of the country. But the leader did not say how the 5,000 death toll was calculated. It came as Oleksandr Markushyn, mayor of Irpin, near the fiercely fought over city of Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces had seized full control back over the town. Irpin has been one of the main hotspots of fighting with Russian troops near the capital. He said in a post on Telegram: ""We have good news today - Irpin has been liberated. ""We understand that there will be more attacks on our town and we will defend it courageously."" The mayor claimed 5,000 people had died in Mariupol on the Nexta TV channel's Twitter feed where he addressed people in army fatigues and claimed the city had been liberated. He quoted data from the mayor's office that said about 90% of buildings in Mariupol had been damaged. Markushyn added an estimated 40% of buildings had been destroyed. Boichenko had earlier called for the complete evacuation of the city. He said on Monday all civilians must be evacuated to escape a humanitarian catastrophe. Mayor Boichenko said 160,000 civilians were still trapped in the southern port city on the Sea of Azov, without heat and power after weeks of Russian bombardment. He added 26 buses were waiting to evacuate civilians from Mariupol - which normally has a population of about 400,000 people. But said Russian forces had not agreed to give them safe passage. He did not say where these people were waiting. ""The situation in the city remains difficult. People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe,"" Boichenko said on national television. ""We need to completely evacuate Mariupol."" He added: ""The Russian Federation is playing with us. We are in the hands of the invaders."" The Mirror told earlier how Vladimir Putin once threatened that he could have Russian troops in six capital cities in just two days, it is claimed. The Russian President is said to have warned former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko that he could have soldiers on the ground in Ukraine, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Romania within 48 hours.

Nonetheless the situation for Ukrainian citizens remains desperate, with Russia blocking civilian evacuation from the besieged city of Mariupol despite Ukrainian reports that 90% of the city has been damaged by the relentless bombardment. The talks have been arranged to begin on Monday following meetings between Putin and President Recep Erdoğan of Turkey. Turkey has the southern coast of the Black Sea, opposite from the Crimea, and has had historic agreements with Russia over the rights of military vessels to enter the Black Sea. Morale among Russian soldiers on the ground also appears to be low, with a report of one soldier even running over their commanding officer with a tank. Russian forces may not even have the numbers to be able to successfully occupy Ukrainian cities, and a campaign of horrific bombardment has been carried out, most notably in the city of Mariupol.

Speaking from Kyiv, the Ukrainian leader accused Moscow’s forces of kidnapping Mayors and then leaving them dead or missing. He said: “They are kidnapping the mayors of our cities. They killed some of them. We can’t find some of them. “We have already found some of them and they are dead.” Zelensky’s shocking claim comes amid fears Russian troops are compensating for their disastrous invasion by resorting to deliberately targeting civilians and executing officials. Ahead of peace talks the Ukrainian leader said his country could declare neutrality and offer security guarantees to Russia to secure peace “without delay”. Whilst claiming only a face-to-face meeting with Putin would end war Zelensky added: “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state - we are ready to go for it.” Talking before the latest round of peace talks, which are to be held in Turkey tomorrow, Zelensky stressed Ukraine ’s priority is ensuring its sovereignty and its “territorial integrity.” He said: “We must come to an agreement with the president of the Russian Federation, and in order to reach an agreement, he needs to get out of there on his own feet - and come to meet me.” Today it emerged 17,000 Russian troops have been killed in the invasion and 586 tanks blown up in ferocious fighting. Moscow has also lost 123 warplanes and 127 helicopters to Ukraine’s ground defence systems. The mayor of Irpin, near Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces had seized back full control of the town which has been one of the main hotspots of bitter fighting with Russian troops near the capital. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said: “We have good news today - Irpin has been liberated. “We understand that there will be more attacks on our town and we will defend it courageously.” Ukrainian forces are on the offensive, pushing Russian troops back in areas around Kyiv, the northeast and the southwest. Russia has meanwhile kept up pressure in the southeast near separatist areas, including its devastating siege of Mariupol, razed while tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped inside. Mayor Vadym Boichenko, who has escaped the city and was speaking from an undisclosed location, said 26 buses were waiting to evacuate some of the 160,000 trapped civilians but Russia was denying safe passage. He said: “The situation in the city remains difficult. People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe. “We need to completely evacuate Mariupol.” Ukrainian children have suffered enormously with 143 killed so far and 216 injured - even though many more deaths among the young are suspected. Hundreds of children have been rescued by a heroic underground movement dedicated to snatching them from beneath Putin’s tanks as they hide in basements. Today it emerged 30 had been plucked to safety and smuggled all the way to Ivano Frankivsk in the Carpathian foothills, where they will be safer. Aid agencies say ten million Ukrainians have been displaced in just over a month since the invasion started. And Ukraine has lost $432 billion from the Russian invasion, according to Kyiv Economy Minister Yulia Svyridenko. She said: “This is the sum of the only one-time losses that Ukraine has suffered since the Russian invasion.” She added that the biggest damage is the loss of infrastructure - 5,000 miles of roads, dozens of railway stations and airports worth £90 billion were destroyed and damaged. With Russia’s offensive stalled its troops have resorted to pummelling Ukrainian towns and cities with rockets and artillery in a grinding war of attrition. Fierce fighting has raged on the outskirts of Kyiv, but Russian troops remain miles from the city centre, their aim of quickly encircling the capital faltering In Stoyanka village near Kyiv, Ukrainian soldier Serhiy Udod said Russian troops had taken up defensive positions and suffered heavy losses. He said “probably they thought it would be like Crimea”, which Russia annexed quickly and almost without a shot fired in 2014. He added: “But, here it’s not like in Crimea. We are not happy to see them. Here they suffer and get killed.” A fiercer than expected Ukrainian resistance, bolstered by weapons from the UK and other Western allies, has bogged Russian forces down. Meanwhile, Ukraine has banned reporting on troop and equipment movements not announced or approved by the military. Journalists breaking the law, even if they are foreign, could face three to eight years in prison. Today it emerged that orders to blitz the stricken city of Kharkiv were given by a Russian general born in that city. The unnamed general’s details are kept by Ukraine’s Office of the Prosecutor General which has a list of 200 “war criminals”. Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said his identity was tracked down after her office fingered a Russian serviceman who took part in the bombing. She added: “Thanks to him we went to another suspected Russian Federation general, who gave the orders to bomb Kharkiv. “The most cynical thing is that this general was born in the Kharkiv region.”",17,3.54459686017365,3.5594281144277398,-0.01483125425408982,19

Ukraine 's head of military intelligence Kyrylo Budanov said the despot was planning to ""create North and South Korea in Ukraine"". Mr Budanov was referring to the carving-up of Korea into two separate states after World War Two. He predicted Russian forces will be pushed back with a new phase of military action that he called ""Ukrainian guerilla safari"". He said: ""In addition, the season of a total Ukrainian guerrilla safari will soon begin. ""Then there will be one relevant scenario left for the Russians, how to survive."" It comes as the country's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the West to give Ukraine tanks, planes and missiles to help fend off the Russian forces, which the Kyiv government said were increasingly targeting fuel and food depots. In its latest military assessment, the British Ministry of Defence said Russian forces appeared to be concentrating their efforts on encircling Ukrainian troops directly facing separatist regions in the east. ""The battlefield across northern Ukraine remains largely static with local Ukrainian counterattacks hampering Russian attempts to reorganise their forces,"" the ministry said. After more than four weeks of conflict, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and Moscow signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions to focus on securing the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army for the past eight years. A local leader in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic said on Sunday the region could soon hold a referendum on joining Russia, just as happened in Crimea after Russia seized the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014. Crimeans voted overwhelmingly to break with Ukraine and join Russia -- a vote that much of the world refused to recognise. Moscow says the goals for what Putin calls a ""special military operation"" include demilitarising and ""denazifying"" its neighbour. Ukraine and its Western allies calls this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion. The invasion has devastated several Ukrainian cities, caused a major humanitarian crisis and displaced an estimated 10 million people, nearly a quarter of Ukraine's total population. In a late-night television address on Saturday, Zelenskiy demanded that Western nations hand over military hardware that was ""gathering dust"" in stockpiles, saying his nation needed just 1% of NATO's aircraft and 1% of its tanks. Western nations have so far given Ukraine anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles as well as small arms and protective equipment, but have not offered any heavy armour or planes. ""We've already been waiting 31 days. Who is in charge of the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it really still Moscow, because of intimidation?"" Zelenskiy said, suggesting Western leaders were holding back on supplies because they were frightened of Russia. Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said on Sunday that Russia had started destroying Ukrainian fuel and food storage centres, meaning the government would have to disperse stocks of both in the near future. Appearing to confirm that, the Russian defence ministry said its missiles had wrecked a fuel deposit on Saturday as well as a military repair plant near the western city of Lviv, just 60 km (40 miles) from the Polish border.",14,3.306675433523031,3.6200893932007543,-0.31341395967772323,25

The port city, once the bustling home of more than half a million people, is practically deserted after a month-long bombing campaign destroyed its homes and high rises. Water, power and heat stopped working weeks ago as the people trapped inside attempted to survive on scraps they found in what was left of long-abandoned shops. Chillingly, the city has been unable to keep up with the huge death toll as the bodies of soldiers fighting to protect the city from Russians pile up at the side of the road with civilians who did not make it out. Rescuers have been unable to go in search of most bodies, owing to the constant shelling which has razed more than 90% of the city to the ground. Instead makeshift crosses are seen scattered around the ruined remains of people’s homes, or near where families were once hiding from the fighting. Others who are found have been buried with dozens of others in huge makeshift grave sites, with the UN reporting one which is believed to hold 200 corpses. Earlier this month authorities ordered workers to dig 25 metre long trenches as morgues were already at breaking point. In tragic scenes they were seen making the sign of the cross as the dead- wrapped in old carpet- are pushed into the makeshift mass graves. Among those killed in Mariupol were those caught in a devastating airstrike on a children’s hospital , killing at least 17 and injuring many more. Mayor Vadym Boichenko “My heart today is full of rage. “Today Russia led by its leader President (Vladimir) Putin carried out an air strike on a peaceful city, firing on a children's hospital,” he said. “They wanted to take away the lives of our children, our women, our doctors.” The number of civilians killed by a Russian air strike on a theatre in Ukraine has reached at least 300. Council officials in the port city of Mariupol city used eyewitness reports after the March 16 bombings to compile the grim toll. Tens of thousands are still trapped inside. Matilda Bogner, head of the UN human rights team, said there is “increasing information on mass graves that are there”. She added: “The extent of civilian casualties and the extent of damage raises serious concerns and suggests strongly there have been violations of international humanitarian law and in particular of indiscriminate attacks.” Olena Stokoz of Ukraine's Red Cross earlier warned: “The whole city remains without electricity, water, food, whatever and people are dying because of dehydration.”",17,4.8408036056629316,6.111136307397153,-1.2703327017342216,24

He was arrested at the scene of one of two target areas hit having filmed missiles heading towards the city. Police found he had even sent pictures of local checkpoints to two Russian mobile telephones before the attack, which injured five people. As many as six cruise missiles were fired on Saturday afternoon at Lviv as US President Joe Biden visited neighbouring Poland. It came amid growing fears the Kremlin is turning the sights of its long-range missiles towards the west of the country as its invasion is faltering and suffering huge losses. The Russian onslaught was a reminder that Moscow is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine despite claims it is re-focusing its offensive on the east. The back-to-back weekend airstrikes, which hit a fuel depot and a military repairs complex, shook the haven for an estimated 200,000 people who have fled their hometowns. The first strike involved two Russian rockets that hit an industrial area in the northeastern outskirts of Lviv. A second rocket attack occurred just outside the city hours later and caused three explosions. It is not known if one of more missiles either failed to reach Lviv or was shot down. Yesterday the UK distanced itself from Biden’s apparent call for Russian regime change when he said in an impassioned speech in Poland that Putin “cannot remain in power”. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the overthrow of Putin is “up to the Russian people” after the US President’s apparently unscripted call caused the White House to row back. A White House official argued that the US president’s point was that the Russian leader “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region”. Mr Zahawi said it is “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed” but suggested they “would certainly do well” to have someone who “is democratic and understands their wishes”. He said: “That’s up to the Russian people and it is only the Russian people that can make that decision, I suspect most of them are pretty fed up with Putin and his cronies and the illegal war.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky renewed his plea for western allies to provide tanks and fighter jets to repel the Russians, as he hailed the courage of his troops defending the besieged city of Mariupol. He said: “If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to hand over dozens of jets and tanks had 1% of their courage.” Yesterday the latest horror toll of children caused by the Russian invasion was revealed as Ukraine said 139 children have died and more than 205 have been injured. The Prosecutor General’s office said 733 educational institutions have been damaged, 74 of them completely destroyed. But Russia has lost a staggering number of troops and military hardware in the invasion.

Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff says that 16,600 Russian soldiers have been killed. Among the warcraft destroyed are 582 tanks, 121 aircraft, and 127 helicopters. But it is feared the losses have triggered a deadly reaction by Russia to take their failure out on the civilians, ruthlessly slaughtering them in constant barrages. There are fears that the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, which has been holding out against Russian forces, could become the next Mariupol. The city, close to the border with Belarus on the road to Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, is surrounded, and trapped residents are suffering a lack of power and drinking water as well as shelling. Just over a month into the invasion, Russia’s attack has slowed into a grinding war of attrition as its military tries to pound cities like Chernihiv into submission. Bombings of hospitals and other non-military sites, such as the Mariupol theatre where Ukrainian officials said a Russian air strike is believed to have killed some 300 people last week, have sparked war crime allegations. Russia, struggling to excuse its huge losses, has claimed the first stage of the operation - reducing Ukraine’s fighting capacity - had “generally been accomplished”. Col-Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said Russian forces could now focus on “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas”. Donbas is the largely Russian-speaking eastern region where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Mariupol is located there, although outside of the two territories controlled by the separatists. Russian troops appear to have stalled their ground offensive aimed at capturing the capital, Kyiv, and are concentrating on gaining ground in Donbas in the country’s south-east. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, appearing by video-link at Qatar’s Doha Forum, slammed the destruction of Mariupol. He said: :”They are destroying our ports. The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.” In Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko says 90% of houses are damaged, 2,600 of them suffering direct hits from Grad howitzers or Buratino artillery strikes - of which 40% cannot be rebuilt. It means almost half of the city needs to be entirely rebuilt from scratch. Russian troops are now consolidating east, trying to move up from the south in areas like Mariupol and south from Kharkiv to encircle Donbas - where the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk are disputed. Experts have said Russian forces are trying to surround thousands of Ukrainian troops trying as President Vladimir Putin tries to capture the region in a desperate bid to make some capital from his disastrous invasion.",17,2.707982564885634,3.440689006808498,-0.7327064419228639,24

The soldier, named as 'Misha', was said by Ukraine to have signalled his surrender with a white flag and pleaded to join opposing fighters after his Russian army colleagues fled home and his military boss threatened to shoot him. Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs, Victor Andrusiv, posted on Facebook to say the soldier saw “no point in further fighting” and was terrified to return to his home country. A meeting was organised and he approached in his military vehicle before opening the door and surrendering to Ukrainian soldiers. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Mr Andrusiv said: “A few days ago Misha called us. ""We passed the information to the military intelligence. “They marked the place and he arrived. The drone checked that he was alone.” Mr Andrusiv claimed Misha will receive the cash reward at the end of the war. Meanwhile he has been given a TV, telephone, kitchen and shower, the minister added, and will be given the opportunity to apply for Ukrainian citizenship. Mr Andrusiv said Ukrainian forces regularly send text messages to Russian soldiers, offering them a way to surrender and hand over equipment, having identified the phones and Ukrainian telephone numbers they are using. In his Facebook post, he added that: ""It turned out that there was only one left from the tank crew, the rest escaped home. He didn't see the point of war."" He said Misha could not return home as his commaner was shooting deserters. ""Misha said that there was almost no food left, military management is chaotic and practically absent. Demoralization is colossal,"" he added. It is the latest embarrassment to Moscow amid widespread dismay at the targeting of Ukraine civilians. Earlier this month the Mirror told how one of Russia ’s helicopters was blasted out of the sky as hopes grew of the invasion of Ukraine faltering. Footage of the chopper being downed in a field by a surface-to-air missile emerged amid claims Vladimir Putin has lost around 10,000 men in just 10 day Ukrainians posted a clip online showing the chopper – believed to be an MI-24 Hind Gunship – being shot down in flames by their forces. It crashed to the ground before exploding in a fireball. A caption on the footage said: “Glory to Ukraine.” Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky defiantly declared his forces were killing up to 1,000 Russian soldiers a day. The death toll is a devastating blow for Russia, which has more than 900,000 active personnel. By comparison, the Soviet Union lost around 14,000 soldiers in Afghanistan in 10 years – and that conflict helped fuel the collapse of the communist state. Ukraine, which at the beginning of the month is thought to have lost around 3,000 troops, also claims hundreds of Russian tanks, armoured vehicles, helicopters and fighter aircraft have been destroyed. Sources said the Kremlin was “demoralised” by the losses and the additional 30,000 wounded. Those killed include Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, 47, who was shot by a sniper trained just days earlier by the SAS.",14,5.3031989691248125,5.006156469945198,0.29704249917961434,6
2022-03-26,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/signs-russias-losing-wage-ukraine-26561769,Seven signs Russia is losing will to wage Ukraine war after 'change of target',"In the face of crippling sanctions and heavy losses, Russia appears to have changed its objectives for the war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade their neighbour on February 24 and, it is thought, hoped to swiftly capture capital Kyiv. Volodymyr's Zelensky's government would be removed with a pro-Kremlin puppet government installed within days. However that has not happened. Ukraine resistance has surprised not only Putin but also western intelligence officials who thought the war could be brief. But the stiff resolve of Ukraine, and the support of NATO countries supplying them weapons and aid, has seen Russia suffer heavy casualties, including several generals. Vladimir Putin's hopes for a swift victory such as when his forces annexed Crimea have vanished and instead his army is bogged down in a land war with a well-supplied Ukraine. Efforts to shell cities such as Kyiv and Mariupol into submission have also failed. When Russian troops invaded, in what the Kremlin still calls a 'special military operation', the Kremlin sought to seize Kyiv, overthrow Volodymyr's Zelensky's government and install a puppet leader. Over a month on it seems their targets have changed. Top Russian general Sergey Rudskoy said on Friday the ""first stage"" of Russia's ""special military operation"" has been mostly accomplished and that Russian forces will now concentrate on ""the complete liberation of the Donbas"". Western officials say that Russia continues to experience setback after setback. They believe General Rudskoy's announcement implies that Moscow knows that its ambitious pre-war strategy has failed. ""Russia is recognising that it can't pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously,"" one official said. A Russian whistleblower reportedly claimed a leaked report called the invasion a “total failure” and that there are “ no options for a possible victory "". A so-called analyst in Russia's feared spy agency the FSB reportedly leaked the document which claims spies were kept in the dark over Putin's Ukraine plan. Russian human rights activist and operator of the anti-corruption website Gulagu.net Vladimir Osechkin published the report on Facebook, reported The Times. The report allegedly concluded: "" Russia has no way out. There are no options for a possible victory, only defeat.” Sergey Beseda, head of the Federal Security Branch, Russia's intelligence branch, was arrested along with his deputy, Anatoly Bolyukh, an expert claimed. Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled Russian human rights activist also confirmed the arrests. Mr Osechkin told The Times that while the arrests were made on accusations of embezzlement of funds, he said the “real reason is unreliable, incomplete and partially false information about the political situation in Ukraine”. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russia's national guard and a part of Putin's security council, admitted progress of the invasion had been slower than expected. He said: ""I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like,"" Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guard's website. ""But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us."" Zolotov has been at Putin's side since before the turn of the century and has spent the last 13 years in charge of his personal security. One of Vladimir Putin's brigade commanders was killed by his own troops, it has been reported. A furious Russian soldier drove over Russian Colonel Yuri Medvedev with a military tank on the frontline in protest, it has been claimed. Angered by heavy losses suffered by the unit, he is said to have taken his commander down in front of other horrified soldiers. Western officials confirmed the Russian general was killed ""as a consequence of the scale of losses that had been taken by his brigade"". They added: ""We believe that he was killed by his own troops deliberately. We believe that he was run over by his own troops."" The man who was behind the wheel of the tank “blamed the commander of the group, Col. Yury Medvedev, for the deaths of his friends.” Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev, was killed in a strike near the southern city of Kherson - the seventh general to die in the conflict. He had been commander of Russia's 49th combined army. It is thought that low morale among Russian troops has forced senior officers closer to the front line. A mayor in Slavutych occupied by Russian forces has been released from captivity and the soldiers have agreed to leave after a mass protest by residents. Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site, was taken by Russian forces but stun grenades and overhead fire failed to disperse unarmed protesters on its main square on Saturday. The crowd demanded the release of mayor Yuri Fomichev, who had been taken prisoner by the Russian troops. Attempts by Russian troops to intimidate the growing protest failed and on Saturday afternoon Fomichev was let go by his captors.",14,4.331934812734367,4.1433863349556415,0.18854847777872585,3
2022-03-26,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putins-troops-defensive-ukraine-26560763,Vladimir Putin's troops on defensive as Ukraine captures more than 100 tanks,"Ukraine’s counter-attacks has left Russia’s invasion reeling with at least 117 tanks belonging to Vladimir Putin ’s forces captured and reports that more than 500 could have been destroyed. With unconfirmed figures claiming that Ukraine has lost 74 tanks, its gains mean that it would now have more tanks than at the start of the invasion. Russia ’s advance has notably lost momentum in recent days with troops failing to press forward in many areas or topple key cities while at the same time Ukraine soldiers have won back some terrain. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine put Russian tank losses at 561 in a Facebook post on Friday. It also said 115 of Russia's warplanes have so far been destroyed in the conflict which has now entered its fifth week. Ukrainians have fought for every inch of ground and it has led to Russian forces resorting to pummelling cities with shells which is causing a high number of casualties. Forbes' aerospace and defence expert, David Axe, reported the Express, said: ""The Ukrainian army’s main tank, the T-64, no longer is in active use in the Russian army. But the Ukrainians also operate at least two models that the Russians still use too, the T-72 and the T-80. ""The T-80 actually is an evolution of the T-64, itself one of the most sophisticated tanks Soviet industry ever produced. ""The T-72, by contrast, is a simpler, cheaper tank - one suitable to mass-production and easy support in the field. It’s not for no reason that Ukraine generally assigns its T-72s to reserve formations."" Mr Axe added: ""In any event, there aren’t many captured Russian tanks Ukraine can’t use in some capacity. ""The question is how quickly Kyiv’s army can take stock of a vehicle its troops, or civilians, have seized, repair any damage, fuel it up, restock its ammo and assign it to a crew with the right training."" Moscow signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the East as Ukrainian forces went on the offensive to recapture towns outside the capital Kyiv. In an announcement that appeared to indicate more limited goals, the Russian Defence Ministry said a first phase of its operation was mostly complete and it would now focus on the eastern Donbass region, which has pro-Russia separatist enclaves. ""The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which ... makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbass,"" said Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate. Reframing Russia's goals may make it easier for Putin to claim a face-saving victory, military analysts said.",14,4.056270656086987,3.3303605753283607,0.7259100807586263,25

It comes as Ukrainian soldiers push back towards Kherson in a bid to retake the captured city. The Kremlin is suffering crippling losses in the conflict, with many of its top commanders now dead. Morale among the rank and file of Russia's army is also said to be low as Russian forces are pushed back. Putin has finally admitted that 1,351 soldiers have been killed in the invasion, with 3,825 wounded, although the real figure is likely far higher. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine claims that 16,400 Russian soldiers have been killed so far. It also said the Kremlin had lost a huge amount of equipment, including 575 tanks, 1,640 armoured vehicles, 117 planes, 127 helicopters and seven ships. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky echoed the claim that more than 16,000 Russian troops had been killed in the conflict during his night-time address. He said his soldiers had delivered 'powerful blows' to Moscow and called for Putin to negotiate, but warned he would not give up sovereign territory. Meanwhile, NATO also estimates that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the invasion. Ukraine is now said to be on the brink of recapturing Kherson in the country's east - the first major city to fall to the Russians. An adviser to the Ukrainian ministry of defence, Markian Lubkivskyi, predicted troops could take the city back on Saturday. Mr Lubkivskyi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I believe that today the city will be fully under the control of Ukrainian armed forces. ""We have finished in the last two days the operation in the Kyiv region so other armed forces are now focused on the southern part trying to get free Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities."" Facing unexpectedly fierce resistance, the Russian defence ministry said that having accomplished the ""first phase"" of military operations, its forces would concentrate on the Donbas region part-held by Moscow-backed separatist rebels. Western officials said the Russian statement was a recognition its forces were overstretched and may have to ""pause"" operations around Kyiv and other cities while they focus on the east of the country.

2022-03-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-counter-attack-forces-back-26552597,Ukraine counter-attack forces back over-stretched Russian troops near Kyiv,"Ukrainian troops launched a series of counter-attacks which forced back over-stretched and under-supplied Russian troops, just outside the capital of Kyiv. The Ministry of Defence announced the successful manoeuvres in an intelligence update this morning. Kyiv’s troops had managed to not only push back the Russian invaders, but reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 21 miles east of the city that has long been Russia ’s main target. Since the invasion began over a month ago, it was reported that the Kremlin initially thought they could achieve a ‘lightning invasion’ that would see them sweep the city, and Ukrainian capital, in a matter of days. However, instead of deposing Volodymyr Zelensky ’s government, Moscow now finds itself negotiating with it. In the latest intelligence update, posted on Twitter, the MoD highlighted specific Russian failings - a common theme of this invasion. The Russian troops had overextended their supply lines it said, which left it vulnerable. This has reportedly been an issue previously as Russia expected fighting to last days, and was unprepared for the prolonged conflict it now finds itself in. From here, the MoD said it was likely that Ukraine ’s troops would continue to push onwards, including towards the strategically significant Hosomel Airfield - where there was fierce fighting at the beginning of the invasion. The MoD said: ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometres (21 miles) east of Kyiv. ""Ukrainian forces are likely to continue to attempt to push Russian forces back along the north-western axis from Kyiv towards Hostomel Airfield.” However, in the south of the country, Mykolaiv is still under heavy Russian siege and Moscow’s troops continue their efforts to surround the city. The MoD added: ""In the south of Ukraine, Russian forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance."" This all comes as fighting continues into its second month, after the invasion began on February 24. Despite many thinking Kyiv and their troops would fall in days, fierce Ukrainian resistance has prolonged the war. Only last night, Kyiv counter-attacks saw success targeting a landing ship and ammunition depots in the southern city of Berdyansk. This was a part of a reported shift in tactics from Ukraine to target Russian supply chains and leave their frontline troops under-resourced. As fighting continues there have been reports emerging of cracks appearing between Russian president Vladimir Putin and other top Kremlin officials. His once close ally and defence minister Sergei Shoigu has not been seen in public in two weeks. Close allies reportedly told one investigative news outlet Agentstvo that he had heart problems, and the Kremlin said yesterday he simply had a lot on his plate. On top of that, one of Putin’s other allies, Anatoly Chubais, who gave him his first job in the Kremlin, quit his job and fled Russia in opposition to the war.",14,2.993230900477089,5.332350814189758,-2.3391199137126693,1

The Drama Theatre of Mariupol, where hundreds including children had been sheltering, was hit by the deadly airstrike last Wednesday. It's believed some Ukrainians are still trapped under the rubble of the bombed theatre in Mariupol, in the south-east of the country. The city council of Mariupol confirmed on Friday morning that the death toll is believed to be at least 300. ""The drama theatre was cynically destroyed by the heralds of the 'Russian world',"" a statement said. ""These fascists of the 21st century were not stopped by either the huge inscription 'children', or the statements of the people themselves that there were only peaceful people - women, children, the elderly. ""The occupier knew where he was hitting. He knew what could be consequences and all the same, the bombs fell on the place that became a refuge for hundreds of Mariupol residents. There cannot be and never will be an explanation for this inhuman cruelty."" Serhiy Taruta, a Ukrainian politician, previously confirmed that those under the rubble cannot be evacuated because the rescue services in the city had been decimated by Russian forces. In a Facebook post he wrote: ""No one understands. Services that are supposed to help are demolished, rescue and utility services... are physically destroyed. ""A lot of doctors have been killed. This means that all the survivors of the bombing will either die under the ruins of the theater, or have already died."" Svitlana Zlenko, who fled Mariupol with her son a day before the theatre was bombed, described the city as ""hell"". She described how she was forced to melt snow to get water to cook pasta and they lived in constant fear of Russian air raids. The mum spent some of her last days in the city sheltering in a school, and described the moment a woman was wounded during a bombing, when shrapnel hit her hip. She said: ""She was lying on the first floor of the high school all night and prayed for poison so that she would not feel pain.

Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev, 48, was killed in a strike by the Ukrainian armed forces, they say. He was Commander of the 49th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District. The Russian side has not so far confirmed the death. A service member said Lt. Gen. Yakov Rezantsev told them on the fourth day of their deployment that the war would be over quickly. The soldier said: “Do you know what he told us? ‘It’s no secret to anyone that there are only a few hours until this special operation is over.’ - And now those hours are still going."" As the Kremlin reportedly fumes at the loss of some of its top generals, experts have said there could be a catalogue of reasons why senior Russian officers have fallen. It comes amid reports of unreliable equipment and electronics amongst Russian forces, as well as subordinates being too terrified to make quick decisions. Former US army general and CIA director David Petraeus said Ukraine also has ""good snipers"" which are able to target key individuals when a Russian chain of command breaks down. He said: ""The communications have been jammed. The column gets stopped, and an impatient general goes forward to see what’s going on. ""There’s no initiative, no non-commissioned officer corps, no sense of initiative at junior levels. They wait to be told what to do, and the Ukrainians have very, very good snipers."" An anonymous diplomat also told Foreign Policy that generals were ""struggling on the front line to get their orders through"". Analysts believe Russian commanders are now suffering a higher casualty rate than in any conflict since World War Two. We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures and video on this breaking news story. The first general's death came only four days into the invasion, and in the just over three weeks since, a significant number of Russian military leaders have been killed in battle. Some of the dead Russian commanders were said to have come to the frontline, something they would normally do if there were issues over decision-making, or their seniority was needed to get the troops forward. Western sources said that a lot of generals are being killed because they are being pushed closer to the front line than usual to boost Russian soldiers' morale According to Foreign Policy magazine, Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said: “It’s a bigger problem if you lose commanders of units because then it’s harder to have someone step in and take over."" It comes after Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin are reportedly sending execution squads after their own army with orders to kill any Russians who try to flee. Ukraine security services claim that prisoners of war have told them of the horrific tactic that has reportedly seen Russian guns aimed at their own. The ‘execution squads’ are a revival of Stalin’s World War Two tactics and are another sign of dire morale among Moscow’s troops, The Mail Online reports. There have also been reports of Chechen units being sent in to try and stop Russian deserters. Since the Russian invasion began on February 24, Kyiv has released videos of Russian captives who were saying on camera how they chose to quit rather than keep fighting. Ukraine has sought to take advantage of poor Russian morale throughout the invasion and is waging a propaganda war of its own to promote success stories.",14,5.522270158284931,5.223190649061243,0.299079509223688,6

Kateryna Diachenko, 11, was inside the residential house in Mariupol, in the south-east of the country, when it was struck by a deadly airstrike, her coach, Anastasia Meshchanenkova, said. The young girl was a rhythmic gymnast, the sport in which Vladimir Putin ’s supposed partner Alina Kabaeva won an Olympic gold medal and countless other honours. “She was supposed to conquer the world, but died buried in rubble,"" Kateryna's coach said. “Can there be any justification of that? Look at this talented girl. She was supposed to give her smiles to the world. “What are children guilty of? I believe that there is a space in hell for everyone who is involved - and as soon as possible.” She added: “I cannot speak, maybe when I come back to my senses.” Kateryna’s mother Marina Diachenko has not spoken about her loss, while reports say her son Artyom, Kateryna’s younger brother, is a talented kickboxer. Kabaeva - who plays a major role training young gymnasts in Russia - has not commented on Kateryna's death even though condolences have come in from around the world. Bulgarian gymnast Iliana Raeva said: “I can’t believe we live in such a cruel world."" The Swiss federation said she was ""one of many victims of a senseless war”. In her only comment on the war, Kabaeva castigated the refusal to allow the Russian team to compete at the Beijing Paralympics. “There has never been a more shameful page in the history of world sports,” she said. A petition has been started to demand she is thrown out of Switzerland where reports suggested she was hiding during the war with children she supposedly shares with Putin. “It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says the incendiary petition.

The Drama Theatre of Mariupol, where hundreds including children had been sheltering, was hit by the deadly airstrike last Wednesday, killing what is believed to be at least 300 people. ""From witnesses comes information that about 300 people died in the Mariupol Drama Theatre as a result of the bombing by a Russian plane,"" Mariupol city council said in a statement on Friday. ""Up until the very last moment, one does not want to believe this horror. But the words of those who were inside the building at the time of this terrorist act says the opposite."" Now, dramatic video shows injured civilians covered in dust making their way out of the damaged building after it was bombed. Some can be seen walking down stairs, while others are heard comforting those around them. Rubble is strewn over the floor in a part of the building which is still standing, while the video then pans to a large section of debris just metres away. Russian forces bombed the theatre last week despite a large inscription saying ""children"" being clearly visible on the pavement outside. Local officials, citing witness accounts, said on Friday that as many as 300 people may have been killed in the theatre bombing. The city council made clear it was still not possible to determine the exact death toll after the incident. The Ukrainian government has previously said that it was impossible to tell how many were killed because Mariupol is in chaos and under almost constant bombardment from besieging Russian forces. Russia has denied bombing the theatre. The Kremlin says Russian forces have not targeted civilians after invading Ukraine on Feb. 24. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the rubble and that the theatre basement, where local officials said many people were sheltering at the time of the bombardment, had withstood the attack. Ukraine officials believe more than 2,300 people have died in the Mariupol siege and those remaining are starving and suffering a lack of water. And there is increasing alarm over the fate of those locals who manage to escape the hell of Mariupol. The city council revealed Russian troops are kidnapping civilians, possibly as many as 5,000 so far, and processing them into Russia, confiscating their passports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the siege on Mariupol was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". Professor Mark Galeotti, principal director of Mayak Intelligence, said Mariupol has been ""comprehensively trashed"" by the bombardment, but civilian casualties will continue to rise in coming days. ""In the grand scheme of things the Russians aren't in a position to escalate, but the point is that they've chosen Mariupol as a key target,"" he said. ""Mariupol has become a symbolic site of resistance and one way or another they will make sure that they take it."" He continued: ""For Putin every extra city he can take is an extra bargaining chip."" He said that with the city completely cut off, every Ukrainian troop killed would be one less enemy to fight, as reinforcements are unable to reach Mariupol.",17,4.638122988958411,4.166058366791065,0.47206462216734657,26

The country's defence ministry said on Friday it has ""liberated"" 93 per cent of the territory of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, and 54 per cent of the Donetsk region - the two areas that jointly make up the Donbass. Sergey Rudskoy, head of the main operational department of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, did not rule out storming Ukrainian cities that had been blockaded in a statement on Friday. He added that Russia would react immediately to any attempt to close the airspace over Ukraine - something Kyiv has asked NATO to do, but NATO has resisted. The defence ministry said on Friday that the operation would continue until Russian forces had completed the tasks that had been set, without elaborating. On Friday, the Russian army updated its losses in Ukraine to 1,351 soldiers, while saying that it had evacuated more than 400,000 civilians. Since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, thousands have died in shelling and missile attacks, while millions more have fled the country. Last week, a theatre in Mariupol, where hundreds including children had been sheltering, was hit by a deadly airstrike, killing what is believed to be at least 300 people. Despite the bombardment, the Ministry of Defence said on Friday morning that Ukrainian forces are driving back the Russians from around Kyiv. The latest assessment said the Ukrainians were expected to continue to try to push the Russians away from the capital. ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometres (22 miles) east of Kyiv,"" it said. In the south of the country, it said the Russian advance on the key Black Sea port city of Odesa was being slowed by ""logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance"". Since the invasion began over a month ago, it was reported that the Kremlin initially thought they could achieve a ‘lightning invasion’ that would see them sweep the city, and Ukrainian capital, in a matter of days. However, instead of deposing Volodymyr Zelensky’s government, Moscow now finds itself negotiating with it. In the latest intelligence update, posted on Twitter, the MoD highlighted specific Russian failings - a common theme of this invasion. The Russian troops had overextended their supply lines it said, which left it vulnerable. This has reportedly been an issue previously as Russia expected fighting to last days, and was unprepared for the prolonged conflict it now finds itself in. From here, the MoD said it was likely that Ukraine ’s troops would continue to push onwards, including towards the strategically significant Hosomel Airfield - where there was fierce fighting at the beginning of the invasion. The MoD said: ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometres (21 miles) east of Kyiv. ""Ukrainian forces are likely to continue to attempt to push Russian forces back along the north-western axis from Kyiv towards Hostomel Airfield.” However, in the south of the country, Mykolaiv is still under heavy Russian siege and Moscow’s troops continue their efforts to surround the city. The MoD added: ""In the south of Ukraine, Russian forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance."" Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24 in what it called a ""special operation"" to weaken its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance to the invasion and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces. Only last night, Kyiv counter-attacks saw success targeting a landing ship and ammunition depots in the southern city of Berdyansk. This was a part of a reported shift in tactics from Ukraine to target Russian supply chains and leave their frontline troops under-resourced. Speaking in Russia on Friday, Vladimir Putin said the West has already cancelled JK Rowling and is trying to cancel Russia. The Russian president cited the Harry Potter author as an example of what happens in the West, adding that it likes to cancel people and compared that with cancelling Russia. Putin said Ms Rowling was cancelled ""just because she didn’t satisfy the demands of gender rights"". He said: ""They are now trying to cancel our country. I'm talking about the progressive discrimination of everything to do with Russia."" On Friday, the Russian army confirmed 1,351 soldiers had died in conflict in Ukraine, while 3,825 soldiers had been wounded. A senior defence ministry official, Mikhail Mizintsev, said more than 400,000 civilians had been evacuated to Russia from the separatist eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions, as well as the rest of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that Ukraine had lost 14,000 troops while 16,000 were wounded.",14,4.789006603239965,4.402011379971258,0.3869952232687073,1

Vlad, 22, and his brother-in-arms Mark, also 22, are two of the troops stationed in Kharkiv in the north of the country. As Ukraine's second city, and a settlement which lies close to the Russian border, Kharkiv was always likely to be firmly in the sights of the Russian forces. The night before columns of tanks and artillery batteries rolled over the Ukrainian border Vlad and Mark were at a fellow soldiers wedding. When they heard the news that the war had began - something which shocked them despite the weeks of build-up - they were rushed straight to the front lines in Kharkiv.

Since the war began a month ago today there has rarely been a break from the near constant bombardment of Russian artillery, the BBC reports. Much of the city has been completely flattened in the shelling and once pretty suburbs have been reduced to muddy fields. Half the city's 1.4million person population has fled since the Russians arrived, and now bodies lay uncollected on the battlefront. According to Vlad and Mark the invading forces did not appear prepared for a long winter war. They have found the bodies of Russian soldiers wearing light clothing in possession of surprisingly small amounts of rations. So far only one group of Russian soldiers have managed to breach the city, it has been reported, only for the Ukrainian forces to repel them after a long, bloody skirmish. Vlad, a professional soldier, has urged his opponents to leave Ukraine and return to their homes. ""Run. Run away. Either you stay here in the ground or you go back home,"" he told the BBC. ""Don't kill kids, destroy homes and families."" Mark added: ""Go back home while you are still alive."" Earlier this week Ukraine's minister for internal affairs, Denys Monastyrsky, said that Russians were doing just that. On Tuesday, Ukraine's armed forces claimed that 300 Russian troops ""refused to comply with orders to carry out combat"" and left an area of intense fighting in the Sumy region. The Centre for Defence Strategies, a leading Ukrainian think-tank said: ""Russian forces are aware of the hopelessness of their situation and increasingly choosing desertion to avoid death."" Mr Monastyrsky said that Russian soldiers were defecting with military equipment and tanks, after realising they were being used as ""cannon fodder"".",14,4.56368062002229,3.466742043027517,1.096938576994773,6

Before Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, while Vladimir Putin ’s troops gathered on the border, Kharkiv was seen as one of the cities most at threat and it has withstood horrific bombings and slaughter. The resistance of the city has typified the response from Ukrainians since Russia’s invasion on February 24 and residents have refused to surrender. Nina was photographed with her face covered in cuts and scarring from an attack with a tweet saying that she wanted people around the world to know what was happening in the city. The tweet, shared by President of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine, Arthur Kharytonov, read: ""This is Nina. She is a professional pharmacist from Kharkiv. ""Before the Russian bombing attack she served in the '9.11' drugstore. Nina agreed to show the face after the meeting with simple Russians. ""To make the world know the truth. She will need a very long treatment."" Russia calls the war a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from ""Nazis"". Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said hundreds of buildings, many residential, had been destroyed. ""It is impossible to say that the worst days are behind us, we are constantly being bombed,"" he said. A witness in the city said she saw people on the roofs of apartment buildings dropping grenades or similar ordnance onto the streets as the resistance continues. A second witness, outside the city, reported hearing more intense explosions than on any day since Russian troops began attacking last month. Putin says his ""special operation"" is aimed at destroying Ukraine's military capabilities and capturing what Russia regards as dangerous nationalists there. The invasion has killed thousands and driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes. Russian bombs have hit residential areas, schools and hospitals in Kharkiv and other cities. ""Putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said as London unveiled restrictions on Gazprombank and Alfa Bank. ""The harder our sanctions ... the more we can do to help Ukraine."" Canada and Australia also stepped up sanctions on Russia on Thursday as the war entered its second month. But the EU lacked the unanimous support needed to impose more punitive measures, and was struggling to implement those already agreed.",17,3.5914618209199474,3.461855644243328,0.12960617667661944,17

In the days after the Russians first invaded the country a column of armoured vehicles and troops moved from the northern border down towards the capital, in an attempt to encircle it. On the way they began bombarding the town of Makariv, which sits about 50kilometres (31miles) west of Kyiv. As with much of the invading forces' actions, the attack was broad reaching and brutal, with one shell attack killing 13 people at a bakery, according to Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian resistance remained strong however, responding with fierce attacks of their own and even derision over tactical radio channels. The New York Times investigators partnered with ham radio enthusiasts to intercept some of the radio chatter between the Russian forces. In one instance a Russian military member asked for clarification over the radio, urging the recipient to ""respond more clearly"". All that came in response was a jaunty whistled tune, the apparent work of a radio jammer hopping onto the channel. Another told the Russian, whose codename is Buran, to get out of the country. ""Buran, go home,"" they said. ""It's better to be a deserter than fertiliser."" In the month since the Russians invaded amateur radio enthusiasts have been picking up messages sent on unsecured channels. Military experts have suggested that the invading forces' inability to properly encrypt their signals suggests a lack of organisation on their part. As well as providing a medium for mockery, in keeping their radio channels open the Russians have given away important pieces of strategic information. “Decision has been made to withdraw all Russian units from the residential area, artillery will target the area,"" one soldier warned during the invasion of Makariv, The Times reports. In Luhansk Oblast at the beginning of the war a Ukrainian soldier on the front lines intercepted one message saying: ""Our fighter planes start bombing in ten minutes. You understood me?"" In Makariv, the loosely guarded nature of the Russian radio channels didn't appear to have too much of a negative impact on their invasion efforts as the town soon fell. However, this week the Russian forces were driven out of the town and many of the outlying areas, away from the main route into Kyiv. Their failure to take Makariv is a telling blow to the Kremlin’s plan to encircle and capture the Ukrainian capital and enforce regime change.",14,3.7496650773269344,3.3154482861667365,0.43421679116019796,21

The announcement was made as Russian state TV made nuclear war threats amid more warnings about Moscow preparing for a possible chemical attack. There are 100,000 people still trapped in Mariupol, which is 90% destroyed after being pulverised by air and artillery strikes, and is now surrounded by Russian forces. The council added there had been “more and more deaths from starvation” in the city, cut off from water and electricity for weeks. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine?

Ukraine said yesterday Russia ’s troop losses by day 30 of the war had reached around 16,000. A Western official said 20 of the 115 to 120 battalions Russia started with were no longer “combat effective”. Moscow is believed to have lost 115 warplanes, 125 helicopters, 561 tanks and five warships. One Russian colonel was deliberately mown down and killed by one of his own tanks as “a consequence of the losses taken by his brigade”, Western officials said yesterday. Yuri Medvechek led the Russian 37th Motor Rifle Brigade. And Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev, 48, comm-ander of the 49th combined arms division, became the fifth Russian general killed – from Ukrainian shelling. Multiple sources working with Ukraine’s InformNapalm intelligence organisation warned Russia could launch a sarin gas chemical attack. Pro-Kremlin Channel 1 TV host Vyacheslav Nikonov claimed Russians on the Ukraine-Poland border had seen a build-up of US and Polish troops, for a peacekeeping mission. Military commentator Colonel Yury Knutov warned that would be a declaration of war, adding: “To win we will have to use tactical nuclear weapons.” In Kharkiv, in the north east, six people were killed and 17 were injured in an overnight airstrike. Another six died and 15 were hurt in a rocket attack on an aid queue on Thursday.

Since then, thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed, millions of refugees have fled over the border and once-thriving cities have been razed to the ground by indiscriminate shelling. However, if it was a quick win Vladimir Putin wanted - and it's widely believed the Russian president did not expect the Ukrainian forces to put up such a formidable fight - then the tyrant will have been bitterly disappointed.

Thick plumes of black smoke were pictured billowing into the air by shocked locals who shared the images on social media. They showed a Russian ship, the alligator-class Orsk, ablaze with flames visible on the deck of the vessel. Some nearby have suggested another vessel has sank, although it has not been confirmed. The shocking pictures were taken in occupied Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov. Its port, 50 miles from besieged Mariupol, is being used by Moscow to resupply its troops nearby with armour, food and weaponry. As the ship burned several suggested they heard explosions nearby, while others believe it was the sound of thousands of rounds of ammunition burning. Ukraine' security service said of the incident: ""At 7 am The Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed a large landing ship Orsk of the occupying army near the seaport of Berdyansk. Two more ships were damaged. ""Also, a 3,000-ton fuel tank was destroyed. The fire spread to the enemy's ammunition depot. Details of the damage inflicted on the occupier are being clarified."" The Ukrainian Navy wrote on Facebook in a brief post: ""A large paratrooper ship Orsk of the black sea fleet of occupiers was destroyed in the occupied Russian port Berdyansk. ""Glory to Ukraine!"" Accompanying the post was a video of the heavily damaged ship burning in the port. A small explosion is clearly seen. It is unknown if there were any casualties or what caused the blaze. Commenting on the post, one person wrote: ""They even cheered me up with their message. ""Glory to our armed forces, glory to our volunteers and glory to our Ukrainians who did not flee from Ukraine, and who supports our state and our army with what they can.

Earlier this week the Kremlin admitted around 10,000 of its armed forces have so far been killed in the war. The MoD’s latest update agrees in grim reading for tyrant Vladimir Putin who is set to replace his soldiers killed on the frontline with people with little or no experience in warfare. The MoD said: “Russian forces have almost certainly suffered thousands of casualties during their invasion of Ukraine. “ Russia is likely now looking to mobilise its reservist and conscript manpower, as well as private military companies and foreign mercenaries, to replace these considerable losses. “It is unclear how these groups will integrate into the Russian ground forces in Ukraine and the impact this will have on combat effectiveness.” The update comes a month after Russia launched its brutal and cruel invasion of its neighbour. Putin's invasion has faced fierce resistance, with Russian officials reportedly recording the deaths of 10,000 Kremlin troops in Ukraine. The shocking figure was published by a pro-Kremlin newspaper, citing Russian defence ministry officials. However, the statistic was quickly taken down from the website. World leaders including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US Joe Biden are set to take part in an emergency Nato summit today in Brussels to discuss the latest on the invasion. The PM will use the visit to set out details of a new support package for Ukrainian forces, including 6,000 anti-tank and high explosive missiles. On Wednesday night Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky called on Nato to provide “effective and unrestricted” support. He said: ""We will see who is a friend, who is a partner and who has sold out and betrayed us. “Together we should not allow Russia to break anyone in Nato, the EU or G7, to break them and drag them to the side of war. “We ask that the alliance declare that it will fully assist Ukraine to win this war, clear our territory of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine.” He also called for people to take to the streets in demonstrations against the war worldwide. He added: ""Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities. “Come in the name of peace. Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life. ""Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard. Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters.

2022-03-24,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-mayor-says-cemetery-cant-26545490,Ukraine mayor says cemetery can't handle the dead as city in 'complete carnage',"A Ukrainian mayor has warned that his cemeteries can no longer handle the dead as the city is left “in complete carnage” from the Russian invasion. Vladyslav Atroshenko, mayor of Chernihiv, said that the city’s cemeteries were overflowing with its dead in a new video. In the video Atroshenko filmed he says that they have refrigerator trucks full of dead bodies and that they’ve been forced to dig up old cemeteries to bury the newly dead. As he talks, he drives through the ruins of the northern Ukrainian city and he offers a horrifying insight into the reality of so many still stuck in Ukraine. CNN verified the video which was originally posted on Telegram. The mayor said: ""The city cemetery cannot handle all the dead, so we are keeping people in morgues and refrigerators longer than normal. “We are burying people in the old cemeteries that haven't been used in a while.” On top of that he shows the burning buildings and ruin and debris that was once his city. He was driving on Shevchenka street, located in the east of the city, as he shows ruined billboards and homes with their roofs blown off or walls caved in. He added: ""There was a direct strike here. There is a tractor over there burning. We are located right now in the zone of combat."" ""Look at these neighbourhoods. They are completely destroyed. You can clearly see that complete carnage has been unleashed here.” The continued bombings of Ukrainian cities is seen by many as a change in tactics after the invasion failed to take the country’s urban centres. Instead of conquering them, Moscow seems intent some have argued on following a Grozny-style bombings that infamously levelled the Chenynan capital. The Kremlin only turned to this after its failure to achieve a ‘lightning invasion’ where it reportedly sought to take Ukraine and Kyiv in a few days. However, instead of deposing the government, Russia now finds itself negotiating with it. On CNN the analyst said that Russia resorted to this “mediaeval siege method of just pounding towns” because after suffering such heavy losses its army is struggling to operate. This came after NATO estimated as many as 15,000 Russian troops were already dead, but others have argued as many as 30-40,000 could be dead, injured, or missing in action. That is a significant chunk of the estimated 150,000 Russian troops who were initially stationed on the border. It is also more dead in one month than Russia suffered in over a decade of fighting in Afghanistan. As Russia’s invasion stutters and struggles, one of its architects, Sergei Shoigu, has not been seen in public in nearly two weeks.

Other aspects are far harder to get a clear grip on - Is Russia changing tactics, being beaten back or both? These questions are made harder by the relentless information war being waged on both sides - conflicting narratives designed to aid their own causes. While the Russian advance has no doubt slowed, what this means for the huge military's next steps and the innocent people it is invading remain largely unclear. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned that Vladimir Putin may be intending to use peace talks pushed for by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky as an opportunity to regroup his forces. She said she was ""very sceptical"" about the Kremlin's position, telling the Times: “If a country is serious about negotiations, it doesn’t indiscriminately bomb civilians that day.” She said the talks could be a ""smokescreen"" warning that “what we’ve seen is an attempt to create space for the Russians to regroup”. Reports claim the Russian military’s strategy has changed, no longer focused on taking certain cities with troops on the ground but instead dropping back and raining artillery shells down on the civilians. Heavy bombardments of densely populated areas is now a primary tactic, similar to those used in Russia’s wars in Chechnya and Syria. In a tweet, the UK Ministry of Defence said that Russia has ""been forced to change its operational approach and is now pursuing a strategy of attrition"", and turning to ""indiscriminate firepower"" as a tactic. Statements about any kind of Russian pullback being intentional has been heavily disputed by Ukraine, however. Ukraine insists Moscow has lost its ‘offensive potential’ after its own armed forces pushed Russia out of Makariv, a tactically significant suburb of Kyiv 37 miles to the west of the capital, “thanks to the heroic actions of our defenders”. UK intelligence appears to corroborate this, with the latest report saying Russian forces remain “largely stalled in place”. Meanwhile, in the south of the country, Russian forces are still unable to take the port city of Mariupol despite Ukrainian fighters and citizens being under heavy siege and surrounded on all sides. On Tuesday March 22, the Ministry of Defence tweeted: “Despite heavy fighting, Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy the southern city of Mariupol. “Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine have endured yet another day of limited progress with most forces largely stalled in place. “Several Ukrainian cities continue to suffer heavy Russian air and artillery bombardment with the UN reporting that more than 10 million Ukrainians are now internally displaced as a result of Russia’s invasion.” On March 22, Ukraine claimed Russian forces had just three days of supplies left after supply chain breakdowns - a claim hard to verify given that Ukraine too is thought to be running low military equipment, with its own supply line reliant on allies. Western sources have said that the supply chain claims are ‘plausible’, but hard to nail down as fact. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist with the Rusi thinktank, told the Guardian : “Resupply issues are hard to gauge, as both sides are keeping that information close to their chest due to operational security concerns.”",14,4.064358416388122,5.487762425989736,-1.4234040096016143,29

Boris Romanchenko, who had survived four of Adolf Hitler’s worst concentration camps, died when his Kharkiv apartment block was hit by missiles last week. In a city savaged by Vladimir Putin ’s war machine, Mr Romanchenko's funeral was held on Thursday, with family members including his son and daughter paying their final respects. In emotional pictures taken at the service, heartbroken relatives were seen crying while leaning on Mr Romanchenko’s casket and cross. Mr Romanchenko had campaigned tirelessly for a better world in his city Kharkiv after surviving inside the notorious death camps of Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, Peenemünde, and Mittelbau-Dora during the Second World War. He was widely respected and his heroic concentration camp survival story was known across Europe and America. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said of Mr Romanchenko’s death on Monday: ""Please think about how many things he has come through. ""But he was killed by a Russian strike which hit an ordinary Kharkiv multi-storey building. With each day of this war, it becomes more obvious what denazification means to them."" The memorial for the Buchenwald said in a statement: ""The horrific death of Boris Romanchenko shows how threatening the war in Ukraine is for the concentration camp survivors. ""We mourn the loss of a close friend.""

Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev has been dubbed the ""butcher of Mariupol"" as he's the suspected mastermind behind the relentless bombing of the city. Mariupol was home to 400,000 people before the war broke out on February 24 and now up to 90 per cent of the city has been destroyed or damaged, according to Ukrainian authorities. Col Mizintsev is officially known as the director of the Russian National Centre for Defence Management and has been accused of being behind the bombing of maternity hospital as well as the shelling of an art school that was being used as a bomb shelter for residents. Sergey Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa military administration, accused the bloodthirsty colonel of ordering several devastating strikes in Mariupol, which has led to hundreds of civilian deaths. Bratchuk wrote: ""He ordered the bombing of a maternity hospital, children's hospital, drama theatre, and civilian homes. All who lay down their arms are guaranteed safe passage out of Mariupol."" The Ukrainian government has claimed that attempts to establish humanitarian corridors out of the city have been disrupted by attacks from Russia's military.

In a translation tweeted out by Scherba, it should Col Mizintsev calling a soldier who was not wearing his uniform the ""scum of the highest order"". He is recorded saying: ""Why is his face not mutilated yet? Why hasn't anyone cut off his ears? Why isn't this moron limping yet? ""At night, when he walks out, unknown assailants jump him. Just jump him over and over, beating him in the face with a bottle and then pouring another litre into it."" Col Mizintsev is said to have orchestrated Russia's involvement in the Syrian Civil War between 2015 and 2016. Russian forces carried out a series of airstrikes, including the sieging of Aleppo, which left 1,640 civilians dead. It is likely the high-ranking officer played a key role in the shelling of Aleppo. It was widely reported at the time that Russian troops used cluster munitions and barrel bombs in built-up urban areas in Syria to inflict maximum casualties on civilians. Government forces also reportedly dropped chlorine in Aleppo in a series of devastating gas attacks. In April 2018, a chemical attack was carried out in the Syrian city of Douma, killing almost 50 people and injuring well over 100. Mariupol is in southeastern Ukraine between the annexed territory of Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region. Mariupol's location as a port city on the Black Sea is also important to the Ukrainian economy as an industrial powerhouse.

Russian leader Vladimir Putin launched his unjust invasion on February 24 and his troops have relentlessly shelled once-thriving cities in Ukraine, leaving a trail of destruction behind. Heartbreaking images from Mariupol, Kharkiv and Kyiv show bombed-out schools, hospitals and government buildings - which once served as important sites for the town's community. Putin's forces have been met with fierce Ukrainian resistance and they are refusing to surrender amid reports of low morale among Russian soldiers and increasing frustration at the pace of the war from the Kremlin boss.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It comes as Russian state TV has issued a chilling nuclear threat to the west if NATO puts peacekeepers into Ukraine, saying World War Three might be around the corner. Moscow's tightly-controlled state TV went into propaganda overdrive, warning alliance leaders meeting in Brussels today against deploying any troops into Ukraine, even if they were there to maintain peace. These chilling threats come four weeks into Russia's invasion, as Putin's forces continue to bombard countless Ukrainian cities with air raids, but Kyiv's resistance holds fast. Moscow continues to cover up the extent of its losses in the war, as it has not updated its official death toll in weeks. The ratcheting up of rhetoric saw blunt, undisguised warnings from the Kremlin's mouthpieces on state TV, worrying that Poland would seek a NATO mandate for peacekeepers. They also went on to claim Poland would seek a land grab, to snatch back Ukrainian territory that was once part of Poland, such as the city of Lviv. At the start of the invasion, Russian troops entered Kharkiv, which is about 12 miles south of the border from Russia. People's homes were destroyed by Russian bombs - including that of a Holocaust survivor. In Mariupol, residents have refused to surrender and continue to face shelling, causing a humanitarian crisis as people run out of water and supplies. Mariupol has seen some of the war's most horrifying scenes, including the bombing of an art school housing hundreds of refugees. The word 'children' had been written in Russian on the outside. The advance of Russian troops has been met with not just fierce resistance by Ukrainian soldiers, but the protests and condemnation of Ukrainian cities. According to reports, Putin has threatened the residents of Mariupol with ' military tribunals ' after the rejected surrender. Earlier this month, three people were killed in the Mariupol maternity hospital bombing by Russian forces, including a six-year-old child, as women gave birth in what has been described as the ""ultimate genocide"". Russian forces have been attempting to take over Kyiv and have been slowly advancing towards the centre. On Sunday night, Retroville shopping mall, in the capital's Podilskyi district, was hit. Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said at least eight people had been killed in the strike, the Kyiv Independent reports. The bodies of six people have been laid in front of the destroyed building, according to news agency AFP. It comes as the Russian advance on Kyiv falters, with forces stalling northeast of the city. The Kremlin attack from the direction of Hostomel - to the northwest - has been pushed back.

The terrifying machine, one of thousands to have rolled into the war-torn nation since the outbreak of war a month ago today, was reduced to rubble in the attack. Drone footage showed the moment the tank was hit causing a massive fireball reaching into the sky in the Ukrainian ambush. Debris was hurled across the road towards nearby agricultural buildings. The wreck is now one of thousands of charred remains of tanks littering the roads of Ukraine as its forces take the fight to Putin’s invading army. Around 3,000 of the war machines are believed to have been destroyed during the war so far. The human toll has reached 10,000 according to a pro-Kremlin TV show who accidentally published the figure before swiftly taking it down. Nato’s numbers are even higher, estimating between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian deaths during the four weeks of war. A senior official said the number was based on information from Ukrainian authorities, Moscow and intelligence. Around 30,000 - 40,000 Russian soldiers are said to have been injured. Officially Moscow has admitted around 500 of its soldiers have been killed, including several high-ranking generals moved to the frontlines. It comes ahead of an emergency summit meeting in Brussels today in which Boris Johnson is expected to urge western allies to help ""keep the flame of freedom alive"" in Ukraine. The PM pledged the UK will supply thousands more missiles to the military in Kyiv. He will use the visit to set out details of a new support package for Ukrainian forces, including 6,000 more missiles comprising anti-tank and high-explosive weaponry. It takes the number of munitions, including next-generation light anti-tank weapons systems (Nlaws) and Javelin missiles, provided by the UK to the war effort to around 10,000. As well as sending more missiles, the UK is providing £25 million from the Foreign Office's conflict security and stabilisation fund to help pay the salaries of Ukrainian soldiers and pilots. It is also supplying and training Ukrainian troops in the use of Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles as well as providing body armour, helmets and combat boots. The Ministry of Defence ’s latest update reads: “Russian forces have almost certainly suffered thousands of casualties during their invasion of Ukraine. “ Russia is likely now looking to mobilise its reservist and conscript manpower, as well as private military companies and foreign mercenaries, to replace these considerable losses. “It is unclear how these groups will integrate into the Russian ground forces in Ukraine and the impact this will have on combat effectiveness.”",14,4.802502481690112,4.323520783460602,0.47898169822950987,8

He smiles as the tank bobbles forward while his passenger shouts and laughs with joy. The video then cuts to a view from the top of the tank, which shows the vehicle driving across the muddy field.

Major Dmitry Toptun, a motorised battalion leader, reportedly died when his armoured vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile in Izyum, near Kharkiv. While paratrooper commander Major Alexey Osokin is also understood to have died in the fighting elsewhere. There are said to be multiple reasons for why so many of the President's senior commanders have been wiped out since the ""special operation"" started this time last month. Ukrainian figures suggest up to 15,300 invading troopers have been killed - with Moscow still having failed to take the capital Kyiv. Toptun and Osokin's apparent deaths come after three Spetsnaz special forces commandos were ""liquidated"" during the battle for Mariupol. Documents found in a captured Tigr tank implied Captain Konstantin Druzhkov, 33, Islam Abduragimov, 19 and Shamil Aselderov, age unknown, were all among those killed. Leaked intelligence showed Putin had been hopeful of completing his invasion within 48 hours, after troops moved across the border in the early hours of February 24 - followed by a relentless campaign of air strikes. The Kremlin's inner circle is blaming such leaks to Britain and the US - subsequently passed to Ukraine - for their poor progress and has launched a purge to find those guilty of undercutting them. Putin is said to be ""incandescent"" and believes such betrayal has, at least in part, allowed the movements of his top generals and elite forces to be so easily tracked. The President - a former Soviet KGB intelligence officer prior to his rise to power - is also reported to be growing wary of defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who is in overall charge of the invasion. Sources are also reported to have said Putin has been dismissive in private of long-time ally Alexander Bortnikov, FSB security service head. Putin has also reportedly started snapping in meetings at Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff - blaming him for heavy losses of military hardware. The Russian leader's fury has also been allegedly targeted at Igor Kostyukov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed forces. Before the invasion even began he humiliated SVR foreign intelligence chief Sergey Naryshkin during a public meeting. There is some suggestion Putin will negotiate a deal which he'll market to the Russian people as a ""surrender"", before launching a ""victory parade"" in May. One source told the Sun: “He is incandescent that US and UK intelligence appear to know the Russian army’s next moves all the time, starting with predicting the invasion before he was ready to acknowledge it."" Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov said military counterintelligence is probing an FSB security service department. He told the New York Post: “So it looks like now Putin is getting angry, not only with bad intelligence and the bad performance in Ukraine but also about the sourcing of the US intelligence about the invasion, and why US intelligence was so good before the invasion, and why the Americans knew so many things about what was coming.” Soldatov also said part of the problem is high-ranking military personnel are so scared to tell Putin the truth, due to fear of being jailed, intelligence on the scale of Ukraine’s likely resistance to Russian invaders was hidden from him. However, he does not believe that the Russian President is in much danger of being assassinated by those in his inner circle. Putin was a former intelligence officer himself and so is well aware of how to manoeuvre risks, and has two separate security services ensuring his personal safety, he said.",14,4.432387645950618,3.45912124685477,0.9732663990958477,3

Russia ’s special forces are the elite of the Kremlin’s forces and Moscow spins countless propaganda tales around the fearsome nature of the soldiers. Amid claims of them being unbeatable, or the deadliest in the world, a book from Viktor Suvorov claims to offer an insight into the deadly shock troopers. The 1987 book called ‘Spetsnaz: The Inside Story of the Soviet Special Forces’ claims that once, the Russian troops were put through a gruelling medieval-like training programme. This included locking them in a small room with a small spade, and a rapid dog. In the book, Mr Suvorov wrote: “A soldier armed with nothing but the spade is shut in a room without windows along with a mad dog, which makes for an interesting contest.” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In his book, he offered a then-unprecedented look inside the special forces unit, 35 years ago. The spade that the Spetsnaz reportedly use is intricate to the soldier’s identity, Mr Suvovrov claimed. He wrote: “It is practically impossible to describe in words how they use their spades. “You really have to see what they do with them. In the hands of a Spetsnaz soldier the spade is a terrible noiseless weapon and every member of Spetsnaz gets much more training in the use of his spade then does the infantryman.” Alongside using it as a weapon and a tool, it is emblematic of what the Spetsnaz want to represent. There is believed to be around 15,000 Spetsnaz troops, with around 30% reportedly conscripts. In his book, Mr Surovov also wrote that the Spetsnaz unit has more deserters than any other branches of services. He added that these people were “usually quickly run down and killed”. He also claimed that Spetsnaz troops would not hesitate to kill one of their own if they looked weak whilst out on operation. In a 2015 book, Mark Galeotti’s ‘Spetsnaz: Russia’s Special Forces’, he wrote that the threat of the troops did not come from the calibre of individual soldiers, but their role. Apart of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence directorate, the specialised in infiltrating and attacking key targets instead of conventional warfare. The unit's history can be traced back to the second world war, when airborne shock troops were dropped behind enemy lines to disrupt and attack specific targets. With Putin’s ascendance into power from an FSB officer to president of Russia, the fortunes of the Spetsnaz were resurrected after the collapse of the Soviet Union. They were used in both the wars in Chechnya and Afghanistan and also under false flag operations in eastern Ukraine. They were reportedly the ‘little green men’, the unidentifiable well-equipped troops who were the face of Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The Mail Online reported that despite propaganda around the infamous Russian shock troops, the quality of the shock troops could not be compared to that of the SAS or American Delta Force.",14,3.191463589317908,2.879603605658879,0.311859983659029,6

Mr Andrusiv added: “He could not return home because his commander told him he would shoot him dead and say he died in battle. “Misha told us that he had barely any food left, the command structure was chaotic and almost absent, morale is very low.” Mr Andrusiv made the claims yesterday on social media, as apart of the ongoing communications war between the two sides. He said the defector would be given $10,000, a TV, phone, kitchen and shower to spend the rest of the war with. His remarkable story follows growing claims that Russia’s forces are being hamstrung by desertions, with many of its troops conscripts. Denys Monastyrsky, the minister for internal affairs, said: ""We are seeing cases of surrender when Russian troops voluntarily contact our military and declare that they want to surrender, that they do not take part in active hostilities."" He claimed that many realised they were being used as ""cannon fodder"" by their commanders. The Centre for Defence Strategies, a leading Ukraine think-tank echoed this, saying: ”Russian forces are aware of the hopelessness of their situation and increasingly choosing desertion to avoid death”. Ukraine also claimed that two days ago they saw a sharp rise in defections in the southern Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence ’s intelligence agency said: ""Having seen the real strength of the Ukrainian defenders, the occupiers are no longer interested in easy money and the possibility of looting, which they were promised before the invasion."" Other reports of intercepted messages from demoralised Russian soldiers have revealed them talking about officers who shot themselves in the leg to get home. Both US and UK intelligence reports are believed to have discussed the low morale among Russian troops as their losses mount. One Pentagon report said how soldiers simply parked their vehicles and walked away into the woods. Sources from Belarus have suggested that a number of wounded troops have been taken there for treatment, often arriving in horrific condition having gone several days without food. Alongside that, a military hospital in Moscow is reportedly said to be ‘overflowing’. Olexandr Danylyuk, director of the Centre for Defence Reform think-tank, said that there were signs of substantial defections that even hit the elite units of the Russian military.",14,2.1301543338324054,3.924884656216965,-1.7947303223845594,6
2022-03-22,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-admits-almost-10000-soldiers-26524579,"Russia admits almost 10,000 soldiers dead and more injured in Ukraine invasion","The Russian army has lost almost 10,000 soldiers in less than a month since the invasion of Ukraine, a pro-Kremlin newspaper revealed before quickly scrubbing the figures. Vladimir Putin ’s apparent aims of a quick toppling of the Ukraine government with a “special military operation” on February 24 have not gone to plan due to stubborn resistance from their neighbours. So far no major city has fallen to the Russian army and due to the slowness of the invasion Putin’s forces have taken to heavy shelling which is in turn causing a heavy loss of life. Thousands of Ukrainians have died but the Russians have also suffered heavy losses against an opponent who is heavily motivated to defend its homeland. Officially the Kremlin had claimed that there had been 498 Russian deaths on March 2 but now it appears to be as high as 9,861, with a further 16,153 injured. The figures were published by the pro-Putin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda last Sunday citing Russian defence ministry officials. But then the statistics were quickly removed from the article. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that it would not be possible to negotiate an end to the war in his country without meeting Putin. Zelensky told European public television networks such a meeting could discuss the future of occupied Ukrainian territory, but more time would be required to resolve the issue. He also repeated his acknowledgement made earlier this month that Ukraine could not now secure NATO membership. ""I believe that until such time as we have a meeting with the president of the Russian Federation...you cannot truly understand what they are prepared to do in order to stop the war and what they are prepared to do if we are not ready for this or that compromise,"" Zelensky said. Zelensky has sought a meeting with Putin for nearly a year, but the Russian leader has refused and instead demanded the Ukrainian president resolve his country's ""civil war"" with separatist territories linked to Moscow. Since Russian troops poured into Ukraine last month, Zelensky has issued increasingly urgent calls for talks to end the fighting. Last week he called for a meeting quickly so that Russia could ""limit the losses caused by its mistakes"". Russia's assault on Ukraine has forced a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes as well as killing thousands. Germany predicted the refugee number could reach as high as 10 million in coming weeks. ""I am ready at a meeting with the president of Russia to raise the issue of occupied territories, but I am certain that a solution will not come at this meeting,"" Zelensky. He said several conditions would need to be met before such matters could be dealt with, namely, a ceasefire, the withdrawal of troops and security guarantees. ""If people are trying to stop a war, there is a ceasefire and troops are withdrawn. The presidents meet, reach an agreement on withdrawing troops and there are security guarantees of one sort or another,"" he said. ""Compromises must be found, one way or another of guaranteeing our security."" Zelensky said Ukraine is well aware it cannot be admitted into NATO now. NATO member states, Zelensky said, ""understand that they do not want to fight with Russia and therefore cannot take us in...we have to reconcile ourselves to that and say 'ok, other guarantees'.""",29,4.5326474825813845,3.4201122992148383,1.1125351833665462,15

The Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, says Russian troops are strengthening their positions around the periphery of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and in other parts of the country. Nearly a month after the invading army first crossed the border, the lightning advance which Vladimir Putin anticipated has failed to materialise. Now latest satellite footage shows troops digging trenches and fortifications around military equipment northwest of Kyiv. With a stalemate unfolding in key battlegrounds, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky today asked the Pope to intervene in the conflict. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In a call with Pope Francis, he asked if the Catholic Church could play a “mediating role”. The president said he discussed the “difficult humanitarian situation and the blocking of rescue corridors by Russian troops.” So far the Kremlin has not responded to the Vatican’s numerous offers to help set up negotiations. President Zelensky also addressed the Italian parliament and referred to his lengthy conversation with the Pope. Meanwhile Ukrainian officials said Moscow has lost its “offensive potential” and is being forced to call in reinforcements from the “depths” of Russia as it retreats in key battles. It said some troops are deserting, forcing generals to take drastic decisions. The Ukraine armed forces said Russian troops had been “repelled” from Makariv, a strategically important Kyiv suburb, and the Ukrainian flag was raised over the town “thanks to the heroic actions of our defenders”. The recapture of Makariv, about 37 miles west of Kyiv, could prevent Russian forces from encircling the capital from the northwest. It comes as a senior Ukrainian general has claimed that the Kremlin is preparing its population for a “long war” and implementing draconian mobilisation measures, including deploying members of the youth military organisation, who are aged between 17 and 18. Officials claim 15,000 Russian soldiers have died so far, although these figures cannot be verified. Saboteurs sent into Ukraine at the beginning of the conflict continue to be caught. They include a man disguised as a monk who was detained in Kyiv, First Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin revealed last night. “The enemy is using various cover-ups,” he revealed. “A saboteur dressed in monastic clothes has been detained in Kyiv. Instructions, photos of checkpoints, military facilities and calls to Russia have been found on his phone.” In Britain, the Ministry of Defence said Russian forces have “endured yet another day of limited progress, with most forces largely stalled in place”. The Ukrainian military also claims the invading army only has stockpiles of ammunition and food to last for “no more than three days”. And a senior US defence official said a lack of correct equipment has led to some soldiers suffering from frostbite. It says the operation to take over Ukraine is being mobilised “chaotically”, leading to increasingly desperate tactics seen in the southern cities and around the capital Kyiv. US President Joe Biden warned that Putin might resort to biological and chemical weapons as his “back is against the wall”. He believes the Russian leadership is prepared to carry out so-called “false flag” operations to justify its propaganda, including that America actually has chemical weapons ready to be launched in Europe. “They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine,” he went on. “That’s a clear sign he’s considering using both of those. He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what’s about to come.” Putin “knows there’ll be severe consequences because of the united Nato front,” he added, without specifying what actions the alliance would take. President Biden also confirmed that Russia has used hypersonic missiles against key targets in Ukraine. Kyiv’s deputy head of police has accused Russian forces of using white phosphorus in the city of Kramatorsk, in the northern part of Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared a clip of a substance releasing white smoke into the air as it burned on the ground. Mr Biloshytskiy wrote: “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk.” White phosphorus is a toxic substance that is self-igniting when it interacts with oxygen. In a signal of how willing Russia is to target its firepower on civilians, Ukraine’s Health Minister Viktor Lyashko said ten hospitals have now been completely destroyed since Russia invaded Ukraine. He said others could not be restocked with medicines and supplies. Despite significant Ukrainian resistance, the mayor of Boryspil city near Kyiv has told residents to “leave town ASAP” as fighting against Russian forces draws closer.",14,3.4904064352616713,3.4831759532964517,0.007230481965219582,29

A voice can be heard on the footage saying: “It is not very clearly visible - but eight sanitary buses are moving…” The ghostly footage is from Gomel (Homel) in Belarus, close to the border with Ukraine where war is raging. It is assumed that the human “cargo” inside those buses is from battles with the Ukrainian army in the Chernihiv region. “I can see them bringing in a stretcher; I guess there are both wounded, and Cargo-200 (the Russia war-speak for those killed in battle),” said the author. However, other sources dispute that these buses with blotted windows and displaying the V-insignia are makeshift ambulances. These sources believe them to be macabre hearses packed with coffins en-route to devastated bereaved families in Russia. Gomel’s hospitals are already filled with Russian wounded from the war. Referring to young soldiers deployed by Vladimir Putin the video commentator says: ""The wounded are ‘children’, young men born in 2003. “They are all last autumn's conscripts, and they get delivered here without eyes, ears, with their intestines twisted."" Some buses in Gomel have brought the wounded and maimed - rather than the dead from Putin’s war. “They had to be hose-washed from blood,” according to one account. “Most of these young men are incredibly hungry, saying they haven’t eaten properly for a week. “Whoever could walk was sent to buy extra instant noodles for the wounded. “The hospital staff is shocked.” It comes as Kyiv generals claimed Russian soldiers only have enough supplies for ""three more days"" of fighting in Ukraine as attacks on Mariupol fail and offensives are stalled elsewhere. Vladimir Putin 's troops could run out of ammunition, food and fuel in a matter of days because of an inability to form a fuel pipeline, claimed the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. British Intelligence has said Russian attempts to capture Mariupol, viewed as a key target by Putin, ""continue to be repulsed"" as heavy fighting goes on.

British Intelligence has said Russian attempts to capture Mariupol, viewed as a key target by Putin, ""continue to be repulsed"" as heavy fighting goes on. Forces have been ""largely stalled"" elsewhere in Ukraine, including Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv. The assessment is in line with other Western allies' opinion that Russian supplies will run out this week and they will be forced to go on the defensive as they wait for more to arrive. This ""operational pause"" will give Ukraine forces a chance to counter-attack. This is something Ukrainian forces have already achieved in Makariv on the outskirts of Kyiv, capturing a key highway and blocking Russian soldiers from surrounding it to the northwest. Yet this setback doesn't mean a ceasefire is imminent. Judging on events up until this point, Russia could get more brutal the longer the war drags on. It comes as the Russian advance on Kyiv falters, with forces stalling northeast of the city. The Kremlin attack from the direction of Hostomel - to the northwest - has been pushed back.

Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs shared the damning update in a Facebook post, which accused the ""aggressor state"" of Russia of kidnapping children. The post read: “According to the information received, on March 19, Russian occupation forces illegally took 2389 children to the territory of the Russian Federation, who were in the temporarily occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. “Forced relocation of civilian population to the territory of the aggressor state, in particular children, has signs of kidnapping. ""Such actions are a gross violation of international law, in particular international humanitarian law.” The MFA carried on to say that by “destroying homes and killing parents”, Russia deprives Ukrainian children of parental care and puts their lives in further danger. An urgent response from the international community is needed, the statement said, to stop the barbaric war against the Ukrainian people. It continued: “The facts of kidnapping children, as well as hundreds of other facts of crimes by Russian occupiers against civilians in Ukraine, are carefully documented by law enforcement. “The culprits of these crimes will be brought to justice."" The abduction or illegal removal of children during a period of conflict is one of the six “grave violations” named and condemned by the UN Security Council. These six violations make up the basis of the Council’s framework to monitor, report and respond to abuses suffered by children in times of war. Just last week, the Kremlin was accused of war crimes against children for bombing a Ukrainian theatre in Mariupol, which was housing a number of youngsters. Sheltering Ukrainians painted the word ""children"" outside the theatre in a desperate but futile attempt to deter a Russian attack. The large letters spelling out the Russian script warning came before forces went on to drop a powerful bomb on the theatre that was being used as a shelter for families. The city council said it's ""impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act"" and that efforts were underway to find the identities of the victims - and just how many innocent Ukrainians were slaughtered. They confirmed the central part of the venue was completely destroyed, as was the entrance to an area being used as a bomb shelter. The death toll from the bombing is still unknown, but more than 1,000, including women and babies, are still feared trapped in the bombed ruins of the theatre. It comes as an elite Spetsnaz fighter who used Stalin’s real name as an alias has today been named among three special forces fighters killed in the battle for besieged Mariupol. The GRU spetsnaz are seen as Russpesia ’s top special forces fighters and were deployed to Ukraine to bring death and fear to its people. According to local sources, three of its troops were “liquidated” by the Azov regiment of the National Guard of Ukraine. The trio were named as Captain Konstantin Druzhkov, 33, Islam Abduragimov, 19 and Shamil Aselderov. Their documents were discovered in a captured Tigr armoured vehicle. Druzhkov was married to someone from the Donbas region of Ukraine and served in the military intelligence HQ of Russia’s southern military district.

Maksym ""Max"" Levin's was last heard from on March 13 when he told a friend he entering a warzone in the capital's Vyshhorod district. Max's friend Markiyan Lyseiko told local media his pal had been carrying a camera through a war-torn village in the hours before his disappearance. On the day he vanished, Max had travelled by car to a village close to Moshchun - which has been the site of intense clashes where Russian troops pummelled residential buildings to the ground with heavy artillery fire. He then travelled by foot to get within the battle zone, just north of besieged Kyiv. His final message was received on March 13 at 11.23am - and he has not been in contact with anyone since, according to Markiyan. Local media has suggested that Max may have either been killed, wounded, or taken prisoner by enemy soldiers. Levin, who is in his early 40s, has worked as a photojournalist and documentary photographer for both Ukrainian and international news outlets, including the BBC, Reuters, and AP. His photos have appeared in the Wall Street Journal and TIME magazine among others. Many of his projects were focused on the crisis in Donbass but he switched to covering the war in Ukraine after Vladimir Putin ordered troops to invade in late February. He has also worked on video and photo packages for human rights organisations like the World Health Organisation and the United Nations. In the past he said one of his dreams was to take a ""photo that will stop the war"". Yesterday, horrifying scenes were shared from the besieged capital showing the moment Russian bombs destroyed a Kyiv shopping mall - killing at least eight civilians. Firefighters worked through the night to rescue Ukrainians trapped underneath the rubble of the complex.

Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said at least eight people had been killed in the strike, the Kyiv Independent reports.

Mariupol has seen some of the war's most horrifying scenes, including the bombing of an art school housing hundreds of refugees. The word 'children' had been written in Russian on the outside. The city has been heavily bombed by the advancing Russian troops and Vladimir Putin's forces are currently holding the city under siege, causing a humanitarian crisis as people run out of water and supplies. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said of the siege: ""To do this to a peaceful city... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come."" In exchange for a safe humanitarian corridor of people leaving the city, Russia offered terms of a Ukrainian surrender, which was rejected on Monday. The advance of Russian troops has been met with not just fierce resistance by Ukrainian soldiers, but the protests and condemnation of Ukrainian cities. According to reports, Putin has threatened the residents of Mariupol with 'military tribunals' after the rejected surrender. Mariupol is in southeastern Ukraine between the annexed territory of Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region. It is a port city on the Sea of Azov, connected to the Black Sea, and became the capital of the Donetsk Oblast region after Donetsk was captured by separatists. Mariupol itself briefly fell to separatists in 2015. Of its 400,000 population before the war, around 300,000 remain trapped in the city according to Ukrainian sources, though other estimates put this figure at somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000. Despite its strategic importance and innocent population, the heavy bombardment has seen around 80% of the city destroyed as a result of Russian airstrikes. As a war tactic, Russia has proven it is happy to level cities in order to pummel them into submission, sending a warning to other cities that choose to resist. The location of Mariupol makes it strategically important to advancing Russian troops and enables them to set up a 'land bridge' between the occupied regions of Donbas and Crimea. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014. With so much being thrown at Mariupol, it is clear the city is important to Putin's invasion plan and many of the approximately 6,000 troops attacking the city would be free to attack elsewhere once they have taken control, further harming Ukrainian defences. Mariupol's location as a port city on the Black Sea is also important to the Ukrainian economy as an industrial powerhouse. Mariupol makes steel, repairs ships and is responsible for the production of heavy machinery, vital to both Ukraine's war effort and its economy. If Russia can control the Black Sea coastline, it will be able to cut off Ukrainian trade. Putin's view - that Ukraine is actually Russian and therefore belongs to the superpower - means that the capture of Mariupol is culturally significant as well.",17,3.727589589284617,3.765882114406315,-0.038292525121697896,26

It came after at least eight people died in a giant explosion that destroyed a shopping mall in Kyiv. Retroville retail centre in the north- west of the capital was hit by missiles while a gym and cars were destroyed. Ukraine ’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk hit out at the 5am deadline given to Mariupol, which has been 90% destroyed by barrages. She said: “There can be no question of any surrender, laying down of arms. “We have already informed the Russian side about this.” In a foul-mouthed blast, mayor adviser Petro Andryushchenko rapped a plan to move the city hall to Russia. On Facebook, he wrote: “They gave us until the morning. Why wait – the answer is ready – f**** you – you won’t get Mariupol.” Soon after yesterday’s deadline, smoke rose from several places in the southeast port amid multiple strikes. In Kyiv, debris was scattered for hundreds of yards and windows were left smashed several blocks away from the blasts overnight on Sunday. Last night, emergency crews tried to find survivors and establish if more people were killed in Russia’s latest barbaric attack. Missiles sparked a mushroom cloud and fires on several storeys of the mall in the Podilsky district. Footage showed a huge blast, followed by smaller explosions that left much of the complex in the rubble. Firefighters pulled out at least one man, covered in dust, after the blasts. Residents of a nearby building, whose windows were blown out, said they had spotted a mobile rocket launcher near the mall several days earlier. Russia said it had struck the shopping centre because it was being used as a rocket store. An apartment block in Kyiv was also hit on Sunday, leaving five people injured. But Ukraine has beaten the bulk of Russian troops back 15 miles out of the city. President Volodymyr Zelensky added Ukraine would never bow to Vladimir Putin ’s ultimatums and key cities would not accept occupation. He added any deal to end the war would need a referendum. Figures released on day 26 of the invasion show Ukraine is battering Russian forces who have lost more than 10% of their troops – 15,000. More than a quarter of Russian warplanes (97) have been shot out of the sky and around half of their helicopters (121) have been downed. More than 40% of Putin’s tanks (498) have also been destroyed. Sources said Russia has lost more than half its armoured personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles. The Ukraine military added: “The enemy continues to insidiously destroy the infrastructure of captured cities, launch missiles and bomb strikes on peaceful neighbourhoods of Ukrainian cities and villages, rob, kidnap and take hostages civilians.” An unnamed US defence official said Ukraine is showing “no signs” of ending its resistance and is repeatedly counter-attacking. The source added Moscow’s forces are shelling Ukraine’s cities in a “near desperate attempt to gain leverage” in talks. Last week, Ukraine said it had lost 1,700 troops and that tally is thought to have risen in recent days. But its strong defence has led to fears Russia is increasingly turning on civilians to force Kyiv into capitulating. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has claimed the Kremlin illegally deported 2,389 children to Russia from the disputed region of Donbas. It urged the global community to increase pressure on Russia to end the war. Many Ukrainian officials have been kidnapped by Russians trying to force a surrender. There have been repeated incidents caught on camera of Russian troops executing and targeting civilians. Captured Russian gunner Valery Vasilyev, 18, told Ukraine’s SBU security agency how he was ordered to shoot civilians in Kharkiv. According to Ukraine, Moscow’s troops have shelled 135 hospitals, nine of which have been destroyed. Yesterday CCTV footage emerged of protestors being shot at in Kherson. Russia has reportedly passed details of more than 500 captured Ukrainians to the Red Cross and is to be prepared to swap them for detained Russians. Some of Ukraine’s orphans have reached a hospital in Kyiv where doctors hope to be able to provide care and perform life-saving surgeries. The governor of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said buses evacuating civilians from frontline areas were hit by shelling yesterday and four children were wounded in separate incidents. Ukrainian officials say 8,057 people escaped through seven humanitarian corridors yesterday.

It comes as Ukraine said it would not accept ultimatums from Russia after Moscow demanded it stop defending besieged Mariupol. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are suffering through Russian bombardments laying waste to the port city. Gennadiy Druzenko, 49, told Ukraine-24 channel about Russian military prisoners of war: “I have always been a great humanist and said that if a man is wounded, he is no longer an enemy but a patient. “But now [I gave] very strict orders to castrate all [captured Russian] men, because they are cockroaches, not people.” Since 2014, some 500 doctors - male and female - have worked with Druzenko’s mobile hospital. A lawyer by training, he set up the First Voluntary Mobile Hospital which deploys civilian doctors and nurses in the conflict zone close to the separatist republics in eastern Ukraine. He also told famous Russian TV host Yevgeny Kiselyov on Ukraine-24 channel: “Believe all doctors who saved the patients - Russians will die here. “Die in large numbers. “Those who [come here] will remember their nightmare on Ukrainian soil. “Like the Germans remember Stalingrad.” The Russian Investigative Committee opened a criminal case into the comments, which means that if Druzenko is captured he will face trial under Russian law. The head of the committee Alexander Bastrykin, a former university classmate of Vladimir Putin, initiated a criminal case over his castration demand which is “contrary to the law and the norms of medical ethics”. He said: ""The head of the Ukrainian Mobile Hospital project, Gennady Druzenko, called for violence against captured soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces live on a Ukrainian TV channel. ""He gave this instruction to the doctors of mobile hospitals.” Druzenko is set to be put on Russia ’s international wanted list. Mariupol has become a focal point of Russia's assault on Ukraine, but attacks were also reported to have intensified on the country's second city Kharkiv on Monday. The conflict has driven almost a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes, and Germany predicted the refugee number could reach as high as 10million in coming weeks. Europe said Russia was using refugees as a tool and that it was prepared to take more action on top of existing sanctions to isolate Russia from global finances and trade. Russia's military had ordered residents of Mariupol to surrender by 5am local time on Monday, saying those who did so could leave, while those who stayed would be handed to tribunals run by Moscow-backed separatists. President Volodymyr Zelensky's Government responded that it would never bow to ultimatums and said cities such as the capital Kyiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv would always defy occupation. ""There can be no question of any surrender"" in Mariupol said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. Russia's invasion, now in its fourth week, has largely stalled, failing to capture any major city, but causing massive destruction to residential areas.",17,3.1626153964520705,5.725023568537617,-2.5624081720855467,2

Overnight, Russian bombs destroyed a Kyiv shopping mall, killing at least eight people. Firefighters have been working through the night to rescue Ukrainians trapped underneath the rubble of the complex.

Maxim, who is in the equivalent of year 6, walked himself to a local territorial military base in Boryspil, Kyiv Oblast at night. The young man told soldiers there that he was ready to fight and wanted to take up arms. While Ukraine is on a war footing and throwing everything it has into efforts to repel the Russians, Maxim's offer was turned down due to his age. Soldiers at the base, impressed by his spirit, asked Maxim if they could pose for some photos with him. Volunteer Oleksiy Kovtun shared the story of the brave student. He said: ""An 11-year-old boy came to us at night. ""Fifth-grade student. School no. 7... He came at curfew. By himself. On foot. To the military...He came to fight! ""Then we passed him to a worried mother, who was quickly found."" Oleksiy urged the boy's mother not to ""scold the hero"", referring to the young boy. The Territorial Defence Forces, which are the military reserve component of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, have been key in helping to stall Russia's ongoing invasion of its neighbour. Though the Russian Armed Forces have occupied swathes of territory in northern, eastern and southern Ukraine, they have so far been unable to take the country's major cities, such as Kyiv or Kharkiv. It has been suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin underestimated the resolve and determination of the Ukrainian people and believed his so-called ""special military operation"" would yield a rapid victory. Such a victory, it is believed, would have allowed him to install a puppet government in place of that of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who remains in Kyiv. Boryspil is home to Ukraine's largest airport, which has been hit by Russian missiles during the ongoing invasion. The city, however, still remains under Ukrainian control. Ukraine's Territorial Defence Forces reportedly have 37,000 active members and 130,000 volunteers. During the course of the conflict, they have been bolstered by the efforts of civilian volunteers who have produced Molotov cocktails and anti-tank traps for them.",14,4.677378161051632,5.467652471297749,-0.7902743102461169,19

The city has been ""comprehensively trashed"" by missiles fired by Vladimir Putin's forces, but defiant leaders today said there was ""no question"" they would lay down their arms. Civilian buildings including a theatre where families were hiding have been targeted in recent days, while President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the siege was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". Tens of thousands remain trapped inside Mariupol, a port on the Azov Sea, as Ukrainian troops and volunteers bravely defend their homeland against the advancing invaders. Russia is determined to seize the city and Putin's forces have completely encircled it on both land and sea, stopping vital supplies getting in and out. Professor Mark Galeotti, principal director of Mayak Intelligence, said that Russia would never have expected Ukraine to surrender the city, and the surrender call was little more than posturing. He told The Mirror: ""As much as anything else it was grandstanding so they can say 'look, we're being reasonable' before they unleash the next wave of hell."" Prof Galeotti said Mariupol has been ""comprehensively trashed"" by the bombardment, but civilian casualties will continue to rise in coming days. ""In the grand scheme of things the Russians aren't in a position to escalate, but the point is that they've chosen Mariupol as a key target,"" he said. ""Mariupol has become a symbolic site of resistance and one way or another they will make sure that they take it."" He continued: ""For Putin every extra city he can take is an extra bargaining chip."" He said that with the city completely cut off, every Ukrainian troop killed would be one less enemy to fight, as reinforcements are unable to reach Mariupol. On Friday Russian forces unleashed high-tech hypersonic missiles for the first time in combat - a move Prof Galeotti said could indicate it is running out of conventional weaponry. ""It's like using a Rolls Royce to go and do a weekly shop,"" he said. ""It's a ridiculously expensive missile that they've used for a purpose that it didn't deserve, but they're looking at what else they've got in the cupboard. ""It's an area in which the Russians have a technical advantage, it's possible that they're saying 'don't mess with us.'"" Prof Galeotti said seizing Mariupol would not be a ""war winning"" moment for the Russians, but it would be a heavy blow for Ukraine. ""Now we're getting reports of Russians in Mariupol, it implies that we're approaching the end game."" Mariupol has been bombarded with missiles in the three weeks since the war began, but this now means Russian forces are running out of targets in the city, Dr Deborah Sanders told The Mirror. Even Kremlin supporters believe that taking Mariupol will not be easy, despite the merciless bombing. Dr Sanders, reader in Defence and Security Studies at King's College London, told The Mirror that the refusal to surrender would likely lead to a ""continuation"" of the assault on the city, but not necessarily an increase. She said she believes Russia lacks the firepower to intensify the attack, and Ukraine cannot afford to give up any territory. Dr Sanders said: ""They (Russia) do not have the firepower to necessarily be able to intensify the attack as they are heavily engaged in the other theatres with a continued push on Odesa. ""Taking Kyiv or at least regime change - overthrowing President Zelensky - remains they key priority. ""One problem they are likely to face is what targets to hit, very little remains standing in Mariupol. If President Putin's aim is to coerce the Ukrainians into accepting his peace terms, then he is lacking a ladder of escalation. ""Not only is there a lack of military capacity to intensify shelling, but a continuation of this tactic will make increased sanctions more likely."" Mariupol is of such importance to Ukraine that it ""will never willingly surrender"" it, Dr Sanders said. She stated: ""The Ukrainians need to demonstrate that they can take the pain, that they will continue to fight, this will put them in a much stronger negotiating position. ""In essence, the Ukrainians need to drag this war out as long as possible, as the costs to Russia are immense - both in terms of the military costs, but also in terms of the reputational and economic costs of sanctions. ""The costs to Ukraine, of course, are also immense, but they could be much much worse and Ukraine could end up losing large swathes of its territory in the east, access to the Sea of Azov and its very independence."" A Russian-backed separatist leader in eastern Ukraine said he believed it would take more than a week to take control of the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Denis Pushilin, head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, told Russia's Interfax news agency: ""I am not so optimistic that two or three days or even a week will close the issue. Unfortunately, no, the city is big."" It comes after a deadline for Ukrainian leaders to surrender the city passed in the early hours of this morning. Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, urged Ukrainian forces in Mariupol: “Lay down your arms. “A terrible humanitarian catastrophe has developed. All who lay down their arms are guaranteed safe passage out of Mariupol.” ""There can be no question of any surrender, laying down of arms,"" the Ukrainska Pravda news portal cited Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk as saying early on Monday. ""We have already informed the Russian side about this."" Mrs Vereshchuk said over 7,000 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Sunday, with more than half escaping from Mariupol.",17,4.900778840255493,2.8735983783294796,2.027180461926013,26

Vladimir Putin ’s insistence Ukraine be stopped from joining the group of 28 European countries and two from North America has been given as one of the reasons for his brutal invasion. Despite his country being decimated by Russian missiles, President Volodymyr Zelensky has been told the former USSR state will not be joining any time soon. Neither will several other European countries if Russia has anything to do with it, it seems. Igor Kalabukhov, the Russian ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, said on national TV Moscow has “plans” for Nato. He added: “I have already said… let me assume, for example, Bosnia has become a member of NATO and Brussels decides to put nuclear missiles aimed at Moscow there. “We will assess the strategic situation and that is why I think that the way out must be the European system, not NATO. “If Bosnia and Herzegovina decide to be a member of any association, it is an internal affair. But another thing is our reaction. ""With the example of Ukraine, we showed what we expect. If there is a threat, we will react."" When asked by a reporter about other neighbouring nations, he answered: ""How do you know we have no plans against Croatia, Hungary, Poland? “We have plans against NATO. We are assessing the geostrategic situation, looking at where the threats are coming from and reacting.” Since the invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, western countries have been unwilling to send troops into Ukraine for fear of it leading to a larger conflict. Putin has implied that Nato boots on the ground in Nato would lead him to launch a nuclear attack. President Zelensky has asked Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country which has been rejected as the move would mean Nato forces could be forced to shoot down Russian planes, potentially leading to a Third World War. Nato was formed in 1949, four years after the end of the Second World War. Its 12 founding members were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States. In response Russia created its own group of eastern European communist countries in 1955, known as the Warsaw Pact. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 several former Warsaw Pact countries such as Hungary and Poland switched sides. The last country to join Nato was North Macedonia in 2020.",29,5.333667806633542,4.408460519328036,0.9252072873055059,10

Officials say up to 5,000 people have been made to leave the city of Mariupol, which has seen intense fighting over the past week, and sent to south-western Russia. The move has provoked chilling parallels with Nazi concentration camps in the 1930s and 1940s, with the Russian invaders accused of following ""the logic of Nazi Germany"". City mayor Vadym Boychenko likened the move to the actions of Hitler's Third Reich, saying it was ""hard to imagine"" it could happen in the 21st century. It is claimed that Russian troops trawled through the phones and documents of residents before telling some they were being deported to Russia. Mr Boychenko said: ""It is known that the captured Mariupol residents were taken to filtration camps, where the occupiers checked people's phones and documents. ""After the inspection, some Mariupol residents were redirected to remote cities in Russia; the fate of others remains unknown. ""What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War Two, when the Nazis forcibly captured people. ""It is hard to imagine that in the 21st century people would be forcibly deported to another country. ""Not only are Russian troops destroying our peaceful Mariupol, they have gone even further and started deporting Mariupol residents."" Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun told Times Radio that Russia was following ""the logic of Nazi Germany"". She said: ""From what we know from the city mayor and the city council, is they are taking Ukrainian citizens. ""They are sending them through what are called the 'filtration camps' and then they are being relocated to very distant parts of Russia, where they are being forced to sign papers (saying) that they will stay in that area for two or three years and they will work for free in those areas."" Ms Sovsun agreed when it was put to her that what she was describing was ""effectively slave labour"". British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has condemned the ""abduction and deportation"" of Ukrainians. She said she was ""appalled"" by the reports and said Putin must be ""held to account"" for his treatment of civilians during the invasion. Mariupol is in the throes of a humanitarian emergency after being encircled by Russian troops, cut off from energy, food and water supplies and facing a relentless bombardment. On Sunday, city authorities said a bomb destroyed an art school where 400 people had taken shelter, with rescuers searching for people possibly trapped under the rubble. Only days before the shelling, there was a separate attack on a theatre in the city where more than 1,000 people were said to have been bunkered. Speaking at the Tory spring conference, Boris Johnson warned that a Putin victory in Ukraine would be the ""beginning of a new age of intimidation across the whole of eastern Europe"".

Olha Stefanishyna spoke out as her President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's siege of the port city of Mariupol was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". Weeks into the Ukraine-Russia war, Russia ’s defence ministry said it had struck Ukraine with cruise missiles from ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, and launched hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace. The city council in Mariupol said Russian forces bombed an art school where about 400 residents had taken shelter. There was no immediate word of casualties, and Reuters could not independently verify the claim. Russia denies targeting civilians. Asked if she believed it was a genocide, Ms Stefanishyna told Sophy Ridge On Sunday on Sky News: ""I absolutely believe it. I am a lawyer myself and I commit myself to implementation of the decision."" Ms Stefanishyna added: “It’s really important that all political leaders around the world… stay united and establish the anti-war coalition. Only this joint effort will allow us to prevent this massive genocide and murdering in the 21st Century”. She said that while Kyiv was still open to talks with the Kremlin, Ukraine would “absolutely not” give up some territory to Russia. She highlighted “horrible stories women have heard about women who have been raped for hours and then murdered”. She referred to the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which has urged Russia to ""immediately suspend the military operations"" it began on February 24 in Ukraine. ""We know that the words of the ruling, the orders, mean nothing to the Russian Federation, but it's not something I presume or anybody else presumes, this is the reality,"" she said.

She went on: “Ukraine will resist as long as it needed to make sure that no terror, no mass murdering, no genocide is committed on this land in the 21st century.

Vasylenko also claimed that some Ukrainians were so vulnerable they could not escape, with the MP saying Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""changed his strategy to target the most vulnerable groups of women and children"". The Ukrainian MP's claims come after Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko claimed Putin was ""not healthy"" and a ""danger to the world"". Vasylenko said: ""Most of [the women over 60] were executed after being raped or took their own lives. The main problem is that victims and families do not have the strength or capacity to come forward.""

Igor Rudenko, signalman of the 126th separate coastal defense brigade of the Russian Federation, told the press conference that his ""decision to surrender was the right"" one. He said that the Russian troops had already lost and that the Ukrainian military would ""destroy"" them, claiming that 15,000 had already died. Troop casualties on either side are very difficult to confirm, but official estimates put the figure much lower. ""If you (the Russian army) have the honour remaining, do not repeat my mistakes,"" Mr Rudenko said. ""Take the troops away, because Putin does not need us. He does not even take the corpses. They are thrown into mass graves. It's hard to see.""

Commander of the automobile department of the 126th separate coastal defence brigade , Alexander Fomenko, appealed to his fellow citizens to hit the streets and protest. ""I ask you to take to the streets,"" he said. ""Do not be afraid of our government. They will not trample on the crowd. Yes, they will detain 10,00-20,000 people, but there are more of you. ""You can go out and stop this chaos. Peaceful people suffer here, children."" The Kremlin has yet to respond to the press conference, which comes after several informal videos of captured Russian soldiers expressing regret about the invasion circulated. Publishing video of prisoners of war is a grey area in the Geneva Convention - an international treaty designed to regulate warfare. Article 13 of the treaty says that that “prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity”. It is not clear what conditions the soldiers were appearing under in the press conference, and whether they were in anyway forced or coerced into speaking out against the Kremlin. It is also difficult to gauge what the level of support of is for the war in Russia. Putin appeared at a huge pro-war rally in Moscow on Friday, where tens of thousands of Russians belted out the national anthem in a carefully choreographed event. Police forces have been brutally cracking down on anti-war protests by arresting tens of thousands of people and checking civilians' phones for anti-Kremlin messages.",13,4.201348319024608,4.865903202840874,-0.6645548838162663,21

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said the troops, also known as Kadyrovites, had returned to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya. The organisation claimed that the soldiers had been pulled out after suffering large numbers of deaths in the first three weeks of the war. Reports of Chechen troops participating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in the first days of the Russian invasion on February 24. On February 26 a video began circulating of Chechen servicemen hoisting a Russian flag on a military unit building in Gostomel, a village 50 kilometres northwest of the Ukrainian capital. The Armed Forces of Ukraine authenticated the video, but denied the claims within it that they had fought off three Ukrainian advances - saying that the area invaded was empty at the time. A day later, three days after the invasion began, commander of the 141st Motorized Regiment of the Chechen Rosguard, General Magomed Tushayev, died. During efforts to land at Gostomel airport from February 26 and 28, ""several hundred"" Chechen fighters lost their lives, SBU intelligence officers say. A large column of what appeared to be Kadyrovites fighters and military machines was then filmed in Bucha, north of Kyiv. Subsequent video emerged of airstrikes being launched at it and the wreckage of many of the army vehicles. Ramzan Kadyrov, President of Chechnya, initially denied casualties among his fighters, but on February 28 he acknowledged the deaths of two Chechen servicemen, while not giving their names. ""Unfortunately, there are casualties among the natives of the Chechen Republic. Two died and six others were injured,"" he wrote on Telegram. Claims from both sides regarding lives lost and the current location of troops are difficult to verify, given the contested area in which the Chechens were operating. According to SBU counterintelligence, on March 13, the Kadyrovites were evacuated from the territory of the Kyiv region via Belarus and further by air to Chechnya. At the same time, Kadyrov announced that he was sending a thousand more of his fighters to Ukraine. Footage that has emerged in the last few days suggests that there are at least some Chechen fighters still involved in the invasion. On Tuesday, Kadyrov announced that his fighters were leading the attack on the city of Mariupol, having entered Ukraine from the east. He published a video which showed a number of soldiers firing at the upper floors of a building that had been hit by an airstrike, before they are seen appearing to help people evacuate. Ukrainian troops have taken to taunting the Chechens, who come from a predominantly Muslim part of Russia. Ukraine’s National Guard posted a video of fighters from the Azov Battalion, some members of which were accused of committing potential war crimes by the United Nations in 2016, greasing bullets in pork fat and warning them to go home.",14,6.144003986236888,6.145025500030457,-0.0010215137935691843,6

The news of the 'abduction' comes as Russian forces attacked an art school in the city which was being used as a shelter from constant shelling and left it in ruins People are believed to be trapped under the rubble where it is thought 400 people had taken refuge but there was no details on the number of casualties. The city's council said thousands had been 'forcibly deported' to Russia as they fight to protect their homeland. The Mariupol authority claimed Russia ""illegally took people"" from Livoberezhniy district and from a sports club property which was being used as a bomb shelter. The Kremlin has claimed buses carrying ""refugees"" from Mariupol began to arrive to Russia on Tuesday. Mariupol's mayor Vadym Boychenko compared the situation to Nazis removing civilians in the Second World War. He said: ""It is known that the captured Mariupol residents were taken to filtration camps, where the occupiers checked people's phones and documents. ""After the inspection, some Mariupol residents were redirected to remote cities in Russia; the fate of others remains unknown. ""What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War Two, when the Nazis forcibly captured people."" The mayor said it was difficult to imagine that deportation could happen in the 21st Century in addition to destroying the city Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, said Russia's siege of the port city of Mariupol was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". ""Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents were deported onto the Russian territory,"" the city council said in a statement on its Telegram channel late on Saturday. Russian news organisations have said buses have carried several hundred people Moscow calls refugees from Mariupol to Russia in recent days. Many of Mariupol's 400,000 residents have been trapped for more than two weeks as Russia seeks to take control of the city, which would help secure a land corridor to the Crimea peninsula. President Vladimir Putin calls the assault on Ukraine a ""special operation"" aimed at demilitarising the country and rooting out people he terms dangerous nationalists. Western nations call it an aggressive war of choice and have imposed punishing sanctions on Russia aimed at crippling its economy. The Mariupol bombardment has left buildings in rubble and severed central supplies of electricity, heating and water, according to local authorities. Rescue workers were still searching for survivors in a Mariupol theatre that local authorities say was flattened by Russian air strikes on Wednesday. Russia denies hitting the theatre. Air raid sirens sounded across Ukrainian cities on Sunday and Russia's defence ministry said cruise missiles were launched from ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, as well as hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace. Hypersonic missiles were deployed by Russia for the first time in Ukraine on Saturday, in a strike which Moscow claimed destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command confirmed the attack in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region, but said the Ukrainian side had no information on the type of missiles used. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said seven humanitarian corridors would open on Sunday to enable civilians to leave frontline areas.",17,5.005286843098406,2.2170509932689955,2.7882358498294106,26

General Sir Mike Jackson said the world was now in “unchartered territory” and that he is increasingly fearful nuclear weapons will be used on people once again. When asked directly if he feared the Ukrainian conflict would lead to a global war, he said: “I can’t rule it out. I find that very hard to say. ""The situation is now very delicate in terms of east west and its future. Its uncharted territory. ""We haven't, thank God, seen nuclear weapons used since 1945. But I honestly can’t say with confidence we can survive another century without such use.” Sir Mike went on to urge the Prime Minister to “play the long game” as he continues to try and support Ukraine. He told GB News: “Strategically we have to continue on the road we have now set out to assist Ukraine, short of offering military presence in the air or the ground. ""I am content with that argument. We have to continue ostracising Vladimir Putin while remembering our dispute isn’t with the Russian people. ""They, in the long term, are in as much danger from Putin as the rest of the world. We must play it long. ""Old points of contention in the West, socially, politically, should now be overshadowed by the strategic importance of getting this right.” His comments came on a weekend when the Russian forces appear to have upped the intensity of their attacks on Ukrainian cities. Earlier today, Mariupol's city council reported that an art school in the city, where about 400 people were sheltering, was attacked. A video has also begun circulating of the Russian military firing what appear to be thermobaric missiles from a launcher. The Russian missiles explode at a much higher temperature than most, and their blasts last longer than conventional weapons. The heat they produce can cause massive damage to internal organs and cause flash burns. It emerged this morning that Russian ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea launched cruise missile strikes on Ukraine and fired hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace today and yesterday. One of the strikes destroyed a large fuel storage facility in the Nikolaev region in southern Ukraine, while another damaged a workshop used to repair damaged armoured vehicles. Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that hypersonic Kinzhal (Dagger) missiles were also fired from airspace of Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Russia also hit a Ukrainian military preparation centre where foreign fighters joining Kyiv's forces were based. Since the invasion began on February 24, western countries have been unwilling to send troops into Ukraine for fear of it leading to a larger conflict. Putin has implied that Nato boots on the ground in Nato would lead him to launch a nuclear attack.",17,4.526064992506828,3.554709258586515,0.9713557339203125,29

Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications tweeted: ""56 people were killed in Kreminna, Luhansk Oblast - the occupiers shot from a tank (a) home for the elderly. ""Russians fired at it. Cynically and deliberately. They adjusted the tank, put it in front of the house, and started firing."" The statement went on: ""Those who lived to their old age in the house - 56 people - died on the spot.

In a separate statement on Telegram, Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk Regional State Administration, said: ""It is still impossible to get to the site of the tragedy."" It was shared by Olexander Scherba, Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria. He tweeted: ""Absolute horror in Kreminna near Luhansk. ""On March 11, (a) Russian tank approached the local senior home and fired multiple shots. 56 civilians dead - Luhansk governor."" Vladimir Putin's government has repeatedly denied claims that his forces are deliberately targetting civilians despite widespread images of hospitals and schools being bombed.

2022-03-20,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-russia-gives-ukraine-hours-26514814,Ukraine rejects Russian ultimatum to surrender stricken city Mariupol overnight,"Ukraine has rejected a call to surrender the besieged city of Mariupol after Moscow gave Kyiv until the early hours of March 21 to lay down their arms, according to a Russian state news agency. Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, told his counterparts they have until 5am Moscow time (2am GMT) on Monday to respond to his ultimatum, RIA reports. According to the state controlled media outlet, ""the Ministry of Defence wanted to receive a written response from Kyiv"" to demands to surrender by that time. Mariupol has been under siege for weeks and the city now has little food, water and power amid a humanitarian crisis that is increasing pressure on European leaders to toughen sanctions on Moscow. Russian Colonel-General Mizintsev urged Ukrainian forces in Mariupol: “Lay down your arms. “A terrible humanitarian catastrophe has developed. All who lay down their arms are guaranteed safe passage out of Mariupol.” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here But Ukraine has rejected Russian calls to surrender the port city. ""There can be no question of any surrender, laying down of arms,"" the Ukrainska Pravda news portal cited Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk as saying early on Monday. ""We have already informed the Russian side about this."" Mrs Vereshchuk said over 7,000 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Sunday, with more than half escaping from Mariupol. Many of the city's 400,000 residents remain trapped as fighting rages on the streets around them. It is unclear what will happen to those who do not surrender in the city, which has suffered terrible losses at the hands of constant Russian bombing over the past three weeks. Moscow has claimed that the Ukrainian army has been using civilians as ""human shields"" during the conflict. In reality the invading Russian forces have been bombarding built up civilians areas at such a pace that most residents were unable to escape before the bombs began to fall. According to RIA, Colonel-General Mizintsez has also called on the civilians of Mariupol to decide where their allegiances lie. ""Separately, the department appealed to the authorities of Mariupol, noting that now they have the right to make a historical choice: either they are with their people, or with the bandits,"" RIA reports. ""Otherwise, they face a military tribunal, the Russian ministry stressed."" Russia has said it will open a humanitarian corridor leading both east and west from Mariupol from 10am tomorrow Moscow time. Colonel-General Mizintsev has urged his Ukrainian counterparts to maintain a ceasefire during that period and for civilians to leave the city. ""From 10am to 12pm - for all armed units of Ukraine and foreign mercenaries without exception, without any weapons and ammunition along the route agreed with Ukraine,"" he said, RIA reported. ""From 12am simultaneous passage of humanitarian convoys with food, medicines and essentials: from the east — Russian humanitarian convoy, from the west — formed by the Ukrainian side."" Ukrainian civilians may be unwilling to trust the Russians to keep a ceasefire as several attempts to evacuate Mariupol have been scuppered by deadly shell attacks from the invading force. Colonel-General Mizintsev, without providing evidence, said that Ukrainian ""bandits"", ""neo-Nazis"" and nationalists had engaged in ""mass terror"" and gone on a killing spree in the city. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the siege of Mariupol was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". The situation in the eastern port of Mariupol has become increasingly desperate over the past three weeks. The Russians, determined to seize the city due to its strategic location, have now completely encircled it on both land and sea, stopping vital supplies getting in and people getting out. While accurate death tolls are difficult to ascertain given that fighting is now raging in the city centre, it is feared thousands have died in Mariupol. Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, warned that the city was facing a ""humanitarian catastrophe"". Two of the worst tragedies of the war so far have taken place in Mariupol. On March 9, Ukraine said that a Russian strike hit a children’s and maternity hospital, killing at least one child. This week a bomb was dropped on a theatre, trapping more than a thousand people beneath rubble for days. According to Mariupol city council and Ukraine’s human rights spokesperson, Lyudmyla Denisova, Russian troops have forced thousands of the city's residents to leave and head to Russia. “Several thousand Mariupol residents have been deported to Russia,” Denisova said on Telegram. On Saturday evening Vadym Boychenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said there was now street fighting in the city centre.",17,3.66901568094345,3.4852212749094353,0.18379440603401465,26

Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that hypersonic Kinzhal (Dagger) missiles were also fired from airspace of Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Russia also hit a Ukrainian military preparation centre where foreign fighters joining Kyiv's forces were based. While Russia has not previously launched large scale attacks from the sea, its navy has blockaded routes into Ukraine via the Black Sea. At least 100 ships are reportedly stranded in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, prompting calls for Russia to open a blue corridor to allow them out. Ukrainian grain exports via that route have stalled completely, raising the threat of global food shortages. Ukraine's ports on its southern coast have become key strategic targets for the Russian forces, who could use them to target the capital Kyiv from two directions. So far Mariupol and Odessa remain in Ukrainian hands, despite intense efforts by the Russians to break the resistance forces' will. The missile attack this morning comes as Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said seven humanitarian corridors would open on Sunday to enable civilians to leave frontline areas. Ukraine has evacuated a total of 190,000 people from such areas since the Russian invasion began on February 24, Vereshchuk said on Saturday, though Ukraine and Russia blame each other for hobbling the process. Efforts to get civilians out of Mariupol have been frustrated over the past fortnight due to Russian shell attacks during periods of agreed ceasefire. The situation in the port city is getting increasingly desperate now, with widespread food and medicine shortages combing with large numbers of casualties. Residents of the city have claimed that they are being taken against their will to Russia. One official, Pyotr Andryuschenko, told the New York Times that between 4,000 and 4,500 people in Marupol had been moved to Tangarog, a city in the Rostov region which borders Ukraine’s south-east corner. One Ukrainian man also told the newspaper he had been in contact with three families who had been forcibly relocated without their passports. This morning President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Russia's incessant bombing of Mariupol. He claimed Russian forces in the city would ""go down in history"" as being responsible for ""war crimes"". “To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,” he said. The cruise missile attack today is the latest sign that Russia is employing increasingly extreme tactics. After a theatre with the words 'children' written outside in large letters was bombed earlier this week, Russian forces struck a school where 400 women and children were sheltering. Russia's defence military earlier said it used hypersonic weapons for the first time in combat during a strike on a base in the Ivano-Frankivsk region. The missile's speed and ability to fly low makes them ""invisible"" to most anti-missile defence systems, and they are capable of carrying nuclear warheads, experts have said.",17,1.9664474571323054,3.275683618860495,-1.3092361617281898,20
2022-03-19,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/syrians-say-war-ukraine-only-26509666,Syrians say Ukraine war 'only beginning' as Putin unleashes same brutal tactics,"A survivor of the Syrian civil war has warned that the brutality being unleashed by the Russians in Ukraine is only the beginning. For Abdel Kafi al-Hamdo, the heart-breaking scenes that have been coming out of Ukraine since February 24 remind him of another conflict. The English teacher was swept up in the Syrian civil war, which saw President Bashar al-Assad's forces fight various opposition factions with the backing of Vladimir Putin's Russia. Over the course of the decade long conflict, more than 200,000 civilians lost their lives, including 25,000 children. Assad's forces plumbed the depths of modern warfare by unloading bombs onto built up areas of Aleppo and releasing chemical weapons including mustard gas and sarin. Hambo says the terrible nature of the war and the way in which it spilled into all areas of civilian life affords Syrians a unique insight into the conflict in Ukraine. ""They destroyed us; they destroyed our psychology,"" Hamdo, who once found himself stepping over dead bodies to meet a friend in hospital, told CNN. ""This is what will happen in Ukraine. What's going on in Ukraine is only the beginning."" The links between the Syrian civil war and the Russian invasion of Ukraine are clear. As with the Syrian government forces, Russia has not been shy in unleashing indiscriminate shell attacks on built up civilians areas. Russia helped launched what United Nations investigators called a campaign of ""systemic"" attacks on hospitals in Syria. More than 300 attacks were made against various medical facilities over a four year period to 2015. In Ukraine, Russian forces have targeted hospitals with shell attacks - in one instance hitting a maternity hospital in Mariupol and killing a child. Another clear parallel between the conflicts is how they have both pushed Western countries into difficult decisions about whether they should intervene. In 2013, the Obama administration said that the Assad regime crossed a ""red line"" when it used chemical weapons on its own people. Somewhat led by the UK's decision not to intervene which followed a historic House of Commons vote, the US did not send troops into Syria. So far Western allies have come to the same decision with Ukraine. Two years after the US decided not to fight directly in Syria, the Russian military moved in and helped prop up a very weakened Assad. He remains in power to this day, and Russia maintains a presence in Syria. By moving into Syria when it did, Russia's military gained valuable modern warfare experience which will have guided its invasion of Ukraine. In August last year Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu boasted about how the military had practiced using hundreds of weapons in the Middle Eastern country. ""We have tested over 320 (types of weapons), in fact, we have tested all the weapons, except for easy-to-understand versions (in Syria),"" he said. Ismail al-Abdullah was a member of the White Helmets volunteer rescue group and witnessed first hand the terrible destruction and misery the war wreaked in Syria. He too has been watching the invasion of Ukraine through the eyes of someone who survived a war in their own country. ""It is frustrating to see Russia repeating the same misinformation and falsehood,"" he said of spurious Russian claims that the bombed Mariupol hospital had been turned into a base for nationalists. ""Russia devastated tens of hospitals and killed hundreds of medical staff in Syria under this false pretext."" Mr al-Abdullah reacted to a photo that was widely shared two weeks ago of a family killed as they tried to flee Mariupol. ""This pic is so reminiscent to what has been happening in Syria since 10 years,"" he said. When asked what advice he would give to Ukrainians caught up in the conflict, Mr al-Abdullah- urged people not to walk in open roads to avoid snipers. He also said rescue workers should wait to help those caught in air strikes until the sky is clear of planes, to avoid being hit in a double-tap attack.",17,3.5271383019986122,3.9747743212156648,-0.44763601921705254,29

The “unstoppable” Kinzhal – or Dagger – obliterated a Soviet-era underground weapons store. Moscow claims the missile travels up to 1,250 miles at Mach 10 – 10 times the speed of sound – and can dodge air-defence systems. It is the first time Russia has confessed to using the aero-ballistic weapon. Security expert Dominika Kunertova fears Russia is retaliating at moves by Britain and its allies to arm Ukraine. The West has provided £1.25billion-worth of military aid. Ms Kunertova said: “It’s a signal to the West, because Putin is annoyed that the West is daring to shift all these weapons.” Meanwhile, as the sickening war enters a fourth week: * Dozens of Ukrainians were feared dead in a blitz on a military barracks near Mykolaiv. Some 200 men were asleep when three missiles hit. * Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Putin to engage in direct peace talks – accusing him of war crimes for blocking aid. * A 38-hour curfew was enforced in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia after a rocket strike killed nine. * Fierce fighting continued to rage in the besieged city of Mariupol. The Kremlin said the hypersonic missile – which can be carried by MiG-31 fighter jets or launched from warships – hit a munitions depot in Delyatun, in the Carpathian mountain foothills 380 miles west of Kyiv. Aerial footage from the Russian military shows a huge explosion. People are seen fleeing as smoke billows. The blast came hours before weeping soldiers honoured two comrades among 35 killed in a strike on a training base in Yavoriv, near the Polish border, a week ago. Security in Yavoriv remained tight amid fears saboteurs and spies are pinpointing bomb targets. From Ivano-Frankivsk, 30 miles north, soldiers were digging in defences, preparing machine-gun positions and sand-bagging areas around statues and public offices. Checkpoints were positioned every 10 miles. A couple from Kramatorsk, Donetsk, fled here a week ago. They said: “It’s like the war has followed us here.” Ukraine, meanwhile, claims 14,400 Russian soldiers have been killed. British defence chiefs believe Russia may have burned thousands of bodies in mobile crematoriums, buried many on the border – or removed them to a hospital in Homel, Belarus. Staff there say 2,500 bodies have already been shipped. But Moscow’s Defence Ministry insists it has lost fewer than 500 soldiers. Fierce fighting still raged in the port city of Mariupol. Street combat was said to be hampering efforts to rescue 1,300 feared trapped in the basement of a bombed theatre. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said: “Our forces are doing everything they can but the forces of the enemy are larger than ours, unfortunately.” A mortar attack in the town of Makariv, near Kyiv, killed seven. In the capital itself, doctors were battling around the clock to treat 200 maimed soldiers and civilians, including one stabbed in the heart. Military surgeon Igor Homenko said: “What we’re seeing is hard to cope with, in terms of our skills but also emotionally.” The injured incuded soldier Yurij, 68, who was badly hurt when his home was bombed, vowed to return to the frontline, telling the Sunday Mirror: “Everybody is ready to fight and protect our people. We feel victory is within our grasp.” Ukraine’s troops are even turning Russian weapons – seized in battles in the east – on their enemy. Four senior commanders have been shot by snipers using a Russian rifle called a Dragunov. Ukraine deputy PM Iryna Vereshchuk said 190,000 civilians have been evacuated via humanitarian corridors. And she said 562 Russians were being held as prisoners of war. President Zelensky again called for negotiations, saying: “It’s time to meet, it’s time to talk, it’s time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia’s losses will be such that you will need several generations to recover.” Even when peace does come, the threat of unexploded bombs will pose a threat for “decades” to come, experts warn. Some 2,000 have been killed or maimed by devices buried in the disputed Donbas region since 2014. Now other areas have been laced with mines too. James Cowan – CEO of HALO Trust, which has 430 people in the country clearing mines – said: “We want to clear the streets and cities of Ukraine of the devastating deluge they are littered with.”",17,3.202751533723048,3.85515044136961,-0.6523989076465617,24

2022-03-19,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-generals-ukraine-killed-kremlin-26471059,Kill list of 13 Russian commanders as generals 'pushed to front line' in Ukraine,"Five generals are among the senior Russian military figures to perish in Ukraine as Vladimir Putin sends his forces to die in his illegal invasion. Troops were told that they would be given a hero's welcome in Ukraine, but the Kremlin's lies have instead cost upwards of 12,000 Russian lives. The latest senior figure to die in the war is Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, one of Putin's most trusted leaders. The invaders have endured heavy losses since the war began on February 24, amid reports that numerous demoralised Russian troops have refused to fight. The first general's death came only four days into the invasion, and in the just over three weeks since, a number of Russian military leaders have been killed in battle. Some of the dead Russian commanders were said to have come to the frontline, something they would normally do if there were issues over decision-making, or their seniority was needed to get the troops forward. Western sources said that a lot of generals are being killed because they are being pushed closer to the front line than usual to boost Russian soldiers' morale Listed below are the most senior Russian military officials to have died in Ukraine so far. Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev was one of Vladimir Putin’s most senior commanders, in charge of the 8th All-Military Army of the Kremlin’s vast Southern Military District. Moscow did not initially confirm his death in keeping with most previous claims of the the deaths of several generals. Ukraine now claims to have killed five holding the rank of General. “As a result of fire on the enemy by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the commander of the 8th All-Military Army of the Southern Military District of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvishev was killed,” said a statement from the army general staff in Kyiv. Colonel Sergei Sukharev, one of Russia's top paratroop commanders, is the latest to be killed, in another blow to Vladimir Putin’s debilitating war effort. The colonel, of the 331st Guards Parachute Assault Regiment from Kostroma, was confirmed dead by state TV in Moscow on March 18. The airborne regiment commander had played a key role in the Battle of Ilovaysk, which was the single biggest loss of life for Ukraine during its war against Russian-backed separatists prior to the invasion. His death was first reported by Ukraine's Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security on March 17 before it was later confirmed. The Ukrainian statement read: ""Commander of the Kostroma Airborne Regiment, Colonel Sergei Sukharev…got lost in the ‘[military] exercises’, but returned home the right way."" His deputy Major Sergei Krylov was killed alongside him, said the report and Sukharev had only been in charge of the feared regiment since October. They were among a number slain from the “glorious” Kostroma regiment, seen as among Russia ’s most elite fighting forces. Major General Oleg Mityaev was the fourth general to die in Russia's invasion of Ukraine so far. He was killed along with a number of elite special force fighters as they tried and failed to take Mariupol. The south Ukrainian city has seen some of the most relentless Russian bombings and aerial attacks, but is yet to be taken by Putin's forces. A picture of the 47-year-old’s corpse was released by Kyiv on March 15 and Moscow are yet to comment on his death. General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, was killed in fighting last week, on March 11. He was among 20 Russian generals understood to be leading the invasion of Ukraine. Kolesnikov had only been promoted in December 2021. He had previously been a lieutenant colonel and chief of staff of the 4th Guards Tank Division, personnel of which were involved in Kosovo and in the second Chechen war. The Chief Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine's defence ministry said in a statement Major General Vitaly Gerasimov was killed on Monday, March 7 along with several other officers. Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, was the second of Putin’s generals to die in the invasion. The statement read: “Another loss among the senior command staff of the occupying army. “During the fighting near Kharkiv, Vitaly Gerasimov, a Russian military leader, major general, chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 41st Army of the Central Military District of Russia was killed. ""A number of senior Russian army officers were also killed and wounded. Gerasimov, 45, had fought with Russian forces in Syria and Chechnya and had taken part in the seizure of Crimea in 2014. Lieutenant Colonel Denis Glebov was killed near the city of Chuhuiv, according to Russian media. He was serving as Deputy Commander of the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces. His funeral was held on Sunday 6 March, Russian media reported, and he was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. Beneath the rank of major general, many other senior officials have lost their lives over the past three weeks. Andrei Sukhovetsky, a high-ranking Russian general, was the first senior figure confirmed to have been killed during fighting in Ukraine. As Major General he sat only four positions below the Marshal of the Russian Federation, who runs the entire armed forces. Experts said his death would have come as a bitter blow to the Russian military command and would've been fed back to Putin himself. Sukhovetsky was the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army. He is the most senior known casualty when he died on February 28, only a few days into Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sukhovetsky was a highly respected paratrooper, famed for leading training missions in “hostile territory”. A military source said he had been killed by a sniper. ""It is with great pain that we have received the tragic news about the death of our friend Major General Andrei Sukhovitsky during a special operation in Ukraine,"" a statement from a Kremlin insider said. ""We send our hearts out to his family. My deepest condolences."" Sukhovetsky also took part in Russia's military campaign in Syria. Christo Grozev, executive director of investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, said that confirmation of his death would be a “major demotivator” for Russian troops. Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Safronov, Commander of the 61st Separate Marine Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, died when Ukrainian forces recaptured the city of Chuhuiv in Kharkiv. Guard Colonel Konstantin Zizevsky , Commander of the 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment, died during a military operation to ""protect the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics,"" according to Mikhail Vedernikov, the governor of the Pskov Region. He died alongside Guard Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Agarkov. Ukrainian forces claimed to have killed Colonel Andrei Zakharov in an ambush on a Russian armoured column in a suburb of Kyiv. General Magomed Tushaev, a Chechen warlord, is believed to have been killed in a battle in Ukraine after a 56 tank convoy of Chechen vehicles were destroyed near Hostomel. Vladimir Zhonga, a warlord who led the Sparta Battalion - a Neo-Nazi military unit that has the Kremlin's backing - has also died. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine?

Bodyguards, cooks, launderers and secretaries were among those sacked, reports the Daily Beast which cited a Russian government source. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has been widely condemned by countries across the world - with heavy sanctions placed on Putin and his network of oligarchs. US and Western officials repeatedly warned in February Russia was preparing to stage a pretext against Ukraine after troops gathered along their shared border. The Kremlin always denied invasion plans... until they launched their illegal attack. According to an operative for France's General Directorate for External Security who claimed it ""is on every intelligence agency's design table."" In the US, meanwhile, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham went further still and called for the Russian president's assassination which was condemned by Republicans Graham compared Putin to Hitler earlier this months and said: ""The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out,"" He added: ""You would be doing your country — and the world — a great service."" But he told The Daily Beast the task would not be something which would be done by foreign government. ""The attempt will be from within the Kremlin,"" he said. ""Russian intelligence is likely the only one left that deploys poison as a default"" to assassinate people. Poisoning have been previously linked to Kremlin critics with the nerve agent Novichok being employed as a means of disposing of outspoken figures such as Alexei Navalny who was poisoned in August 2020. Putin was then accused of carrying out the attack, but there have also been instances closer to home in Salisbury where double agents were poisoned with the same Soviet-era substance. The Mirror told in May last year how a detective left fighting for life by the Novichok attack in Salisbury is suing his police force. Det Sgt Nick Bailey was medically retired after he was contaminated with the nerve agent at the home of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Lawyers acting for the former officer lodged the case against the Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police Kier Pritchard at the High Court earlier this month. ­Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov were were identified by Britain as being behind the attempted murder of double agent Skripal, 69, and daughter Yulia, 33, by smearing Novichok on the door handle of their home in Salisbury, Wiltshire.",3,3.976647727370909,4.669867436120906,-0.6932197087499965,3

Pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda highlighted Sergeant Alexei Gapchennko who in an ""unequal battle with superior enemy forces…personally destroyed up to 10 nationalists during the battle."" Gapchenko also ""captured 13 Ukrainian neo-Nazis, who, during interrogation, provided valuable intelligence about the enemy”.

It said Russian forces had destroyed an underground Ukrainian missile depot in the Ivano-Frankovsk region yesterday. The use of the weapons is the latest sign Vladimir Putin is getting increasingly desperate as his military struggles to carry out his illegal invasion of Ukraine. Details about the operation remain scarce, but Russia has previously bragged about its hypersonic weapons arsenal. The strike is believed to have been carried out using Kinzhal - or 'Dagger' - missiles, which have been claimed to have a range of around 2,000 km. Their speed and ability to fly low makes them ""invisible"" to most anti-missile defence systems, and they are capable of carrying nuclear warheads, experts have said.

It has since raised the question whether it would be capable of an all out victory despite its considerably larger military. Zelensky has said Ukraine had always offered solutions for peace and wanted meaningful and honest negotiations on peace and security, without delay. His latest appeal to Putin comes with Ukrainian cities now having suffered weeks of heavy shelling leading to mass civilian casualties, and Russia has said it is ""tightening the noose"" on the port city of Mariupol which has been reduced to rubble. Zelensky gave a video address in the early hours of Saturday saying: ""I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk. ""The time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover.""

The Ukrainian president said there was no information about how many people had died after a theatre in the city of Mariupol, where hundreds of people had been sheltering, was struck on Wednesday. More than 130 people had been rescued so far, he said. It comes as Britain's chief of defence intelligence has warned that Putin is now engaged in a deadly war of attrition as Russia's advance in Ukraine continues to stall in the face of fierce resistance. Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull said the Kremlin has been forced to switch tactics, turning to the ""reckless and indiscriminate"" use of firepower which will inevitably lead to more civilian casualties. The Russians have ""enormous"" stocks of artillery ammunition and could maintain their bombardment for weeks in an attempt to force Ukraine into submission, Western officials say. The warning came as Putin made a rare public appearance to address a mass flag-waving rally at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium to mark the eighth anniversary of his country's annexation of Crimea. He praised the efforts of Russia's forces, declaring: ""Shoulder to shoulder, they help and support each other."" But Gen Hockenhull said that, more than three weeks into the campaign, it is clear the Kremlin has still not achieved any of its initial objectives. ""It has been surprised by the scale and ferocity of Ukrainian resistance and has been bedevilled by problems of its own making,"" he said. ""Russian operations have changed. Russia is now pursuing strategy of attrition. This will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. ""This will result in increased civilian casualties, disruption of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis."" Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said that she fears peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are being used as a ""smokescreen"" by the Kremlin to allow forces to regroup. In an interview with The Times, Truss said: ""If a country is serious about negotiations, it doesn't indiscriminately bomb civilians that day."" The minister said she was ""very sceptical"" about the negotiations, and added: ""What we've seen is an attempt to create space for the Russians to regroup."" She said: ""We don't see any serious withdrawal of Russian troops or any serious proposals on the table."" Truss said that ""the Russians have lied and lied and lied. I fear the negotiation is yet another attempt to create a diversion and create a smokescreen"". At the same time, Putin is tightening his control over Russian media in a bid to disguise the heavy losses his forces have suffered in battle, Gen Hockenhull said. ""The Kremlin is attempting to control the narrative, hide operational problems and obscure high Russian casualty numbers from the Russian people,"" he said. As many as 7,000 Russian troops have died so far in the fighting, including four major generals and a number of other senior officers, American sources estimate. Russian forces have been continuing to pound the outskirts of the capital Kyiv, while the cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Mariupol, where more than 2,500 civilians are reported to have died, remain under siege. Earlier another missile strike was reported on an aircraft maintenance plant on the outskirts of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which has largely so far escaped the fighting. Western officials are concerned that as Russia uses up its stock of precision weapons, it will turn increasingly to ""dumb"" bombs resulting in even more casualties among the civilian population. ""There is an enormous amount of artillery ammunition which the Russian forces hold. It may be a logistical challenge for them to get all of it in place,"" one official said. ""But if they are able to get those supplies forward then they could mount that artillery bombardment for a very, very considerable period of time. Those bombardments could be very intense."" UK armed forces minister James Heappey said the indiscriminate shelling of cities was ""very probably"" a war crime and that the Russian president bore ultimate ""culpability"" for atrocities. He warned, however, that everyone in the military chain of command could be held responsible for war crimes they were involved in. ""The evidence being gathered points very much towards war crimes being committed in Ukraine,"" he told Sky News. ""The culpability for war crimes sits absolutely with the leader of the Russian government, the man who decided to do all of this in the first place,"" he said. ""It is not just Putin who ends up being responsible for war crimes as and when the evidence is gathered and people are held to account. ""They too are involved in the prosecution of war crimes in Ukraine. This is a stain on the Russian nation.""",14,4.0786111393863225,4.359808834629544,-0.2811976952432218,29

Russia has failed to announce its estimated death toll in Ukraine for more than two weeks. There are claims it runs to around 7,000 with suspicions the true figure is being kept secret to prevent a sapping of support in Russia.

Professor Michael Clarke, a former director of the Royal United Services (RUSI) think tank highlighted the catalogue of mistakes Russian forces have and continue to make during their invasion of Ukraine. Such was the poor state of affairs of the Russian side that he said they were “making almost every tactical mistake it is possible to make”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: ""They [Russian troops] look like forces that were completely unprepared, that hadn’t thought through what a major campaign might look like.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It added: “Ukrainian forces around Kyiv and Mykolaiv continue to frustrate Russian attempts to encircle the city. It added that the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remained surrounded and subject to relentless Russian aerial attacks. Prof Clarke said that Ukraine has a ""NATO standard"" battlefield command and control system, built with help from NATO countries since 2014. He added that an attack on a plane maintenance plant in Lviv this proved Russia was now trying to weaken Ukraine’s aerial ability. This comes after weeks of failure from Russia to seize control of the skies and Ukraine calling for a ‘No Fly Zone’ to be introduced by western nations. Striking the western city just 70km from the Polish border was also ""an attempt to frighten the west out of helping Ukrainians as much as they have been"", he added. Former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, General Sir Richard Shirreff said Russian forces had shown “extraordinary incompetence” during their stuttering invasion of Ukraine. Talking to Sky News, he said that the amazing “lack of professionalism” was partly because “amateurs talk tactics, and professionals talk logistics”. He said that Russian troops morale was “absolutely rock bottom"", adding: ""They were expected to be greeted by flag-waving crowds and they have been greeted by ferocious defence. ""Putin cannot accept defeat and therefore in typical KGB style if he is facing trouble in one direction, he could cause even greater trouble in another.” Because of this the former commander warned that Putin could turn to extreme measures to try and change his fortunes. He said: ""We should be on our guard to chemical attack, quite potentially the use of tactical nuclear."" He warned that a ramp-up in forces could very easily lead to a general war that spilled beyond the Ukrainian border and “could easily go nuclear”. He added ""we can take nothing for granted"" and a ramp-up of forces would lead to a ""general war that could easily go nuclear"". Western intelligence sources reportedly said that Russia had intended to take Ukraine in a ‘lightning invasion’. This would have, in theory, seen them race across the country in a matter of days, seizing cities and urban centres before taking the capital and replacing the government with a puppet. Instead, Russia now finds themselves negotiating peace terms with Volodymyr Zelensky and his administration. According to recent reports from the Financial Times, a tentative 15-point peace plan has been outlined which could see Russian forces withdraw from Ukraine. Reportedly, it would be conditional on Kyiv accepting neutrality and curbs on its armed forces.

The Russian President rang the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on Thursday afternoon and explained what his conditions were for a peace deal with Ukraine. Following the call, the BBC spoke to Mr Erdogan's leading adviser and spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin who was part of a small number of officials listening in on the call. One of the chief demands is that Ukraine should be neutral and not apply to join NATO, which Ukrainian President has already conceded to, the report says. There are also demands for Ukraine to undergo a disarmament process to make sure there's no threat to Russia and protection for Russian as a language in Ukraine, reports said. Another demand was said to be about 'de-Nazification' which is deeply offensive to Zelensky, who is Jewish himself. Other discussions involved the status of Donbas in eastern Ukraine, though no specific details were given about this. Putin reportedly said that some of the negotiations would need to be face to face with Zelensky, which the latter is said to be prepared for. A peace deal could take a long time to reach and it will be a long time until Ukraine is able to rebuild the cities Russia has destroyed.

2022-03-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/how-russias-three-day-ukraine-26500525,How Russia's '3-day' Ukraine invasion became Putin's humiliation - full timeline,"Vladimir Putin 's military has been advancing at a snail's pace since the illegal invasion of Ukraine last month. Immediately on February 24, the invasion has received international condemnation as the world rallies behind the Ukrainian people and President Volodymyr Zelensky as they continue their fierce resistance. Putin has refused to call his invasion what it is - a war. Instead, he only refers to it as a ""special military operation"" to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. He had hoped it would last just three days. Reports of Putin's inner circle crumbling continue to circulate as he appears to be losing his control over the invasion. It is near the end of the third week of the invasion and morale among the Russian troops in Ukraine is waning and top military commanders are being killed. Former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, General Sir Richard Shirreff said Russian forces had shown “extraordinary incompetence” during their stuttering invasion of Ukraine. Talking to Sky News, he said that the amazing “lack of professionalism” was partly because “amateurs talk tactics, and professionals talk logistics”. He said that Russian troops morale was “absolutely rock bottom"", adding: ""They were expected to be greeted by flag-waving crowds and they have been greeted by ferocious defence. ""Putin cannot accept defeat and therefore in typical KGB style if he is facing trouble in one direction, he could cause even greater trouble in another.” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here After weeks of saying there was no plan to invade, Putin orders his military to launch a full-scale assault. This action sparked international anger and Moscow’s stock exchange plummets by an unprecedented 45 per cent. Multiple countries announce sanctions to try and cripple Russia's economy. Within four days of the illegal invasion, things had already started to go wrong for Putin. Andrei Sukhovetsky, a high-ranking Russian general, was the first senior figure confirmed to have been killed during fighting in Ukraine. As Major General, he sat only four positions below the Marshal of the Russian Federation, who runs the entire armed forces. Experts said his death would have come as a bitter blow to the Russian military command and would've been fed back to Putin himself. Sukhovetsky was the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army. Lieutenant Colonel Denis Glebov was killed near the city of Chuhuiv, according to Russian media. He was serving as Deputy Commander of the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces. His funeral was held on March 6, and he was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. The Chief Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine's defence ministry said in a statement Major General Vitaly Gerasimov was killed on March 7 along with several other officers. Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, was the second of Putin’s generals to die in the invasion. Gerasimov, 45, had fought with Russian forces in Syria, was a veteran of the Second Chechen War and had taken part in the seizure of Crimea in 2014. A Russian whistleblower reportedly claimed that a leaked report says the invasion has been a “total failure” and there are “ no options for a possible victory "". A so-called analyst in Russia's feared spy agency reportedly leaked the document which claims spies were kept in the dark over Putin's plan. Russian human rights activist and operator of the anti-corruption website Gulagu.net Vladimir Osechkin published the report on Facebook last week, reported The Times. The report allegedly concluded: "" Russia has no way out. There are no options for a possible victory, only defeat.” Less than a week later a third major general was killed in Ukraine. General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, was killed in fighting on March 11. He was among 20 Russian generals understood to be leading the invasion of Ukraine having been promoted to the rank of Major-General in December last year. Western sources said that more generals are being killed than usual because they are being pushed closer to the front line to boost Russian soldiers' morale. Sergey Beseda, head of the Federal Security Branch, Russia's intelligence branch, was arrested along with his deputy, Anatoly Bolyukh, an expert claimed. Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled Russian human rights activist also confirmed the arrests. Mr Osechkin told The Times that while the arrests were made on accusations of embezzlement of funds, he said the “real reason is unreliable, incomplete and partially false information about the political situation in Ukraine”. Vladimir Putin allegedly turned to China asking for military equipment, US officials said. Footage and images from the Ukraine battlefields had shown the widespread destruction of tanks and other armoured vehicles. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned Beijing that it would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over the war in Ukraine. However, China has denied this ever happened. Asked about the reports, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, said: ""I've never heard of that."" Liu said that ""utmost efforts should be made to support Russia and Ukraine in carrying forward negotiations despite the difficult situation to produce a peaceful outcome”. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russia's national guard and a part of Putin's security council, admitted progress of the invasion had been slower than expected. He said: ""I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like,"" Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guard's website. ""But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us."" Zolotov has been at Putin's side since before the turn of the century and has spent the last 13 years in charge of his personal security. Russia's Channel One was interrupted by Marina Ovsyannikova carrying a huge placard which read ""stop the war, don't believe propaganda, they're lying to you."" Her message was written in Russian and English aimed at the channel's millions of viewers - but producers quickly switched the broadcast to a clip of a hospital as they dealt with the situation. She was later fined 30,000 rubles or £214. Major-General Oleg Mityaev was the fourth general to die in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He was killed along with a number of elite special force fighters as they tried and failed to take Mariupol. The south Ukrainian city has seen some of the most relentless Russian bombings and aerial attacks but is yet to be taken by Putin's forces. A picture of the 47-year-old’s corpse was released by Kyiv on March 15 and Moscow are yet to comment on his death. General Roman Gavrilov, the deputy chief of Russia 's Rosgvardia unit, which was the spearhead of the first push into Ukrainian territory, was arrested by the FSB - Russia's successor to the KGB. According to Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian investigative journalist, the reason for the arrest is unclear. He cited a course that says he was detained over ""leaks of military info that led to loss of life"", while two others say it was ""wasteful squandering of fuel"". Supply line issues are thought to have plagued Russia's forces since the first days of the invasion. Elvira Nabiullina, 58, reportedly handed in her resignation amid claims she stood up to Putin over his war in Ukraine. The head of the Russian Bank's resignation is rumoured to have come after she privately argued with Putin over the devastation faced by Russians from Western sanctions he did not expect to be so serious. The former economic adviser to the Kremlin leader told reportedly told Putin that his invasion of Ukraine has plunged the Russian economy into a “sewer”, adding: “I am an expert in a completely different field.” She is respected both in Moscow and the West as a highly competent technocrat, one of the best central bankers in the world who has guided Russia through relative stability even amid worsening relations with the West - but the war on Ukraine may have changed her line. Colonel Sergei Sukharev, one of Russia's top paratroop commanders, is the latest to be killed. The colonel, of the 331st Guards Parachute Assault Regiment from Kostroma, was confirmed dead by state TV in Moscow on March 18. The exact date he was killed in known. The airborne regiment commander had played a key role in the Battle of Ilovaysk in 2014, which was the single biggest loss of life for Ukraine during its war against Russian-backed separatists prior to the invasion. A former Russian deputy prime minister quit his role as chair of a prestigious foundation. Arkady Dvorkovich, deputy prime minister from 2012 to 2018, questioned the war and told US media this week that his thoughts were with the Ukrainian civilians. The 49-year-old was accused of undermining Russia by a senior ruling party lawmaker. This morning it was announced he stepped down from his role had at the Skolkovo Foundation, an innovation and technology hub on the outskirts of Moscow.",14,4.3989497947933085,4.02960121150664,0.3693485832866683,11

However, one Ukrainian politician warned that without the rescue services to save them, they were buried alive, destined to die down there. The shocking news comes days after the theatre was first hit by a Russian air strike on Wednesday. Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said today that so far 130 people had been rescued from the rubble. In a televised address she said that rescue work was ongoing. Serhiy Taruta, a Ukrainian politician, confirmed this and said hundreds remained unaccounted for. He added that they cannot be evacuated because the rescue services in the city had been decimated by Russian forces. In a Facebook post he wrote: ""No one understands. Services that are supposed to help are demolished, rescue and utility services... are physically destroyed. ""A lot of doctors have been killed. This means that all the survivors of the bombing will either die under the ruins of the theater, or have already died."" Over a thousand people were sheltering at the theatre in one of Ukraine ’s worst hit cities, when it was struck. Over 350,000 Ukrainian remains in the besieged city, surviving Russian bombing attacks, officials have said. Svitlana Zlenko, who fled the city with her son on Tuesday, a day before the theatre was bombing, described Mariupol as ""hell"". She described how she was forced to melt snow to get water to cook pasta and they lived in constant fear of Russian air raids. She spent some of her last days in the city sheltering in a school, and described the moment a woman was wounded during a bombing, when shrapnel hit her hip. She said: ""She was lying on the first floor of the high school all night and prayed for poison so that she would not feel pain. ""[She] was taken by the Red Cross within a day, I pray to God she is well."" Many in Mariupol are without food or medicine with humanitarian corridors in, being shelled by Russian forces. Ms Zlenko added: ""The dead are not taken out. Police recommend to the relatives of those who died of a natural death, to open the windows and lay the bodies on the balcony. ""I know you think you understand, but you will never understand unless you were there."" The bombed theatre had the words “children” written in Russian in front and behind it, to try and warn off Russian bombers and missile strikes to the vulnerable inside. However, Putin’s forces still laid waste to the shelter in a merciless attack that has characterised Moscow’s approach as their invasion continues to stutter and make little progress. Only today, a Russian missile struck an airport near the western city of Lviv, where hundreds of thousands had found refuge from the Russian forces. In light of the failed reported ‘lightning invasion’ where the Kremlin had hoped to take the country, and capital in a few days, Russia has resorted to relentless shelling and bombings of civilian targets. However, today, in a Ministry of Defence intelligence update, they confirmed that across this week Russia had made little progress, in spite of its ruthless air raids. This was in part due to fierce Ukrainian opposition which has killed four Russian generals and over a dozen leading officers in three weeks of fighting. US President Joe Biden is due to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping at 1pm this afternoon. This meeting will be held in hope to bring one of the two powers yet to denounce Russia, on side with the west. India is the only other power yet to publicly condemn Putin or Russia. Despite reports that Russia had been begging China for military aid and assistance to sidestep aid, recent noises from the eastern power has suggested it does not want to be tied to Putin and his oligarchic mafia state. Since the start of the invasion, more than 3.2million people have been forced to flee their homes and leave Ukraine. As of today, the United Nations Human Rights Commission said that 3,270,662 people had left the country. Over half of these, 1,975,449, had entered Poland, and it is unknown how many stayed her or moved on to other countries. In the past few days, reports suggest border crossings have slowed, but as food chains continue to collapse and the conflict threatens to worsen, the streams of refugees could pick up once more.",17,4.89884938785427,4.58131598337913,0.31753340447513967,24
2022-03-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/how-russia-crumbled-after-invasion-26502385,"How Russia crumbled after invasion - 28,000 killed or wounded and Putin weakened","It was supposed to be one of the world’s most powerful and modern armies, against which few countries - not least its little neighbour Ukraine - would stand a chance. But three weeks into Putin’s war and Russia faces the real prospect of humiliation as its invasion falters and its army is exposed as ill-equipped and badly prepared. This morning Russia was forced to confirm that yet another of its military leaders, and one of Russia’s top paratroop commanders, has been killed in battle, along with his deputy. And as their advance grounds to a standstill following devastating attacks by Ukraine’s defenders, Russia is increasingly having to resort to long-range missile attacks, like the ones which hit Lviv in west Ukraine in the early hours of this morning, believed to be launched from warships in the Black Sea. Meanwhile, the Russian economy is collapsing, the country has become an international pariah, and increasing numbers of prominent Russians are turning against their president. Here’s how Putin’s attempt to capture Ukraine and rebuild Russia’s once-glorious empire is really going… The US believes that as many as 28,000 Russian soldiers have been captured, killed or wounded in the fierce fighting raging across the country - amounting to around a fifth of its total forces. The Ukrainians have deployed weapons shipped over from the West - including at least 17,000 anti-tank rockets and 900 Stinger missiles - with devastating effect, destroying hundreds of tanks and armoured personnel carriers. In a single day this week, Kyiv’s commanders said they had shot down four aircraft - including two helicopters. Meanwhile, the Oryx Blog, a group that tracks the conflict in real time, has said 230 heavily armoured tanks have been taken out, and drone footage of charred vehicles lining the roads has been shared widely online. There have also been reports of Russian soldiers defecting, leaving piles of uniforms next to their abandoned armoured vehicles. Dr Natasha Kuhrt, a War Studies lecturer at King’s College London, says: “Morale has been a problem with Russia’s army since the Soviet Union and corruption is endemic. Soldiers were deployed being told they were just on exercises, before being sent to the frontline - and many of them will have family in Ukraine as well.” But Russia is still believed to have an estimated 280,000 soldiers and 2,000,000 reservists ready to be called up. In addition, it has close ties with the notorious Wagner Group, a firm of around 6,000 battle-hardened mercenaries who have previously been accused of crimes against humanity in Africa. The country also has a vast military-industrial complex, making up close to a fifth of the world’s entire arms sales - second only to the US - and supplies almost all of its own equipment. Even so, earlier this week US officials said Moscow had reached out to China for military support amid reports that everything from armoured vehicles to ammunition and fuel are running low on the front lines. An intelligence update yesterday by the Ministry of Defence claimed the Russian invasion “has largely stalled on all fronts” while “the vast majority of Ukrainian territory, including all major cities, remains in Ukrainian hands.” Putin was so confident in a quick victory that soldiers were reportedly only issued with three days’ worth of rations when the offensive began. Twenty-three days later, however, troops have become bogged down - sometimes literally - amid fierce resistance and are failing to take control of key cities. Attempts to encircle Kyiv look increasingly fraught with the rivers that cross the city, as well as difficult terrain like marshlands, stalling the Russian advance. And while in other cities in the south, like Mariupol, and the east, like Sumy, the Russians have surrounded them and cut off supply routes, the Ukrainian fightback is frustrating Putin’s plans. Meanwhile the towns and villages they have occupied, Russian soldiers face constant and angry opposition from residents. In the region around Kherson, a key strategic city captured at the start of the invasion, at least 400 people are said to have been arrested and whisked away to unknown locations. Dr Khurt says: “They were hoping to take Kyiv within as little as 36 hours. Now it’s increasingly clear it will be hard, if not impossible, to capture the whole of the capital. “The problem of whether attackers can actually control the territory you’ve conquered is always difficult - and this is a big issue for Russia, potentially getting bogged down in urban warfare.” Four out of 20 of Russia’s brigadier generals have died in three weeks on the battlefield in Ukraine. The latest, Major General Oleg Mityaev, who was killed this week in the besieged city of Mariupol, was in command of the 150th motorised rifle division, and had previously fought in Syria. Another nine senior Russian military figures have also reportedly died in the fighting, including the leader of the marine brigade and two air assault troop commanders. And in a fresh blow, state TV in Moscow today confirmed the death of one of Russia’s top paratroop commanders, Col Sergei Sukharev. The military leader, who was killed alongside his deputy, his among a number slain from the Kostroma regiment, seen as one of Russia’s most elite fighting forces. Losing so many of those who were leading Russians into battle is likely to both affect troop morale and the smooth running of the already chaotic war effort. Rita Konaev, of Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, believes Ukraine is likely to be targeting top-level Russian officers. “I don’t think this is an accident,” she said. “One is an accident, but this many is targeted.” At the same time, Putin is said to have sacked several other army generals as Moscow scrambles to change strategy after its attempted ‘shock and awe’ blitz fell flat. Investigative outlet Bellingcat reported yesterday that General Roman Gavrilov, the deputy head of the Russian National Guard, which is believed to have faced huge losses in Ukraine, has been detained by the secret services. Last week Oleksiy Danilov, head of Ukraine’s security council, said ‘around eight’ Russian commanders had been fired since the start of the conflict. A furious Putin last week placed Sergey Beseda, the head of the FSB’s foreign service, and his deputy, under house arrest after blaming them for intelligence failings in Ukraine. Putin is said to blame the agency, which he ran before becoming president, for intelligence given to him ahead of the invasion suggesting Ukraine was weak, riddled with neo-Nazi groups, and would give up easily if attacked. Philip Ingram, a security expert and former senior British intelligence officer, said Putin was obviously “very angry” and was blaming his intelligence agencies. He said: “He blames them for sending him the advice that led to the poor decision-making in Ukraine.” Experts have been astounded at Russia’s flawed intelligence, exposed on the first day of the invasion with Russia’s botched attempt to seize Kyiv’s Hostomel airport, when paratroopers flown in to take the airport were outnumbered by well-equipped Ukrainian special forces and quickly wiped out. Russia this week also admitted to losing its first GRU military intelligence spy in the war. Captain Alexey Glushchak, 31, from Tyumen in Siberia, died in the carnage in Ukrainian port Mariupol. “Due to the strict secrecy of the military operation, the circumstances of the death of Tyumen hero are not disclosed,” said a statement. However, the devastating attack on the Ukrainian military base where 35 people were killed during an airstrike shows that Russia’s network of spies are still active in the country. Ukrainian intelligence chiefs believe that an agent claiming to be an international volunteer had sent coordinates and information to Russia before the attack. At the same time, American military officials have reportedly confirmed that top Russian commanders are using mobile phones and cheap walkie-talkies to give orders to their troops in the field, leaving their messages wide open to being intercepted. In at least one case, this is said to have helped the Ukrainian army geolocate a top officer and take out him and his staff. With Western sanctions crippling Russian businesses and sparking a run on the banks, the ruble has lost nearly a quarter of its value in three weeks since the invasion began. Now, there are warnings that Russia could default on more than £30 billion in debt it borrowed in US dollars and Euros because it has been barred from trading in the foreign currencies. On Wednesday, Moscow’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov insisted the country had been able to settle an installment of nearly £90m due that same day. Analysts, however, fear that future deadlines may not be so easy to meet if its reserves run dry. Over the past few weeks, weekly inflation has soared by more than 2% per week, smashing past records and forcing ordinary people to shell out more for basics like food, toothpaste and even tampons. Shoppers have stripped shelves and rushed to get hold of sugar, rice and pasta. In more bad news for the Kremlin, the International Energy Agency has warned that the country’s oil exports could soon fall by as much as a third, with Western nations turning their back on its fuel. The UK, US, Canada and Australia have already banned Russian energy imports, slashing around 13% of its sales virtually overnight. Britain and a number of other nations have unleashed huge trade tariffs on hundreds of other Russian products, with Downing Street announcing a 30% tax hike for high-end vehicles, luxury goods and works of art worth a total of £900m. At the same time, the government has slapped a ban on exports of big name brands like Burberry and Land Rover, leaving glitzy stores in Moscow with empty showrooms. Putin himself has faced up to the fact the bloody war is taking its toll on the economy, telling anxious citizens that the country will need to “accept the new reality,” and admitting that things “won’t be easy” from now on. The outcry over the invasion that Russians were told for weeks was just “Western hysteria” has brought thousands out onto the streets to oppose the regime, with authorities launching a brutal crackdown on protestors. Human rights group OVD.info estimates 14,980 people have been arrested at demonstrations, and one recording leaked to the media appeared to show detainees being beaten by police. According to Dr Ian Garner, a historian and expert on Russian war propaganda, “young people are being increasingly sidelined by Putin - they’re losing the opportunities to travel abroad and live overseas - those are the people we see taking part in anti-war protests.” Top celebrities like TV hosts, actors and musicians have joined the calls for peace, with dozens leaving the country or facing being blacklisted over their opposition to the invasion. Top Bolshoi ballerina Olga Smirnova quit her role on Thursday saying “I never thought I’d be ashamed of Russia… but that was then and this is now.” Marina Ovsyannikova, a producer on state TV, was arrested after stepping in front of cameras earlier this week during a live broadcast with a sing saying “you are being lied to - stop the war.” According to Garner, despite the unease at home, the Kremlin is doubling down on its rhetoric. “We’re seeing some really aggressive, nationalist propaganda being put forward by the government.” For those willing to stand up to Putin, he warns, “a big repressive crackdown could be in the works - combining the sheer aggression of the Russian state and the willingness to murder innocent people. Russia is turning into the kind of place we haven’t seen since the start of the Stalin era.”",14,3.929240928475237,3.8136100242664703,0.11563090420876687,3

The heartbreaking images show rows and rows of empty prams of various colours, set out in the Rynok square in the historic western Ukrainian city under blue skies. Each one of the prams is empty and represents a child killed since February 24, and a family mourning their tragic loss. The eerie picture is a timely reminder of the human cost of the Kremlin's actions. The prams were put behind rails to keep them undisturbed and to allow passers-by to see them.

His words echoed Ukraine's calls for the west to turn the country's airspace into a no-fly zone. However, western leaders like Joe Biden have always said that they would never take such an action as it would likely lead to open war with Russia. As the invasion continues, an intelligence update from the British Ministry of Defence said that Russia had made ""minimal progress"" this week. The stuttering attack was reportedly initially planned by the Kremlin to be a 'lightning invasion', that would have seen them take the country in a matter of days and depose the standing government. Instead, Russia finds itself struggling to take the major cities and urban centres, while negotiating with the government it sought to depose. The display of prams is just one sign this week of Russia's barbarity. Experts have said that, after its failure to take the cities quickly, the Kremlin then turned to indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets. This week also saw a theatre in Mariupol that was sheltering around 1,300 civilians attacked. Serhiy Taruta, a Ukrainian politician, confirmed the atrocity and said hundreds remain unaccounted for. He added they cannot be evacuated because the rescue services in the city have been decimated by Russian forces. In a Facebook post, he wrote: ""No one understands.

Speaking on day 23 of the Russian invasion, the UK’s Chief of Defence Intelligence said the Kremlin had been “surprised by the scale and ferocity of Ukrainian resistance” and “bedevilled with problems of its own making”. General Jim Hockenhull said its tactics had changed and Moscow was “now pursuing a strategy of attrition”. He warned: “This will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. “This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis.” He also accused Putin of stepping up his propaganda war and deceiving Russians about troop deaths. Gen Hockenhull said: “Putin has reinforced his control over Russian domestic media. “The Kremlin is attempting to control the narrative, hide operational problems and obscure high Russian casualty numbers from the Russian people.” Boris Johnson today spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and promised more defensive weapons to the country, a day after the UK announced it will send anti-aircraft missiles to Poland. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister reiterated his disgust at Russia’s barbaric actions in Ukraine and his admiration for the steadfast resistance of the Ukrainian people in the face of tyranny. He said the entire United Kingdom stands with Ukraine. “The UK intends to provide and committed to work with allies at next week’s NATO meeting to step up military support to Ukraine. “They also discussed progress in ongoing peace talks. The Prime Minister offered his support for Ukraine’s position in negotiations and the President said the UK’s close involvement was highly valued. The UK will continue to exert pressure at all levels to oppose Putin’s act of aggression, including through sanctions, lethal aid and diplomatic action.” Russia has sustained heavy casualties so top brass are drafting in replacements, including from the “eastern military district” and mercenaries, according to a Western official. “They're looking at forces in the Pacific fleet, they are looking at Armenia, they are also looking at private military companies,” said the official. “We have seen reports of Chechen forces and Syrian mercenaries being recruited as well. “They are trying to make good those losses. “The challenge of course they will have is integrating those - that rather slightly odd mix of different groups and forming that into an effective fighting force. “They have struggled with the effectiveness of their force with their troops which they are training with, used to operating together. “Bringing just more people to the fight won’t necessarily provide a panacea to the problems they have been facing so far.” The official warned that cities could be subjected to weeks of pounding by Russian heavy guns. Moscow could mount an “artillery bombardment for a very, very considerable period of time”, depending on intensity and ammunition supplies, they said. The official added: “Those bombardments could be very intense. “The scale of artillery assets that have been made available to the forces on all of the strategic directions are really, really considerable. “There is also an awful lot of artillery in reserve across Russia.” However, attempts to encircle the capital Kyiv were being “frustrated” by Ukrainian resistance, they added.",14,4.915223732009709,4.720304513617966,0.19491921839174253,29
2022-03-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-kyiv-locals-woken-up-26503189,Why Putin's 'dogfood army' is NOT winning - lack of food and led by a paranoiac,"A Russian missile powered towards the heart of Kyiv before it was knocked out of the sky by a Ukrainian air defence rocket. The debris scissored to earth on the east bank of the Dnipro river, away from the centre of the city, blasting the top of a ten-storey apartment block, killing one person and injuring two, shattering windows in the whole neighbourhood, including a school, a local clinic and a kindergarten. Thankfully, most people were hiding in bunkers and survived. Maria, 33, and her little girl, Olga, four, were woken up by the explosion: “We felt it.” Maria pointed out a low building with very single window blown out: “That’s where Olga has her dancing classes.” But the most striking thing about the east bank was the absence of crumps and bangs. The Russian army has stopped moving forwards. Far from encircling the city, the eastern claw of Vladimir Putin ’s forces is weakening its grip. To the west, the Russians and the Ukrainians are locked in mortal combat, fighting for every street, every house. The difference is simple: the Ukrainians are fighting for their homes and their kids; the Russians are fighting for one man in a high castle. The killing continues in Kyiv and across the whole of Ukraine but the big picture is that Vladimir Putin’s dogfood army is not winning the war. I call it the dogfood army because, a while back, a Russian army officer was sacked because he complained his boys were being fed “prime quality beef” which was, in fact, dogfood relabelled. The Ukrainians have found abandoned Russian tanks equipped with food rations with “eat-by” dates from 2015. There are multiple videos of Russian soldiers scavenging for food in Ukraine. An army marches on its stomach. If it doesn’t eat, it doesn’t march. It’s not just the food. “Any army who doesn’t look after its dead is in trouble,” said Johnny Mercer, the Tory MP for Plymouth and, in a previous life, a British army commando, who passed through Kyiv last week. The litter of Russian dead has become a commonplace; the fact that the Russian soldiers don’t bother to pick up and bury their fallen comrades shows their morale is rock bottom. The second great weakness of the dogfood army is corruption. Michael Weiss, an American journalist who is writing a book on Russia ’s military intelligence service, the GRU, says: “there is mounting evidence that the Kremlin are fielding a Potemkin army. Their soldiers don’t want to fight. They’re abandoning tens of millions in kit. And there have been credible allegations of rampant corruption in the military with billions stolen by crooked officers.” The Russian army’s third great weakness is that its ultimate leader, Vladimir Putin, trusts no-one, like Stalin, not even himself. He was so paranoid about the army leaking his invasion plans that he told them two nights before D-Day. That meant that the generals have had to make it up as they were going along. The Ukrainians believe in their cause and are fighting like tigers. The dogfood army is hungry, scared, cheated by corrupt generals and led by a paranoiac who he sits at a table that screams the length of his fear. Don’t be surprised, then, that the Russian army is not moving forwards.",14,4.570155022387894,5.057837017274547,-0.4876819948866533,21
2022-03-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/fears-grow-1000-civilians-buried-26504739,"Fears for 1,000 people buried under Mariupol theatre reduced to rubble by bombs","Fears were growing tonight for more than 1,000 civilians thought buried under the rubble of a Ukrainian theatre reduced to rubble by Russia ’s bombs. The rescue effort has been severely hampered as most of the city of Mariupol’s emergency services have been destroyed and many of its doctors killed. Just a few more emerged today from the ruins – one with serious injuries – after Russia’s barbaric attack on Wednesday. As many as 1,300 people are thought to have been in the basement of the three-storey building and only around 130 have been able to get out so far. Local politician Serhiy Taruta warned hundreds of possible survivors will die because there is nobody to pull them out. He said: “No one understands. Services that are supposed to help have been demolished, rescue and utility services are destroyed. “A lot of doctors have been killed. This means survivors will either die under the ruins of the theatre, or have already died.” Human rights official Lyudmyla Denisova said there was still no information on the remaining civilians thought to be in the building. Today Russian troops renewed assaults on Ukraine ’s cities, shelling residential buildings and reducing infrastructure. The port city of Mariupol is now believed to be 90% destroyed. President Vladimir Putin ’s military launched 6am strikes as far west as Lviv, just 40 miles from the Polish border. Four strikes from cruise missiles from the Black Sea hit an aeroplane repair complex close to Lviv airport in the west, just five miles from the city, wounding one person. Two missiles fired at Lviv were blown out of the sky by air defence systems and huge smoke plumes billowed into the air near Lviv. The first refugees from Mariupol arrived in the city, where activists today lined up 109 prams to highlight the number of children killed so far in the invasion. Yulia Yashenko, 28, said: “The city is being wiped off the face of the earth. Our house was burned by artillery. They fire everything at the city, every weapon is used. “There is black smoke everywhere. There are bodies everywhere and there is nobody to collect them. It is only fate that we are alive. We could have been killed any time. “People took us in their car out of the city on the green corridor [humanitarian corridor]. It should not be like this. Tell the world what is happening.” Air raid warnings blared in Ivano-Frankivsk, 80 miles south of Lviv, but no attack came. Ukrainian ballet star Artyom Datishin, 43, died having fought for his life for almost three weeks in hospital after being shelled by Russia in Kyiv in the opening days of the invasion. Artillery strikes hit a residential building in north Kyiv, killing at least one person. Two were killed in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. And 21 people died near the north-east city of Kharkiv when Russian shelling destroyed a school and a community centre on Thursday. At least 45 people died in missile strikes on a Ukrainian military base in Mykolaiv. But the toll on Russia’s forces has been enormous – with as many as 30,000 troops taken out of action, either having been killed, injured or taken prisoner. Moscow’s special forces 2nd Spetsnaz Brigade unit 64044 has lost 30 troops and suffered 80 injured, whilst a further 50 are missing in action. Ukraine believes 14,300 Russian troops have been killed since the invasion started. As many as 450 Russian tanks have been blown up, 93 warplanes shot down and 112 helicopters destroyed, whilst 1,448 armoured personnel carriers have been knocked out. Chief of Defence Intelligence, Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull, said Putin had adopted a new strategy to counter Ukrainian resilience. He said: “Russia is now pursuing a strategy of attrition. This will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure, and intensify the humanitarian crisis. “Putin has reinforced his control over Russian domestic media to control the narrative, hide operational problems and obscure high Russian casualty numbers from the people.”",17,3.9160892518512953,4.78517361144979,-0.8690843595984945,24
2022-03-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-become-neutral-peace-talks-26491297,All the signs of progress from Russia and Ukraine war peace talks ,"Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are ongoing as the two countries look to an end to the suffering caused by war. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had major consequences for millions of people and, while peace is vital for people in Ukraine, talks of Ukrainian neutrality have become a difficult point. As a result of Vladimir Putin's orders, the war in Ukraine has caused devastation in major cities like Kyiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv. Millions have already fled their homes, heading west towards uncertainty and seeking refuge in surrounding countries such as Poland and Romania. According to the Financial Times, a 15-point plan to end the fighting has been drawn up but there are some sticking points. So will peace talks bring about any successful changes and is Ukraine any closer to an agreement that will bring an end to the devastating shelling? Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are continuing, with hopes that a deal may be reached soon. The Financial Times is reporting that an end to the fighting could involve a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Russian troops, Ukraine agreeing to accept neutrality and a restricted armed force. This means that Ukraine would not join NATO. It is also reported that the territories annexed by Russia in 2014 could be a major difficulty in talks between the two Russia, though admitting that the invasion was not conducted as quickly as they would have liked, continue to insist that it is going to plan. Putin said the operation is going ""successfully, in strict accordance with pre-approved plans"". The current understanding is that Ukraine is unlikely to become neutral, even as talks continue, as the country will see the recent invasion as obvious evidence that it should be able to protect itself from invading troops. As long as Putin remains in power, the idea followed by him and members of the Kremlin that Ukraine should be part of Russia will not change. This, used partly as Putin's pretext for the invasion, means that Ukraine may always view the threat of another Russian invasion as a possibility. Head of the Russian delegation Vladimir Medinsky proposed an idea that Ukraine would be allowed an army, but would not be a member of NATO, like Sweden and Austria. Mykhailo Podolyak, senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, rejected the idea of Ukrainian neutrality on March 16, 2022. He said: ""Ukraine has never been a militaristic state that attacks or plans to attack its neighbours...That is why today Ukraine wants to have a really strong pool of allies with clearly defined security guarantees."" Neutrality would mean, according to reports, that foreign military bases or weapons would not be allowed into the country. Before the invasion, Ukraine was a partner of NATO, meaning that it may have become a member state one day. Russia was opposed to another NATO state being on its border and was also against Ukraine joining the European Union (EU). While the idea of not joining NATO may still tempt Ukraine in a bid for peace, the idea of neutrality in the wake of destroyed Ukrainian cities may not seem a good idea.",29,5.207132325767635,5.59328774338409,-0.38615541761645567,15
2022-03-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russias-most-barbaric-war-crimes-26490300,Russia's most barbaric war crimes - from theatre bombing to bread queue massacre,"As horrific scenes continue to come from the war-torn cities across Ukraine, world leaders have condemned Vladimir Putin's actions as war crimes. Horrific scenes of bombed out buildings and street fighting have been played out in recent days in the southern city of Mariupol - while a convoy of Russian vehicles continues its approach to Kyiv. Reports of the use of thermobaric vacuum weapons - which before detonating the cloud in a huge fireball that sucks up all the oxygen in the area - have emerged from the war zone. Discussions are already underway about whether Russian president Vladimir Putin has committed war crimes. Here we take a look at Putin's horrific attacks on civilians and alleged war crimes across Ukraine Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Last week Russian forces bombed a children's and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Horrific images showed pregnant women wading through masses of debris and rubble, while others were carried out on stretchers by rescue workers. At least 17 people were injured in the attack, and this week it was tragically confirmed a mum-to-be and her baby had died. She is believed to have died from crushing injuries to her pelvis. President Zelensky once again called out Russian atrocities as they continue a barbaric campaign targeting civilians and the vulnerable left in warn-torn Ukraine. He said: ""Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity."" The clip shows one building totally destroyed and another badly damaged as wounded patients swiftly evacuate. Children are reportedly buried under rubble after the Russian airstrike but it was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. The world condemned the horrific attack, with Boris Johnson calling it ""depraved"" - as the Vatican even commented saying there was no excuse for such an attack. A drama theatre where hundreds of terrified Ukrainians were sheltering from Russian forces was razed to the ground in an airstrike, it has been reported. Desperate Ukrainians painted the word ""children"" outside a theatre in a hopeful yet futile attempt to deter a Russian attack. The large letters spelling out the Russian script warning came before forces went on to drop a powerful bomb on the theatre that was being used as a shelter for families in Mariupol, Ukraine. The city council said it's ""impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act"" and that efforts were underway to find the identities of the victims - and just how many innocent Ukrainians were slaughtered. They confirmed the central part of the venue was completely destroyed, as was the entrance to an area being used as a bomb shelter. The statement went on: ""It is impossible to find words that could describe the level of cruelty and cynicism with which the Russian occupiers are destroying the civilian population of the Ukrainian city by the sea. ""Women, children, and the elderly remain in the enemy's sights. ""These are completely unarmed peaceful people. ""It is obvious that the only goal of the Russian army is the genocide of the Ukrainian people."" Thirteen Ukrainian shoppers queuing for bread were executed in cold-blood yesterday in the latest horror committed by Russian troops. Shocking claims by America accused the soldiers of shooting people as they queued for bread in the embattled northern city of Chernihiv. It was originally reported that ten people had died but the death toll has since risen. There are growing fears the faltering Russian advance, beset by shocking troop and equipment losses, has led to soldiers picking out innocent civilians. Even before midday yesterday, three bombers were shot down as it emerged 13,800 Russian troops had died in just 21 days of fighting. Within hours a Russian helicopter was blown out of the sky. US embassy officials tweeted: “Today, Russian forces shot dead and killed ten people standing in line for bread in Chernihiv. “Such horrific attacks must stop. We are considering all available options to ensure accountability for any atrocity crimes in Ukraine.” Russian forces have also been accused of blocking humanitarian corridors established to help civilians reach safety. However, after establishing a ceasefire last week to allow for humanitarian rescue vehicles to reach and remove civilians, Russian forces were accused of breaking an agreement to launch an attack. The Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook : ""The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor."" Ukrainian officials went on to say the Russian army ""did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city of Mariupol."" Mariupol city mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said Russian forces continued to bombard areas densely populated by civilians as an estimated 200,000 people tried to flee. Ukraine ’s human rights monitor said Russia used thermobaric and phosphorous bombs. In the first week of the invasion, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova said the Kremlin had used the devastating thermobaric bomb - which is banned by the Geneva convention - during air strikes. The high-power thermobaric weapons vaporise bodies and crush internal organs. They use the atmosphere itself as part of the explosion and are among the most powerful non-nuclear weapons ever developed. Oleksi Biloshytsky, chief of Popasna police, whose town is 60 miles west of Luhansky city, said over the weekend Russian forces used a phosphorous bomb weapon in his area. Using an amalgamation of the words ‘Russian forces’ and ‘fascist’ he said: “It’s what the Nazi called a “flaming onion” and that’s what the Russcists are dropping on our towns. “Indescribable suffering and fires.” A regional governor said Russian soldiers were holding patients and doctors hostage at a Mariupol hospital. Parents have also been forced to leave premature babies in a hospital in the Ukrainian city with around 350,000 people trapped with food and water running out, say reports. He also claimed that around 400 local residents and 100 staff had been rounded up as human shields and are being kept at the hospital in what he called “crimes against humanity”. ""It's impossible to get out of the hospital,"" Mr Kyrylenko wrote in a Telegram post. ""They're shooting hard, we sit in the basement."" He continued: ""Cars can't drive to the hospital for two days already. High-rise buildings are burning around. Russians drove 400 people from neighbouring houses into our hospital. We can't get out."" In hospital three in Mariupol there are premature babies without parents who have been forced to leave, it is reported.",17,5.76257994667603,5.1107715959628734,0.6518083507131562,0

President Vladimir Putin has lied to his citizens telling them the invasion of Ukraine is a special operation to rid the country of neo-Nazism. But the prisoners of war who spoke to American broadcaster CNN said Putin had given orders for troops to commit crimes in Ukraine. CNN has reported that an officer and fighter-bomber pilot revealed there had deep disquiet about their mission and the suffering of Ukrainian civilians among the Russian serviceman. When asked what he thought of Putin's claims that Ukraine was run by neo-Nazi, he replied: ""I think it was invented as a pretext and is something that the world cannot understand. ""But Putin and his circle need this in order to achieve their own objectives. ""One such step was that it would be beneficial for them to spread disinformation about fascism and Nazism. ""We didn't see any Nazis or fascists. ""Russians and Ukrainians can communicate in the same language, so we see the good in these people. ""It's hard to give a direct assessment of his actions. But, at the bare minimum, judging by the consequences of his orders, he is incorrect."" The professional serviceman then became emotional, CNN reports, and spoke about the suffering inflicted on civilians since the invasion. He said: ""It's not just about demilitarising Ukraine or the defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but now cities of peaceful civilians are being destroyed. ""Even, I don't know, what can justify, f**k, the tears of a child, or even worse, the deaths of innocent people, children."" He added that the troops were aware of what had happened in places like Mariupol, where nearly 1,600 people have been killed since the invasion began. He added: ""It was a horrifying fact, not just because it is a crime. It's vandalism. ""You cannot forgive such things. To bomb a maternity ward? It's the most perverse f**king form of neo-Nazism, neo-fascism. ""Who could think of such a thing?"" CNN say the men who are being held captive by the Ukrainians, but added that they had been treated acceptably, been offered food and drink, and medical treatment. In order to protect the prisoner of war's identity his full name was not used in any of the CNN reports. The broadcaster added that they requested access to speak with the prisoners with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry and they spoke to the three men following a press conference in Kyiv on Friday. CNN added that they were the only journalists in the room when the pilot made this remarks. They added: ""At no time did Ukrainian Security Services, who were in the room throughout, interject or direct CNN or the prisoners to ask or answer specific questions. ""The interview was conducted in Russian. ""The prisoners were not handcuffed, and while they didn't move from their seats, seemed to be under no physical restraint.""",13,5.176156416275266,4.073069792786899,1.103086623488367,21

Major Viktor Blyudin, was leading a group of Russian forces in the forest near Sribne, Chernihiv, when they were captured. They then said they never wanted to invade Ukraine or embark on a war, reports the Daily Star. Other Russian fighters can be heard obeying their Ukrainian captors after being ordered to say ""Putin is a d**khead"" and ''Death to Russia."" Dressed in military clothing and and a black hat, one captive added: ""I really love [my wife] and I hope that she will forgive me for coming here."" He described the Russian government as ""scumbags."" A soldier calling himself Anton Nikulkov, sent a message to his wife and children ""Don't worry, I'm fine, everything's going to be okay. Putin is a d**khead."" But he was ordered to scream the insult louder and added: ""Glory to Ukraine. Death to Russia."" Another soldier full of remorse and calling himself Dmitry Kamyanikov begged for forgiveness from Ukrainians. He said: ""I stand in front of them guilty, I didn't want to go to war here. I haven't killed anybody, I swear. I'm asking for your forgiveness for coming here."" The prisoner then told his Russian comrades to ""resign from your army posts and get out of here."" Major Blyudin, who was in charge of the six men captured was reluctant to being quizzed, but he did join them in the insults. The soldiers allegedly deny coming to Ukraine for war as they claimed to be in the area 'to learn and observe.' The captured men, who are considered prisoners of war, insisted they had not fired on any Ukrainians. But a Sribnyanshchyna newspaper suggested this may be a tactic to avoid being punished or killed. The reports of the soldiers' remarks came after President Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces have captured around 1,000 troops who are being held. The Ukrainian leader said: ""We have already almost 1,000 prisoners and their video testimonies"". He added that he is looking forward to working with the International Criminal Court to ensure 'those who invaded our territory for nothing are punished'. The Mirror yesterday told how a Ukraine TV channel had been hacked when it apparently broadcast a fake statement claiming to be from president Volodymyr Zelensky calling on people to surrender. The cyber attack happened on Ukraine 24's webstream and and reportedly was a statement address claiming to be from Zelensky. In it said he was ""capitulating"" and would surrendered and ""give up arms"", leading to outrage and alarm online. But the president himself quickly released a video slamming the fake address and saying it was not him. In it, he said he never made any such statement and promised “the only ones who should give up arms are Russian soldiers”.",13,5.77947190318917,4.820440499341593,0.9590314038475771,21
2022-03-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/defence-secretary-blasts-russian-dirty-26494638,Defence Secretary blasts Russian 'dirty tricks' after call from fake Ukraine PM,"Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said an imposter called him up pretending to be the Ukrainian Prime Minister and asked several ""misleading questions"". The top Tory blasted the move as a ""desperate attempt"" by Russia to divert attention away from its brutal invasion of Ukraine in what appeared to be a security breach. It was not clear how an imposter was able to reach the Defence Secretary, who travelled to Poland on Thursday for talks on the Ukraine conflict. Mr Wallace has ordered an immediate inquiry to find out how the impostor was able to speak to him. He tweeted: ""Today an attempt was made by an imposter claiming to be Ukrainian PM to speak with me. ""He posed several misleading questions and after becoming suspicious I terminated the call. ""No amount of Russian disinformation, distortion and dirty tricks can distract from Russia's human rights abuses and illegal invasion of Ukraine. A desperate attempt."" The video call was set up after an email, purportedly sent from an aide at the Ukrainian embassy, was sent to a government department and then forwarded to the Ministry of Defence. Mr Wallace was put through on Teams to the ""PM of Ukraine"", who was posing with the country's flag behind him. After initial introductions and thanks for the UK's support, Mr Wallace is understood to have became suspicious as the man started asking questions about British policy and eventually urged the Defence Secretary to shout slogans. The level of sophistication involved in the hoax has convinced Government sources that it was a Russian plot. Senior Ministry of Defence sources fear Moscow may attempt to splice together Mr Wallace's comments in an attempt to embarrass him. Russian pranksters duped the-then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson into discussing the UK's relationship with Moscow back in 2018 by pretending to be the Armenian Prime Minister. It comes as Mr Wallace travelled to Warsaw on Thursday, where he announced that the UK would deploy a medium-range missile system and 100 personnel to Poland to ""protect her airspace from any further aggression by Russia"". Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to “pulverise” Ukrainian cities after getting “bogged down” and meeting “fierce” resistance, Western officials warned. Kremlin troops were “making little bits of progress here and there, but they are not achieving a strategic breakthrough at any point”, they said. Vladimir Putin 's invaders have “taken substantial casualties” and a death toll of 7,000 was “not an implausible estimate”. Military top brass have ordered reservists from “some quite peripheral places around Russia and its borders, which clearly was not part of the original plan”, they added. The redeployments “demonstrate the extent to which Russia has got bogged down”, with morale among its soldiers “very, very low”. Kremlin warplanes have still failed to win the aerial battle with Ukraine’s air force, with the skies “heavily contested” and Moscow fighter planes moving with “considerable caution” to dodge air defences. An official said: “It’s clearly not going the way Russia planned it.” Warning of an intensification of artillery strikes on major population centres, they went on: “The Russian strategy appears to be to bombard city centres to try and pulverise the resistance within them and to encircle them wherever possible. “I would expect that to continue.” Kremlin military planners may be unsure of whether to launch a full attack on the capital, Kyiv, it is understood. “I think there is a question now as to whether Moscow intends to assault Kyiv or not,” one official said. “To do so, with or without bombardment, would be very costly for Russia.” They added: “An ill-judged ground assault on a city as well prepared as Kyiv, with really determined and committed defenders would be a very costly business. “There comes a point where even Russia has to count the cost of casualties.”",14,5.548639509494102,4.710742909707011,0.8378965997870909,28
2022-03-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-ukraines-city-hell-lost-26496314,Inside Ukraine's city of hell where lost children buried in mass grave,"The bodies of the children all lie here, dumped into a narrow trench hastily dug into the frozen earth of Mariupol to the constant drumbeat of shelling. There is 18-month-old Kirill killed by shrapnel to the head, 16-year-old Iliya blown up playing football at a school field, and a girl no older than six in unicorn pyjamas who was among the first of the children to die. They are stacked together with dozens of others in this mass grave on the outskirts of the city. A man covered in blue tarp, weighed down by stones at the ­crumbling kerb. A woman wrapped in a red and gold bedsheet, her legs bound at the ankles with white fabric. Workers dispose of the bodies as fast as they can, because the less time they spend in the open, the better their chances of survival. “The only thing [I want] is for this to be finished,” said Volodymyr Bykovskyi, pulling body bags from a truck. “Damn them all, those people who started this.” More bodies will come, from the streets, from the hospital basement. The youngest still has an umbilical cord attached. Airstrikes and shells relentlessly pound Mariupol about one a minute. This southern seaport of 430,000 has become a symbol of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s drive to crush Ukraine but also of a fierce resistance. The city is now encircled by Russian soldiers, who are slowly squeezing the life out of it, one blast at a time. Several appeals for humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians went unheeded, until Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that about 30,000 people had fled in convoys of cars. Air strikes and shells have hit the maternity hospital, the fire department, homes, a church, a field outside a school, and now a theatre sheltering women and children. For the estimated hundreds of thousands who remain, there is quite simply nowhere to go. The surrounding roads are mined and the port blocked. Food is running out, and the Russians have stopped humanitarian attempts to bring it in. Electricity is mostly gone and water is sparse, with residents melting snow to drink. Some parents have even left their newborns at the hospital, perhaps hoping to give them a chance at life in the one place with decent electricity and water. People burn scraps of furniture in makeshift grills to warm their hands in the freezing cold and cook what little food there still is. The grills themselves are built with the one thing in plentiful supply: bricks and shards of metal scattered in the streets from destroyed buildings. Death is everywhere. Local officials have tallied more than 2,500 deaths in the siege, but many bodies cannot be counted because of the endless shelling. They have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because it is too dangerous to hold funerals. Doctors say they are treating 10 civilians for every injured Ukrainian soldier. “They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week. Just weeks ago, Mariupol’s future seemed much brighter. If geography drives a city’s destiny, Mariupol was on the path to success, with its thriving iron and steel plants, a deep-water port and high global demand for both. Even the dark weeks of 2014, when the city nearly fell to Russia-backed separatists in vicious street battles, were fading into memory. But that same geography turned against it. The city stands squarely between regions controlled by the Russia -backed separatists - about six miles to the east at the closest point - and the Crimean Peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. The capture of Mariupol would give the Russians a clear land corridor all the way through, controlling the Sea of Azov. Two weeks into the fighting, the sound of Russian fighter jets was enough to send people screaming for cover. On March 9, the jets decimated the maternity hospital. The pictures of the devestation shocked the world. Rescuers rushed a pregnant woman through the rubble and light snow as she stroked her bloodied belly, face blanched and head lolling listlessly to the side. Her baby was dying inside her, and she knew it, medics said. “Kill me now!” she screamed, as they struggled to save her life at another hospital even closer to the front line. The baby was born dead. Half-an-hour later, the mother died too. The doctors had no time to learn either of their names. Another pregnant woman, Mariana Vishegirskaya, was waiting to give birth at the maternity hospital when the strike hit. Her brow and cheek bloodied, she clutched her belongings in a plastic bag and navigated the debris-strewn stairs in polka-dot pyjamas. Outside the ruined hospital, she stared motionless with wide blue eyes at the crackling flames. Beauty blogger Ms Vishegirskaya delivered her child the next day to the sound of shellfire. Baby Veronika drew her first breath on March 10. The two women - one dead and one a mother - have since become the symbol of their blackened, burning home town. Facing worldwide condemnation, Russian officials claimed that the maternity hospital had been taken over by far-right Ukrainian forces to use as a base and emptied of patients and nurses. Two days after Veronika was born, four Russian tanks emblazoned with the letter Z took up position near the hospital where she and her mother were recovering. A group of medical workers came under sniper fire, with one hit in the hip. The windows rattled, and the hallways were lined with people with nowhere else to go. Anastasia Erashova wept and trembled as she held a sleeping child. Shelling had just killed her other child as well as her brother’s child, and Ms Erashova’s scalp was encrusted with blood. “I don’t know where to run to,” she cried out, her anguish growing with every sob. “Who will bring back our children? Who?” By early this week, Russian forces had seized control of the building entirely, trapping medics and patients inside and using it as a base, according to a doctor there and local officials. Mr Orlov, the deputy mayor, predicted worse is soon to come. Most of the city remains trapped. “Our defenders will defend to the last bullet,” he said. “But people are dying without water and food, and I think in the next several days we will count hundreds and thousands of deaths.”",17,5.270586973636556,4.67729465944424,0.5932923141923157,9

A former senior officer spoke about chilling scenario in which Putin's regime captured NATO countries Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. It comes as thousands of NATO troops take part in military exercises near the Russian border. The three Baltic states joined NATO following the break up of the Soviet Union - with fears Putin has plans to destabilise the states and takeover, as he has done in Ukraine. Colonel Igor Korotchenko, formerly of the Russian General Staff and air force and currently a reserve officer said: “This is how the scenario for capturing the Baltic countries might look."" ""Referring to a map, he added: ""A massive Russian radio-electronic strike is inflicted"" - causing ""all Nato radars go blind and see nothing"". Drawing on the map, Korotchenko then turns to how Russia will overpower its foes. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine?

He continues to explain that the “entire Baltic sea” would then be under target from Russia. Britain has warned Vladimir Putin that if a ""single toecap"" of a Russian solider steps into NATO territory ""then it would be war"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the West had been clear over the response to any aggression on its territory following a bombing near the border with Poland. The Yavoriv military base was targeted in a deadly barrage of missiles on Sunday, only a few miles from the Polish border. People were woken by sirens before the “skies turned red” as missiles landed, killing 35 and leaving 134 wounded. Mr Javid condemned the attack and warned Putin that he could face war with 30 NATO countries if he moved onto their territory. ""If just a single toecap of a Russian soldier steps into NATO territory then it would be war with NATO,"" he told Sky News. In another interview he said ""it's not impossible"" that Russia would launch an attack on Nato territory but he thinks it is ""very unlikely"". The UK and other NATO countries have so far resisted sending troops into Ukraine amid fears it could cause a dramatic escalation in the conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.",29,5.3655684225905125,4.497240872556864,0.8683275500336487,10

Lesia Vasylenko said joining the alliance was ""a course that we have decided to take and proscribed it specifically in our constitution"". Meanwhile, the Kremlin said negotiators were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, both members of the European Union that are outside the NATO military alliance. Ukraine's chief negotiator said Kyiv was still demanding a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, with guarantees. But Zelensky has said Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join NATO. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here That prospect has been one of Russia's primary concerns. ""Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. ""There are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement."" Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's chief negotiator, told state TV: ""Ukraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral demilitarised state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the idea ""could really be seen as a compromise"". Austria and Sweden, the biggest of six EU members outside NATO, both have small militaries that cooperate with the alliance. Yet Vasylenko, a member of Ukraine's Holos party, told ITV's Peston programme: ""Joining Nato for Ukraine, it's a course that we have decided to take and proscribed it specifically in our constitution. ""So it would be very difficult to give that course up, that would mean changes to the constitution. ""Today, as the escalation of Russia's aggression grows against Ukraine, the support for Nato grows with it."" Earlier, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We've made it clear to Putin that there is no way Ukraine is going to join NATO any time soon."" Addressing Johnson and representatives from Baltic and northern European countries gathered on Tuesday in London, Zelensky expressed his frustration that Ukraine had not been allowed to join NATO, but said: ""This is the truth and we have simply to accept it as it is."" But asked about the comments as well as the prospect of dropping the demand in order to agree a ceasefire, Ms Vasylenko said: ""I actually think that was taken out of context by many of the Western media. ""What President Zelensky actually said today during his speech in Congress and during the many meetings that he was having is that Ukraine calls for a coalition of responsible leaders of the free world, and that coalition, he called it the 'U24.' ""Basically the Ukraine 24, of the countries who would be prepared to stand up to Putin and free the world, and Ukraine, from Putin's aggression in 24 hours."" She said she did not trust the Russian negotiators to keep their side of the deal in any agreement. The Financial Times reported that a draft proposal for a peace plan included promises for Ukraine not to seek to join NATO or to host foreign military bases. Zelensky, since addressing the London summit, has suggested peace talks between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations had started to produce hope of a ceasefire. In his nightly video address to the nation early on Wednesday, the president said Russia's demands were becoming ""more realistic"". Johnson said decisions about the future of the country had to ""be for the Ukrainian people"" and their ""elected leader"" to make, as he vowed Britain would continue to ""back"" Zelensky.",29,4.846195634334234,7.1262683744697854,-2.2800727401355516,15

Authorities in besieged Mariupol announced that a theatre in the ""heart"" of the city, which had become a sanctuary for hundreds of civilians, was hit by Russian bombs this afternoon. The city council said it's ""impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act"" and that efforts were underway to find the identities of the victims - and just how many innocent Ukrainians were slaughtered. They confirmed the central part of the venue was completely destroyed, as was the entrance to an area being used as a bomb shelter.

Horrific scenes of bombed out buildings and street fighting have been played out in recent days as the Russian army shells the city and the Ukrainian residents are ready to battle to the death to keep them out. Desperate attempts have been made to evacuate the city as part of a humanitarian corridor but there remain about 350,000 people still inside Mariupol with resources dwindling. And with the fighting raging, people have been unable to leave hospital, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Ukrainian military in the Donetsk region. He also claimed that around 400 local residents and 100 staff had been rounded up as human shields and are being kept at the hospital in what he called “crimes against humanity”.

Shocking claims by America accused the soldiers of shooting people as they queued for bread in the embattled northern city of Chernihiv. It was originally reported that ten people had died but the death toll has since risen. There are growing fears the faltering Russian advance, beset by shocking troop and equipment losses, has led to soldiers picking out innocent civilians. Even before midday yesterday (Weds) three bombers were shot down as it emerged 13,800 Russian troops had died in just 21 days of fighting. Within hours a Russian helicopter was blown out of the sky. US embassy officials tweeted: “Today, Russian forces shot dead and killed ten people standing in line for bread in Chernihiv. “Such horrific attacks must stop.

On day 21 of Moscow’s barbaric invasion footage emerged of a group of Russians executing a civilian man who was was surrendering. The March 7 film has only just emerged and shows a silver car driving on the E40 expressway west of Kyiv. As he approaches Kyiv the driver sees a Russian tank and a group of soldiers. He gets out of the car with his hands up before they gun him down, executing him. They then grab his dead body and drag him into trees nearby. A woman and a child also travelling in the car were taken captive. Putin’s invasion force is losing almost a battalion of troops every two days as Ukraine puts up a ferocious defence of its cities. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog As well as huge troop losses Moscow has suffered 430 tanks blown up and yesterday the three bombers were blown out of the skies by midday - two above Odesa and one flying above Chernihiv. The shooting down of three SU-25 bombers means Vladimir Putin’s military has now lost 87 warplanes to Ukraine’s devastating air defences. As many as 1375 armoured vehicles have been blasted and 109 of Russia’s helicopters have been destroyed. The Russian Ka-52 military helicopter was shot down near Mykolaiv yesterday. Ukraine says Putin’s military has lost around 40% of its operational capability - based on a combination of the appalling troop toll and loss of war machinery. But Russian commanders will reinforce numbers by releasing early cadets studying in higher military educational institutions to send them to the Ukraine frontline. Overnight on Wednesday Kyiv special forces had counter-attacked against Russian troops, driving them back 15 miles west of the capital. Plummeting morale among Russian troops has led to hundreds being captured or surrendering to Ukraine’s troops. More than 1,000 have been captured. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency intercepted phone calls from one of Moscow’s troops complaining he and his comrades has no more food, water, fuel or ammunition. Putin’s bloody invasion has been battered by logistical problems - its armoured columns cut off from supply lines as Ukraine’s forces ambushed fuel and supply trucks. A massive security clamp down and curfew throughout Kyiv has limited the ability of Russian spies and Spetsnaz commandos to trigger sabotage attacks. One Russian agent was detained in Kyiv after being seized with pictures he had taken on his phone of critical infrastructure targets. It is believed Kyiv officials had ordered the special operation to protect a vital supply route into the city from western Ukraine. Kyiv regional leader, Oleksiy Kuleba, said Russian forces had intensified fighting in the suburbs and a highway leading west, and across the capital region, “kindergartens, museums, churches, residential blocks and engineering infrastructure are suffering from the endless firing”. But despite Russia’s losses Ukraine is still reeling from horrific suffering of its civilians, who continue to be killed in cold blood by Putin’s military. And the relentless shelling continued, with smoke rising from Kyiv from multiple artillery strikes leaving residential apartment blocks burning. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky went before the US Congress via video and, invoking Pearl Harbour and 9/11, pleaded with America for more weapons and tougher sanctions against Russia, saying: “We need you right now.” In the eastern Kharkiv alone as many as 500 have died, although that figure is likely to double and the horrific toll on children is rising. Ukraine’s second city, just 20 miles from the Russian border, suffered over 50 artillery shells overnight until Wednesday morning. By day 21 of Putin’s barbaric war Ukraine’s Prosecutor General said 103 children have now been killed with many more than 100 injured. Thousands of civilians have been killed and the State Prosecutor’s office is working round the clock to collate details of alleged war crimes by Russian forces. Air-raid sirens sounded throughout eastern and central cities, including Kyiv, which was again hit by a number of suspected cruise missiles. A huge fire burned in Mariupol from near-constant Russian bombing - as America was understood to be preparing to transfer a new anti-aircraft missile system to Ukraine. More than 20,000 civlians were able to flee Mariupol in the biggest evacuation yet from the besieged port. They fled in 4,000 vehicles of which 570 have reached relative safety. The Red Cross has helped evacuate civilians from besieged areas and has delivered 200 tonnes of aid, including medical supplies, blankets, water and more than 5,200 body bags. Nowhere has suffered more than Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov. Local officials say missile strikes and shelling have killed more than 2,300 people. Bodies have been buried in trenches, and more corpses lie in the streets and in a hospital basement. With humanitarian aid unable to get in amid the constant bombardment, people burn scraps of furniture to warm their hands and cook the little food still available. In Ivano Frankivsk in the west sirens blared in the early hours of Wednesday, although the city through which many frontline supplies are transported was not hit. Since the beginning of the invasion, Russia has completely or partially destroyed 3,500 infrastructure facilities in Ukraine, said Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky. Among them - 230 objects of transport infrastructure and 165 objects of life support of the population, such as electric substations and gas pipelines. A staggering 72 educational institutions and 21 health care institutions were also destroyed. Ukraine’s Health Ministry said 43 ambulance has been fired upon by Russian troops since the start of the invasion and 117 hospitals have been hit by shells - seven of them demolished.",17,4.275584467667851,3.6325370565565467,0.6430474111113047,24

Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, said his forces also stopped the attack in Irpin. ""The night was quite difficult, but in general we can say that the Ukrainian army counterattacked near Kyiv,” he said. Fighting has been reported on the southwest side of Kyiv, today, as fears rise that a full-scale assault on the Ukrainian capital could be on the horizon. There are fears Putin could launch similar airstrikes as he did on the city of Mariupol and Kharkiv. In Mariupol, a maternity hospital was hit and killed three, including a six-year-old girl. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is still in Kyiv, today said his ""heart breaks at what the occupants have done with our cities, our country, and at what they want to do to our people"", who he said needed ""urgent help"". Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said today that the capital has been turned into a fortress ahead of the Russian assault. He said in televised remarks: ""Every street, every house is being fortified, the territorial defence is joining. ""Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands."" Troops are warning civilians not to stray beyond the outskirts of the city because Russian vehicles had been spotted just a few miles away. If Putin's troops encircle Kyiv, they could shell it as they have done to Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Ukrainian officials say Mariupol continues to be surrounded by Russian forces but is still in Ukrainian control. They said Ukrainian fighter jets and anti-aircraft missile units destroyed four Russian Su-25 attack jets and two Russian helicopters over the past 2 days. It comes as chilling photos from Mariupol showed corpses being discarded in mass grave sites as the death toll in the city grows. This week it was revealed more than 1,200 people have died in the port city, formerly the home of nearly half a million people, since the start of the Russian invasion. Described by rescuers as a humanitarian crisis, authorities have ordered workers to dig 25 metre long trenches as morgues are at breaking point. In tragic scenes, they were seen making the sign of the cross as the dead- wrapped in an old carpet- are pushed into the makeshift mass graves. Forty bodies were dumped in the trench in the cemetery on Tuesday, followed by 30 more on Wednesday.

Putin said on Wednesday that the West would not succeed in what he called its attempt to achieve global dominance and dismember Russia. If the West thinks that Russia will step back, it does not understand Russia, Putin said on the 21st day of the war against Ukraine. He claimed that keeping Russia in check was a long-term policy of the West, and that its economic sanctions against Russia were short-sighted. The Russian President said Western countries wanted to hit every Russian family with the sanctions, and accused them of engaging in an unprecedented information campaign against Russia. Putin said the West had effectively declared Russia in default as part of its sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, and that the conflict had merely been a pretext for the West to impose sanctions. ""The West doesn't even bother to hide the fact that its aim is to damage the entire Russian economy, every Russian,"" he said. Putin's defiance comes as ordinary Russians panic buy and scramble for basic goods such as sugar. Shoppers in a Perekryostok store in the north of the capital scrapped for ordinary items that have nearly run out because of Western sanctions. Anna, a local resident who filmed the noisy scuffle, told Podyom media that people behaved aggressively because they have been scared by the empty shelves. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. They fear a potentially grave economic crisis triggered by the punishing sanctions which have seen the rouble currency plunge in value. Anna said: “There were empty shelves - no salt, no sugar, no pasta, no buckwheat, and only expensive rice. “People suddenly saw a cart with sugar and ran towards it. “They attacked this cart, pushing each other away aggressively. “They were grabbing as much as possible for themselves, not leaving sugar for the others. “I wanted to share the horror of it. We must stay human.” This comes as Russia's invasion into Ukraine comes to the end of its third week. In that time, despite initial reports Moscow planned a lightning invasion that would see it take the capital in a matter of days, the Kremlin's forces have run into a number of issues and find most cities still under Ukrainian control. Instead of deposing Volodymyr Zelensky's government, Putin finds his acolytes negotiating with them. This morning, Britain's Ministry of Defence released an intelligence update, on the ongoing invasion and Russia's continued struggles. In the statement released on Twitter, they said: “Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain. “They have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvres. “The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia’s advance. “Russia’s continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvres, further limiting their options. “The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on invading forces.”",14,6.43583165427817,6.104560290956988,0.3312713633211821,14

He continued: ""Cars can't drive to the hospital for two days already. High-rise buildings are burning around. Russians drove 400 people from neighbouring houses into our hospital. We can't get out."" In hospital three in Mariupol there are premature babies without parents who have been forced to leave, it is reported. It comes as Ukraine accused Russia of blocking a convoy trying to take supplies to the besieged city, where the Red Cross said desperate families were being ""suffocated"" as food and water ran out. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said hundreds of civilians managed to leave Mariupol in cars for the second successive day, but the aid convoy trying to reach the port city was stuck at nearby Berdyansk as Russian shelling continued. ""Our side ensures a complete ceasefire,"" she said. ""Russia, as usual, is cynically lying, thinking that people and the world do not see it and do not understand."" Russia denies targeting civilians and has blamed Ukraine for the repeated failure to establish safe passage for civilians and humanitarian convoys since it invaded Ukraine on February 24. Mariupol residents have been without heating, electricity and running water for most of the past two weeks, and at least 200,000 are in urgent need of evacuation, according to official Ukrainian estimates. Vereshchuk said the majority of residents do not have cars, so there was a need for buses to reach the city in convoys so that they can be evacuated. Residents are ""essentially being suffocated in this city now with no aid,"" Ewan Watson, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told a UN briefing in Geneva. The ICRC said on Twitter that ""tens of thousands of families are living under the constant threat of danger"" in Mariupol. ""They're huddled in whatever shelter they can find. They have limited food and water. They're terrified,"" it said. Russian forces agreed on Monday to allow the creation of a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol. The first evacuation convoy then left, after more than a week of failed attempts to do so, but Ukrainian officials were unable to deliver any aid. About 300 civilians have reached the city of Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles from Mariupol, the Mariupol city council said. At the same time about 2,000 cars had left Mariupol and a further 2,000 were waiting to leave, it said. More than 2,500 Mariupol residents have been killed since the Russian invasion, a Ukrainian official said on Monday.",17,4.028600652730491,5.700226228713241,-1.67162557598275,26

Major General Oleg Mityaev, commander of the Russian army’s 150th motorised rifle division, was killed as he tried to take the city, Kyiv has said. A picture of the 47-year-old’s corpse was released by Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko. The Mirror has chosen not to publish it due to its graphic nature. He is the fourth Russian general to die in less than three weeks of fighting according to Kyiv. He died alongside seven elite special operations fighters from the feared Dzerzhinsky Division of the country’s national guard, which is under Vladimir Putin ’s direct control. There is reportedly around 20 Russian generals leading the invasion - meaning a fifth have already died in three weeks. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here This major blow to the Kremlin’s forces comes amid a warning from a top Russian airman that his country’s forces have suffered losses on a scale that will “horrify” people. Captain Alexander Garnaev, a famous military test pilot and recipient of the Kremlin’s highest honour, the Hero of Russia award, denounced the “completely incomprehensible” war. He added that the true death toll of the war currently remained a closely-guarded secret. Mityaev’s death follows on from the deaths of three other generals. Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was the first Russian general to die and was reportedly killed by a sniper. Putin confirmed his death in a speech eight days into the invasion. Christo Grozev, executive director of investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, said that confirmation of his death would be a “major demotivator” for Russian troops. Sukhovetsky had reportedly been decorated for his role in annexing Crimea and Russian paper Pravda and graduated from Airborne Command School in 1995. The second general to die was Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, who died in the same week. Ukraine's defence ministry said that Gerasimov was killed outside the eastern city of Kharkiv, along with other senior officers. The ministry also broadcasted what it said was a conversation between two Russian FSB officers discussing the general's death and complaining that their secure communications were no longer functioning inside Ukraine. Then, General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th Combined Arms Army, was killed in fighting on March 11. Moscow has only confirmed the death of one general and has not yet commented on Kyiv’s claims of Mityaev. On top of this, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported the death of another Russian general in his nighttime address but did not name him. On top of continually losing generals, some of Russia's best soldiers have been killed in the fighting so far. A mourning picture was released in Russia showing the photographs of six elite “maroon beret” special forces fighters from the Vityaz Special Purpose Centre of the Dzerzhinsky Division, named after Soviet secret police founder Felix Dzerzhinsky. It was later revealed that a seventh had been slain. Only four have been named. Major Viktor Maksimchuk, 44, was commander of a motorised rifle regiment, who also died in fighting near Mariupol. A father and grandfather, his funeral is due today in Krasnodar region. Mikhail Belyakov, a 30-year-old sergeant and father-of-two from Penza region, was awarded the Order of Courage posthumously. He was killed in Ukraine on 27 February but in common with other announcements of Russian fatalities, they are being made with a time delay of around two weeks. Also killed was Alexey Blinkov, a graduate of the Novosibirsk Institute of National Guard Troops. The fourth SWAT fighter to be named was Maxim Pustozvonov, a native of Samara region. The body of another Russian soldier Aslanbek Mukhtarov was reported to have been found on the battlefield two-and-a-half weeks after he died. Air force pilot Captain Alexey Belkov was killed when his plane was downed. Two others from the same city, Bratsk, in Siberia, who had been moved 3,500 miles to fight in the war - Ilya Kubik, 18, and Pyotr Tereshonok. Respected test pilot Garnaev quit from a number of positions, including chairman of the board of Russia’s Club of Heroes, over the “completely incomprehensible” war. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. A Hero of Russia and Honoured Test Pilot, he launched a scathing attack on the way Ukrainian cities have been “bombed and crushed with tanks”. His opposite number in Ukraine, Alexander Galunenko, had seen the giant An-225 Mriya aircraft bombed “before his eyes”. Now he is cowering in his cellar as his house is ""constantly bombed and shelled”. He hinted at dissent in Russian ranks, he said: “It is unbearable for me to see how much our men - including those I know personally - suffer. This is unbearable for me.” And he warned: ‘Sooner or later society will know the final number of losses… “Society will be horrified.”",14,5.900598130503409,5.83015829574459,0.07043983475881976,14

Parents have also been forced to leave premature babies in a hospital in the Ukrainian city with around 350,000 people trapped with food and water running out, say reports. Horrific scenes of bombed out buildings and street fighting have been played out in recent days as the Russian army shells the city and the Ukrainian residents prepare to fight to the death to keep them out. Desperate attempts have been made to evacuate the city as part of a humanitarian corridor but there are still roughly 350,000 people inside Mariupol with resources dwindling. And with the fighting raging, people have been unable to leave hospital, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Ukrainian military in the Donetsk region.

The cyber attack happened on Ukraine 24's webstream and is believed to have taken place today, and reportedly was a statement address claiming to be from Zelensky. In it he reportedly said he was ""capitulating"" and would surrendered and ""give up arms"", leading to outrage and alarm online. However, it was quickly picked up on by a number of sources, and the president himself quickly released a video slamming the fake address and saying it was not him.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Many Ukrainians poured online to point out the hack and the false statement. In reality, Ukraine continues to fight to the end the third week against a Russia that had reportedly originally planned a lightning invasion of Ukraine that would take the capital in days. Instead, the government Putin and the Kremlin hoped to oust are now negotiating with them, having inflicted heavy losses on Moscow's forces. Russia is thought to be behind the cyber attack, a tool they have long used in their arsenal both inside and out of open warfare. Hacking and cyber attacks from Russia have long been targeted towards its Eastern European neighbours. Air Marshal, and former Director of Operations at the Ministry of Defence, Edward Stringer, told The Mirror Russia was a country that ""let loose its most talented and imaginative criminals and gives them licence will be able to create trouble anywhere in the world.” Despite the threat the attack may have posed, it was quickly caught out by a defiant nation that continues to frustrate and repel Russian attacks. This was far from the first cyberattack of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The night before the first assault took place, when Russian forces surged across the border into Ukraine, experts believe a computer-disabling malware was unleashed on the country. This was apart of Russia's initial offensive. A data-wiping malware was used to target websites, including government sites. However, in response, Ukraine appealed worldwide for hackers to help protect their own digital infrastructure and fight back against Russia virtually. The Guardian reported an estimated 300,000 people signed up to a group on the messaging app Telegram, called 'IT Army of Ukraine'. Ukraine's vice-Prime Minister and Minister for Digital Transformation, called on people to join the war, virtually. He said: ""We are creating an IT army. We need digital talents. ""All operational tasks will be given here: https://t.me/itarmyofurraine. There will be tasks for everyone. ""We continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists."" The volunteers come from all over the world and the attacks have been successful targeting government sites and state-backed media. In an intelligence update this morning, Britain's Ministry of Defence said: “The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on invading forces.” This they said was one of the key factors slowing what Russia hoped would be a lightning invasion. As the invasion comes to the end of its third week, peace talks continue between both sides.",14,5.599136127065974,4.755031365935331,0.8441047611306436,19

In the latest intelligence update on the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, they highlighted a number of the problems that Putin’s forces had run into. Challenges like the terrain, and transport issues have severely hampered Moscow’s ability to advance across what is the biggest European country by landmass. On top of that, an inability to secure control of the sky has “drastically limited” their ability to utilise jets and limited their options further. On top of that, the military acumen of the Ukrainian forces and the tactics they have used have exploited Russian weakness and inflicted “heavy losses” on Putin’s invading forces. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In a statement released on Twitter, they said: “Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain. “They have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvres. “The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia ’s advance. “Russia’s continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvres, further limiting their options. “The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on invading forces.” This comes as one of Putin's closest allies has admitted Russia's invasion of Ukraine have not gone to plan. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russia's national guard and apart of Putin's security council, said progress of the invasion had been slower than expected. He said: ""I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like,"" Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guard's website. ""But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us."" Zolotov has been at Putin's side since before the turn of the century and has spent the last 13 years in charge of his personal security. His comments, made at a church service led by Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on Sunday, have reflected reports from Western intelligence and mark a departure from official Kremlin lines so far. This comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine comes to the end of its third week. In that time, Russia has lost four major generals and nearly a dozen high-ranking officers. It has sustained heavier casualties than Ukraine, and lost more tanks than Germany has in its army. It was reported, Russia initially planned a ‘lightning invasion’ that would have seen Putin’s forces sweep the country and take Kyiv in a matter of days. However, now the Kremlin finds itself in protracted warfare against Ukraine’s forces and negotiating with the government it hoped to oust. Russia’s invasion has reportedly been plagued with issues such as low morale and supply issues. A number of videos have circulated on social media, showing Russian vehicles running out of fuel. Russia has maintained the invasion is going to plan, but reports from US intelligence officials have said they have been asking China for military equipment since the beginning of the invasion. After initial failures to conquer Ukraine's cities, Russia has turned to relentless shelling and bombing of civilian targets. The deadly invasion has led to thousands of deaths and has led to over three million refugees having fled from their homes since February 24. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees said, that as of March 15, 3,063,095 Ukrainians had left their homes. Over half of these, 1,857,045, have entered into Poland, the main destination of refugees so far, but it is not known how many intend to stay here, or move in to other countries. Despite its size, Moldova has taken in 344,454 people, the most per capita of any nation. Over 150,000 Ukrainians, largely from the country’s eastern regions, have fled into Russia.",14,5.204211701398779,4.704980672410561,0.49923102898821803,4

ZDF say the drone operator told them he watched the soldiers then torch the car. The German broadcaster attempted to verify the authenticity of the drone images by tracking down the drone operator. They found him in a a basement in the Ukrainian capital, where he showed them his equipment and spoke to them about what he had seen. Yesterday the Mirror reported that Volodymyr Zelensky has encouraged Russian soldiers to surrender, asking them why they should sacrifice their lives. In the message the Ukrainian president said: “You won’t take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives. But we will take your lives too. ""We offer you choice: if you surrender, we will treat you as people should be treated. With dignity. Not like your army has treated you."" More than three million people have fled Ukraine in the past three weeks, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Since the war began 73,000 children have become refugees on average each day - a figure which underlines the enormous hardship triggered by Vladimir Putin's decision to send his troops into Ukraine.

The sports car was deposited outside the police station in the city, which has seen half of its population leave in just a week due to Russian bombardment. But, despite that, someone took time out of the war to soup up a posh BMW sports car with Ukrainian flags, emblems and more, and drop it off to the local police. And they even added what looks like a machine gun turret to the back of the BMW 6 Series convertible, The Daily Star reports. Underneath the deadly weapon is a blunt message for the Russian invaders.

Speaking after video peace talks held by his representatives and Russia he said the negotiations were “pretty good,” and suggested there may be an end to Ukraine’s NATO ambitions. He said: “Ukraine is not a member of NATO. “We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised.” Over the past two weeks, support within the country for Ukraine's entry to NATO has dropped from 76% to 72% because of NATO not closing the skies over Ukraine. Ninety per cent of Ukrainians want a “no fly zone” which would be policed by NATO jets - but this would likely lead to a direct clash between alliance jets and Russian warplanes. But in Ukraine 56% believe that the main goal of Russia's invasion is the complete destruction of the Ukrainian people. And according to local poll and social study organisation Rating Group only two per cent believe Russia is trying to protect the Russian-speaking population. Today air-raid sirens blared throughout Ukraine - even in the west in cities such as Ivano Frankivsk whose airport has been blitzed three times in the past 20 days. Police in the sub-Carpathian town have massively clamped down as they search for Russian spies believed to have infiltrated the quiet town. Locals have been warned to look out for strangers and be suspicious of anyone asking directions or strange questions as they could be interlopers. Sources have told the Daily Mirror the spy agency SBU’s local office believe spies are within the town having rented apartments months before the invasion. It is believed they have sent instructions to their controllers on targets to be hit by long-range missiles, including the military and civilian airport. Ivano Frankivsk is a supply hub for the war effort, sending vital medication, clothing, military fatigues and even bedding to frontline troops. The region has provided as many as 150 volunteer troops who have been shipped to the frontline in Kyiv. Across Ukraine a second wave of mobilised troops is being summoned to fight Russia on the frontline as Kyiv desperately hangs on. Today shortly before dawn large blasts boomed throughout Kyiv as Russia attacked, striking a residential apartment block, killing two as 35 were rescued. Multiple strikes hit the neighbourhood, sparking a huge fire and a rescue effort all over the 15-storey apartment building. Despite the pounding and as Kyiv was warned to prepare for Russia’s brutal strikes Moscow was revealed to have suffered massive casualties. As well as 13,500 dead its forces have lost 81 warplanes, 95 helicopters, 404 tanks and even another Russian General has been killed - the fourth in 20 days. But the Ukrainian civilian cost is immense as heartbreaking figures emerged of at least four children a day being killed by Russian shelling as more than 90 have died. As many as 100 plus children have been injured in fighting- many of them from barbaric Russian shelling. Moscow’s forces have blitzed 400 schools - destroying 59 of them. But Zelensky vowed: “Russia has already begun to understand that they will not achieve anything by war.” Both Ukraine and Russia have expressed hope for peace. Mykhailo Podolyak, aide to Mr Zelensky, said negotiators would discuss ""peace, ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops & security guarantees.” Two people were killed when Russia struck an airplane factory in Kyiv, sparking a large fire. The Antonov factory is Ukraine's largest aircraft plant and produces many of the world's biggest cargo planes. A town councillor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, was killed in fighting and shells fell on the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst fighting. The southern city of Mykolaiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv, suffered intense shelling and blasts echoed around theBlack Sea port of Kherson. Nine people were killed in a rocket attack on a TV tower in the western village of Antopol and in the eastern city of Kharkiv, the remains of a four-storey residential building were seen. Ukraine's military again fought an advance by Russia on Mariupol and the attackers were forced to retreat. Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the war has become ""nothing short of a nightmare"" for those living in besieged cities.",17,3.425425591838753,3.2738662492301334,0.15155934260861947,24

Russia's defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenov said the country's forces had taken full control of all territory in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, Russian news agencies reported. The claims have yet to be independently confirmed. Kherson city was taken at the beginning of March, leaving 300,000 citizens to live under the rule of Russian occupiers. Now the Russian military is claiming to have full control of the broader Kherson region, which has a population of more than a million people. This weekend Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky warned that the Russians wanted to turn Kherson into a pseudo-breakaway state, like Donbass. To keep up with all the day's Ukraine war updates, follow our live blog here. Kherson Oblast also includes strategically important port town Kakhovka and river port Nova Kakhovka. The region is known as the country's fruit basket and is an important area for both Ukraine and Europe more broadly due to the huge amount of food grown there. Russia has had much more success invading Ukraine from the south - with its forces moving up through occupied Crimea into Kherson - than in the north. To the east of the region lies Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where the port city of Berdiansk, urban hub Melitopol and large nuclear power plant Zaporizhzhia have fallen to the Russians. The citizens of Kherson city have ignored warnings from the Russian occupiers to stay inside over the past two weeks, instead opting to protest their presence on the streets. On March 5 2,000 people came out to demonstrate, waving the flag and singing the Ukrainian anthem. Locals yelled “Glory to Ukraine ” and “Death to the enemy” as Russian troops fired bullets into the air. Eyewitnesses said Russian troops fired automatic rifles in a failed bid to disperse the crowd. The soldiers later left the city centre, the eyewitnesses said. At the weekend more than 100 people came out in Kakhovka to demand that the Russians leave and chant ""one, united, free Ukraine"" while draped in their country's flag. The situation in Kherson city has become bleak over the past week, according to people living there. Food is in short supply and the Russian police carefully monitor people's social media feeds to ensure they're not being too overtly pro-Ukrainian. Shortages of medicine and food in the occupied city have left vulnerable people waiting to die, according to civilians living there. Shops are open but supplies are not getting through. Over the weekend President Zelensky warned that the Russians were attempting to take control of the region as they had Donbass. ""The invaders in the Kherson region are trying to repeat the notorious experience of the formation of pseudo republics, blackmail local leaders, put pressure on deputies, look for someone to bribe,"" he said in a video message on Sunday. This morning James Cleverly said any attempt by Russia to hold a 'referendum' in areas of Ukraine would ""be another attempt to put a veneer of credibility on what is an unacceptable, unjustified illegal invasion"". The Foreign Office minister was speaking to Times Radio after the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia ""may seek to stage a 'referendum' in Kherson in an attempt to legitimise the area as a 'breakaway republic' similar to Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea"". Mr Cleverly said: ""What we have seen is that there has been a long-standing disinformation campaign coming out from Russia. There has been all kinds of excuses.""",14,4.901482860483847,5.292244176074425,-0.39076131559057803,1

Russia has failed to make the big inroads it is thought they were expecting and are making slow progress in trying to topple the Ukraine regime in Kyiv. They are slowly encircling the Ukraine capital but it is thought now that the inability to make decisive blows means that they will run out of ""manpower and energy"" sooner rather than later. Now, a senior UK defence source is reported to have said that ""Ukraine has Russia on the run"" and the attacker was running out of both manpower and energy. The source told the Daily Mail: ""As long as we keep pressing they've got 10 to 14 days before reaching their culminating point. That's when the strength of Ukraine's resistance should become greater than Russia's attacking force."" A similar view to the Mail source, where Russia will be forced to call a halt to their invasion by May, was held by Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, speaking late on Monday. In a video published by Ukrainian media, Arestovich said the exact timing of a withdrawal would depend on how much resources the Kremlin was willing to commit to the campaign. ""I think that no later than in May, early May, we should have a peace agreement, maybe much earlier, we will see, I am talking about the latest possible dates,"" Arestovich said. ""We are at a fork in the road now: there will either be a peace deal struck very quickly, within a week or two, with troop withdrawal and everything, or there will be an attempt to scrape together some, say, Syrians for a round two and, when we grind them too, an agreement by mid-April or late April."" A ""completely crazy"" scenario could also involve Russia sending fresh conscripts after a month of training, he said. Still, even once peace is agreed, small tactical clashes could remain possible for a year, according to Arestovich, although Ukraine insists on the complete removal of Russian troops from its territory. The war in Ukraine began on February 24 when Vladimir Putin launched what he called a ""special military operation,"" the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a nightly address where he talked of the Russian forces suffering ""devastating"" losses and he tried to get their soldiers to surrender. ""Therefore, I offer you a choice. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive,"" he said. ""If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours. Choose! ""Our brave defenders continue to inflict devastating losses on Russian troops. Soon the number of downed helicopters of Russia will reach hundreds of units. They have already lost 80 warplanes. Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment.

Invading forces have hardly moved in recent days and the Russian attack is now largely focused on intense shelling and airstrikes as opposed to more tactical manoeuvres. It comes as Putin has been forced to admit the deaths of several high-ranking officers in what Russia continues to call a 'special military operation'. The Putin regime today acknowledged the deaths of Major Alexei Vorsyuchenko and Sergeant Pavel Bogatyrev from the VDV's 76th Air Assault Division.

GRU spy Captain Alexey Glushchak died in the carnage in the Ukrainian port of Mariupol, although his country has given no details of how he was killed. ""Due to the strict secrecy of the military operation, the circumstances of the death of the Tyumen hero are not disclosed,"" a statement read. The GRU was behind the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury of its former spy Sergei Skripal, who had defected to Britain. To keep up with all the day's Ukrainian war updates, follow our live blog. Pictures emerged of the funeral of father-of-one Glushchak, 31, from Tyumen in Siberia, Russia, where he was buried with full military honours amid a guard of honour. On the day the military intelligence officer died he had spoken to both his wife and mother in Russia, the statement explained. He called to congratulate them on International Women’s Day, but that evening they learned he had been killed. His death coincides amid anger and dismay at the number of military coffins now returning to Russia, even though those officially acknowledged as having fallen in Ukraine are seen as a small fraction of the total number. Best estimates suggest Russia's war dead now run into ‘many thousands’, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 1,300 of his troops had died as of Sunday. Glushchak will be posthumously decorated. Moscow has given no up-to-date total of those killed in the war, and named only a handful of the fallen, which include several generals. Many funerals that can be read or watched in the media are for soldiers slain at the end of February. Russia is taking two weeks or more to transport their bodies back to relatives, many of whom live in the far east of the country, many thousands of miles from the bloody war zone. The pain they're suffering when they do arrive is evident in an increasing number of hostile and anguished posts. “When will this stop, we are seeing coffins almost daily?” said one. “Why did we need to send our boys into this hell?” asked another. A funeral was also held for Corporal Danil Novolodsky, 24, a senior gunner on an air assault artillery battery. He was awarded the Order of Courage under a decree signed by Vladimir Putin. He was from Ulan-Ude, capital of the republic of Buryatia in Siberia, a mainly Buddhist region, which has suffered a disproportionate number of fatalities among Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine. Ahead of the invasion, tens of thousands of troops were sent west on the Trans-Siberian Railway to fight in the coming war. Another funeral from the same region was held for Vladimir Plekhanov, 24, an orphan raised by a living foster family. Sagyndyk Kudaibergenov, 22, from Tyumen, like the GRU agent , was buried with military honours, according to reports. He was killed in mortar fire while deploying communications equipment across a river.

The deaths of Russian generals comes after reports a Kremlin spy chief and his deputy haven been placed under house arrest by Putin - who is reportedly blaming his security services for setbacks in the invasion of Ukraine. Sergey Beseda, head of the Federal Security Branch, Russia's intelligence branch, was arrested along with his deputy, Anatoly Bolyukh, an expert claimed. Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled Russian human rights activist also confirmed the arrests. It comes after Russia finally admitted losing its first senior military intelligence officer during the war with Ukraine. GRU spy Captain Alexey Glushchak died in the carnage in the Ukrainian port of Mariupol, although his country has given no details of how he was killed. ""Due to the strict secrecy of the military operation, the circumstances of the death of the Tyumen hero are not disclosed,"" a statement read. Putin could face the threat of being toppled by his own officers and generals, a journalist claimed. Andrei Soldatov, a leading Russian investigative journalist, told Channel 4 News that ""everything now seems to be possible"" when asked if the Kremlin leader, a former FSB agent himself, could be deposed by his own men. In the wake of the invasion, there have been reports that Putin was told by the FSB security service, the successor to the KGB, that Ukraine would capitulate easily and give up. Matt Frei of Channel 4 News asked Mr Soldatov: “Is it possible that some senior generals, especially the ones who are on the front here, perhaps together with some disgruntled officers in the FSB, could turn against Putin to try and dislodge him?” In response he said: ""Obviously, everything now seems to be possible, but we need to remember that Putin is a trained KGB officer. ""He is well aware of risks to his personal security and safety and he has not one but two security services. While chaos appears to escalate within the Kremlin, Ukraine’s Armed Forces estimated that approximately 12, 000 Russian troops have been killed, a staggering 303 tanks, 48 warplanes, 80 helicopters and over 1,000 armoured personnel carriers. It comes as the head of Russia’s National Guard has said that Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine is not going as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, in the strongest public acknowledgement yet that the invasion is not going to plan. Viktor Zolotov blamed the slower-than-expected progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by officials in Russia. ""I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like,"" Mr Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guard's website. Those comments appeared to be at odds with an assessment made on Friday by Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who told Putin that ""everything is going according to plan"". A column of Russian forces approaching Kyiv are now about 15 miles from the Ukrainian capital, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said this weekend. Earlier, it was reported the Ukrainian army reportedly wiped out Russian armoured vehicles and a command centre. Drone footage appears to show rockets being fired at armoured vehicles in the city of Mariupol - where Russian forces last destroyed a children's hospital in an airstrike.

Shane Matthews, a former Lance Corporal with the 2nd Battalion Princess of Wales’ Royal Regiment, is currently based in Kyiv and helping to fortify the city against Vladimir Putin ’s approaching soldiers. Despite their military superiority Russia has so far failed to take the capital - one of the Russian army’s key objectives. Shane Matthews, who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told MailOnline he does not believe Kyiv will fall to the invaders. He said: “The Ukrainian artillery absolutely hammered the Russians while I was giving one of my medical lessons. “Apparently the Russians have got no defensive positions in Irpin so the Ukrainian boys are absolutely hammering them, which is good news. “The guerrilla-style tactics being employed by the Ukrainians is something you simply cannot defend against, it’s like the Taliban on steroids.” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Mr Matthews flew out to Poland before being given lifts to the capital so he could help the Ukrainians prepare for the brutal invaders. Last week Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said both serving soldiers and veterans should not fly out to join the fight against Russia. He said: “No good comes from British service people or veterans going to Ukraine to be a part of this."" The former Army officer added the British public, especially servicemen and women who have a ""deep sense of wanting to be doing the right thing"", need to know what is going on behind the scenes. He added: ""They need to know there is a lot of people in the Royal Air Force flying a lot of important stuff, not just from the UK but from other European partners forward. ""There are British soldiers in other European countries, mostly Poland, where that stuff (resources) is being received and then what happens next is not for public consumption. “The might of the Russian army is still up against them (Ukraine). They have overwhelming force at their disposal. ""That overwhelming force, unfortunately, looks pretty indiscriminate, we are going to see some brutal things on our TV screens in the days ahead. ""But the torch has been lit for the Ukrainian people and it burns brightly.

Warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, an ally of the Russian president, boasted about his troops who are driving Ukrainian forces to flee, according to reports. The Chechen leader said that he was in Ukraine with Russian forces on Monday in a video uploaded on the Telegram app. Several international organisations have accused Kadyrov of serious human rights violations in the Caucasus Republic, reports the Daily Star. In the footage, he is seen looking at plans with troops in the room which he said was filmed in Hotomel, an airfield near Kyiv in Ukraine which was captured by Russian forces in the first few days of their attack. But this has not been independently verified, reports News AU. Kadyrov wrote, “the other day we were about 20km from you Kyiv Nazis and now we are even closer"" and demanded that Ukrainian forces surrender ""or you will be finished"". He vowed to show them that ""Russian practice teaches warfare better than foreign theory and the recommendation of military advisers."" Reports suggest that Chechen soldiers could play a crucial part in helping Russia to take control of Ukraine's capital Kyiv with mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner Group. According to Russia Today, Kadyrov said: “Members of the Ukrainian armed forces and national battalions, who have always bragged about their courage, flee when they see the Chechen fighters, leaving behind heavy weapons and military equipment. “Full military coordination, the correct deployment of troops and a decisive assault – that’s all we need. ""We must finish what we started and do it quickly. “Since [the Ukrainians] have twice refused to negotiate we must change tactics. ""That will convince them.”",14,5.08199560373093,4.18448976153722,0.8975058421937101,6

Mr Javid said he believed a direct attack on a NATO member was still “very unlikely”. But he added any incursion would trigger an alliance response under its mutual defence policy. Health Secretary Mr Javid said: “We’ve made it very clear to the Russians – even before the start of this conflict – if a single Russian toecap steps into NATO territory, it will be considered an act of war.” His comments follow Sunday’s deadly strike on the Yavoriv base, is 15 miles from Ukraine’s border with NATO member Poland. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, meanwhile denied US suggestions that Russia had asked China for military kit to help Vladimir Putin’s invaders. He said: “Russia possesses its own potential to continue the operation. ""It is going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full.” And Peskov chillingly warned allegations by the US and EU that Putin had grown frustrated with the war’s progress, amounted to a provocation to storm cities. He said: “The defence ministry of the Russian Federation while ensuring the maximum safety of the civilian population, does not exclude the possibility of taking major population centres under full control.” Peskov was contradicted by one of Putin’s closest allies on whether the invasion had worked out as planned. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russia’s national guard and a member of the dictator’s security council admitted: “Not everything is going as fast as we would like. ""But we are going towards our goal, step by step, and victory will be for us.” One UK defence expert suggested Russia’s forces may have hit problems because they are riddled with “deep cultural problems, such as deep corruption”. Prof Michael Clarke, a director of Exeter University’s Strategy and Security Institute, said: “Reforms to the ‘large, modern’ Russian army have not gone very well. ""The part which is modern is not large, and the part which is large is not modern. “Weapons systems and equipment haven’t been performing well because exercises were not completed properly, and commanders lied about this in their paperwork, pretending they had capabilities that weren’t there, so the force is simply not battle-ready.” NATO defence ministers will meet for crisis talks on Wednesday at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels. With the war entering its 20th day on Tuesday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned them it is “only a matter of time” before a member of the alliance comes under attack. He is expected again to demand a no-fly zone over Ukraine in an address to the US Congress tomorrow. Mr Zelensky said in a televised speech: “If you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on NATO territory, on the homes of citizens.” Boris Johnson’s spokesman said Russia’s barbaric missile strikes were “deeply concerning” adding: “We continue to call on the regime to stop the bombardment of Ukraine and focus on negotiating.” The PM today hosts Baltic and Scandinavian leaders for talks in London. Representatives from Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway will be there. The countries form the Joint Expeditionary Force of nations which has taken a leading role in providing military support to Ukraine. Mr Johnson will later hold talks with his Finnish and Swedish counterparts. His spokesman said: “We want to get the broadest possible coalition to stand up to Putin.” In the Netherlands, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said Britain would also bolster International Criminal Court efforts to probe war crimes. Speaking after visiting the ICC in The Hague, Mr Raab said it was vital “commanders on the ground – those who may be receiving illegal orders, as well as those in the Kremlin, knew they could be held to account.” Despite Putin’s ruthless crackdown on dissent, a protester yesterday burst onto the set of the nightly news on state-run Russian Channel 1, shouting “Stop the war!” and holding a sign reading: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying.”",29,3.2914036559740074,3.869641118692022,-0.5782374627180147,28

The Russian negotiations delegate even went as far as to suggest it may produce positive results in the coming days. But it is unknown if this was an attempt to put pressure on Ukraine or paint them as the aggressors if talks fail. Ukraine has said that it is willing to negotiate about an end to the bloody invasion of its country, but will not surrender or accept any ultimatums.

Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In more good news for peace talks, separately, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Russia was willing to engage in substantive negotiations. These talks could bring about an end to the conflict which has seen thousands die and more than 2.5million flee. “I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days,” he said. RIA news agency quoted a Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, as saying the talks had made substantial progress. He said: “According to my personal expectations, this progress may grow in the coming days into a joint position of both delegations, into documents for signing.” Neither side indicated what the scope of any agreement might be. Their public comments were issued almost at the same time, on the eighteenth day of the war. In a tweet, Podolyak said Russia was carefully listening to Ukraine's proposals. He said: “Our demands are - the end of the war and the withdrawal of [Russian] troops. I see the understanding and there is a dialogue.” This comes as nearly a week ago, the Kremlin’s chief spokesperson claimed Russia was ready to halt military operations “in a moment” if Kyiv met a list of its conditions. These included unrealistic demands like ceding Crimea to Russia officially and recognising the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. He said that “we can discuss and find a compromise on how these territories will live on” before adding “we're not ready for capitulation”. There have so far been three rounds of talks between the two sides, held in Belarus. The most recent took place last Monday and focused on humanitarian issues and led to the limited opening of some corridors for civilians to escape fighting. However, in the days since, there have been reports of Russian troops violating this agreement and firing on civilians trying to flee along these routes. On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed there had been some “positive shifts” in the talks as well, and a day later the Kremlin said talks between the sides continued “in video format”. There has also been disagreement between the countries as to whether talks were ongoing today.

As Moscow’s troops continued their armoured advance on Kyiv artillery strikes pounded Chernihiv northeast of the capital, killing nine civilians. Ukraine ’s human rights monitor said Russia used phosphorous bombs in an overnight attack on the town of Popasna in the eastern Luhansk region, calling it a “war crime.” Oleksi Biloshytsky, chief of Popasna police, whose town is 60 miles west of Luhansky city, said over the weekend Russian forces used the weapon in his area. Using an amalgamation of the words ‘Russian forces’ and ‘fascist’ he said: “It’s what the Nazi called a “flaming onion” and that’s what the Russcists are dropping on our towns. “Indescribable suffering and fires.” Further south Russian missiles struck the Sviatoguirsk monastery where nearly 1,000 civilians were sheltering, wounding 30 people, according to Ukraine’s public prosecutor. Over the weekend Ukraine’s intelligence agency accused Russian troops of another atrocity against civilians fleeing through an agreed “safety route.” Ukraine intelligence officials claimed Russian troops had shot at women and children during an agreed evacuation, killing seven, including a child. Kyiv’s Central Intelligence Agency said it happened on Friday as women and children fled the village of Peremoga in the Baryshevsky district towards the village of Ostroluchie. They were walking along a “green” corridor agreed with the Russian Federation, according to the intelligence report and the exact number of wounded is unknown. The survivors were ordered to return to where they had come from and the atrocity did not emerge until late Saturday night. On the same day, it has emerged a woman and a child were shot at a checkpoint in the Kharkiv region and yesterday another child was killed in an attack on a car in the same region. In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops were trying to surround Ukrainian forces, advancing from the besieged port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north. Kharkiv has suffered some of the heaviest bombardments but Ukraine’s forces have fought back repeatedly. British intelligence said Russian forces advancing from Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, were trying to circle around Mykolayiv to drive west towards Odesa. Airstrikes on Mykolayiv killed nine people on Sunday, regional Governor Vitaliy Kim said. In Chernihiv, around 100 miles northeast of Kyiv, firefighters rescued residents from a burning building after heavy shelling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday nearly 125,000 people had been evacuated via “humanitarian corridors” agreed with Russia. Russian troops have destroyed 3,687 Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities so far, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. But latest Ukrainian official figures said Russia has suffered horrific losses in the invasion, now in its third week. They have lost well over 12,000 troops, 74 warplanes, 86 helicopters, a staggering 374 tanks, 1226 armoured personnel vehicles, 600 other vehicles and three boats. In stricken Mariupol, which has endured some of the worst punishment since Russia invaded, efforts to bring food, water and medicine into the port city of 430,000 and to evacuate civilians, were prevented by unceasing attacks. Local officials confirmed 2,187 people have died in the city during the siege, according to the mayor’s office, and the shelling has even interrupted efforts to bury the dead in mass graves. Mr Zelensky said: ""They are bombing it 24 hours a day, launching missiles. It is hatred. They kill children."" Over the weekend he reported that 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers have died in fighting since the February 24 start of the Russian invasion. Thousands of civilians have been killed including more than 80 children who have died. More than 100 children are thought to have been injured, according to Ukraine’s chief prosecutor. Mr Zelensky also accused Russia of employing “a new stage of terror” with the alleged kidnapping of the mayor of Melitopol, a city 119 miles west of Mariupol. After residents of the occupied city demonstrated for the mayor’s release on Saturday, the Ukrainian leader called on Russian forces to heed the calls. “Please hear in Moscow!” Mr Zelensky said. “Another protest against Russian troops, against attempts to bring the city to its knees.” In multiple areas around the capital, artillery barrages sent residents scurrying for shelter as air raid sirens wailed. A convoy of supplies has been spotted travelling into Mariupol protected by a group of Orthodox priests, who bravely used their religious appearance in the hope that Russian soldiers would be less likely to fire on them. The Orthodox clergy members are said to have volunteered to accompany the convoy, which carried 90 tonnes of food and medicine, from nearby Zaporizhzhia and planned to safely evacuate civilians on their return Britain’s Defence Ministry said Russian ground forces that had been massed north of Kyiv for most of the war had edged to within 15 miles of the city centre.

Rob O’Neill, from Montana, was part of SEAL Team Six that took out the terrorist leader who organised 9/11. The soldier, who completed 400 combat missions over 16 years of service said that Vladimir Putin had “lost his marbles” by launching an invasion of Ukraine. But he also lambasted his own country’s response to the invasion. He was taken back by his country’s response to the invasion and said that America had responded with weakness. The veteran, who was decorated 52 times, slammed President Joe Biden's administration after it cancelled a nuclear missile test last weekend while Russian troops bombed innocent citizens. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here O’Neil claimed the Pentagon was more worried about its green agenda, to combat climate change instead of trying to combat Putin, The Daily Mail reported. He said: ""You don't defeat a crazy man with nuclear weapons, with weakness. ""It's like trying to stop a schoolyard bully by appeasing him, it's nonsense. ""When I was in the service, the main concern was whether you could perform the task at hand. ""Now they (the Pentagon) are wasting time and resources making warships green. ""The unfortunate truth is Russia and China are laughing at us when we talk about climate change in the military."" O’Neill admitted that he hadn’t believed Russia would invade Ukraine because he made the mistake of trying to make sense of an “insane man’s decision”. The veteran feared that after the heavy loss of its jets and helicopters, Russia would move to long-range artillery and shelling of Ukraine. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. But he hoped Ukraine’s resistance would continue to prove defiant and cause Russia to suffer losses to the point it would be willing to sit down and discuss peace. O'Neill also admitted he found footage of Russian helicopters being blown out the air unsettling after he had had friends die under similar circumstances. O’Neill also claimed that most Americans got their ideas of war from TV and social media.

Ukrainian journalist Oleksiy Matsuka posted the picture with the caption: ""Irpin. Mother and son are buried in the courtyard of the residential complex in the parking lot."" Civilians have been fleeing bombs and artillery strikes raining down over the city - which has been bombarded by Russian forces for more than seven days. It is one of several key Ukrainian cities being evacuated amid intensifying shelling. Another image taken in the city today showed Ukrainian troops carrying an elderly woman to safety among the rubble of razed buildings. The woman is seen laying on a stretcher, with two crutches across her body, as the servicemen straddle over collapsed buildings to extract her to safety. Ukrainian authorities have accused the Kremlin of targetting civilians fleeing their homes amid heavy Russian shelling. And the mass exodus currently underway could lead to a worst-case scenario of as many as five million refugees fleeing their homeland for sanctuary, Poland's president warned today. Andrzej Duda told BBC's Sunday Morning show: ""According to experts, in an extreme situation, it could be up to five million people. ""Of course, we are not the only country who is receiving them because Romania, which shares a border with Ukraine, is also getting refugees. Hungary has a border with Ukraine. ""More than half of all refugees who have left Ukraine are in Poland. ""So, if there are five million, just imagine that we get 2.5million."" Meanwhile, a foreign national became another of the growing numbers of civilians slaughtered by Putin's troops. An American journalist has reportedly been shot dead and another injured by Russian forces, according to Ukraine police. The head of Kyiv region police said one journalist had been killed and another injured in Irpin town close to the capital. The journalist had previously worked for the New York Times but was not on assignment. A tweet by Kyiv police read: ""URGENT! In Irpen, the Russian occupiers have just shot the international journalists of the New York Times! ""One killed, one wounded. Now militiamen try to take out the victim from a combat zone."" And now one of Putin's political opponents has predicted the war may spread beyond the Ukrainian border - and that the despot could trigger a nuclear war. Leonid Volkov, the former chief of staff for jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny, issued a chilling warning over the Kremlin's plans and said he wanted his fellow Russians to make it clear it was ""not our war"". Prominent opposition leader Mr Navalny, who has accused Putin of corruption, was poisoned by the Novichok nerve agent in 2020 and later imprisoned on his return to Russia in 2021. Mr Volkov said Putin was ""crazy enough"" to use nuclear weapons as the conflict in Ukraine continues to escalate. He told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""It is now very clear that enormous cost has to be paid to stop this war.""",17,4.197212183229956,3.554703359206798,0.642508824023158,29

Mr Bretton-Gordon also said that the ""reckless"" bombing by the Russians could spark a lab accident. He added: ""If a massive bomb hit the lab, the pathogens could be released - but it's more likely they would be destroyed."" It comes as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has warned Russia might use chemical weapons following its invasion of Ukraine. ""In recent days, we have heard absurd claims about chemical and biological weapons laboratories,"" Stoltenberg was quoted by Welt am Sonntag as saying, adding that the Kremlin was inventing false pretexts to justify what could not be justified. ""Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies. That would be a war crime,"" Stoltenberg was quoted as saying. He added that although the Ukrainian people were resisting the Russian invasion with courage, the coming days are likely to bring even greater hardship.",3,5.029369613952465,3.5003694816013775,1.5290001323510873,29

Images taken on Saturday by private US satellite firm Maxar showed fires burning in Mariupol and dozens of apartment buildings burnt to the ground. Maxar confirmed fires were raging in the port city's western districts - where high-rise buildings were severely damaged by Russian bombing and shelling. The Maxar pictures include a multispectral view of fires in an industrial area of the Primorsky district. The images also reveal burning apartment buildings on Zelinskovo Street. The United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said: ""There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city. ""Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply."" On Friday, Mariupol City Council claimed at least 1,582 civilians had been slaughtered there as a result of Russian shelling. These figures can't be independently verified at present. Mariupol was one of several cities evacuated by Ukrainian authorities today. At least 13,000 people in total - which is almost twice the number who managed to get out the previous day, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. This is almost twice the number who managed to get out the previous day. Vereshchuk said in an online message that no one had managed to leave the besieged city of Mariupol and blamed obstruction by Russian forces. Moscow had earlier accused Ukrainian forces of intentionally trapping people there. Three people including a child were killed in a Russian strike on a maternity and children's hospital in the city of Mariupol, officials said. Some 17 people were also injured, including staff and patients, local officials said. The Mariupol city council said the strike had caused ""colossal damage"", and published footage showed burned out buildings, destroyed cars and a huge crater outside the hospital.",17,4.94476853308629,3.6201590943209845,1.3246094387653051,26

Russia was feared to be making final preparations to lay siege to Kyiv after gaining ground in its outskirts, with troops said to be less than 15 miles away. But as air-raid sirens and volleys of shelling rang out over the city Ukrainians vowed they will stand up to Russia. The country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, warned Putin would only take Kyiv if he razes it to the ground. Its youngest MP, Sviatoslav Yurah, 26, vowed: “Nobody is going to surrender.” As they prepared to fight, experts warned the battle for Kyiv could lead the Russians to use “irregular weapons”. But Britain last night offered some hope to Ukrainians fleeing their country. The UK Government announced a settlement scheme for refugees with financial help for people in Britain who take them into their homes. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Today, the 17th day of Putin’s senseless and relentless war… So far 353 Russian tanks have been destroyed by Ukraine soldiers. The number of Russian troops killed is estimated to be more than 12,000. In a rousing online speech, Mr Zelensky vowed his country would fight to the end in its defence of Kyiv. But he said: “If there are hundreds of thousands of people, who are now being mobilised by Russia, and they come with hundreds or thousands of tanks, they will take Kyiv. We understand that.” Mr Yurah likened the looming battle to the bloodiest of the Second World War, in which 1.9 million German and Soviet troops died. He said: “This will be their Stalingrad if they want to make it so. Nobody is going to surrender. I can definitely guarantee you that.” Sources said Ukrainian soldiers today blew up a main Russian HQ set up outside Kyiv. Putin’s troops, supported by mercenaries and fighters from Chechnya and Syria, have still failed to take control of any major urban area. But they were pictured moving rocket launchers into position outside the capital. And former British Army colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon warned of an “escalation of horror”. The chemical weapons expert, who advised the UK government after the Salisbury poisonings, said Putin could order indiscriminate attacks on the city. He said: “I fear what is about to transpire in Kyiv will be unwatchable. If things start going badly the Russians will revert to irregular weapons. “They will use thermobaric weapons, which are illegal to fire in civilian areas, white phosphorus – a self-igniting chemical that can burn at upwards of 2,500 degrees – and possibly napalm to set buildings on fire. It will be like Grenfell multiplied by a thousand.” Russian troops were last night accused of shooting dead six women and a child as they tried to leave the village of Peremoha via an agreed humanitarian corridor. Ukraine’s intelligence service said after the attack on Friday “the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back to Peremoha and are not letting them out”. Conditions are desperate in decimated Mariupol, where a maternity hospital and a mosque were shelled. After repeated failed evacuation efforts, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, described the city as “the worst humanitarian catastrophe on the planet”. President Zelensky urged Russia to uphold a ceasefire. He also called for the release of kidnapped Melitopol mayor Ivan Fedorov. In Ivano Frankivsk, air-raid sirens blared all day today. IT student Dima, 19, took cover underground with girlfriend Alina, 16. He told the Sunday Mirror: “To be honest I am very scared of what is happening to Ukraine.” The UN estimates that 2.6 million people have so far fled the country. Under Michael Gove’s new Homes for Ukraine scheme, Britons who offer refugees shelter for at least six months will receive £350 a month. The Levelling Up Secretary said: “I urge people across the country to join the national effort and offer support to our Ukrainian friends.” Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Dragon’s Den star Deborah Meaden said they would be happy to take in a refugee. A website will be launched this week. But Britain was criticised for buying Russian oil. Oleg Ustenko, economic advisor to President Zelensky, said: “It will be sold for money and that money was used by Putin to buy weapons and ammunition that are killing Ukranians.” Meanwhile, British special forces veterans, helping to defend Ukraine in a project funded by a European country, have been ordered to withdraw as UK officials fear their presence could spark political problems. It also emerged Britons who volunteer to fight in Ukraine could be executed on the spot if captured. In a 75-minute phone call today, French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire. Meanwhile Italy seized the world’s biggest yacht, worth £443m from Russian coal and fertiliser billionaire Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko.

Vladimir Putin has issued orders for his troops to release radioactive waste at the former reactor which he plans to blame on Ukrainian soldiers. By doing so, he hopes to further escalate the conflict - which has already killed or injured at least 1,500 civilians, according to the latest UN estimates. Kyiv's Military Intelligence Directorate claims the Kremlin has been gathering false evidence in preparation of the ""false flag"" mission after the reactor was captured on day one of the invasion, the MailOnline reports. In a statement, the agency said: ""Russian car refrigerators collecting the bodies of dead Ukrainian defenders were spotted near the Antonov airport in Hostomel. ""There is a possibility that they will be presented as killed saboteurs in the Chernobyl zone."" Russian forces plan to use what would be a 'disaster' to further justify the conflict in Ukraine, but there are fears that without the proper knowledge, Russian forces could trigger a chemical leak. Technicians work around the clock to maintain the plant whilst held at gunpoint by the Russian occupying soldiers, the Daily Star reports. Sviatoslav Yurah, Ukraine's youngest ever MP and a former adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's a massive town of millions and if the Russians try to come in they will have quite a fight on their hands - this will be their Stalingrad if they want to make it so."" Millions of refugees have now fled Ukraine, going to neighbouring countries like Poland, Slovakia and Moldova to escape the bombardment from Putin's forces. Russian forces are closing in on Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv in what could be a major turning point in the war so far. Vehicles are advancing on the capital after being held for several days and a military airfield south of the city in Vasylkiv has been destroyed by Russian missiles. Earlier this week, a specialist cancer hospital in Mykolaiv was also hit, luckily killing no one but hundreds of patients receiving chemotherapy were inside at the time. Another ceasefire is expected to be put in place today to allow citizens in major cities to evacuate through humanitarian corridors. However, Russia has been ignoring ceasefires despite pleas from Ukrainian officials. According to the United Nations, the death toll has now reached 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries in Ukraine as of March 10, 26 of those killed were children.",17,3.668823122557478,3.2097008286711004,0.4591222938863777,19

The cruel attack took place today when Moscow’s forces fired on an evacuating convoy of civilians from the village of Peremoha, in the Kyiv region. This caused seven deaths including that of a child. In a statement, the intelligence service claimed: ""After the attack, the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back to Peremoha and are not letting them out of the village.” Russia has denied targeting civilians since it invaded but repeatedly has been proven to attack civilian targets.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The seven women and children who Ukraine says died when Russian forces attacked a convoy escaping a village in the Kyiv region on Saturday were not as previously stated in an agreed evacuation corridor, the defence ministry said. Ukraine's intelligence service initially said those who died outside Peremoha had been in a ""green corridor"" agreed withRussia. A defence ministry statement later said people had in fact tried to escape by themselves, ""so they began evacuatingwithout the 'green corridor' agreed by the parties"". This came as France said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not ready to make peace after Emmanuel Macron, the French President, met with him. The invasion continues well into its third week now, after reports that the Kremlin hoped it would be over in days. But now the conflict has spanned into weeks, with most of the country and airspace, not under Russian control. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Moscow intended to send in new troops after his country’s forces had put 31 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups out of action. Whilst difficult to determine Russia’s exact losses, thousands of Russian troops have died and reportedly the Kremlin has lost more tanks than Germany has in use. Zelensky also said that 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed so far in the fighting. He has also recently spoken with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Macron, who in turn spoke with Putin and urged him to consider a ceasefire. However, a Kremlin statement on the 75-minute call made no mention of a ceasefire and a French presidency official said: ""We did not detect a willingness on Putin's part to end the war"". In response to Zelensky’s calls for more Western involvement in peace negotiations, a US state department spokesperson said: ""If there are diplomatic steps that we can take that the Ukrainian government believes would be helpful, we're prepared to take them."" Crisis talks continue between the two slides via video link, Russia’s RIA news agency reported. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that fighting continues northwest of the capital, with the main bulk of Russia’s ground forces 25km from the capital. Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain surrounded and under heavy Russian shelling, it said. Russia’s invasion has been met with nearly universally condemnation and drawn tough sanctions from the west. Moscow’s brutal attacks have trapped thousands of people as the conflict has besieged cities and sent over 2.5million Ukrainians fleeing. Ukrainian officials had planned to use humanitarian corridors from Mariupol as well as towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv, Sumy and some other areas on Saturday. The governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing on Saturday morning though some evacuations were proceeding. The Donetsk region's governor said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into the southern city of Mariupol. ""There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,"" the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. ""Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.""",17,2.5091444742150344,4.869395899638594,-2.3602514254235594,26

Russia has already lost three major generals in less than three weeks of fighting, since the invasion began on February 24. Former RAF Commander Edward Stringer said the presence of these figures so close to the frontline, and their deaths, does not bode well for Russia. On Friday, it was reported that the commander of the Eastern Military District, Andrei Kolesnikov, had died. This came within days of his colleagues Vitaly Gerasimov of the 41st Army and Andrei Sukhovetsky of the Russian Airborne Forces also being killed in combat. The former RAF commander told Sky News: ""Critical reports that three Major Generals – Major Generals don't normally get that close to the front. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here ""If they do, something is going very badly wrong. It shows Russia is stretched to its elastic limit in Ukraine. ""And to try and salvage something from this, the generals are at the front whipping the troops for one last effort. ""If you've lost three generals, and you're claiming you've only lost about 500 troops, something doesn't add up and it suggests things are not going well militarily."" Whilst reports vary, Moscow has only killed around 500 Ukrainian soldiers so far - but lost more than 10,000 of its own troops. This means Russia is losing more troops every day - at least 588 a day. Western intelligence reported that Russia was taken back by the fierceness of Ukraine’s resistance which has seen it lose more tanks than Germany has across its total army. The cities of Kherson, in eastern Ukraine, and Melitopol, in the south, are the only large centres to have been officially taken by the Russians. Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol have been subjected to heavy, relentless shelling, forcing countless to flee, but they have not fallen yet. Russians are thought to have around 20 major generals in theatre in Ukraine. Western officials believe having such high-ranking officers so far forward to the front in the early stages of the invasion is significant. There have been widespread reports of morale among Russian troops is low after two weeks of the war, with footage emerging of allegedly captured soldiers claiming they were not aware they would be deployed to fight. General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th Combined Arms Army, was killed in fighting yesterday. His death followed the killings of Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, who died outside Kharkiv alongside senior officers, and Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky. Sukhovetsky was the first general to die and was reportedly killed by a sniper. Putin confirmed his death in a speech eight days into the invasion. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. Christo Grozev, executive director of investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, said that confirmation of his death would be a “major demotivator” for Russian troops. Sukhovetsky had reportedly been decorated for his role in annexing Crimea and Russian paper Pravda and graduated from Airborne Command School in 1995. The second general to die was Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, who also died this week. Ukraine's defence ministry said that Gerasimov was killed outside the eastern city of Kharkiv, along with other senior officers. The ministry also broadcasted what it said was a conversation between two Russian FSB officers discussing the general's death and complaining that their secure communications were no longer functioning inside Ukraine.",14,5.1531860793330715,4.090578986876638,1.0626070924564335,14

""In the train station, it's like seeing hundreds and hundreds of homeless people not knowing what to do next. ""The ones here have not got anything to sleep on. They've just got a day pack and a change of clothes. ""They don't want clothes, though. They want carry mats and sleeping bags."" Mr Dass said he stayed at a friend's apartment in the town, which he does not want to name, along with a mother and a six-year-old boy who had travelled from the area of the battered city of Kharkiv. He said the boy was so traumatised after the nine-day journey he just seemed to be in a trance. ""Somebody showed us a picture of their house but it's a pile of rubble, everything's gone,"" he added. He said five or six trains a day are arriving in the town from the east, each with a minimum of 250 refugees on board looking for help. A group of six of his friends have housed 300 to 400 people in the last three weeks. Mr Dass set off from Huddersfield earlier this week with a plan to take medical supplies to the hospital where his doctor friend works.

The unidentified soldier is now thought to be on the frontline.

Another ex-soldier who asked not to be named had a 13-year-old son and told the Mail: “We are seeing war crimes being committed in Ukraine and as a soldier, you can’t just stand by and see that happening. “That’s why those guys who went AWOL went, they were probably a bit fed up hanging around not doing any proper soldiering and so wanted to get stuck in. “I’m sure those guys who went AWOL felt like us, they wanted to put up some resistance against what is going on in Ukraine and take the Russians on.

The AWOL British soldier is thought to already be on the frontline facing Russians. He arrived in Poland earlier this week before crossing into the war-torn country and signing up with the Foreign Legion. The unnamed soldier initially joined other recruits at the base around 15 miles from Lviv. It's understood the unnamed serviceman, who abandoned his post in the UK, was made to sign a contract stating he would not leave Ukraine until the war was over as per martial law. He is also said to have handed over his passport and be earning £2,500 a month. The 19-year-old dropped his ceremonial duties as one of the prestigious Queen's Guards in Windsor to join the war effort. The teen - who has not been named for security reasons - was reportedly given an AK-47 and other equipment, as well as a uniform, and sent to capital Kyiv to fight. Hundreds of foreigners are thought to have joined Ukraine's Foreign Legion following Russia's invasion on February 24. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said earlier this week any serving British soldiers who are planning to abandon their posts to go fight in Ukraine could be prosecuted under desertion law. International law expert Dr David Turns told the Mirror those who choose to go AWOL and join the war could be wading into a legal quagmire. Theoretically, the 1870 law hasn't been used for more than 120 years, but it could punish civilians who make the journey to fight, he said. Unless foreign fighters are integrated into the Ukrainian armed forces they have little protection under international law if they are caught by Vladimir Putin's army. This means they could face prosecution as saboteurs, or heightened risk of being shot, Dr Turns warned. Meanwhile, the Armed Forces Act of 2006, which covers going AWOL as a criminal offence, carries a maximum punishment of two years in prison. Dr Turns added: ""They could be liable for prosecution either for absence without leave or desertion, although I think that's less likely in these circumstances.""

Ukraine's parliament has claimed the mayor was kidnapped by a group of 10 armed men who put a plastic bag over his head, Daily Mail reports. President Zelensky has called the alleged abduction a ""crime against democracy"" and said the acts by Russia would be treated as ""terrorism"". He said: ""The capture of the mayor of Melitopol is therefore a crime, not only against a particular person, against a particular community, and not only against Ukraine. It is a crime against democracy itself... The acts of the Russian invaders will be regarded like those of Islamic State terrorist."" Ukrainian officials have claimed that the mayor was kidnapped after he had ""refused to co-operate with the enemy"". Mr Zelensky said Russian forces ""have transitioned into a new stage of terror"". He added: ""They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders. ""Therefore, they have switched to a new stage of terror when they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of the legitimate local Ukrainian authorities. ""The whole country saw that Melitopol did not surrender to the invaders, and this will not be changed by putting pressure on mayors or kidnapping mayors."" In an address on Friday, March 11, Ukraine's President Zelensky described his colleague as ""a mayor who bravely defends Ukraine and the members of his community"". It was later claimed by a Russian separatist prosecutor in Luhansk that Fedorov was being investigated for terrorism offences. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of violating international law by abducting the mayor of Melitopol. Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement: ""The abduction of the mayor of Melitopol is classified as a war crime under the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocol, which prohibit the taking of civilian hostages during the war."" It comes as the sound of war continued to rip through Ukraine overnight with Russian troops edging closer to Ukraine's capital Kyiv.",17,4.43296040840633,4.4399347051291205,-0.006974296722790818,24

This would mark a serious escalation 15 days into Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv's Centre for Strategic Communications has said Belarusian troops may be drawn into invasion by 7pm local time, according to early data. It comes as the Ukrainian government has accused Putin of staging ""false flag"" air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to justify an intervention. They say two Su-25 bombers crossed the border from Belarus on Friday afternoon, carrying out attacks on Ukrainian soil, before bombing Belarus itself. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Ukrainian Defence Minister Olexiy Reznikov shared a Twitter thread detailing Putin's plans to run ""false flag"" air strikes from Ukrainian airspace. Addressing the people of Belarus, he said Ukraine is not planning an offensive with Belarus and warned that Putin was ""trying to bind you with blood"". An adviser to Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that Belarusian strongman Lukashenko was in a meeting with Putin in Moscow, at the time of the attack. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog The two countries have been close allies since the dismantling of the Soviet Union in 1991. The countries also share a border. Lukashenko is considered to be a puppet of Putin by many and has been regarded as Europe's last dictator. Belarus has been a staging post for Russian forces since before the invasion on February 24. Putin and Lukashenko agreed on Friday that Moscow would supply Belarus with up-to-date military equipment and on mutual support against Western sanctions, including on energy prices, the official Belarus Belta news agency said. Mr Reznikov wrote: ""I would like to address the Belarusian people. Based on the information in which we are fully confident and which we have confirmed, at this very moment, the command of the Russian occupation forces is preparing a series of bloody provocations. ""According to their criminal intent, the Russian aviation is preparing to launch a strike at several settlements on the territory of the Republic of Belarus located near the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. In particular, they are planning to hit the settlement of Kopany, Brest oblast. ""To mask this crime, Russia intends to carry out the strike from Ukrainian airspace. The purpose of this provocation is to force the current leadership of Belarus into war against Ukraine. Moscow is trying to bind you with blood. ""I guarantee that the Ukrainian army did not plan, is not planning and will not plan any aggressive actions against Belarus. During 15 days of the war, the Ukrainian armed forces liquidated over 12,000 Russian soldiers. ""Do not let your country be dragged into this war! Save the lives of your loved ones! Do not let the Kremlin destroy the future of Belarus!"" Putin recently said that there had been ""certain positive shifts"" in talks between his country and Ukraine recently, adding that they continued ""practically on a daily basis"". Belarus has reportedly been intimately involved in the invasion of Ukraine, with the country north of Ukraine serving as a staging ground for Russian troops in the months preceding the invasion.

Yegor Pochkaenko was killed the day before his 19th birthday after being moved 5,360 miles across his country to fight Vladamir Putin's conflict amid a string of teenage soldiers sent as cannon-fodder. On the Ukrainian side, children as young as six have been killed by shelling or starved or food and water as fighting rages on in civilian areas. Pochkaenko is one of only a handful dead Russian soldiers whose identities have been made public. The teen soldier was hailed a ‘hero’ in his home town of Belogorsk in Amur region, some 5,000 miles away from Russia's border with Ukraine. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here But the acknowledgement of his death comes amid a disagreement over the use of conscripts, some who are allegedly forced to enlist as contract soldiers. A classmate Dmitry Radchenko said his fallen friend was “kind and cheerful” and loved football. He had wanted to be a policeman before joining the army. Russia has failed to give reliable figures on its losses in a war it calls a “special military operation”, but the US has estimated the toll to be up to 6,000, with a large number wounded. Putin had publicly denied conscripts, usually aged 18 and 19, were deployed in Ukraine but he was contradicted by his own defence ministry. Its spokesperson Igor Konashenkov admitted: ""Unfortunately, we have uncovered several instances of the presence of conscripts in the Russian units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. “Almost all of those servicemen have been taken back to Russia.” This enraged Putin who demanded the chief military prosecutor examine the evidence and “punish officials” responsible for conscripts being deployed in Ukraine. Pochkaenko, despite his young age, was reported to be a contract soldier having been earlier conscripted. But a Russian senator Lyudmila Narusova, 69, has claimed conscripts were forcibly ordered to sign up as contract soldiers or that it happened without them knowing. She also told parliament that in one company of 100 young soldiers forced to fight in the conflict, only four survived. “They lie there with stray dogs gnawing at their faces,” she said. “Some cannot be identified because the bodies are so charred.” Ms Narusova's withering words are stinging for Putin since she is the widow of his political mentor and ex-law professor Anatoly Sobchak. She is also the mother of Ksenia Sobchak, 40, Russia's leading opposition woman politician whose childhood baptism was attended by Putin. Pochkaenko was posthumously honoured with the Order of Courage by Putin and he was given a military salute. “Yegor Pochkaenko died like a hero, not hiding behind the backs of his comrades,” said army comrade Aleksey Tarasov. “He was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. We remember him as a good soldier, we will always remember him as a hero. “ The Ministry of Defense offers condolences to the family and friends."" Andrey Dyumin, deputy prime minister of Amur region, six time zones east of Moscow, also hailed the fallen soldier. He said: “He defended us all: our country, our residents. “Unfortunately, the short peaceful periods of life in our country have always been replaced by a series of wars, when someone thought that they could trample on our Motherland, tear it apart. “Thanks to men like Yegor, this will not work.""",14,5.319672730036799,6.062772362956079,-0.7430996329192805,3

The TOS-1A multi-barrelled rockets have a range of five miles and are used in areas of urban resistance in an attempt to cause mass civilian casualties. The catastrophic weapons, usually mounted on a T-72 tank chassis, lead to horrific blasts which can cause wounds and other major physical damage to victims. The Kremlin has opted for the missiles to escalate its war while avoiding the nuclear threshold, according to reports. It is believed they have used them in Syria against Islamic State and have been brought into the war zone in Ukraine. For all the latest updates on the Ukraine invasion follow our live blog here This week, the UK Ministry of Defence confirmed its Russian counterparts had ""confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine"". It added in a statement on Twitter : ""The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects."" However, a US defence official said his country could not confirm the use of thermobaric weapons. He told reporters at a briefing: ""We know that they have the launching systems available to them in Ukraine that could be used for rockets that have a thermobaric warhead on them. ""But we cannot confirm that those weapons are in Ukraine and we cannot confirm any examples of use."" On February 24, the day Vladimir Putin announced the invasion, cameras installed on the Belarus-Ukraine border revealed a TOS-1A among other military vehicles entering Ukraine. Days later, more footage began to emerge on social media showing TOS-1As, as well as other heavy artillery, heading toward Ukraine, this time moving south from Russia’s Belgorod region. On February 26, US Senator Marco Rubio tweeted that Russia ""has now deployed TOS-1A launchers to the outskirts of heavily populated areas"". At the end of last month, the TOS-1 was identified near Mariupol, the southern port city which has seen some of the worst bomb strikes since the war began. There were some claims that the missiles were used during artillery attacks on the hotly contested town of Vasylkiv, around 15 miles south of Kyiv. A major explosion had occurred after a fuel farm at Vasylkiv Air Base took a direct hit, leading to such rumours. However, there's no evidence the TOS-1 was used. Also at hand for invading forces are Uragan long range thermobaric Multi Launch Rocket Systems, which have a range of 40 miles. One volley can destroy a square mile of territory. These weapons bridge the gap between nuclear and conventional, avoiding nuclear escalation, but achieving many of the same catastrophic effects. There are also lung-busting thermobaric vacuum missiles which cause an explosion so powerful and so hot that it blows out and then in on itself, sucking all of the oxygen from the immediate area. Russia has already admitted using these Soviet-era weapon-launched rockets which create higher temperatures and more damaging explosions that last longer than conventional blasts. Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova claimed the vaccum bomb has already been used in the invasion, though this has not yet been confirmed and the ambassador gave no indication as to where it had been used. She said earlier this month: ""They used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva Convention."" A CIA study said of the bombs: ""Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness."" The White House Press Secretary said if the ambassador's claims are indeed true, then the act of using them would be a ""war crime"". However, The Guardian was told that the bombs are indeed legal. A senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Dr Marcus Hellyer, said: ""They are not illegal even though their effects can be pretty horrific, because of that effect of creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders."" When Putin announced the invasion of Ukraine on February 20, few expected successful resistance for so long. But as the days have gone on, the Kremlin has resorted to more extreme measures, including heavy bombardment of Ukrainian cities via airstrikes.",17,4.685705643246373,5.527062669083412,-0.8413570258370386,27

At the time of writing, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is still holed up in the city, having pledged to remain in the country until the fighting is done. The Russian column, thought to be up to 40 miles long, ominously disappeared into surrounding towns and forests, according to satellite imagery, after it appeared to become stuck and break down in the early days of the fighting. On March 11, Dnipro in the east of Ukraine and the country’s fourth-largest city sustained heavy damage from Russian artillery despite having not come under major attack until this point in the conflict. Russian invasion forces entered Ukraine, the largest country in Europe, from multiple different angles. Troops initially entered from the north via Belarus and western Russia. In the east forces came from the already contested Ukrainian regions of Donestk and Luhansk, while in the south, naval attacks were paired with an invasion from Crimea, which too has been contested since its annexation by Russia in 2014. But now, on day 16 of the invasion, which cities are currently under attack and how far have Russian forces reached according to the latest map data available? Kyiv , the nation’s capital, has been the scene of heightened Russian shelling, with Russian forces thought to be closing in on the city. The 40-mile convoy is thought to have redeployed closer to the city, in what has been interpreted by some as a move to encircle the capital. At the time of writing the city remains free, despite ongoing attacks. President Zelensky is believed to still be in the city despite being at threat from roving assassination squads. The eastern city of Dnipro suffered its first major attack on Friday, March 11. This city holds strategic importance as a means of supplying Ukrainian forces on the eastern front, acting as an artery between the nation’s east and west. Mykolaiv , a strategically important city on the banks of the Pivdennyi Buh River close to the Black Sea, southern Ukraine, is thought to be resisting despite heavy bombardment.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In the north, civilians are fleeing Sumy, which has spent much of the conflict on the frontline with heavy shelling, along with the loss of basic amenities like water and power. Russian forces have attacked areas to the south of the city but are yet to establish a firm grip. To its east, the city of Kharkiv - the second largest in the country - has been the scene of brutal fighting. Formerly home to 1.4 million people, the city has become a battlefield. Missiles and bombs are now commonplace and destruction across the city is widespread. At the time of writing, however, it is not thought to have fallen to the invaders, as the battle for Kharkiv rages on. Dozens of civilians have been reported killed, with shelling nightly. Mariupol , a southeastern port city on the coast of the Sea of Azov, is now completely surrounded by Russian forces and is under siege from all angles. Residents report being unable to leave and are subjected to brutal Russian shelling and bombardment. Fears of widespread civilian loss of life have continued to grow, as images of bodies being dumped in mass graves have surfaced online, after more than a week of siege. Some 1,200 have been killed there. The northern city of Chernihiv , close to both the Russian and Belarusian borders, has been under heavy bombardment and the scene of fierce fighting. The southern city of Kherson has fallen to Russian forces, but citizens are continuing to resist what Russian state media has falsely described as ‘liberation’. Russian tanks reached the city within five days Chernobyl , the site of the 1986 nuclear power plant disaster, has also fallen under Russian control. Donetsk and Luhansk , eastern Ukrainian cities that have been the epicentre of the pro-Russian separatist movement since 2014, remain under Russian influence.",17,4.17355681625347,5.71721601825005,-1.5436592019965802,19

Moscow triggered an United Nations Security Council emergency meeting on Friday to discuss what the Kremlin claims are ""the military biological activities of the US on the territory of Ukraine"". Kyiv and Washington have dismissed the allegation, warning it could be Russia paving the way for a “false flag” attack before launching its own chemical weapons. Technology Minister Chris Philp told Sky News: ""Clearly, the use of chemical weapons, especially in an invasion where there are a very large number of civilians, would be an outrage against humanity. ""I would say to anybody in Russia thinking about this - do not cross that line, do not inflict any more misery and suffering on the Ukrainian people.

""I'm not going to speculate about the form that's going to take or pre-empt it, but that's a line that Russian governments should not cross."" Downing Street warned of a ""robust"" response against Russia if the Kremlin uses chemical weapons in Ukraine. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ""The international community has always responded robustly following the use of chemical weapons. ""I'm not going to get into hypotheticals and try and look into the future, but you've seen what the Prime Minister's said and we continue to call for Russia not to use chemical weapons."" It comes after Boris Johnson expressed fears Russia could kill millions - and admitted ""I can’t see a way out” unless Russia withdraws its troops. He said the threats over chemical weapons were ""straight out of their playbook"" and expressed fears Russia was preparing fake news stories on chemical weapons held by their opponents to justify an action. Asked if that is what he expects next, the Prime Minister said: “I just note that that is what they’re already doing - it’s a cynical, barbaric government I’m afraid”. Meanwhile, Mr Philp said he would be ""in the streets"" if there was an attack on his Croydon South constituency. “The Ukrainian army and Ukrainian citizens have every right to defend their homeland, to defend their cities and their towns, to defend their hospitals against this aggression by Russia,” he said. “And to be honest, if somebody was attacking Croydon, the place I represent, if somebody was bombing Croydon University Hospital, I tell you what, I would be in the streets defending my hospital. ""I’d be in the streets defending my town and my neighbours as Ukrainians are quite rightly doing.” He promised details of a new humanitarian route for refugees fleeing the invasion to seek sanctuary in the UK in the ""very near future"" after the scheme was hit by delays.

The Russian Space Agency issued the terrifying warning in response to harsh sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. Agency head Dmitry Rogozin said that Russia may abandon Mark Vande Hei who was set to return to Earth aboard a Russian spacecraft at the end of March. US President Joe Biden announced sanctions on Russia that would ""degrade"" the country's aerospace industry and space programme. Vande Hei is been scheduled to touch down in Kazakhstan with his two Russian counterparts aboard a Russian spacecraft. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here But Mr Rogozin cast doubt over the US astronaut's safety and said that the space lab would crash into the US if Russia did not help to move it away from space junk, reports the Express. US and Russian astronauts were the first to step inside the ISS in 1998 where research led to some of the most important findings of the 21st century. Now 227 miles below the floating lab, Russia has waged a war against Ukraine separating it from the US and its allies. The ISS has become the latest focus after relations soured over the crippling US sanctions slapped on Russia over the invasion. Former US astronaut Scott Kelly told of his fury at Mr Rogozin's threatening message, which was shared in a video on social media. But he added that he was not convinced of Russia's threat to the safety of America. ""I never thought I would hear anything so outrageous,"" he told ABC News. ""I think it is just a crazy threat. It is not really based on reality. ""We do have the ability to control the orbit of the space station independent of the Russian space agency, so I don't really see that happening."" The ISS is currently split into two sections, one controlled by Russia and the other run by the US. But the feud just marks the latest in an ongoing to-and-fro between the two space teams. Tensions rose between Mr Rogozin and Mr Kelly in a public disagreement on social media last week. Mr Rogozin posted a clip of Russian astronauts covering up British and US flags on Russia's Soyuz rocket. “The launchers at Baikonur decided that without the flags of some countries, our rocket would look more beautiful,” he said. Responding to the post, Mr Kelly tweeted: ""Without those flags and the foreign exchange they bring in, your space program won't be worth a damn. ""Maybe you can find a job at McDonald's if McDonald's still exists in Russia."" McDonald's closed all its restaurants in Russia, followed by Coca-Cola and Starbucks, in response to its attack on Ukraine. Meanwhile Russia's space agency Roscosmos announced that it will stop rocket engines to US companies. Last week, Russia refused to send OneWeb satellites into space despite a scheduled launch. The company, which is partly British owned with a Government share, was counting on Russia as a launch partner to help complete its 648 satellite constellation. NASA was considering whether to kill off the ISS by crashing it into the ocean within the next ten years with plans to take it out of orbit in January 2031. Point Nemo, Latin for 'no-one', is the ideal spot to sink it being the furthest point from land on Earth. Some 244 astronauts have stepped onto the space lab since its launch in 1998 but all of its mission goals will have been achieved by the end of this decade.",3,7.179223704563745,7.286211320649336,-0.1069876160855916,7

The home suffered extensive damage and it is now without heating, electricity or water. Some of the people staying at the home require wheelchairs, although 63 individuals have been evacuated since the bombing. It comes after three people were killed when Russia bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Regional official Oleg Sinegubov wrote on Telegram: ""The enemy today hit a specialised establishment for disabled people near Oskil."" He added that 10 people inside the home needed wheelchairs, while 50 had reduced mobility. Another local official, Yuriy Shparaga, wrote on Facebook : ""The Russians have again carried out a brutal attack against civilians. It is a war crime against civilians. ""There is no more heating, electricity and water access (in the home). Luckily, there are no victims."" The victims include a six-year-old child and at least seventeen others were reportedly injured, some of whom included pregnant women. Sergei Orlov, Mariupol's deputy mayor, said: ""I'm absolutely sure they know about this facility and this is their third hospital that they are destroying in this city."" He said a 300-bed hospital dedicated to treating Covid patients had been destroyed by artillery shelling the previous day, along with a blood-collection centre in Mariupol. ""I'm absolutely sure (these are their) targets,"" Mr Orlov added. The World Health Organization says it's verified at least 18 different attacks on health facilities in Ukraine since the invasion began. Russia insists Ukrainian fighters had moved staff and patients out of the hospital and set up firing positions there. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has accused Russia of committing a war crime. It comes after harrowing satellite footage was released showing the impact constant air attacks have had on the southern port city. Private US satellite firm Maxar has released before and after snaps of Mariupol, which has been surrounded by Kremlin troops amid regular air strikes. Extensive damage is seen to the eastern city's civilian infrastructure, including residential homes, high-rise apartment buildings, supermarkets and shopping centres. Zelensky tweeted out footage of the barbaric attack and once again called out Moscow's atrocities in his country. He said: ""Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings!

Russia warned the UN Security Council about this three days ago.” In a follow up tweet they added: “It’s the indeed pregnant [Ukrainian] beauty blogger Marianna Podgurskaya. “She actually played roles of both pregnant women on the photos. “First photos were actually taken by famous propagandist photographer Evgeniy Maloletka, rather than rescuers and witnesses as one would expect.” Evgeniy Maloletka is in fact a photographer for respected news agency the Associated Press.

The tweet was reported by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) and has since been removed with a note in its place saying: ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.""

Russian forces are encircling the city of Mykolaiv, a major Black Sea shipbuilding centre and key strategic target for the Kremlin. But the Ukrainian general who is leading the defence of the city has warned that any attacking troops will end up as more food for stray dogs in the streets. General Dmytro Marchenko is in charge of the garrison in Mykolaiv and has vowed that for each Ukrainian civilian who dies, he and his men will kill ten Russians. One Russian attack has already been repelled and the general claimed the streets are littered with Russian dead. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine?

The rest of them will become dog food.” Ukraine ’s military said it is fighting “fierce battles” with invading Russian forces on the edge of the city. Marchenko told The New York Times that they were slowly wearing down Russian troops attacking the city. He said: ""We fight them day and night, we don't let them sleep. They get up in the morning disoriented, tired. Their moral psychological state is simply broken."" Whilst Ukrainian forces are still in control of the city, it remains under very heavy bombardment from Russian aircrafts and artillery. Several fires in residential areas, caused by Russian rockets, have had to been put out, according to city authorities. Marchenko’s comrade, Colonel Sviatoslav Stetsenko, has vowed that his troops will fight to the death to defend their city. Even though Stetsenko retired from the military in 2010, he re-enlisted after Russia invaded. As a young soldier, Stetsenko. 56, once served in the Soviet military and marched alongside many of the current generation of Russian commanders. ""They are now my enemy,"" he told the New York Times. ""And each one of them who comes here with arms, who comes here as an invader, I will do everything I can to ensure that he remains as fertiliser for our land.""

2022-03-11,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inept-russian-invasion-tactics-leaving-26448417,'Inept' Russian invasion tactics leave military experts baffled,"Russia’s ""inept"" battle tactics during its invasion of Ukraine have left military experts scratching their heads. A number of experts, analysts and academics have lambasted the approach taken by Putin's forces, who have suffered heavy losses with seemingly clueless attack strategies that have seen them often fail to make meaningful inroads into Ukraine ’s urban centres. One particularly baffling example of seeming ineptitude was highlighted when drone footage yesterday showed a column of Russian tanks being picked off one-by-one in an ambush by Ukrainian forces. Military experts and analysts were questioning how and why the Russian tank commanders allowed themselves to walk straight into a death trap, driving down the middle of a main road. Multiple sources have agreed that so far the number of tanks lost by Putin’s army is so great it exceeds the number owned by the entire German army. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The devastating artillery attacks in Brovary destroyed a number of Russian T-72 tanks and other vehicles. The ambush added to Moscow’s misery that has been compounded by heavier than expected losse, the onset of freezing temperatures and reported low morale among troops. Reports said that Russia ’s 6th tank regiment escaped with minimal casualties but commander Andrei Zakharov was reportedly killed, sending troops into panic mode and the unit into retreat. Franz-Stefan Gady, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that the fight highlighted the danger of not securing urban territory before advancing. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog He said on Twitter : ""Fight shows the danger of not securing urban terrain with adequate infantry plus recon. assets when main elements of a force pass through urban terrain ideally suitable for ambushes."" Rob Lee, a Senior Fellow and military expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said that the ambush displayed “very poor tactics”. He tweeted: ""Very poor tactics displayed by this Russian armored force so close to Kyiv. They're well within range of Ukrainian artillery in Kyiv, they're on an obvious avenue of approach, and they still decided to bunch up like this, leaving them more vulnerable to indirect fire."" Similarly, the Austrian military’s research and development department proved that the column which was ambushed was a part of a larger Russian Battle Tactical Group. They picked out some key points that led up to the ambush. The large group of Russian vehicles, at least 30 tanks, approached Kyiv on a main road in the north-east suburb of Brovary. Given the size of the column, Ukrainian forces would have known it was coming and would have predicted it would take the route. The Russian commanders could have chosen to take a safer route around the densely built up residential area, but chose to simply push on. Ukraine’s forces used a UAV spotter drone to pick the targets out from above, then began launching strikes from a safe distance. Despite the fact that missiles had already hit the road ahead and fields either side, the forces kept to the main road. The column used soviet-era movements, driving the vehicles bumper to bumper as they entered the chokepoint with houses either side. This meant they had only two escape routes, forwards onto Kyiv, or retreating. Ukrainian artillery brought the column grinding to a halt in the village of Skybyn. The vehicles of the column were too tightly packed to move, leaving the Russians sitting ducks to Ukrainian fire. Drone footage shows artillery strikes narrowly missing the tanks, and one of the BTR-82 armoured carriers received a direct strike and explodes in flames. Another flank was also hit and destroyed. This left the column with no choice but a humiliating defeat, with tanks seen driving north-east away from Kyiv. This was but just one example of the poor tactics employed by the Kremlin’s forces that has turned what they planned to be a lightning invasion into a prolonged war. The true scale of Putin’s losses are unknown but Ukraine has claimed that it has killed over 12,000 troops, destroyed more than 350 tanks, 80 helicopters, 125 artillery units, 1,150 personnel carriers and nearly 60 planes. Military tracking website Oryx uses figures based on visual confirmation has suggested over 1,000 Russian vehicles have been destroyed, damaged, left behind, or captured by Ukraine so far.",14,4.524855020008063,4.203204350025633,0.3216506699824304,8

The 40-mile armoured column was last seen on February 28 on a highway leading to Kyiv after the Russian military broke down and soldiers knocked on village doors for food. But the vehicles appear to have been fixed and are on the move again, with rocket artillery moved into firing positions for an attack on the city, pictures suggests. A break in cloud cover on Thursday revealed how the Russian army has dispersed its convoy, which was a sitting duck for Ukrainian troops, drones, anti-tank weapons and jets. Footage taken from above shows supply trucks and rocket artillery set up at the edge of farm fields in the small town of Berestyanka, around 30 miles north of Kyiv, reports the Mail Online. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It is thought this is in preparation for an attack on the capital as the Russians tighten the noose around it. Some witnesses say this began on Thursday, with two assaults from the east and west that were blocked. Russian vehicles were also seen stopping in the forests of Lub'yanka and in civilian areas of Ozera which could be an attempt to make them less vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks. While those that remain on the highway north of Ivankiv have been spread out, also making them less vulnerable to Ukrainian bombing attacks and artillery fire. The huge convoy was originally pictured with its tanks close together with fears of an imminent and terrifying attack on the capital. Despite the stalling, the fight for Kyiv is already underway according to officials from the Institute for the Study of War. US intelligence suggests that Russian soldiers have advanced to the west of the city, inching three miles closer to the centre. Tanks are just nine miles away from the central government district compared to 13 miles previously, the Pentagon announced on Thursday. Ukrainians have been fighting every inch of ground since the start of the Russian invasion last Thursday. But Russian President Vladimir Putin is throwing much more armoury and troops into the battle. Irpin, on the edge of Kyiv, has been subjected to horrific bombings in recent days with footage of Russian tanks and soldiers moving through the town. Images show the bodies of women and children strewn on the roadside among other refugees being hit by Russian shelling. Russia claimed on Friday that 16,000 people from the Middle East have asked to fight for Russia in Ukraine. The country has widened its offensive with assaults on three cities targeted for the first time. Meanwhile fears remain that Russian is planning a false flag attack to justify the use of chemical weapons. Russian state TV has hit out at the invasion of Ukraine in a stinging attack on Putin's war. Guests on the popular primetime show risked the wrath of the president by defying him on air.

The Russian military is now believed to be just three miles from the city's limits, a senior US defence official said. A 40-mile long convoy of Russian tanks has been slowly advancing towards the capital as ambush attempts and shelling have been seen on the outskirts. Russian troops launched two attacks in the area - one in the western city of Irpin and another on the east side of Brovary. Video of the attack in Bovary shows Russian tanks being ambushed with heavy artillery before turning back. Colonel Andrei Zakharov, commander of the tank regiment, was also killed in the ambush according to the Ukrainian defence ministry. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, said his forces also stopped the attack in Irpin. In an update today, the Ukrainian military said it had stopped Russia's attempt to cross the Irpin River in the town of Moshchun. Denysenko said: ""The night was quite difficult, but in general we can say that the Ukrainian army counterattacked near Kyiv. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog ""There is no further detailed information yet."" Putin's efforts to surround the capital continued today as more fighting has been reported on the southwest side of Kyiv. A full-scale assault on the Ukrainian capital could be on the horizon as there are fears Putin could launch similar airstrikes as he did on the city of Mariupol and Kharkiv. In Mariupol, a maternity hospital was hit and killed three, including a six-year-old girl. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is still in Kyiv, today said his ""heart breaks at what the occupants have done with our cities, our country, and at what they want to do to our people"",who he said needed ""urgent help"". Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said today that the capital has been turned into a fortress ahead of the Russian assault. He said in televised remarks: ""Every street, every house is being fortified, the territorial defence is joining. ""Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands."" Troops are warning civilians not to stray beyond the outskirts of the city because Russian vehicles had been spotted just a few miles away. If Putin's troops encircle Kyiv, they could shell it as they have done to Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Ukrainian officials say Mariupol continues to be surrounded by Russian forces but is still in Ukrainian control. They said Ukrainian fighter jets and anti-aircraft missile units destroyed four Russian Su-25 attack jets and two Russian helicopters over the past 2 days. It comes as chilling photos from Mariupol showing corpses being discarded in mass grave sites as the death toll in the city grows. This week it was revealed more than 1,200 people have died in the port city, formerly the home of nearly half a million people, since the start of the Russian invasion. Described by rescuers as a humanitarian crisis, authorities have ordered workers to dig 25 metre long trenches as morgues are at breaking point. In tragic scenes, they were seen making the sign of the cross as the dead- wrapped in an old carpet- are pushed into the makeshift mass graves. Forty bodies were dumped in the trench in the cemetery on Tuesday, followed by 30 more on Wednesday. They were said to be both civilians and soldiers No family members were seen at the gravesite to say goodbye to their loved ones. Ukraine estimates that Russia has lost some 12,000 troops in the fighting, along with 335 tanks, 1,100 armoured personnel carriers, 500 vehicles, 81 helicopters and 49 planes.

As many as 1,200 have died during a brutal nine-day siege leaving more than 200,000 running out of water and food, desperate for evacuation. Grim images have emerged of a 25 metres long long trench being filled with bodies, wrapped in carpets and sacking. Officials try to dignify the appalling scenes by making the sign of the cross before the remains of friends and neighbours, even relatives are pushed into the hole. Today Russian shelling of the key port city - scene of the barbaric bombing of a hospital’s maternity ward - again smashed hopes of civilians evacuating. A window for 200,000 trapped civilians to start fleeing in a humanitarian convoy was smashed by artillery a day after two adults and a child were killed in the city medical centre. Residents have been cowering under fire, and without power, water or food in the Black Sea port city for days whilst repeated ceasefires” were broken by Russian forces. Mariupol is reeling from the Wednesday horror bombing of the hospital which wounded 18 and amongst the three dead, killed a six year-old girl, sparking global disgust. There are escalating fears Vladimir Putin will order commanders to become more ruthless after he sacked eight generals and is said to be furious with his FSB spy agency. Enraged Putin is said to be angry with the FSB for wrongly advising him that Ukraine was weak and ripe for attack- as his military campaign is proving a disaster. Devastating imagery of Moscow’s tanks has also emerged - with five vehicles being targeted as they are ambushed by Ukraine’s defiant anti-tank teams. It is possible some of the tanks were targeted by drones on the outskirts of Brovary, in the Kyiv region this morning, their crews obliterated. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Another of Putin’s tanks was left abandoned and in flames in the area as his troops pushed on towards the capital, the latest among hundreds of tanks destroyed. Now it is feared Moscow’s troops are increasingly turning on civilian targets to try and force Ukraine’s troops to stop fighting. Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor said Russian aircraft were targeting routes that humanitarian aid was trying to use to enter the city, and along evacuation routes. He said: “We try and try and try, but I’m not sure if it’ll be possible today - or other days. “Airstrikes started from the early morning. Airstrike after airstrike. All the historic centre is under bombardment.” The bombardment, he said, had continued “without any gaps, without any pause”, hitting houses and buildings. He added: “They want to absolutely delete our city, delete our people. They want to stop any evacuation.” Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Russia was deliberately preventing the evacuation of civilians because it had failed to seize the key port city. Zelenskiy accused Russia of carrying out genocide after officials said Russian aircraft had bombed the hospital in Mariupol, burying patients in rubble and breaking a ceasefire deal. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Moscow would look into the incident. Other Russian officials rejected what they said was “fake news, with one saying the hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian troops. But Zelenskiy said in a televised address: “Like always, they lie confidently.” The Wednesday attack wounded 17 people, including women waiting to give birth, doctors, and children buried in the rubble. Bombs also fell on two hospitals in another city west of the capital. Ukraine’s health minister Viktor Lyashko said Russia has already fired on 63 hospitals in his country, killing five doctors and seriously injuring over ten. In Zhytomyr, a city of 260,000 to the west of Kyiv, bombs fell on two hospitals, one of them a children’s hospital, mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn said on Facebook. Some lightly wounded medical experts had struggled to return to their duties he said. Today it emerged the ground shook more than a mile away when a series of blasts hit the medical facility in Mariupol. Explosions blew out windows and ripped away much of the front of one building. Police and soldiers rushed to the scene to evacuate victims, carrying a bleeding woman with a swollen belly on a stretcher past burning and mangled cars. Another woman wailed as she clutched her child. In the courtyard, a blast crater extended at least two floors deep. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Mariupol strike trapped children and others under debris. Mr Zelensky has urged the West to impose even tougher sanctions in Russia. Britain’s armed forces minister, James Heappey, said the strike “is a war crime” regardless of whether it was deliberate. Two weeks into Russia’s assault on Ukraine, its military is struggling after suffering well-over 12,000 deaths among its 150,000-strong attack force. Increasingly Russian forces appear to be falling back on superior artillery and air power with more deadly weapons coming into Ukraine, such as its thermobaric missile systems.

Talks between Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers on Thursday failed to bring any respite in the two-week-old conflict as hundreds of thousands of civilians remained trapped in Ukrainian cities sheltering from Russian air raids and shelling. The news comes as horrifying pictures of mass graves emerge from the besieged city of Mariupol and reports of a the Russian advance slowing throughout Ukraine. Moscow violated an expected ceasefire on Wednesday, continuing heavy shelling on Mariupol, raising questions about whether the latest announcement of humanitarian corridors will be respected by forces on the ground. The Black Sea port city, home to over 400,000 people, has endured days of intense shelling with aid agencies saying humanitarian help is desperately needed as trapped residents are without food, power or water. This latest announcement, of humanitarian corridors from the embattled urban centres, would allow vital aid to reach civilians trapped inside and allow trapped Ukrainians to flee. Russia is committing an increasing number of its forces to encircling key cities in Ukraine, slowing its advance through the country, Britain's defence ministry said on Thursday.

The Prime Minister is the most senior figure yet to sound the alarm after concerns about chemical weapons were voiced over the last 24 hours by Western officials, the US, and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. He told Sky News’ new show Beth Rigby Interviews: “I’ll make you one other prediction by the way, which is the stuff you’re hearing about chemical weapons is straight out of their playbook. “They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or the Americans. “And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of… fake story ready to go. “You’ve seen it in Syria, you saw it even in the UK.” Asked if that is what he expects next, the Prime Minister replied: “I just note that that is what they’re already doing - it’s a cynical, barbaric government I’m afraid”. Earlier Ms Truss said she was ""concerned"" that Vladimir Putin may use chemical weapons in Ukraine and if so it would be a ""grave mistake"". She also branded the bombing of a children's hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol a ""war crime"" The PM and Foreign Secretary's chilling remarks came hours after Western officials expressed ""serious concerns"" that Russia could use chemical weapons. Yesterday an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “We’re seeing some of the disinformation come out of Moscow about non-conventional weapons. “We saw this in Syria, the Russians starting that talk when they or their proxies were about to use those weapons there.” Worries are mounting among allied governments after Moscow was seen “setting the scene” for such an attack. Russia-backed Syria was repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons in the country's bloody war, but Russia vetoed a 2017 UN resolution that would have looked into who was responsible. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found people were exposed to sarin gas in 2017 in the Khan Shaykhun area but did not identify who was responsible. A Russian air strike badly damaged a children's hospital in the besieged Ukraniian port city of Mariupol yesterday, burying patients under rubble and injuring women in labour, Ukraine said. The bombing, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called an ""atrocity,"" took place despite an agreed ceasefire to enable thousands of civilians trapped in the city to escape. The city council said the hospital had been hit several times by an air strike, causing ""colossal"" destruction. In tweets branded ""disinformation"" by Downing Street, Russia's foreign ministry claimed there were no patients at the hospital and it was being used by 'Nazi' Ukrainian forces for battle. But Ukraine's UK ambassador last night said Russia’s bombing of a maternity and children’s hospital in Mariupol was a “red, red, red line” and NATO must intervene. Vadym Prystaiko told BBC Question Time: “I believe there is something not that could be done, but should be done to stop it… What is the red line for NATO to come and help us?"" He also raised Putin’s attacks on fleeing civilians and a nuclear power station, saying: “All of these are very red lines we don’t want him to cross, and the sooner we tell him the better. “If you ask me who can tell him, I would guess nations who promised to defend us when we gave up nuclear weapons - these people should tell him. “The United States, United Kingdom, and later on China and France who all joined the memorandum.” The UK has refused to back a no-fly zone, saying it could lead to all-out war between nuclear-armed NATO and nuclear-armed Russia.",17,5.013244360029605,3.4953715959045653,1.5178727641250394,28

Around 16 soldiers have been filmed walking through the devastation and it is not clear from the video whether they are part of a larger convoy. Some of the vehicles have the distinctive “V” sign that is used by the Russians while others are camouflaged and parked near trees in an apparent attempt to hide them. A massive 40 mile-long Russian military convoy has been heading south from the Belarus border but it had ground to a halt apparently due to mechanical problems and a lack of supplies. “It’s bad,” one resident who abandoned Irpin told ITN News. “There’s no water, no electricity, nothing to cook with. Horrible. Our guys are saving us and friends are helping us."" The woman said she had travelled 500 miles from the besieged town of Mariupol to Irpin to help care for her grandchildren in the town. She explained“They (my children) left with the babies but they didn’t manage to come back.” The sighting of the Russians close to the capital comes amid claims that they are “tightening the noose” around Kyiv, by a western official who has predicted “horrific” scenes when they arrive. “I think around Kyiv they are continuing to tighten the noose .. this is definitely not over. They are still set on moving in. It’ll be utterly horrific when they do,” they said, reported The Times. Ukrainians have said they will defend Kyiv to the death and have been preparing with barricades, trenches and molotov cocktails.

The missile is seen as one of the deadliest on the modern-day battlefield, so much so its use is strictly regulated. The Russian missiles explode at a much higher temperature than most missiles, and their blasts last longer than conventional weapons. They are fired by the TOS-1A, an armoured rocket launcher, which can be used to destroy infrastructure and due the heat it produces it can cause massive damage to internal organs and cause flash burns. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that previous footage had shown Moscow was using the TOS-1A against Ukraine, and if Putin was to use this against civilians it would be illegal. Sebastian Roblin, a military expert, writing for 19fortyfive.com, said: ""A TOS-1 rocket barrage will wipe out everything within the 200-by-300m blast zone."" According to Military Today, the TOS-1A was adopted by the Russian Army in 2001 and is is capable of launching the deadly thermobaric missiles. Defence and national security commentator Charlie Gao described the weapons as ""are very useful weapons for a military that might be going into urban combat with little regard for collateral damage.""

The attack, which is reported to have left at least 17 people wounded, has been branded an ""atrocity"" by President Volodymyr Zelensky. It happened in the port city of Mariupol, with the bombing prompting fresh calls for Western nations to impose a no-fly zone. Mr Zelensky posted footage online showing the damage from what he said was a ""direct strike"" on the hospital, with windows blown out and debris strewn through the corridors. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity!"" he tweeted. ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings!

As details of the strike emerged, Boris Johnson tweeted: ""There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless."" He said the UK was considering more support for Ukraine to defend itself against airstrikes and would hold President Vladimir Putin to account ""for his terrible crimes"". At least 1,170 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the Russian invasion, according to Ukrainian authorities. The United States says it has seen indications that Russia's military is using so-called ""dumb bombs"" - unguided missiles which greatly increase the risk of missing targets. A senior US defence official told Reuters: ""We do have indications that the Russians are in fact dropping some dumb munitions."" Earlier Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the MPs that the Ministry of Defence was looking at whether they could supply anti-aircraft missiles as well as more anti-tank weapons. In Washington, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the strike was ""absolutely abhorrent"", but continued to reject calls from the government in Kyiv for a no-fly zone. ""The reality is that setting up a no-fly zone would lead to a direct confrontation between Nato and Russia, and that is not what we're looking at,"" she told a joint news conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

Olena Zelenska, wife of President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, said the Russian leader had underestimated her country's resolve and said citizens stood united against the ""aggressor"". In an open letter published on social media, Ms Zelenska highlighted the tragic child casualties, and said ordinary citizens were living a ""horrific reality"" because of the Russian bombardment. Hundreds of civilians, including civilians, have been killed while an estimated two million have been forced to flee as missiles rain down on cities across the country. Ms Zelenska's letter said: ""Despite assurances from Kremlin-backed propaganda outlets, who call this a 'special operation' - it is, in fact, the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians."" Scroll down to read Olena Zelenska's letter in full She highlighted the cases of three young lives lost - eight-year-old Alice, Polina from Kyiv and 14-year-old Arseniy, stating: ""When Russia says that it is 'not waging war against civilians,' I call out the names of these murdered children first. ""Our women and children now live in bomb shelters and basements. You have most likely all seen these images from Kyiv and Kharkiv metro stations, where people lie on the floors with their children and pets - trapped beneath.

The President's wife said despite the horrors unleashed on the civilian population, Ukrainians would not give up. Her open letter states: ""The aggressor, Putin, thought that he would unleash blitzkrieg on Ukraine. But he underestimated our country, our people, and their patriotism. ""Ukrainians, regardless of political views, native language, beliefs, and nationalities, stand in unparalleled unity. ""While Kremlin propagandists bragged that Ukrainians would welcome them with flowers as saviours, they have been shunned with Molotov cocktails."" Earlier President Zelenskyy addressed British MPs, telling them: ""We will not give up and we will not lose. We will fight to the end at sea, in the air. ""We will continue fighting for our land whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets."" ""Recently, an overwhelming number of media outlets from around the world have reached out with requests for interviews. This letter serves as my answer to these requests and is my testimony from Ukraine. ""What happened just over a week ago was impossible to believe.

In some cities families cannot get out of the bomb shelters for several days in a row because of the indiscriminate and deliberate bombing and shelling of civilian infrastructure. ""The first newborn of the war, saw the concrete ceiling of the basement, their first breath was the acrid air of the underground, and they were greeted by a community trapped and terrorized. At this point, there are several dozen children who have never known peace in their lives. ""This war is being waged against the civilian population, and not just through shelling.

War against these innocent people is a double crime. ""Our roads are flooded with refugees.

2022-03-09,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russias-troops-face-dying-tanks-26421949,Russian troops face dying in -20C cold as tanks turn into 'iron freezers',"A cold snap bringing bone-chilling temperatures of -20C could cause Vladimir Putin ’s soldiers in the 40-mile convoy stalled outside Kyiv to freeze to death in their tanks, according to a former army major. The huge convoy of tanks and vehicles has been stuck on roads positioned around 30 miles from Ukraine ’s capital for several days amid claims of mechanical issues and empty fuel tanks. The weapons of death could become tombs for Russian soldiers in the coming days with conditions set to drop to -10C at night - and even colder with the added windchill factor. Putin’s Moscow fighters are not equipped for severe cold war fighting. Former British Army Major Kevin Price told MailOnline the invaders’ tanks will become “40-ton freezers” for those still inside, which will destroy morale. Glen Grant, a senior defence expert at the Baltic Security Foundation, said the Russians inside the convoy may have to surrender to avoid freezing to death. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog He told Newsweek: “You just can't sit around and wait because if you are in the vehicle you are waiting to be killed. ""They are not stupid."" Reports have been heard of Putin’s troops overheard complaining about the war in calls to family and friends back home. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. While the soldiers shiver in sub-zero conditions, the falling temperatures will also cause a nightmare for Ukraine’s refugees. Forced out of their homes by constant Russian shelling, the plummeting conditions could cause the current humanitarian crisis in the country to worsen still further. Some cities, including Mariupol in the south east, currently have no power, water or heat, leading to fears those still inside their ravaged homes could die without help. Yesterday it was reported a six-year-old girl died from dehydration ""alone, weak, frightened, thirsty"" in the besieged city of Mariupol. Her tragic death came after spending days with no water, power or heating supplies. Last week Russian forces cornered the port city with constant airstrikes, leaving residents without energy and water, with no way to evacuate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the child's death this morning in a video address and officials later said her name was Tanya. Likening the humanitarian crisis linked to Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities to that created by the Nazi invasion during World War Two, he said sadly: “In 2022, from dehydration.” The city's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, later said: “Her mother was killed. We don’t know how long the girl was fighting for her life. ""We can’t imagine how much suffering she had to bear. In the last minutes of her life she was alone, weak, frightened, thirsty.” Sky's weather producer Jo Robinson added: ""Overnight lows of -10C are forecast for parts of the east - especially Kharkiv. ""It could feel like -20C at night with the wind chill. ""The cold will be extensive across Ukraine, but the lowest temperatures seem to be in the east. ""It looks like the cold spell will last into the weekend.""",17,4.252352281304144,4.1622821344451015,0.09007014685904213,14
2022-03-09,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/defiant-images-ukrainian-war-resistance-26418212,Inspirational pictures of Ukrainian defiance as besieged nation fights back,"The Russian war in Ukraine has gripped the globe with shocking images and video clips pouring out of the country at an incredible rate. While not always easy to verify, the imagery shows harrowing first-hand experiences, eyewitness accounts and the raw brutality of war. The first of this scale in Europe since 1945, the war in Ukraine is different due to the huge number of people with smartphones leading to an unprecedented amount of content being published. While so much is deeply upsetting, some of it is rousing, with inspirational accounts of bravery and defiance in the face of a vast and terrifying enemy. We take a look at some of the finest images showing the defiance of the Ukrainian people in the face of the Russian war machine. The marriage of Lesya and Valery warmed hearts around the world. Tying the knot near Kyiv, the couple said 'I do' wearing their military uniforms surrounded by fellow fighters. An image of defiant love, it serves as a reminder of the sheer scale of the sacrifice the people of Ukraine are making to defend their homeland, but is also a sign of hope for a better future. With striking similarities to one of the most famous images of defiance of all time - the Tiananmen Square 'Tank Man' - this act of courage standing in front of an armoured convoy came in one of the first days of the war. Regular people have had their lives completely uprooted by the arrival of the Russian military. The UN reports the confirmed deaths of at least 406 civilians since the fighting began on February 24. The evacuation effort has been huge, with reports claiming around two million people have already fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries. The exodus has required a huge effort, with families making harrowing decisions about what to take and what to leave. So far, the UK has granted just 750 visas to Ukrainian refugees. Vitaliy Skakun Volodymyrovych is thought to have blown up a bridge to prevent the advance of a Russian tank column while he was still on it. He is understood to have sacrificed himself for the defence of his homeland in the early days of the fighting. His sacrifice is not alone, with thousands of Ukrainian troops risking their lives to defend their country. New life seems strange in the face of so much death but the birth of Ivan, a baby boy born in the basement of a perinatal centre in Kyiv, is a sign of hope. Agencies report that he was born to the sound of sirens outside as the war raged all around. He was born on March 2, 2022. Ukrainian citizens have flocked to the defence of their country, with regular people now finding themselves learning how to use a weapon. Seen here, a young woman is given a self-defence crash course on the outskirts of Lviv in western Ukraine. All men aged between 18 and 60 are being asked to stay in the country, and some 60,000 expats have returned to Ukraine to fight in its defence. Self-defence courses have been widespread, with Ukrainian citizens having been told by authorities to make Molotov cocktails. The cocktails, which are effectively bombs, are crude but easy to make weapons that cause burning fuel to spill out over a large area when smashed. The weapon has been recommended as it can be made with things easily found in a non-military environment. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has become a figure of defiance and stoicism. He announced he would not leave Ukraine until the fight was done and has made a string of stirring speeches that have earned him plaudits both inside and outside Ukraine. The last confirmed images from the alleged attack on Snake Island, where some reports claim 13 Ukrainian soldiers lost their lives. Their supposed last words over the radio - “ Russian warship, go f**k yourself ” - have become a rousing message of defiance around the world among protestors marching against Russian aggression. Russia denies that the troops were killed, and instead were captured by the Russian army. Neither side has presented verifiable evidence, yet the iconic line uttered by Ukrainian troops has become a rallying cry nonetheless.",17,3.077702922769075,3.7760858942030424,-0.6983829714339675,19

Russian Mikhail Vedernikov said the ""paratrooper officers were killed"" as they ""honourably fulfilled their duty, valiantly and courageously defending the security of our country"".

He shared harrowing footage of the aftermath of the ruthless bombing of the facility with early indications suggesting 17 people have been wounded by the attack. Members of staff and women in labour were among those wounded, officials say. The cameraman is forced to pick their way through the remains, and what's left of flowers can be seen on tables, as walls have been blown out and windows destroyed.

The clip shows one building totally destroyed and another badly damaged as wounded patients swiftly evacuate. Children are reportedly buried under rubble after the Russian airstrike but it was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: ""There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless. The UK is exploring more support for Ukraine to defend against airstrikes and we will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes."" Mariupol city council earlier said in a Facebook post that a children’s hospital had been destroyed. ""The destruction is colossal,"" the post read. ""The building of the medical facility where the children were treated recently is completely destroyed. Information on casualties is being clarified."" The battered port city's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov, told the BBC: ""We don't understand how it is possible in modern life to bomb children's hospital."" He says people in Mariupol who managed to escape the hospital are in ""total anger"" and ""cannot believe it is true"". Liz Truss called Russia's attack on maternity and children's hospital 'abhorrent, reckless and appalling'. But the Foreign Secretary ruled out a no fly zone in response to Zelensky's calls, saying the best way to 'protect the skies' is to continue to supply aid to Ukraine. Hours earlier, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that 3,000 babies were without food or medicine. He said the infants could die and begged for for a humanitarian corridor to allow them to leave. At least 516 civilians have been killed since Russia began its invasion on February 24, the UN human rights office has said. Bodies heartbreakingly lie scattered in the streets of Mariupol as Russia continues to bombard the besieged Ukrainian city. The Red Cross say the humanitarian crisis in Mariupol is 'apocalyptic' and worsening by the hour. Hundreds of thousands of residents have been forced to shelter for nearly ten days without water or power. Now experts say we are we starting to see the full impact of Russia's deadly invasion. In what has been called a vision of the future for every city in the war-torn country, the dead are left abandoned more than a week after fighting broke out. Red Cross spokeswoman Ewan Watson said: ""This situation is really apocalyptic for people, it is getting worse, they are running out of essential supplies. “We’ve depleted our stocks. As I said, it stands to reason that people are coming to the end of whatever supplies they had.” Today, Mariupol City Council say another Russian bombing has completely destroyed a children's hospital in the city. More than 2 million refugees have fled their homes into neighbouring countries after Vladimir Putin launched his invasion 14 days ago. Ukraine will continue its attempt to evacuate civilians along safe routes agreed with Moscow, the country’s deputy prime minister last night stated. Iryna Vereshchuk confirmed Ukrainian forces would hold their fire during a 12-hour window from 9am until 9pm local time on Wednesday. She appealed to Russian forces to stick to their “official public commitment” and do the same. Authorities state the routes should allow civilians from Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha to leave. Respected war author Tomi Ahonen says we are now starting to really see Putin's methods - the twisted butchering of civilians deliberately to flex his muscle. He tweeted: ""It is a cruel psychological warfare method, designed to crush hope. To defeat a NATION. Putin creates horrible pressure to the citizens of Mariupol. Then offers them hope. And then DESTROYS that hope. And repeat, and repeat, and repeat. Pure evil."" Later, he added: ""Putin intends to do this to EVERY city he captures, crush all those people in the same way. If they get out alive, their psychological damage is likely to never be fixed. ""He is committing war crimes in front of our eyes, & he doesn't care."" It comes after a girl, six, died from dehydration ""alone, weak, frightened, thirsty"" in Mariupol yesterday after spending days with no water, power, or heating supplies.

Last week Russian forces cornered the port city with constant airstrikes, leaving residents without energy and water, with no way to evacuate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the child's death this morning in a video address and officials later said her name was Tanya. ""In 2022, from dehydration,"" he said, likening the humanitarian crisis linked to Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities to that created by the Nazi invasion during World War Two. The city's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, later said: “Her mother was killed. We don’t know how long the girl was fighting for her life. ""We can’t imagine how much suffering she had to bear. In the last minutes of her life she was alone, weak, frightened, thirsty.” He said the child's death was “one of many tragic stories of Mariupol, the city surviving in a blockade for the past eight days”. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog Mr Boychenko said: “Russian invaders have cynically left the city of half a million without water, light, heat and communications. All routes into the city are blocked. All efforts to deliver food and medicine to the residents of the city were blocked by the Russian army.” His statement said the girl had no water, electricity, heating or mobile connection and accuses Russian forces of blocking evacuation & humanitarian deliveries. Mariupol's council last week said in a statement that Russian forces were: ""breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade, as in the old Leningrad"". ""Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying [Mariupol's] critical life-support infrastructure. ""We have no light, water or heat again,"" it added. ""Mariupol remains under fire. Women, children and the elderly are suffering. We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" the statement concluded. The city is home to an estimated 400,000 and is a key target for Russia as its capture would allow Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine to join troops in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed in 2014. The opening of humanitarian corridors have come as a ray of hope for Ukrainians trapped by fighting since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Thirty buses are currently en route to the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol to collect evacuees via a humanitarian corridor to Ukraine-controlled territory, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on television on Tuesday. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbour and arrest leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis"". It denies targeting civilians. But reports have come out this morning of yet another devastating airstrike, which has left 21 people dead, including two children. Russian pilots last night 'dropped 500-kilogram bombs' on the Ukrainian city of Sumy. Footage taken at the scene of the shelling shows the devastating aftermath of the attack, with small bodies being pulled from the rubble and blood-splattered rocks. One of a team of men working to excavate the bodies is seen gently lying a blanket over the face of an unmoving body, before moving away to help elsewhere. A video of the scene, too graphic for the Mirror to show, was shared to Twitter by Ukraine’s Ambassador to Austria, Olexander Scherba, who described it as the “Barbaric bombardment”.",17,3.855256343832787,3.0900250444573363,0.7652312993754506,26

""#StopRussia"" Dmytro Zhyvytsky, who leads the Sumy Regional Military Administration, also shared a video of the reported attack online. ""The kids are being killed..” he said. “We will never forgive this!"" It comes as Russia has this morning opened ""humanitarian corridors"" so people can be evacuated from Sumy and four other Ukrainian cities: Cherhihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol. A humanitarian corridor is designed as a demilitarised zone that would allow people out safely, with the aim of reducing the number of civilians killed or wounded by attacks on cities. They are set up as a way of reducing civilian casualties during war. The corridors would effectively be a safe route where Russian forces would hold fire, an idea first requested by French President Emmanuel Macron, according to the Interfax news agency. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the first convoy would start at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) from the city of Sumy. The convoy will be followed by the local population in personal vehicles,"" she said in a televised statement. The Ukrainian authorities have also announced that people living in areas particularly badly impacted by war can apply for a relief payment of 6500 UAH (£165). The first images of the effort to get civilians out of the bombarded city of Sumy have been shared online this morning. Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation."" The United Nations (UN) has reported that around 1.5 million people have fled the country since the invasion started. However, many more people are believed to be trapped by the violence. Russia proposed giving the residents of Sumy, in northeastern Ukraine, and Mariupol, a southern port city, the choice of moving elsewhere in Ukraine on Tuesday, Russian news agencies reported. Other humanitarian corridors proposed by Russia would travel through Russia or Belarus, something Ukrainian authorities have previously rejected. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky branded the move as “completely immoral” and blamed Russia for trying to ""use people's suffering to create a television picture"". They added: ""They are citizens of Ukraine, they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine"". ""This is one of the problems that is causing the humanitarian corridors to break down. They seem to agree to them, but they themselves want to supply humanitarian aid for a picture on TV, and want the corridors to lead in their direction.""

A so-called analyst in Russia's feared spy agency reportedly leaked the document which claims spies were kept in the dark over President Putin's plan. This has left the FSB, successor to the infamous KGB, allegedly unprepared for the crippling sanctions that have followed. Russian human rights activist and operator of the anti-corruption website Gulagu.net Vladimir Osechkin published the report on Facebook last week, reported The Times. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog The report allegedly concluded: “ Russia has no way out. There are no options for a possible victory, only defeat.” The report also warned that 10,000 Russian soldiers could already be dead, while the Russian defence ministry has formally acknowledged the deaths of only 498 people so far. The whistleblower added that the actual figure was unclear as ""we have lost contact with major divisions"" - but is similar to the number reported by Kyiv officials. ""You have to write the analysis in a way that makes Russia the victor ... otherwise you get questioned for not doing good work,"" they wrote. ""Suddenly it happens and everything comes down to your completely groundless analysis. ""[We are] acting intuitively, on emotion ... our stakes will have to be raised ever higher with the hope that suddenly something might come through for us. “By and large, though, Russia has no way out. There are no options for a possible victory, only defeat."" The letter also claimed that Russia would not be able to occupy Ukraine, even if they assassinated Zelenskyy It added: ""Even with minimum resistance from the Ukrainians we'd need over 500,000 people, not including supply and logistics workers."" The document was published by Vladimir Osechkin, a Russian human rights activist who runs the anti-corruption website Gulagu.net. Christo Grozev, an expert on the Russian security services, wrote on Twitter that he had shown the letter to two FSB contacts, who thought it “was written by a colleague.” He added: ""Ukraine had previously leaked fake FSB letters as psy-ops. This letter appeared different, though. It came via a reputable source [Osechkin] and it was way longer than a forger would choose to make it."" On Twitter, he added that while his contacts did not necessarily agree with all of the conclusions in the report, they were confident of its origin. Aleksandr Bortnikov is the director of Russia's intelligence service, the FSB and is said to be one of Putin's most trusted henchmen. Born in Perm, in the Soviet Union, Bortnikov graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Railway Engineers in 1973 and soon after joined the KGB. In December 2017, he was the subject of derision after he sought to legitimize the Stalinist Great Purge, a brutal campaign led by dictator Joseph Stalin to eliminate anyone he considered a threat -where it is believed 750,000 were executed.",3,7.900343140539031,6.874770119908277,1.0255730206307545,3

The Chief Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine's defence ministry said in a statement Major General Vitaly Gerasimov was killed on Monday, along with several other officers. The Kremlin has not commented on the reports. Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, is the second of Putin’s generals to die in the invasion after Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was taken out by a sniper. The statement read: “Another loss among the senior command staff of the occupying army. “During the fighting near Kharkiv, Vitaly Gerasimov, a Russian military leader, major general, chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 41st Army of the Central Military District of Russia, was killed. A number of senior Russian army officers were also killed and wounded. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog “Vitaly Gerasimov took part in the second Chechen war and the Russian military operation in Syria. He received a medal ‘for the return of the Crimea’."" Several high ranking Russians have been killed so far in Ukraine, including Colonel Konstantin Zizevsky of the 247th Air Assault Regiment and Air Assault Brigade Lieutenant Colonel Denis Glebov. The statement also suggested there were “significant problems” with communication in the Russian army. It follows suggestions generals have been moved to the frontline owing to issues getting through to their officers on the fields. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. Putin previously confirmed the death of Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army, during a speech. Ukraine says its forces have killed more than 11,000 Russian troops since the start of the deadly invasion on February 24 while Moscow has so far confirmed about 500 losses. Neither side has divulged Ukrainian losses. It comes as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is preparing to speak to MPs later today about the Russian invasion while Boris Johnson continues to encourage Western leaders to punish Russia for the invasion. Zelensky will address the House of Commons at 5pm by video link after Speaker Lindsay Hoyle approved a request for a ""historic address"". Last night the Ministry of Defence said Russia continued to target civilian evacuation corridors in Ukraine. The latest intelligence update said: ""Russia continues to directly target evacuation corridors, resulting in the death of several civilians whilst trying to evacuate Irpin. ""Due to heavy fighting in the town, it has reportedly been without heat, water or electricity for days."" Attempts to evacuate besieged towns and cities in Ukraine have so far failed owing to continuous Russian shelling at would-be evacuees.",14,6.057510093458743,6.517320381165837,-0.45981028770709464,14

And tragically it is a similar scene that is repeated across Ukraine as people queue desperately for trains to leave the shelling and the deepening humanitarian crisis. So far the UN has said that 1.7 million refugees have left the country in less than two weeks since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine and it is reported that it could rise to over 5 million in the coming weeks. Others hide in shelters fearing the bombs while food and water runs out and electricity and other energy supplies have been cut in many areas. Sieges and bombings have continued as Ukraine rejected possible humanitarian corridors to Russia and Belarus, but said some limited progress had been made on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians. In the city of Irpin, on the northwest edge of Kyiv, fleeing residents ran with their young children in strollers, or cradling babies in arms, while others carried pet carriers, plastic bags and suitcases. ""It's like a disaster, the city is almost ruined, and the district where I'm living, it's like there are no houses which were not bombed,"" said one young mother, holding a baby beneath a blanket, while her daughter stood by her side. ""Yesterday was the hardest bombing, and the lights and sound is so scary, and the whole building is shaking."" Besides corridors to Russia, Moscow has proposed giving the residents of the Ukrainian cities of Sumy and Mariupol the choice of moving elsewhere in Ukraine, setting a deadline in the early hours for Kyiv to agree, Russian news agencies reported. After the third attempt to ease the bloodshed at talks in Belarus, a Ukrainian negotiator said that although small progress on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians had been made, things remained largely unchanged. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters that Moscow would halt operations if Ukraine ceased fighting, amended its constitution to declare neutrality, and recognised Russia's annexation of Crimea and the independence of regions held by Russian-backed separatists. On the failed humanitarian corridors so far, Dominik Stillhart, of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the BBC : ""So far we have seen, unfortunately, only agreements in principle. ""But they have immediately broken down because they lack precision. They lack the kind of... agreements over times, over roads, over whether people can go out or goods can come in. ""We have a team in Mariupol on the ground. They were ready on Sunday, despite the fact that it was not entirely clear what exactly the agreement was. As soon as they reached the first checkpoint, they realised that the road that was indicated to them was actually mined."" Meanwhile a British-Ukrainian is helping to evacuate refugees across the Polish border using a London black cab saying he is ""doing everything he can"". Roman Tymchyshyn, 31, has already transported around 80 people including pregnant women, disabled elderly people, children and even a nine-month-old baby. He began driving refugees in his black cab across the Polish border on February 28, and has since racked up around 2,169 miles - which is around 300 miles a day. ""My employer is very generous and has allowed me one month's paid leave so I relocated to Ukraine mainly to help people evacuate,"" Mr Tymchyshyn said. ""Until they cross the border or reach their final destination the passengers feel frightened but they are sometimes more relaxed when they are gathered together with different families as I form groups of random people. ""They discuss their stories and cry together about the losses or talk about their family members who have been split up."" Mr Tymchyshyn, who is from Lviv, western Ukraine, travelled back to his birth country with his wife Ulyana Vovk from their home in Portadown, Northern Ireland, after war broke out almost a fortnight ago. After another day of fighting, a Russian strike on a bread factory killed 13 in the town of Makariv in the Kyiv region, Ukrainian officials said, while Russia denies targeting civilians. In the encircled southern port city of Mariupol, hundreds of thousands of people remained trapped without food and water under regular bombardments. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, police said the death toll from the Russian bombardment was 143 since the start of the invasion. Ukraine said on Monday its forces had retaken control of the town of Chuhuiv in the northeast after heavy fighting and of the strategic Mykolayiv airport in the south.",17,3.2464338677741953,3.418807428961189,-0.17237356118699365,26

It comes amid fresh calls for the war crimes prosecution of Russian troops, com­­manders and President Vladimir Putin over the targeting ­of civilians. Footage of the incident, seemingly captured by a CCTV camera on the outside of a building, shows a maroon sedan driving into the bottom left corner of the frame, before abruptly stopping. A moment later, a tank careens around the corner toward the sedan and gunshots appear to strike the grassy area beside the road as it curves into the distance. Grey smoke rises above the area between the two vehicles. The tank slows as it continues around the corner before more gunshots are fired directly at the civilian car. It is momentarily shrouded by smoke, which then clears to reveal a shelled car; the bonnet destroyed and the windows shattered. Yet another round of gunfire strikes the left hand side of the car, causing it to jerk back. Pieces of the car fly off and onto the road. Meanwhile, the Russian tank slowly turns around before driving back in the direction it came from. The video, posted by @ArmedForcesUkr, is tweeted with the caption: “Shooting of a civilian car with people. Russian invaders!” Another clip posted to Twitter by a woman named Anastasia Horoshchak, who claims to be a Russian citizen, captured a man walking around the battered car while speaking in Ukrainian. Close-up footage of the car showed the extent of the damage; little glass is left where the windows once were and the bonnet and shell of the doors have been blown off to reveal the mechanics underneath. The man opens the doors to reveal an elderly man in the driver’s seat, with an elderly woman beside him, her head having drooped to rest on his shoulder. Bloody holes can be seen on the man’s body where the gunshots have struck him. On what remains of the windscreen, a yellow disability sticker can be seen. The caption accompanying the video said: “They shot a car with a sign of disability. “Two retirees going home. “Russian peace looks like this???” A tweet from the Kyiv Independent this afternoon said war crimes like those captured in the video were “part of Russia ’s deliberate strategy”. “Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia holds 300,000 civilians hostage in Mariupol, a city in Donetsk Oblast, and prevents humanitarian evacuation despite agreements with the Red Cross mediation,” it continued. In a video address from an undisclosed location, President Volodymyr Zelensky said a child had died of dehydration in the blockaded southern port of Mariupol, in a sign of how desperate the city's population has become. He pleaded again with western countries to provide air support. He said evacuation buses have been sent to Mariupol, but there was no firm agreement on the route, so ""Russian troops can simply shoot on this transport on the way"". Mr Zelensky accused the International Red Cross of ""forbidding the use of its emblem on our cars"", but did not give details. Buses shown heading out of the city of Sumy and towards Mariupol had signs with a red cross on the side but it is not clear who pasted them there.",17,5.000942571124796,4.634765554008972,0.36617701711582384,16

Several other top commanders have been killed in recent fighting in Ukraine, including Colonel Konstantin Zizevsky of the 247th Air Assault Regiment and Air Assault Brigade Lieutenant Colonel Denis Glebov. The statement also suggested there were “significant problems” with communication in the Russian army. Putin previously confirmed the death of Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army, during a speech. Both Safronov and Glebov were killed when Ukrainian forces recaptured the city of Chuhuiv. Zizevsky was killed in the south of Ukraine. Prior to their deaths, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was killed by a Ukrainian sniper during the fighting for Hostomel Airfield. General Magomed Tushaev died when his Chechen special forces column was obliterated near Hostomel, north-east of the city. Warlord Vladimir Zhonga is also among the dead. Zhonga led the Sparta Battalion, a Neo-Nazi military unit that boasted the backing of the Kremlin. Ukraine says its forces have killed more than 12,000 Russian troops since the start of the deadly invasion on February 24 while Moscow has so far confirmed about 500 losses. Neither side has divulged Ukrainian losses. Today Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to MPs about the Russian invasion while Boris Johnson continues to encourage Western leaders to punish Russia for the invasion. Zelensky received a standing ovation at the House of Commons after Speaker Lindsay Hoyle approved a request for a ""historic address"". Last night the Ministry of Defence said Russia continued to target civilian evacuation corridors in Ukraine. The latest intelligence update said: ""Russia continues to directly target evacuation corridors, resulting in the death of several civilians whilst trying to evacuate Irpin. ""Due to heavy fighting in the town, it has reportedly been without heat, water or electricity for days."" Attempts to evacuate besieged towns and cities in Ukraine have so far failed owing to continuous Russian shelling at would-be evacuees.",14,5.892252025189498,3.673861138655838,2.2183908865336597,11
2022-03-08,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-invasion-ukraine-slows-significantly-26419304,Russia invasion 'faltering' fuelling fears civilians being deliberately targeted,"Russia's bloody invasion of Ukraine appeared to falter tonight amid escalating fears Moscow’s troops are deliberately resorting to targeting civilians. Ukraine says 2,000 civilians have been killed and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned of “credible reports of civilians coming under fire ”. It emerged that Russia had bombed a humanitarian convoy in Mariupol and stricken Sumy civilians again came under fire from artillery that killed 21 non-combatants, including two children. By day 13 of Vladimir Putin ’s invasion, Stoltenberg said 38 children had been killed in the fighting, 200 schools destroyed, along with 34 hospitals and 1,500 residential homes. It is feared many more children have been killed by Russian forces. Ukraine claims Moscow has lost more than 12,000 troops in fighting, a staggering 303 tanks, 48 warplanes, 80 helicopters and over 1,000 armoured personnel carriers. Demands for ways to safely evacuate civilians have surged along with intensifying shelling by Russian forces, who have advanced in southern Ukraine but stalled in some other regions. Military sources on the ground have told the Mirror Russian forces may have reached a critical mass point where they may have lost critical momentum and could lose. They have lost their second very senior officer Major General Vitaly Gerimov, 45, in ferocious fighting near the stricken city of Kharkiv, east Ukraine, a major blow to Moscow. Russia is also falling back on recruiting Syrian troops to backfill their invasion, it is believed, sparking fears Ukraine could become a country beset by proxy battles for years. One said: “It is beginning to feel like Russian forces have started flailing about and are becoming increasingly desperate. “They are throwing increasingly long-range missiles at cities, hitting civilians, because they just don’t seem to know what next to do. “They have lost so many air assets to Ukraine’s troops and now they are trying to get into cities - which hugely boosts the need for a higher number of troops. “The attacks just are not coordinated and there are increasing reports of desertions and people being taken prisoner.” Efforts to put in place ceasefires along humanitarian corridors have repeatedly failed amid Russian shelling. Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said as well as killing 38 children Russia had also wounded over 70. The situation is becoming increasingly untenable in the city of Mariupol, which is without water, heat, sanitary systems or phones. Mariupol’s capture could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. An estimated 200,000 people - nearly half the population of 430,000 - hope to flee the port city. Ukraine was also tonight making arrangements to get people out of the suburb of Irpin, although it was not clear if that would be along with one of the five official corridors the Russians promised. Ukrainian officials had pushed back on the proposals as several of the routes would funnel people into Russia or its ally Belarus, which was a launchpad for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the expansion of humanitarian corridors, and more support from the Red Cross, adding that a Mariupol child had died from dehydration. In a video address from an undisclosed location, he said a child had died of dehydration in Mariupol, in a sign of how desperate the city's population has become. He said there was no firm agreement on the route out of Mariupol, so ""Russian troops can simply shoot on this transport on the way"". The president again pleaded for air support from western countries. A senior US official said multiple countries were discussing whether to provide warplanes to Ukraine. Ukraine's armed forces HQ said in a statement that Ukrainian troops are continuing defence operations in the suburbs of Mariupol. The general staff said ""demoralised"" Russian forces are looting in places they have occupied, commandeering civilian buildings like farm hangars for military equipment. Ukrainian defence forces were also involved in operations in Chernihiv and the outskirts of Kyiv, the general staff said. In Kyiv, soldiers and volunteers have built hundreds of checkpoints to protect the city of nearly four million, with sandbags, tyres and spiked cables. Some barricades looked significant, with heavy concrete slabs and sandbags piled more than two storeys high, while others appeared more haphazard, books used to weigh down stacks of tyres. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said: ""Every house, every street, every checkpoint, we will fight to the death if necessary.” It also emerged drunken Russian soldiers shot dead a ten-year-old girl in a village near Kyiv. Anastasia Stoluk died in Shybene, 40 miles north of Kyiv, on February 28, her cousin Anya Stoluk, 18, said. The soldiers refused to allow Nastya's mother, Luba, to go to the cemetery so she was buried in the yard, Anya added. Anya's adoptive mother Vera Dmitrien- ko, 40, said: ""People say that the soldiers just got so bored. They looted all the stores, of course they got a lot of alcohol ... and got drunk and started shooting. “They shot into Nastya's house, she was there with her uncle, and she died immediately. Her uncle was taken to hospital and we still don't have any information from him."" Dmitrienko said soldiers had started shooting after a Ukrainian teenage boy found a gun and fired it in the air. ""The soldiers heard it but since they were so drunk they didn't know where it was from so they just started shooting everywhere they could see. “They shot in four houses and in one of those houses was Nastya,"" she said.",17,3.0855134687436454,3.555679763709662,-0.4701662949660168,24
2022-03-07,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-humanitarian-corridor-russia-offers-26403534,Putin's humanitarian corridors come under fire for leading to Russia and Belarus,"As the horrific plight of the Ukrainian people continues following the Russian invasion of their homeland, attention has turned to how those fleeing can get out of the country. Russia has come under increasing accusations, including from Ukraine, that its forces have been firing on non-military targets sparking fears about the danger posed to Ukrainian citizens. The United Nations (UN) has reported that around 1.5 million people have fled the country since the invasion started. However, many more people are believed to be trapped by the violence. On March 7, 2022, Russia announced it would be opening ‘humanitarian corridors’ that would allow civilians to flee the violence safely - but what are humanitarian corridors and how has the offer been received by Ukraine and the west? A humanitarian corridor is designed as a demilitarised zone that would allow people out safely, with the aim of reducing the number of civilians killed or wounded by attacks on cities. They are set up as a way of reducing civilian casualties during war. Civilians have been trapped by Russian bombardment, Reuters reports. The corridors would allow a specific, safe route for them out of besieged positions. The corridors would effectively be a safe route where Russian forces would hold fire, an idea first requested by French President Emmanuel Macron, according to the Interfax news agency. The latest offer from Russia includes a corridor from the city of Mariupol, where Reuters report hundreds of thousands have been trapped without food or water and unable to evacuate people wounded by the fighting. The corridors would be opened from the cities of Mariupol, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Sumy. However, the corridors have caused alarm because, according to maps published by the RIA news agency and seen by Reuters, they only lead to two places: Russia and Belarus. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky branded the move as “completely immoral” and blamed Russia for trying to ""use people's suffering to create a television picture"". They added: ""They are citizens of Ukraine, they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine"". ""This is one of the problems that is causing the humanitarian corridors to break down. They seem to agree to them, but they themselves want to supply humanitarian aid for a picture on TV, and want the corridors to lead in their direction."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast The Europe Minister, James Cleverly, said the offer was “cynical beyond belief”, criticising the corridors as ""routes into the arms of the country that is currently destroying yours"".",17,2.9717445600369294,3.5052316947995736,-0.5334871347626442,5

Vladimir Zhoga, who led the Sparta Battalion, was killed while fighting in the Ukrainian town of Volnovakha on Saturday. The group, which has been accused of committing war crimes, is among the fiercest to fight with the Russian army and was formed in the breakaway Ukrainian territory of Donetsk during the 2014 conflict. Denis Pushilin, who leads Donetsk, confirmed the kill on his Telegram channel. ""Today, the commander of the Sparta separate reconnaissance battalion, Guards Col. Vladimir Zhoga (nom de guerre Vokha), died like a hero in Volnovakha,"" he wrote. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog It was announced last night that Vladimir Putin signed an executive order awarding Zhoga the ""title of hero of the Russian federation"". Pushilin said that the commander was killed during an operation to evacuate civilians from Volnovakha. A ceasefire was brokered for citizens to flee Volnovakha on Saturday morning, only for the Russians to violate it with shell attacks as people attempted to leave. Russian troops were filmed entering the town over the weekend, although it is understood Ukrainian forces still hold the centre. Before his death Zhoga had been one of the most widely known and feared fighters in the Russian army. He joined Russian-backed rebels in 2014 - the same year in which the Sparta Battalion, a Neo-Nazi militia that has the support of Moscow, was created. In the eight years since the group has been at the forefront of the separatist war in Donbass. Its former leader, Arsen Pavlov, known as Motorola, was accused of war crimes in Kyiv and died when he was blown up an explosive device in 2016. Mystery still surrounds his death, with some suggesting Russian special forces had Pavlov killed due to concerns about his reputation and the hold he had over the independent fighting unit. Pavlov had been accused of killing Ukrainian prisoners of war. Zhoga's death is another major blow for Putin after he lost two top military chiefs this week. Lieutenant General Serhiy Shaptala said the defending forces had seized Chuhuiv from Russian control and killed large numbers of Putin's men. Two high-ranking Russian commanders were killed in the battle. Lieutenant Shaptala also gave an update on the number of losses suffered by the invading forces - numbers far higher than those offered by the Russians last week. He said that more than 11,000 Russian soldiers had died and 290 tanks destroyed in the course of the invasion. Forty-six planes and 68 helicopters had been downed, the army chief said.",14,2.848789118324671,5.372773322352542,-2.5239842040278706,11

Over the weekend two ceasefire agreements broke down as Ukrainians were leaving, forcing many to return to homes as Russian shells began to rain down. In one incident which has triggered outrage and widespread condemnation, three members of a fleeing family were killed in a strike as they made their way towards safety. This morning, for a third time, humanitarian corridors have been reopened, potentially offering people a safe passage away from built-up areas. According to various Russian state media outlets all citing Russia ’s defence ministry, the corridors are being set up at the personal request of French President Emmanuel Macron - the French government have denied this. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog They will be opened from the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Sumy, and some appear to involve the evacuation of Ukrainian civilians to Russian cities and Belarus. According to routes published by the RIA Novosti news agency, the corridor from Kyiv will lead to Belarus, which has allied with Russia and allowed troops to gather there prior to the invasion. Civilians who are seeking to flee Kharkiv will only have one corridor leading to Russia. A spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the routes ""completely immoral"" and said Russia was trying to ""use people's suffering to create a television picture"". ""They are citizens of Ukraine, they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine,"" the spokesperson told Reuters. Dominik Stillhart, director of operations for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), explained what has been going wrong with so-called humanitarian corridors. He said both sides had been talking ""for days"", but problems remained confirming the detail of any ceasefire agreement - to allow civilians out of bombarded cities. Stillhart said the challenge was to get the two parties to an agreement that is ""concrete, actionable and precise"". He added that so far there had only been agreements ""in principle"", which had immediately broken down because they lacked precision, regarding routes and who can use them. Illustrating his point, he said some ICRC staff had tried to get out of Mariupol along an agreed route on Sunday, but soon realised ""the road indicated to them was actually mined"". ""That is why it is so important that the two parties have a precise agreement for us then to be able to facilitate it on the ground."" The routes discussed today, which will take Ukrainians in the opposite direction to the vast majority of refugees who are fleeing west, have been criticised by the UK's Europe Minister James Cleverly. He said Russia's latest offer of a ceasefire and an escape route for civilians was ""cynical beyond belief"". Mr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast: ""There is a view that Vladimir Putin believed there was a widespread desire of Ukrainians to be closer to Russia, to be more Russian. ""I think that has been proven to be a complete nonsense by the circumstances we are seeing. ""Providing evacuation routes into the arms of the country that is currently destroying yours is a nonsense."" He added that ""ultimately the most humanitarian thing the Russians could do is end this completely illegal, completely unjustified invasion of Ukraine "". A spokesman for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia's proposal on humanitarian corridors taking refugees to Belarus or Russia was ""completely immoral"". ""This is a completely immoral story. People's suffering is used to create the desired television picture,"" the spokesman said. ""These are citizens of Ukraine, they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine. This weekend three members of the same family were among those killed in the attack by Vladimir Putin's forces on Irpin, a town 12 miles from Kyiv. Shocking photos show children, parents and grandparents running for their lives from artillery fire. The deaths have been condemned by Zelensky, who vowed revenge. In a heartfelt plea his wife Olena pleaded with international media to ""tell the terrible truth"" that Putin's troops are killing children ""consciously and cynically"". She asked Nato to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine to ""save our children, because tomorrow it will save yours"". She said: ""The Russian occupiers are killing Ukrainian children.

In another leaked recording, a Russian infantryman complained that his battalion was facing ""massacres"" and said his comrades were ""shaking"", ""afraid"" and refusing to fight. A third soldier called his wife, it is claimed, and told her: "" Russia itself attacked Ukraine, why I don't understand. We're definitely here until May, that's for certain."" He warned the war could drag on for a couple of years. Another Russian fighter said he was being paid £40 a day - a relatively high wage in Russia - but said no-one cared about the money anymore. He echoed other soldiers' wishes to quit the army and said his comrades were ""sleeping in the street"". ""We're running out of diesel fuel, ammunition level is low too. I don't know what the f*** we're going to do,"" he added. Russian forces have lost 1,000 troops a-day to a ferocious defence from Ukrainian troops and defiant citizen warriors, according to official Ukrainian numbers. The loss of 11,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen by day 11 of the invasion has been a massive blow to Moscow, which is now calling up reserves.

The BBC’s flagship Sunday Morning political show cut to Olha Stefanishyna in the striking surroundings as Putin’s troops ramp up the bombardment of Ukraine. Ms Stefanishyna warned Russian forces were shelling hospitals, nurseries and schools, and civilian homes with the situation getting “more and more severe”. With Western officials believing Russian forces are encircling cities to bombard them into submission, Ms Stefanishyna said: “We now see another wave of the fomentation of this terroristic plan of the Russian Federation has started. “Given the strong resistance our Army showed, now the [operation] is done against the civilian population.” It came as a second attempt began to evacuate some of the 400,000 residents trapped in Mariupol, with a temporary ceasefire lasting from noon to 9pm local time. A similar plan had to be abandoned on Saturday after the ceasefire was not fully observed, with both sides trading blame. Speaking to the BBC, she added: “This evacuation should have started yesterday but we didn’t start it because of the shelling that was ongoing throughout the territory… “Today hopefully this agreement will be implemented.” She thanked the West for its support, but warned: “The war is not ending in one or two days - it will presumably be a long-lasting process.

Valentina Pushich - known as Romashka - was a medic in the Ukraine army's 72nd brigade. Reports around Ms Pushich's death have not been independently verified but Ukraine media says she was killed by Russian shelling in the Ukraine capital. This weekend her body was buried at a cemetery in Kyiv, draped in the Ukraine flag. Her medical work in the war so far had quickly seen her described as 'legendary' among the Ukrainian resistance.

Ms Stefanishyna said the situation reported in the city of Mariupol was replicated across other cities, but the port city would again be the site of a temporary ceasefire on Sunday to try and allow citizens to leave.

2022-03-06,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-releases-horror-video-inside-26397755,Ukraine releases horror video from inside war zone and compares Putin to Hitler,"Defiant Ukraine has launched a desperately haunting appeal for a no-fly zone - using horror images of Putin’s invasion and a famous Winston Churchill speech. The powerful 1.10 minute video shocker features an eerie clock ticking, suggesting time is running out and compares Russian leader Vladimir Putin to Hitler using horror imagery of his invasion. Throughout the video viewers can see the words “ Ukraine 2022” reminding them of how a modern day despot is threatening to level a neighbouring country. It begins with a clock ticking and Churchill saying: “I have to make the declaration but can you doubt what our policy will be? “We have but one aim and one single irrevocable purpose. We are resolved to destroy Hitler.” For all the latest updates from Ukraine follow our dedicated Russia-Ukraine war liveblog Throughout the video imagery of Putin’s missiles smashing into civilian communities can be seen, elderly women desperately seeking help. Churchill continues: “And every vestige of the Nazi regime. From this nothing will turn us. Nothing. We will never parler, we will never negotiate with Hitler or any of his gang. “We shall fight him by land , we shall fight him by sea, we shall fight him in the air until with god’s help we have rid the earth of his shadow and liberated its people from his yoke. “Any man or state who fights against Nazidom will have our aid….” Throughout the video are also disturbing images of refugees fleeing Putin’s troops, who have targeted civilians throughout. It continues: “Any man or state who marches with Hitler is our foe.” And it ends movingly with the words: “History repeats itself. Will we repeat the greatness of our ancestors - close the sky over Ukraine!” Fresh missile attacks have been launched on civilians amid warnings that the war in Ukraine could last years. Overnight the population of Ovruch, which is in the north west of the country, were bombarded with bombs which destroyed 30 homes as the invasion goes into its eleventh day. Vladimir Putin's bombing of populated areas is an effort to break morale, according to the UK government. Ukraine's defence ministry said in a statement this morning: ""The eleventh day of the heroic confrontation of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion began. ""Armed Forces and units of the Security and Defence Forces of Ukraine are fighting fierce battles to maintain certain borders. ""The opponent, suffering losses, is making constant attempts to avoid direct fire contact with our troops."" In its latest update, Ukraine said that it is ""imposing maximum losses"" on Russian forces trying to advance in the South, East and North of the country. It said: The number of refugees fleeing the invasion is expected to reach 1.5 million today, officials said. The Ukraine conflict could last “months if not years” and Vladimir Putin could resort to even “more brutal” attacks, Dominic Raab warned this morning. The UK’s Deputy Prime Minister appeared to suggest “anyone” taking the Russian President’s illegal orders should be tried for war crimes, not just the leader himself.",17,2.627332950743463,3.1918127964088816,-0.5644798456654185,19

The schoolboy has been hailed as a 'hero of the night' by Slovakian authorities after he crossed the border. He had just a backpack, a plastic bag, his passport and a telephone number written on his hand, according to the Slovak Ministry of Interior. The report has not been independently verified. ""He came all alone because his parents had to stay in Ukraine. Volunteers took care of him, took him to a warm place and gave him food and drink,” the ministry said. For all the updates on Ukraine-Russia war visit our liveblog The statement, posted on the ministry’s Facebook page yesterday, said that thanks to the information written on the boy’s hand and on a piece of paper that was folded in his passport, the staff at the border were able to get in touch with the boy’s relatives in Slovakia who were then able to come and collect him. “He won over everyone with his smile, fearlessness and determination worthy of a real hero,” the statement said. It is not clear why the boy was unaccompanied with his parents reportedly remaining in Kyiv. The UN estimates that 1.5m people have left Ukraine since the outbreak of war on February 24 - that amounts to about 3.5% of the total population. The majority of them have fled to Poland but other counties such as Hungary, Slovakia and Moldova have also taken refugees. Ukrainian soldiers bolstered defences around Kyiv on Sunday, digging trenches, blocking roads and liaising with civil defence units as Russian forces bombarded the surrounding areas and attacked towns and villages nearby. While the armed forces and civilian volunteers dug in, thousands of people continued to try to flee the city of 3.4 million as fears of a full assault spread. Russia has concentrated its heaviest attacks on the south and east of the country, besieging cities including Mariupol and Kharkiv with artillery fire and air strikes and causing extensive damage and casualties. Kyiv has been spared the worst of the fighting so far, but intense battles have raged in surrounding towns and villages and Russia's defence ministry released footage on Sunday of some of its tracked military vehicles on the move near the capital. Video provided by Ukraine's armed forces taken on Saturday in the Kyiv region, showed Ukrainian efforts to defend the capital, with piles of sandbags and concrete slabs laid across a main road, while Ukrainian soldiers carefully checked passing cars. A smaller road was blocked by metal ""hedgehog"" anti-tank barriers, and machine gun positions had been erected. Molotov cocktails were lined up on the side of the road, as civilians vowed to join the battle to protect Kyiv. ""We are equipped 100%,"" said an unidentified soldier in the footage. ""Positions are prepared, we've fitted them out and we are simply waiting to meet them here ... Victory will be ours.""",17,4.209417317302922,3.6812801770106134,0.5281371402923085,19

Russia has been dogged by reports of low morale among soldiers realising they have been lied to by the Kremlin, with Britain's top military chief saying it has ""got into a mess"". Ukraine's ministry of defence this morning said it is inflicting ""maximum losses"" on Putin's military as the brutal war goes into its eleventh day. Nevertheless the Russian President, whose actions have turned the country into a pariah state, remains defiant following an hour-long talk with his Turkish counterpart, Tayyip Erdogan. He maintains that Russia would only halt its military operation if Ukraine stops fighting and meets demands, the Kremlin said in a statement. For the latest updates follow our dedicated Russia-Ukraine war liveblog Putin is said to have told Erdogan that the onslaught was going according to plan and to schedule - and that he hoped Ukrainian negotiators would take a ""more constructive"" approach. Russian chiefs said Ukraine needs to take into account the ""reality on the ground"". Putin, whose comments were published in a Kremlin readout of the call, said his ""special operation"" in Ukraine was going according to plan and to schedule. ""It was underlined that the suspension of the special operation is only possible if Kyiv stops military operations and carries out well-known Russian demands,"" the Kremlin said. It warned of ""the futility of any attempts to drag out the negotiation process"", claiming Ukrainian security forces were using delays to regroup. The Kremlin said: ""It is hoped that during the planned next round of negotiations, Ukraine's representatives will show a more constructive approach, fully taking into account the emerging realities."" The Russian president has been branded a war criminal over reports of civilians being targeted, with the number fleeing Ukraine set to reach 1.5 million today. He also faces a backlash in his own country as Russians take to the street to protest the invasion.

""Erdogan emphasised the importance of taking urgent steps to achieve a ceasefire, open humanitarian corridors and sign a peace agreement."" It comes as Britain’s top military chief today said Russia has ""got itself into a mess"" with the invasion, morale in Moscow’s forces is low and the Kremlin lost more troops in a week than the UK did in 20 years in Afghanistan. But Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin warned Vladimir Putin would unleash fierce and indiscriminate aggression against the Ukrainian people. Sir Tony Radakin told the BBC's Sunday Morning: ""This invasion is not going well for Russia... It's less powerful than it was 10 days ago. ""Russia cannot continue... So we have to have to have confidence that what we're doing is the right thing"". He added: ""We do know that some of the lead elements of Russian forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian response.” But Sir Tony warned Russian aggression could be ramped up. He said: “I think there is a real risk because Russia is struggling with its objectives on the ground in Ukraine - and we've seen from Russia's previous actions in Syria and in Chechnya - where it will turn up the violence, it will lead to more indiscriminate killing and more indiscriminate destruction.”",14,3.223171346051628,4.621732310856945,-1.3985609648053172,4
2022-03-06,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-shopping-centre-blown-pieces-26400802,Ukraine shopping centre blown to pieces as civilians run for their lives,"A shopping centre in Ukraine has been razed to the ground as Putin's forces continue to bombard areas packed with innocent civilians. Aerial images show plumes of smoke billowing into the air after a factory and shopping centre in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, was hit by airstrikes earlier today. Civilians ran for their lives across the city today as Russian troops targeted their escape routes. An estimated eight people, including two children, were slaughtered when Russian forces opened fire on citizens trying to flee the city by bus, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Markushin, said. Three more Ukrainians died when Russians shelled a damaged bridge in the city they were using to escape. It is not known exactly how many ­civilians were killed in Irpin, which lies 16 miles northwest of the capital Kyiv, and which has been the target of a Russian ­bombardment in recent days. The UN says 364 Ukrainian civilians have been confirmed killed in fighting, including 20 children, with hundreds more injured, many of them seriously. But there are fears the death toll may be much higher, with the Ukrainian emergency services saying more than 2,000 civilians have died. It came amid reports of Russian losses of 11,000 troops, sparking fears Moscow is planning more ferocious attacks on soldiers and civilians, with increasingly deadly weapons. Russian forces also pounded the key port city of Mariupol. Ukraine officials confirmed a second attempted ­evacuation of the city was smashed by shelling. Fleeing civilians were meant to be given a nine-hour safety corridor. But artillery fire hit the city within seconds of an agreed time for the ceasefire to begin. It came 24 hours after the first failed ceasefire. Interior ministry adviser Anton Garashchenko said: “There can be no green corridors because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom.” It sparked fresh calls for war crimes prosecution of Russian troops, commanders and ­even President Vladimir Putin for targeting civilians. Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko, who represents 200,000 ­residents, said in a video call: “They are destroying us. “They will not even give us an opportunity to count the wounded and the killed because the shelling does not stop.” In the port city, mothers mourned slain children, wounded soldiers were fitted with tourniquets and doctors worked by the light of their smartphones to save lives. Dead bodies lay in the street, ­apartment blocks burned, while ­residents ran out of water and food. Mayor Boychenko added: “The city is in a very, very difficult state of siege. ""Relentless shelling of residential blocks is ongoing, airplanes have been ­dropping bombs on residential areas.”",17,4.943955547528465,2.0249209350061985,2.9190346125222666,24

Horrifying images from Irpin, just 16 miles from capital Kyiv, show people cowering under cover as missiles rain down around them. Soldiers and residents refusing to leave their homes can be seen helping elderly citizens to a bus as they attempt to flee the horror. All around them are the bodies of those who did not make it to safety, as they were fired upon as they attempted to leave. One heartbreaking image shows the bodies of a family, killed as they attempted to leave, surrounded by suitcases containing their possessions. A resident has covered them with a blanket, but they remain a symbol of the innocents slaughtered by Putin’s illegal invasion. The sad images confirm Russians are shelling civilian populations, despite assurances they would be off limits from weapon fire. Other images show people looking exhausted as they tread through streets strewn with debris which was once someone’s home or business, as flames lick the sky behind them. Four people, including two children, are also reported to have been shot down as they attempted to leave Irpin today. The catastrophic scenes of destruction are repeated throughout the nation, now in its eleventh day under attack from aggressors Russia. Thousands remain trapped in Mariupol after two ceasefires were ignored by Russians this weekend. A second attempt, which was due to last between 10am and 9pm local time, again failed as evacuees attempting to flee were met with heavy shelling from Russian guns. Around half of the city’s 400,000 population remains in the city. A cease fire had earlier been called on Saturday but was also ignored, putting tens of thousands of lives at risk. Since the invasion started, the coastal city has come under heavy attack. Residents remaining have no power, water or heat as supplies of food and medicine threatens to run out, causing people to starve. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said the planned evacuations were halted because of an ongoing assault by Russian troops. He said: “There can be no 'green corridors' because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom.” The city council said in a statement: “It is extremely dangerous to take people out under such conditions.” Pope Francis said on Sunday he had dispatched two cardinals to Ukraine, saying the Vatican is willing to do everything it can to bring peace. He said: ""In Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing. “This is not just a military operation, but a war that sows death, destruction and misery."" The scenes of horror will soon come to the historic port city of Odesa, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned. He said: “They are preparing to bomb Odessa. “Russians have always come to Odessa. They have always felt only warmth in Odessa. Only sincerity. And now what? ""Bombs against Odessa? Artillery against Odessa? Missiles against Odessa? “It will be a war crime. It will be a historical crime.”",17,3.149788495369205,1.8130380742131413,1.3367504211560635,26
2022-03-06,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-lost-1000-troops-day-26400197,"Russia has lost 1,000 troops-a-day to ferocious resistance, Ukraine says","Russian forces have lost 1,000 troops a-day to a ferocious defence from Ukrainian troops and defiant citizen warriors, according to official Ukrainian numbers. The loss of 11,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen by day 11 of the invasion has been a massive blow to Moscow, which is now calling up reserves. Defence experts usually calculate invading commanders usually need an advantage in numbers of around three to one to attack a defending force. In house to house combat in inner cities, which is what Moscow is attempting, this calculation can be as many as four to one needed. It is estimated that Russia began the invasion with around 230,000 troops, in Belarus to the north, on the eastern flank and offshore in the Black Sea. That is only a few thousand more than Ukraine ’s entire armed forces, it is believed, but the defenders were better-trained. And by adopting a full-on assault offensive on towns and cities that are well defending by a well-motivated force the Russian troops are now mired in urban combat. They lost the initiative and momentum quickly by allowing supply lines to get cut off and also by being flanked by Ukraine’s troops and militia. In addition they under-estimated Ukraine’s air defences which have remained well-hidden and efficient, bringing down a staggering 44 warplanes. The air defences and missile teams have also shot down 48 attack and troop carrier helicopters in less than two weeks of fighting. The Mirror understand these Ukrainian estimates of the toll on Russia’s armed forces may even be conservative numbers. One headline loss is also the amount of armour taken out by Ukraine’s anti-tank teams, in particular using UK supplied NLAW weapons, destroying 285 tanks. As well as this 447 vehicles have been blown up or disabled by an unrelenting defence from Ukraine’s armed forces and militia. Almost 1,000 armoured vehicles have been destroyed and 109 artillery systems have been wiped out in Ukrainian attacks. On Saturday alone Russia lost four helicopters, five warplanes and one unmanned drone, testimony to western-supplied weaponry given to Ukraine’s forces. Two of Moscow’s warships, bristling with weapons, have also been disabled or destroyed in attacks by the defenders. Many hundreds of Russian troops have been captured, treated if they are wounded and have even been filmed denouncing the invasion as wrong. Some of those found abandoned by their comrades or left behind in attacks had run out of food days ago and were hungry and thirsty. In one shock video some were found to have been given tinned rations that were six years past their sell-by date. And some vehicle crews were captured after simply running out of petrol as the logistics chain of the invasion broke down because of Ukraine’s defences. At a press conference in Kyiv on Saturday, captured Russian troops condemned the mission and called on their fellow citizens to rally against the conflict. Andrey Chuvatarevsky, a soldier who served on a contract basis in the Moscow region, said: ""Russians, do everything possible to stop this war. ""Neither Ukraine nor Russia needs this war. Only Putin needs this war. Try to inform the President, drive the military away from the equipment so that they don’t drive and bomb the civilian population. ""If you take to the streets, the President will decide to withdraw the troops. Then there will be no war."" Fellow captured soldier Mikhail Kulikov warned that Ukrainian children were suffering. The two men were among ten soldiers who spoke at a press conference at Interfax-Ukraine after voluntarily surrendering. Prisoner Dmitry Gagarin told relatives and friends in Russia not to listen to Russian propaganda. ""I would like all the people of Russia to hear that here everything is not like they say on Russian television,"" he said. ""There are no Nazis. Here are ordinary peaceful people who have rallied against one person – Putin, who wanted to be a conqueror."" A Ukraine Armed Forces spokesman told the Daily Mirror: “The enemy has not given up its intentions and continues the offensive operation against Ukraine. This is despite losses in personnel and hardware. “Unable to achieve the goal of capturing the capital of Ukraine in the first few days of the war, the occupation focused their efforts on encircling the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mykolayiv as well as reaching the administrative borders of Luhansk and Donestsk, creating a land corridor to the temporary occupied territory of the Crimea. “The 11th day of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion continues.”",14,3.7087987079749514,3.4103314069816766,0.2984673009932748,19

Around eight people, including two children, were killed yesterday when Russian forces opened fire on ­residents who were trying to flee by bus, according to the city’s Mayor Oleksandr Markushin. Three more died when Russians shelled a damaged bridge in the city they were using to escape. But the toll of ­civilian victims in Irpin, which lies 16 miles north-west of the capital Kyiv, could be far higher as it has been regularly ­bombarded in recent days. The UN says that, nationally, 364 civilians have been confirmed killed in the fighting, including 20 children, with hundreds more injured, many of them seriously. However, Ukrainian emergency services say more than 2,000 civilians have died. It came amid reports of 11,000 Russian troops killed, sparking fears Moscow is planning even more ferocious attacks on soldiers and civilians, with increasingly deadly weapons. The key port city of Mariupol was also pounded again yesterday. Ukraine officials confirmed that a second attempted ­evacuation of the besieged city was thwarted by shelling. Fleeing civilians were meant to be given a nine-hour safety corridor. But artillery fire blasted the city within seconds of an agreed time for the ceasefire to begin. It came 24 hours after the first failed ceasefire.

Relentless shelling of residential blocks is ongoing, planes have been ­dropping bombs on residential areas.” In a counter-attack, a Ukrainian special unit of National Guards assaulted Russian troops encircling the city. The attack is said to have killed 30 soldiers and destroyed three Russian tanks and four infantry vehicles. One tank commander surrendered, as other captured soldiers claimed that they were not aware they were being sent to Ukraine when deployed. In another sinister move, more than 100 weapons installations have been spotted being brought into the north of Ukraine, including the TOS-1 multi-rocket flamethrower, capable of wiping out entire buildings. Point-U Tochka missile systems with a range of 75 miles were moving south in Belarus towards the border. Artillery teams also attacked a second nuclear reactor in the second largest city of Kharkiv and the national security service warned it could spark a “large-scale ecological disaster”. Police also reported shelling and air raids in the north-east Kharkiv region, as Starokostiantyniv air base, in west Ukraine, was destroyed. It follows the levelling of Vinnytsia airport, which was hit by eight missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is now preparing to bombard the historic port of Odesa. In a televised address the defiant leader said: “Rockets against Odesa? This will be a war crime.” He went on to demand an ­immediate no-fly zone above Ukraine. He added: “The world is strong enough to close our skies.” Ukrainian soldiers have been digging trenches around Kyiv, which is expecting a major assault soon. The city, along with Zhytomyr, 85 miles west of the capital, is being pummelled by air strikes from Su-35S and Su-25 bombers from Belarus. Last night sources said that troops are also bracing for an assault from Chechen forces in the city of Bucha, 20 miles north-west of Kyiv. And the World Health Organisation confirmed there had been attacks on Ukrainian healthcare facilities.

The 18-month-old boy named Kirill was fatally wounded as Russia shelled the southern city of Mariupol – where thousands were targeted during a supposed ceasefire today. Doctors couldn’t save Kirill – one of the youngest victims of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s cruel war. Devastated mother Marina Yatsko and her boyfriend Fedor wept as they cradled their son’s lifeless body. Hours later, thousands of their fellow citizens came under fire after gathering at agreed evacuation points. Follow all of of today's news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog A seven-hour ceasefire was agreed to allow up to 200,000 to flee along a so-called humanitarian corridor. But the exodus plunged into chaos as Russian forces bombed meeting points and the route to safety, officials said. The evacuation was called off after three hours and thousands returned to bunkers without heat, electricity and, in some cases, water. In other developments on the 10th day of the bloody conflict: In Mariupol, locals abandoned their cars to scramble back to hideaways when it became apparent the bombardment was not going to stop. Some were relying on melting snow for water, said the charity Médecins Sans Frontières. Mariupol, a port city of 400,000 people, has endured indiscriminate shelling as Moscow attempts to link separatist forces in eastern Ukraine with troops in Crimea. Serhiy Orlov, deputy mayor of Mariupol, said the ceasefire lasted barely 30 minutes. He accused Putin of genocide and said: “The Russians are continuing to bomb us and use artillery. There is no ceasefire in Mariupol and no ceasefire all along the escape route. Civilians are ready to escape but they cannot. It is crazy.” Another official said: “When the people organised in evacuation points, they started attack on evacuation points. Not all the city. Just evacuation points.” The Ukrainian parliament said it had been forced to suspend the evacuation “for security reasons” amid reports that Russian troops were using the ceasefire to make advances. A second humanitarian corridor came under fire in the eastern city of Volnovakha, where 15,000 had hoped to flee. Just 400 managed to get out. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which was due to oversee the evacuations, called the chaos “heartbreaking”. Russia’s defence ministry blamed Ukrainian “nationalists” for thwarting the humanitarian corridors. Capital city Kyiv remained under renewed bombardment today. The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy were tonight encircled – though Ukrainian fighters continue to keep hold of them. There was more resistance in the southern city of Mykolaiv, where locals said Russian forces had been pushed back. Regional governor Vitaliy Kim declared Putin’s troops were “destroyed and kicked out of the city”. Armed local police posed with four soldiers captured at a checkpoint. Thousands of women and children, many weeping and numb with exhaustion, arrived in Lviv, in the west, desperate to catch trains and buses out of the country. Hundreds lined up in flurries of snow on the station forecourt, warming themselves on oil-drum braziers or lining up for hot food and drinks served by volunteers. Anna Filatova, who arrived from Kharkiv with daughters Margarita, 18, and Lilly, four, said: “The Russians want to flatten Kharkiv. It was impossible to stay there any more. “The Russians thought Kharkiv would welcome them. But we hate them. We hate Putin.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky today again called on NATO to impose a no-fly zone – which the West has ruled out for fear of triggering all-out war with Russia. Mr Zelensky warned that “all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you”. Ukrainians fleeing into central Europe also pleaded for Western nations to take tougher steps following an invasion that has already created 1.3 million refugees. At the Medyka crossing in Poland, Solomiya Zdryko, 18, begged: “Please close the sky. People are dying.” But Putin – who today made a public appearance marking Tuesday’s International Women’s Day – warned Moscow would consider the move “participation in the armed conflict”. Of Western opposition, he said: “These sanctions being imposed are akin to a declaration of war, but thank God it has not come to that.” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova went a step further, warning London: “Russia will not forget Britain’s desire to co-operate with ultra-nationalist forces in Ukraine and the supply of British weapons to the Kiev regime. “The sanctions hysteria in which London plays one of the leading, if not the main, roles, leaves us no choice but to take proportionately tough retaliatory measures. London has made a final choice of open confrontation with Russia.” Putin also claimed “everything was going to plan”, vowing forces would complete their “special military operation”. Ukrainians in the UK, meanwhile, remain terrified for their folk back home. Mychajlo Barsky, 62, from Coventry, has family in the city of Ternopil, in the west of the country. He shed a tear as he said: “We are dealing with evil. Everyone is scared but we are prepared to fight it out. “There is a real determination in the nation that we cannot let Putin win. We will fight our corner – as we always have.” His musician son Danylo, 31, added: “Even if Russia wins the battle, they will not win the war. We will never accept a pro-Putin president. We do not want that.”",17,3.352328922581567,3.0672374755396534,0.2850914470419137,26

Vladimir Putin ’s troops are attacking Ukrainian cities with ever more shelling and as tanks move in the scenes of devastation are being beamed around the world with buildings razed to the ground. New images from Irpin on the outskirts of Kyiv show dystopian scenes with collapsed apartment blocks and vehicles blown up, while people walk around dazed. In one image a bridge can be seen destroyed from an attack with rubble, twisted metal and cables lying in water and mud. In the foreground is a soldier carrying a baby, oblivious to the destruction all around them. There are many other terrible images from the assault on the town while the pictures have been echoed from other cities around Ukraine. Moscow's attack on Ukraine, the biggest on a European state since World War Two, has created over one million refugees, a barrage of sanctions and fears of a global economic hit and wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades. Ukrainians say their resolve is as strong as ever as fighting continues to rage with Russian troops besieging and bombarding cities in the second week of an invasion that has isolated Moscow - which says its attack is a ""special operation."" Kyiv, in the path of a Russian armoured column that has been stalled outside the Ukrainian capital for days, came under renewed assault, with explosions audible from the city centre. Europe's biggest nuclear power plant had also been seized. The southeastern port city of Mariupol - a key prize for the Russian forces - has been encircled and shelled. There is no water, heat or electricity and it is running out of food after five days under attack, according to Mayor Vadym Boychenko. ""We are simply being destroyed,"" he said. Putin's actions have drawn almost universal condemnation and many countries have imposed heavy sanctions as the West balances punishment with avoiding a widening of the conflict. Moscow denies targeting civilians in Ukraine and says its aim is to disarm its neighbour, counter what it views as NATO aggression and capture leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and its Western allies call that a baseless pretext for a war to conquer a country of 44 million people. More EU sanctions are coming, potentially including a ban on Russian-flagged ships in European ports and blocking imports of steel, timber, aluminium or coal, said Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. The United States is weighing cuts to imports of Russian oil and ways to minimize the impact on global supplies and consumers as lawmakers fast-track a bill that would ban Russian energy imports entirely. In Kyiv's Borshchahivka neighbourhood, the twisted engine of a cruise missile lay in the street where it had apparently been downed overnight by Ukrainian air defences. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said an advance had been halted on the southern port of Mykolayiv. If captured, the city of 500,000 people would be the biggest yet to fall. Russian forces have made their biggest advances in the south, where they captured their first sizeable Ukrainian city, Kherson, this week. Bombing has worsened in recent days in the northeast cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv and Ukrainians have been fleeing west, many crowding into Lviv near the Polish border. James Elder of the United Nations children's agency said doctors in Lviv were preparing a system to identify children in case of mass casualties. ""A green dot means fine over here, a yellow dot means critical support. They are learning a black dot means the child won't make it,"" he said.",17,2.2745057921605203,3.182977378984793,-0.9084715868242728,24

The leader's messages have rallied Ukrainians as they fight the Russian army amid heavy shelling. But in a bitter and emotional speech he hit out at the way that NATO has not imposed a no-fly zone which would have given civilians some protection from the air. ""All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity,"" he said in a night-time address. He stated: ""Today there was a NATO summit, a weak summit, a confused summit, a summit where it was clear that not everyone considers the battle for Europe's freedom to be the number one goal. ""Today, the leadership of the alliance gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages, having refused to set up a no-fly zone."" NATO refused to impose a no-fly zone, warning that to do so could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. ""All that the alliance was able to do today was to pass through its procurement system 50 tonnes of diesel fuel for Ukraine. Perhaps so we could burn the Budapest Memorandum,"" Zelensky said, referring to the 1994 security guarantees given to Ukraine in exchange for the withdrawal of its Soviet-era nuclear weapons. ""You will not be able to pay us off with litres of fuel for the litres of our blood, shed for our common Europe."" Zelensky had earlier appealed to NATO to set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which Russia invaded by land, sea and air on February 24. ""We are not part of this conflict,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in denying Ukraine's request. ""We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering,"" he said following a NATO meeting in Brussels. Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, wants to join the European Union and NATO, moves which Moscow says threaten its security and influence. Russia has shelled residential areas and civilian infrastructure, as well as capturing two nuclear sites. While the West condemned Putin, members of the 30-strong NATO are bound to defend each other in case of attack and wary of sinking into a war with nuclear-armed Russia. The EU threatened more sanctions but it was not clear what it could do. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the alliance would defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory and that Moscow should not doubt Washington's resolve. ""Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready,"" he said. ""We'll continue to raise the cost for President Putin. Unless the Kremlin changes course, it will continue down the road of increasing isolation and economic pain."" But the alliance - in which the United States, Britain and France are also nuclear powers - dashed Ukraine's hopes of immediate help that Kyiv says could turn the tables in the war. ""We should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops operating in Ukrainian territory,"" Stoltenberg said.",29,4.064653839253706,3.9726572504803737,0.09199658877333272,28

The sound of explosions surrounded people fleeing the city of Mariupol during a five hour ceasefire this morning. Less than two hours into it many had to turn back as it became clear that shelling had continued and fighting had broken out near the evacuation route. ""It's not safe to go by this road because of these fights,"" the city's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC. When it became clear that the ceasefire, which had been bargained overnight, would not hold, people were urged to seek immediate shelter and wait for information. ""Right now I'm in Mariupol, I'm on the street. I can hear shelling every three to five minutes,"" said Alexander, a 44-year-old engineer. Follo all of of today's news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog ""The green corridor is (nonsense). I can see cars of people who tried to flee and they are coming back."" Mr Orlov said that fighting had broken out in a town along the road to Zaporizhzhia, where the fleeing citizens had been heading. ""Their shelling stopped for a little time, but then it continues,"" the deputy mayor said, before saying that rockets had been deployed by the Russians. He added: ""We decided to move our citizens back because it is not safe on the street."" An hour before the shelling and gun fire erupted, Russian troops had been urged not to break the ceasefire. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned the invading forces not to take advantage of the situation. She said claims that the Russians were moving closer to Ukrainian positions in areas along the evacuation routes were being looked into. ""We are using this channel to evacuate civilians - women and children - as well as to deliver humanitarian cargo to those remaining,"" she said. ""The whole world is watching."" Civilians were meant to have safe access out of Mariupol between noon and 5pm Moscow time (9am and 2pm GMT), Russia's RIA news agency quoted city authorities as saying. Russia had said its troops, which have encircled the Azov Sea port city in Ukraine's south, would stop firing and allow civilians to pass. Russia also said it had planned a ceasefire to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Volnovakha - another besieged city in the south. Médecins Sans Frontières called for a safe route out of the city and said that several members of its staff had been trapped in Mariupol. ""The situation is the same as in recent days,"" they said in a statement. ""This night the shelling was harder and closer. We collected snow and rain water yesterday to have some utility water. ""We tried to get free water today but the queue was huge. We also wanted to get ‘social’ bread but it is not clear the schedule and the places of distribution.

Speaking at a meeting with female pilots on Saturday, Mr Putin said Russia would view ""any move in this direction"" as an intervention that ""will pose a threat to our service members"". ""That very second, we will view them as participants of the military conflict, and it would not matter what members they are,"" he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has pushed Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country, warning that ""all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you"", as Russian forces batter strategic locations. Nato has said a no-fly zone, which would bar all unauthorised aircraft from flying over Ukraine, could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. His comments came as a ceasefire to evacuate residents from two cities in Ukraine quickly fell apart, with officials saying work to remove civilians had halted amid shelling hours after Russia announced the deal. The Russian defence ministry said early on Saturday it had agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces for Mariupol, a strategic port in the south-east, and the eastern city of Volnovakha. The vaguely worded statement did not make clear how long the routes would remain open. But a short time later, Mr Zelensky's office said the ceasefire had already failed. Deputy head of his office Kyrylo Tymoshenko said: ""The Russian side is not holding to the ceasefire and has continued firing on Mariupol itself and on its surrounding area. ""Talks with the Russian Federation are ongoing regarding setting up a ceasefire and ensuring a safe humanitarian corridor."" Russia breached the deal in Volnovakha as well, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk told reporters. ""We appeal to the Russian side to stop firing,"" she said. Russian outlet RIA Novosti carried a Russian defence ministry claim that the firing came from inside both communities against Russian positions. The struggle to enforce the ceasefire shows the fragility of efforts to stop fighting across Ukraine as people continue to flee the country by the thousands. Mr Zelensky said: ""We are doing everything on our part to make the agreement work. This is one of the main tasks for today. Let's see if we can go further in the negotiation process."" Mariupol had become the scene of growing misery amid days of shelling that knocked out power and most phone service and raised the prospect of food and water shortages for hundreds of thousands of people in freezing weather. Pharmacies are out of medicine, Doctors Without Borders said. The head of Ukraine's security council, Oleksiy Danilov, had urged Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the older adults to flee the fighting, calling them ""question number one"". Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts continue as US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in Poland to meet the prime minister and foreign minister, a day after attending a Nato meeting in Brussels in which the alliance pledged to step up support for eastern flank members. Aeroflot, Russia's flagship state-owned airline, announced that it plans to halt all international flights, except to Belarus, starting on Tuesday in the wake of Western sanctions imposed on Russia. The country's aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, had recommended that all Russian airlines with foreign-leased planes halt passenger and cargo flights abroad to prevent the aircraft from being impounded. But as the United States and other Nato members send weapons for Kyiv and more than one million refugees spill through the continent, the conflict is already drawing in countries far beyond Ukraine's borders. Russia continues to crack down on independent media reporting on the war, also blocking Facebook and Twitter, and more outlets say they are pausing their work inside the country. And in a warning of a hunger crisis yet to come, the UN World Food Programme says millions of people inside Ukraine, a major global wheat supplier, will need food aid ""immediately"".

The evacuation of thousands of people from the war-torn city in the south east of Ukraine was due to start this morning, with Moscow promising to stop attacks to allow them to leave. Instead, more distressing reports have emerged from the port city. Its people have suffered near constant shelling for days on end, leaving them without power, heating, power or lights in near freezing conditions. Virtually cut off from the rest of the world, people have to rely on rainwater from gutters to quench their thirst whilst there is little that can be done for their hunger. Several grocery stores have been destroyed by missiles. Those left standing have been emptied of food and medicine by desperate people trying to survive. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Aid agencies have tried to deliver food such as bread but dare not stay still for fear they would be killed by Russian shells. The nightmare was promised to be nearly at an end today as the Kremlin and Ukraine agreed some of its half a million population could leave through a “humanitarian corridor”. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. Instead the attacks never abated leaving the city’s mayor Vadym Boychenko no choice but to cancel the evacuation, fearing it would leave more dead. He said thousands of people had gathered for safe passage out of the city and buses were departing when shelling began. He added: ""We value the life of every inhabitant of Mariupol and we cannot risk it, so we stopped the evacuation.” The mayor earlier said they have no way of knowing how many people have died in the city and he has no idea if his family have so far survived. It comes as the United Nations estimates 12 million people in Ukraine and four million fleeing to neighbouring countries in the coming months will soon need humanitarian aid. Earlier Mariupol resident Maxim, 27, told the BBC how he had videos of smoke from explosions near the city centre. He said: ""We can hear missiles and see smoke coming from buildings around us ""Our apartment building is full of people now because everyone is fleeing the shelling into the city centre.

In some sections of the wagon, parents sat in regular train seats with their children next to them, often also receiving medical assistance or sleeping. Other snaps show tanks of oxygen and medical staff preparing treatments and monitoring patients. But, amazingly, many of the children are seen smiling despite everything they've been through and such uncertainty going forward. Predominantly Russian-speaking Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, has been caught in heavy shelling since the start of the invasion on February 24. But as piles of rubble line its streets and despite it being so close to the border with Russia, the city has remained in Ukrainian control. It comes Putin bizarrely insisted tonight that Russia is not bombing Ukrainian cities - despite US estimates suggesting at least 500 missiles have been fired by Moscow. The lying Russian President has overseen the constant shelling of the neighbouring country, in which both military and civilian structures have been targeted, and thousands killed. Today, 100 people are feared to have been buried under rubble after an apartment block near the capital Kyiv was struck, while a cluster bomb attack killed 49 in Chernihiv.

Yesterday, in a bizarre televised rant, Putin said Ukrainians were using civilians as human shields - but presented no evidence to back it up - then vowed to never back down from his attack. Putin had also said his troops were heroes and that the operation, so far, was going to plan. That's despite intelligence suggesting he had expected to quickly conquer Kyiv within 48-hours - but over a week later the city is still holding him off. However, as his progress appears to be running behind, it has only led to more sadistic strategy - essentially bombing major cities relentlessly in the hope they will bow down. The port city of Mariupol, on the Black Sea in the south, is being ""simply destroyed"" by artillery, its mayor has warned. Its residents have gone days without water, while electricity has also been cut and food is running drastically low amid regular air strikes. Officials have begged the Kremlin for a ceasefire, at least long enough so they can evacuate their citizens. It comes as Russian state communications regular Roskomnadzor restricted access to Twitter after also blocking Facebook today. The regulator said there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020, including restrictions in recent days on state-backed channels like RT and the RIA news agency. The move is a major escalation in an ongoing confrontation between big tech companies and Russia, which has in recent years issued a slew of fines and hobbled services through slowdowns. Major tech companies have faced pressure to respond to the February 24 invasion, which has led to economic sanctions against Moscow by governments around the world.

Former PM Gordon Brown said a new tribunal should be set up to deal with the Russian leader’s actions. It comes after Putin’s forces almost sparked a nuclear disaster with an attack on an atomic plant. Boris Johnson branded the assault “reckless”. British police are helping a war crimes probe into Putin. And a $1million reward has been put up for his arrest. Ukraine came close to a horrific nuclear disaster after Vladimir Putin ’s forces attacked Europe’s biggest atomic power plant. The strike on the ­Zaporizhzhia plant sparked fears of a ­radioactive catastrophe as a blaze raged for hours in part of the vast site. Putin was accused of “nuclear terrorism” over the terrifying assault. It came as Moscow continued its merciless bombardment of innocent families, amid reports soldiers were raping local women as they maraud through the country. Russian businessman Alex Konanykhin, 55, offered a $1million reward for Putin’s arrest as occupied apartment blocks, schools and ­administrative buildings were again targeted by shells today. And Deputy PM Dominic Raab warned the attacks will get “ever more barbaric” as Moscow increases its stranglehold on Ukraine. The attack on Zaporizhzhia in the south late on Thursday killed three guards. Emergency crews were blocked from putting out the inferno for four hours. The assault, which comes 36 years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Soviet Ukraine, was branded a “war crime” by the US. It came after a fierce firefight to seize authority of the power station. Boris Johnson branded the attack “reckless” and said it had “threatened the ­security of the whole of Europe”. The PM revealed Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky phoned him to declare “an attack on a nuclear power plant or an explosion at a nuclear power plant are clearly a matter of our common European health and safety”. He added: “We remember what happened with Chernobyl, the ­radioactive clouds spread over the whole continent. “I am concerned about how we stop a disaster, there are other Ukrainian plants and there are other Ukrainian radioactive nuclear waste sites.” Ukraine’s energy minister German Galushchenko said: “This is real nuclear terrorism. “They shelled directly to the station. They know what they did.” Russian forces last night surrounded the site, although the Ukrainian workers who maintain the control room have been able to carry on. ­Fortunately, there was no radioactive leak after the attack and fire, ­International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi revealed. But he described the situation on the ground as “fragile” and “unstable”. And Mr Raab warned there is unlikely to be any let-up in Russian attacks, after commanders became frustrated that the invasion was not at the rapid pace they had hoped for. He said: “I’ve said that we can expect that, after the stuttering start to this campaign, that Putin would resort to ever more barbaric measures as he gets frustrated. And that is the next phase that we all need to be alert to. He claimed economic sanctions on Russia are “starting to bite”, but admitted Britain and allies need to “bed in and have the strategic stamina for the long haul”. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned Moscow will likely bring in “heavier weaponry” as the brutal conflict intensifies. He accused Russia of dropping cluster bombs and predicted more death and destruction. Mr Stoltenberg said: “We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law.” Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russian troops of raping Ukrainian women. He said: “We have numerous cases.” With Russia becoming increasingly isolated, Mr Konanykhin revealed he would pay out the $1million (£756,000) from his own fortune for the “arrest of Vladimir Putin as a war ­criminal under ­international laws”. He put up a mock Wanted: Dead or Alive poster online. Mr Konanykhin, in exile in the US, insisted he was not asking for people to kill Putin but wanted him “brought to justice”. The southern city of Mykolaiv today came under heavy fire. Russian forces also moved within striking distance of the centre. Shells, rockets and artillery also continued to rain down on Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol, Footage emerged of the charred wreckage of a block of flats in Chernihiv, showing bloodied bodies strewn on the ground. The siege of Mariupol, in the south, stayed in place, despite claims humanitarian corridors would be set up to allow civilians out. The city has been without power, water, or heating for three days. Local ­officials claim Russian troops are also stopping food getting in the wreckage of charred, bombed-out buildings. If Russia can take Mariupol, then large parts of Ukraine’s army dug into trenches in the Donbas region are in danger of being cut off. Kyiv’s government today announced that more than 2,000 ­civilians have been killed. But the figure is undoubtedly much higher as it has been impossible to access some of the worst-hit places. Officials said 9,200 Russian soldiers have lost their lives and hundreds of tanks, almost a thousand armoured vehicles and dozens of helicopters and jets have been destroyed. Ukraine and Moscow are expected to hold a third round of talks this weekend to try to stop the bloodshed.",17,3.9090971416243248,1.9782672447745018,1.930829896849823,24

As the dust settled on a shocking overnight attack on Europe’s biggest nuclear power station - prompting fears of a radioactive disaster - Putin’s forces unleashed their massive firepower on another Ukrainian city - Mykolaiv, in the south. Yet despite outraged condemnation of the nuclear assault at a meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels tonight, there was no let-up. The demolition of occupied apartment blocks, schools and administrative buildings with shells, rockets and artillery in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol was unabated. New footage of the charred wreckage of a block of flats in Chernihiv emerged online, showing bloodied bodies strewn on the ground. With Russia becoming increasingly isolated as global sanctions bite, entrepreneur Alex Konanykhin, 55, who served under Putin’s predecessor Boris Yeltsin, said in social media posts that he would pay out money from his own fortune for the “arrest of Putin as a war criminal under international laws”. He put up a mock ‘Wanted: Dead or Alive’ poster on his LinkedIn and Facebook pages, stating that Putin was not the real President of Russia because he “murdered his opponents”. After Facebook banned the post, Konanykhin, who lives in exile in the US, insisted he was not asking for people to kill Putin but wanted him “brought to justice”. Konanykhin’s offer comes ten days after Putin approved the Russian invasion of Ukraine by declaring the Russian-occupied eastern states of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. Russian soldiers engaged in a fierce firefight to seize authority over the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant late on Thursday night. The attack sparked a blaze in a block just outside the main reactor buildings. Three guards were killed in the offensive, branded a “war crime” by the US, and emergency crews were prevented from putting out the raging fire for four hours. Russian forces now surround the site, although the Ukrainian workers that maintain the control room have been able to carry on. Prime Minister Boris Johnson branded the action “reckless”, saying it had “threatened the security of the whole of Europe”. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, explained later that the attacks on Zaporizhzhia did not impact the safety systems of its six reactors. He added that there had been “no release of radioactive material”. However Mr Grossi, who says he hopes to travel soon to the decommissioned Chernobyl disaster site in northern Ukraine soon, went on to describe the situation on the ground as “very fragile” and “very unstable”. Ukraine’s energy minister German Galushchenko described the attack as “real nuclear terrorism”. “They shelled directly to the station - they know what they did,” he said. Ukraine’s government today announced that more than 2,000 civilians have been killed. It also said that 9,200 Russian soldiers have lost their lives … along with hundreds of tanks, almost a thousand armoured vehicles, and dozens of helicopters and jets. However the civilian death toll is undoubtedly much higher as it has been impossible to access some of the worst-hit places. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed there is evidence Russia has been using banned cluster bombs in its invasion, “in violation of international law”. The Russian siege of Mariupol, in the south, stayed in place, despite claims that humanitarian corridors would be set up to allow civilians out. Mariupol has been without power, water, or heating for three days, and local officials say Russian troops are also stopping food getting in the wreckage of charred, bombed-out buildings. If Russia can take it, then large parts of Ukraine’s army dug into trenches in the Donbass are in danger of getting cut off. At the same time, they moved within striking distance of the centre of Mykolaiv. But Ukraine’s military did reportedly manage to pull off some successes. Two Russian jets were downed near Volnovakha, in the east near Donetsk, while Ukrainian special forces also ambushed two of the Kremlin’s tank columns at Hostomel and Brovary, leaving large numbers of troops dead and destroying vehicles. In Melitopol, another strategically important city in the south, hundreds of people - many with national flags of Ukraine and blue-and-yellow ribbons - attended a rally to protest against the invasion. A local activist said about 2,000 people were chanting “Glory to Ukraine!” and “Death to enemies!” and also singing Ukraine’s national anthem in Victory Square. They came out on the streets even though the city was occupied by Russia in the first few days of the invasion. Although calls for a ceasefire have so far produced no respite from the fighting, Ukrainian and Russian officials are expected to hold their third round of talks this weekend. The first round of talks saw officials from both sides meet on the Ukrainian border with Belarus - with little breakthrough. In the second meeting between officials in Belarus on Thursday, Russia agreed to the need for temporary ceasefires in humanitarian corridors to allow people to escape. But Ukraine said this outcome wasn’t the result it was hoping for. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously asked Russian President Vladimir Putin for one-to-one talks, saying this is the only way to end the war.",17,2.5886280878305454,3.035976709139147,-0.44734862130860176,24

The terrifying video was captured by a dashcam as the car turned a corner and began driving down a road during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Around a dozen bombs can be seen raining down from the sky around 100 yards ahead of the car before they make impact with a loud boom. The car videoing simultaneously slows to a stop. Flames can be seen bursting out from the scene on the horizon, followed by dark grey plumes of smoke billowing out and obscuring the apartment blocks. For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our live blog A huge hole was blown in the side of the tall building which was scorched in the large fire. Civilians can be seen fleeing from the inferno, while the wailing of a car alarm pierces the air. Footage of the horrifying scenes from Ukraine comes after the news that 47 people were yesterday killed in the airstrikes using cluster bombs in Chernihiv, in the north of the country. It comes as Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, one of tyrant Vladimir Putin ’s major targets, came under renewed attack today with explosions heard in the city centre, which is now practically deserted as people flee advancing forces. A massive convoy of vehicles stretching for around 40 miles continues to be stalled on the road leading to the city, amid concerns it is regrouping for a major attack. Experts say around 15,000 troops are part of the armoured group which are believed to be waiting for supplies before launching an offensive on Kyiv. Control for some areas have already been wrested out of Ukraine’s hands. Kherson, seen as a key city because of its port, became the first to fall into Russian control yesterday with its mayor, Igor Kolykhaev, saying enemy troops forced their way into the council building. Residents still in the area now live under a strict curfew. Several others have come under intense shelling since Putin ordered the invasion of their peaceful neighbour last week. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he believes Russia is using cluster bombs in Ukraine, in violation of international law.

President Volodymyr Zelensky pledged to 'find every b***ard' who attacks Ukrainians after Russian shelling killed the family. The image was taken in Irpin, 16 miles north-west of Kyiv, as civilians desperately fled the area on Sunday. Despite Russia attacks across the country, Ukrainians are continuing to resist and troops even recaptured the city of Chuhuiv on Monday. Vladimir Putin's bombing of populated areas is an effort to break morale, according to the UK government. Ukraine's defence ministry said: ""The eleventh day of the heroic confrontation of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion began. ""Armed Forces and units of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine are fighting fierce battles to maintain certain borders. ""The opponent, suffering losses, is making constant attempts to avoid direct fire contact with our troops."" Ukraine said Russia is losing 1,000 troops a day in its invasion. In its latest update on the Russian invasion, Ukraine said: The Ukraine conflict could last “months if not years” and Vladimir Putin could resort to even “more brutal” attacks, Dominic Raab previously warned. The UK’s Deputy Prime Minister appeared to suggest “anyone” taking the Russian President’s illegal orders should be tried for war crimes, not just the leader himself. Ukrainians trying to flee their city during a ceasefire had to seek shelter after Russian forces continued shelling. The sound of explosions surrounded people fleeing the city of Mariupol during a five hour ceasefire on Friday. In the first week of the Russian invasion of Ukraine enemy troops failed to take control of several key sites, but took its first city amid severe shelling leaving dozens dead and more injured. Russian forces also seized Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest power station, on Friday in heavy fighting as fierce battles continue to be raged for control of several key cities around Ukraine. Capital Kyiv, one of tyrant Vladimir Putin ’s major targets, has been under constant bombardment with explosions heard in the city centre, which is now practically deserted as people flee advancing forces. The 20,000 person town of Trostyanets in the north of the country fell on Friday evening, the governor of Sumy Oblast said. A massive convoy of vehicles stretching for around 40 miles continues to be stalled on the road leading to the city, amid concerns it is regrouping for a major attack. Experts say around 15,000 troops are part of the armoured group which are believed to be waiting for supplies before launching an offensive on Kyiv.

Dmytro Kuleba accused Vladimir Putin ’s forces of committing sex attacks as they invaded cities. He said there were “numerous” cases of women being targeted. Speaking to the Chatham House foreign affairs think-tank via a video link, he said: ""When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities - and we have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities - it's difficult of course to speak about the efficiency of international law. “But this is the only tool of civilisation that is available to us, to make sure that in the end, eventually, all those who made this war possible will be brought to justice, and the Russian Federation, as a country that committed an act of aggression, will be held accountable for its deeds.” Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie teamed up with then Foreign Secretary William Hague in 2014 to raise awareness of how rape was used as weapon of war. The pair hosted aN End Sexual Violence in Conflict global summit in London, bringing together officials from more than 100 countries. Mr Hague said at the time: “This is a subject that the world did not want to talk about for a long time. ""We have moved a long way in the last two years in getting the world to talk about what was a taboo subject, and now we have to follow it with action.” Gordon Brown, who spoke at the same event, called for Vladimir Putin to face a Nuremberg-style war crimes tribunal. The former Prime Minister said the Russian premier should be held to account for atrocities committed as his forces invade Ukraine. Writing exclusively for the Mirror, he said: “I call on all European countries who believe that aggression must never pay to support the creation of this tribunal so that justice is done by the embattled people of Ukraine and justice can be seen to be done by them.” The ex-Labour leader also addressed the Chatham House think-tank panel, where he insisted putting Putin in the dock was “a realistic option”. He added: “This act of aggression by Russia, deplored in the strongest terms this week by the UN General Assembly, cannot go uninvestigated, unprosecuted and unpunished. “But there is a serious gap in international law. Since Russia is not party to the statute of the International Criminal Court, this crime of aggression cannot, as things stands, be investigated by the prosecutor.” Moscow pulled out of the ICC in 2016. Charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide can be brought against Russia even though it is not a signatory. However, the crime of aggression cannot be prosecuted against people from a non-ICC state - unless the UN Security Council makes a referral. That cannot happen because Russia is one of the Council’s five permanent members and has a veto. Even if Putin was charged, he would need to be arrested by a state that is signed up to the ICC - so if he never left Russia he would be highly unlikely to be arrested. But Mr Brown said that trying Putin was “a realistic option”. International human rights QC Philippe Sands todl Chatham House: “When Charles de Gaulle an dothers met in London in january 1942 it must have been unimaginable that ever Nazi leaders like Hermon Goerring and others would find themselves in the dock, and yet three years later that is what happened.” 1 Shutting off Russian banks’ access to the West, with plan to move to full asset freeze on all Russian banks. 2 Sanctions on Russian central bank and financial institutions, already in effect. 3 Preventing Russian firms and the Russian state raising debt in the UK, already enacted. 4 Asset freeze against individual oligarchs, with 15 so far including Putin and Lavrov and more to come. 5 Targeting key strategic sectors including defence with more planned on services and energy. 6 Blocking access to SWIFT, with UK still pushing for a full SWIFT ban against all Russian banks. 7 Banning Russian planes and ships landing in UK, with new laws next week to put this on longer-term footing. 8 Banning export to Russia of ‘dual-use’ items such as electronics that could be used in military computers or weaponry. 9 Setting a £50,000 limit on wealthy Russians’ deposits in UK bank accounts. 10 Extending the above sanctions to Belarus due to its role supporting the Russian invasion. 11 Extending UK-Crimea total trade embargo to the Luhansk and Donetsk ‘People’s Republics’. But still no date, due to concerns about protecting Ukrainians still there. 12 Sanctions on all members of Russian Parliament and Russian National Security who voted in support of invasion. Still in progress despite EU acting already. For more information click here. He added: “Who knows? But it’s not impossible.” Speaking to the think-tank via video link from what appeared to be a vehicle in Kyiv, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that while Ukraine was “fighting against an enemy much stronger than us, we have international law on our side”. Backing the tribunal, he added: “This is the only tool of civilisation that is available to us, to make sure that in the end, eventually, all those who made this war possible will be brought to justice, and the Russian Federation, as a country that committed an act of aggression, will be held accountable for its deeds.” Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said Putin risked ending up in prison.

The video showed the heavily armed helicopter falling out of the sky after coming under heavy fire from the ground. Moments later, the aircraft smashed into the water. It is not known if the pilot or anybody else aboard survived the impact. Other choppers flying in close formation also took hits from the barrage of bullets, but managed to stay airborne. The hardware is known as the Alligator and is believed to be Russia ’s most sophisticated attack helicopter, drawing comparisons with the USA’s infamous Apache. First made in 1996, it is capable of destroying armoured ground targets as well as personnel and is regularly deployed as a surveillance platform for other vehicles. For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our liveblog As the invasion got underway last week squadrons of the aircraft were filmed flying towards capital Kyiv in chilling scenes. Joseph Dempsey, a research associate for defence and military analysis for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter : “Ka-52 Hokum B attack helicopter in apparent forced landing after suffering damage, reportedly North West of [Kyiv].” The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. It comes amid accusations Vladimir Putin risked causing a 'nuclear apocalypse' by attacking Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, early this morning. Russian troops opened fire on the station and eventually overpowered local troops. The Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) of Ukraine posted on Telegram: ""Putin might create a nuclear apocalypse as a result of potential catastrophe on South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant in Zaporizhzhia."" Russia denied it was responsible for the attack, claiming it had held the area since the second day of the invasion. Instead it said the attack was by Ukrainians. Russians are fleeing their country amid fears Vladimir Putin’s fury will turn on his own people and close the borders, leaving them unable to escape his tyranny. Trains full of desperate people lugging heavy luggage travelling from St Petersburg have pulled into Helsinki railway station this week.

2022-03-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-war-pictures-vladimir-putin-26384495,Ukraine war pictures Vladimir Putin doesn’t want Russians to see,"According to a Norwegian International Affairs researcher, the images people in Russia are being shown by the official media are far from the brutal reality of the Ukraine war. Russian president Vladimir Putin is reportedly painting a completely different picture of his ongoing invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. For people only consuming Russian media, it comes across as there being an ongoing ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, which has the aim of protecting the people of East Ukraine against the so-called nationalistic government in Kyiv. Russian state television aired a short statement by Putin last week, where he described Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's government as "" a band of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,"" and claimed most of the Russian army's fighting had been with ""national groups"". Follow the latest updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine in our live blog The pictures we in the West see of Ukrainian resistance, civilian casualties and people fleeing their homes and the destruction of buildings and properties are being censored by Russian officials. You're also unlikely to see any pictures of Russia appearing 'weak', or not in control of the war. Speaking about pictures showing the bodies of Russian soldiers, Natalia Moen-Larsen, researcher at the the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, told Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang (VG): “No, no. Images such as this aren’t shown on official channels in Russia.” The pictures in question were taken in the city of Bucha, which is part of the Kyiv Oblast region. According to VG, Russian tanks entered the city, which is located near Hostomel airport, but were stopped by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, February 27. Some of the most shocking images of devastation show how an entire convoy of tanks and armoured vehicles were obliterated. The charred debris from vehicles completely blocked one of Bucha’s main roads, a mere 20 miles from the centre of Kyiv. Moen-Larsen told VG: “They can’t admit to the Russian people when things go badly for the Russian forces. Russia needs to appear as the strongest force.” According to the researcher, the Russian population is not being shown images of Russia shooting missiles directed towards Ukrainian cities either. The video at the top of this article is one that is being showed to Russian civilians by the tightly controlled media. The video, filed in Kharkiv, shows Russian helicopters flying over Ukraine, painting a different picture of the war. Moen-Larsen explained in an opinion piece posted in the Norwegian TV2, that the “truth about the war doesn’t see the light of day in Russia”. The researcher explained how most Russians see Ukrainians as their “brothers” and they don’t want a war with them. She added: “If the Russians were given all the facts they would not be happy. But I don’t think they will be given the facts, because there aren’t many unbiased sources.” Instead, the Russian media is showing pictures of houses that have been bombed in Eastern Ukraine, from the area of the country where Russian-supporting separatist forces already had control before the invasion. In addition, people are being shown pictures of Ukrainians throwing Molotov cocktails to defeat the Russians. Moen-Larsen explains how this is done to “show examples of how the Ukrainian military use civilians as ‘shields’”. Most of the media in Russia is tightly controlled by the government. Most news organisations are obliged to report the situation the way the government portrays it, VG reports. According to the researcher, most of the Russians get their information from TV. The government-controlled TV stations are very selective with the information they show to the people of Russia. However, even the number of TV stations has been dramatically reduced since the beginning of the war. Moen-Larsen said: “Two [TV stations] were removed on Tuesday, and can now only be found on YouTube. That means not many people can see it. “There are perhaps only 100,000 people, in a country with a population of 140 million, that see it. “There is a small percentage of Russians who find other sources, and it’s becoming increasingly less.”",17,4.226301458362476,3.127564810006521,1.0987366483559553,19
2022-03-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-shelling-russia-nuclear-plant-26301088,Shelling in war explained as Russian shells set fire to nuclear power plant site,"The Russian shelling of Ukraine has continued in cities with news last night that a nuclear power plant was targeted by invading troops. A fire broke out at the site of Zaporizhzhia power plant in Energodar, southern Ukraine. The plant is the largest of its kind in Europe and any potential explosion there has been described as being worse than ""ten times worse than Chernobyl"". However, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service later reported the fire was in a building outside the plant and has since been extinguished. When war broke out, Russian forces were expected to sweep through Ukraine far quicker than they have done. Instead, their advance of the capital of Kyiv is 'slowing' - according to recent reports - and they have also failed to take Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, only around 20 miles from the Russian border. With this occurring, there appears to have been a trend in which Russian forces are attempting to break resistance by increasing their shelling on key parts of Ukraine, leading to civilians being indiscriminately attacked. The tactic has been widely used by Russian forces, so what is shelling? Shelling is a tactic in warfare that involves firing large ‘shells’ full of explosives at your enemies. The definitions surrounding the words point to exactly that. Shelling is defined by the Oxford Learners’ Dictionary as “the firing of shells from large guns”, while a shell is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as “a container, usually with a pointed end, that is filled with explosives and shot from a large gun”. In other words, shelling is also often known as artillery fire, big guns launching huge projectiles at enemy positions from far away. Reports of the continued shelling on Ukrainian cities suggest that Russia is launching bombs indiscriminately, rather than just targeting military positions. As a result, Ukraine's State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have died since war broke out. This has not been verified and the UN human rights office said it had recorded 227 deaths, with 525 injured. The tactic can be particularly brutal and indiscriminate because, with the shot fired often from a large distance and packed with high explosives, they can easily hit people and things they weren’t intended for. Kyiv and Kharkiv have seen particularly intense shelling, as have the cities of Mariupol and Chernihiv. Despite ensuring casualties would be avoided, Vladimir Putin's armed forces have resorted to the devastating shelling of Ukrainian cities, driving an estimated one million people across the border in neighbouring Poland, Romania, Hungary and Moldova. The shelling of Kharkiv has led to much of the cities landmarks being targeted, including the opera house, Freedom Square, university and city hall. The International Criminal Court has launched an investigation into Putin's shelling of Ukraine, including the alleged use of banned cluster bombs. A video verified by Reuters showed that the surroundings of the Zaporizhzhia power plant were also bombed by a 'volley of shells' as the mayor of nearby town Energodar saw ""continuous enemy shelling"". Zaporizhzhia is key to the energy supply of surrounding towns, and while there are no indications that the plant's functions have been affected - no reports of an increase in radiation have emerged - Russian control of the plant is ideal for the invaders. Outrage and condemnation of the attack were seen across the globe, as people feared another nuclear disaster should the plant be heavily damaged. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the assault on the plant, which is now under Russian control, as 'reckless'. The University of Sydney's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, David Fletcher, said in a statement: ""The real concern is not a catastrophic explosion as happened at Chernobyl but damage to the cooling system which is required even when the reactor is shut down."" Ukrainian authorities have since said ""nuclear safety is now guaranteed"".",17,4.147862445864795,3.6634573706158697,0.48440507524892507,17

Multiple videos showing ill-prepared military units 'out of fuel' have been circulating online and in one video a nationalist decided to make the most of the opportunity, as The Express reports . In one video the man approaches and rolls down his window before asking what the soldiers were doing - and the Russian troops replied: ""Waiting for diesel."" The driver then mocks the soldiers, saying he would love to help and offers: ""I can tug you back to Russia !""

She told the wife of the Ukraine ambassador that she was “praying for you”, said reports. The Duchess was reduced to tears talking to representatives from the 70,000 or so Ukrainians living in this country. Her spokesman reportedly said last night: ""No one could fail to be moved by the appalling scenes of Ukrainians fleeing their homes and the duchess wanted to help in whatever way she could."" Charles also emphasised the fighting spirit of the Ukrainians to defend their country, paying tribute to their “extraordinary bravery and fortitude” reported the Daily Mail. A humanitarian crisis is unfolding in Ukraine with the United Nations now saying that more than one million refugees have fled the country since the Russian invasion began a week ago. There have been long queues at borders with women and children along with foreign nationals leaving while men aged 18 to 60 are obliged to remain in the country. It comes following claims that the first major city has fallen to the Russians with Vladimir Putin’s troops now on the ground in Kherson and they have forced their way into a council building. The Black Sea port of Kherson, a southern provincial capital of around 250,000 people, is strategically placed where the Dnipro River flows into the Black Sea. Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday it had captured Kherson but several hours later an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy responded the Ukrainian side was continuing to defend the location. Late on Wednesday, Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said Russian troops were in the streets. ""There were armed visitors in the city executive committee today,"" he said in a statement. ""I didn't make any promises to them... I just asked them not to shoot people."" He called on civilians to walk through the streets only in daylight and in ones and twos. In other incidents, bombing in Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people, has left its centre a wasteland of ruined buildings and debris. Russians have shelled the city of Izyum, some 120 km south east of Kharkiv, killing six adults and two children, Ukraine's parliament said. An explosion also rocked the Kyiv railway station during the night, where thousands of women and children were being evacuated. An interior ministry adviser said the blast was caused by wreckage from a downed Russian cruise missile, not a direct rocket strike. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

It is becoming one of the most famous cities in the world due to its role in the war with Russia, and President Volodymyr Zelensky has described Russia's attack on the city as 'war crimes'. The attacks have led to huge numbers of people fleeing the country already, an estimated one million, while at least 10 people were killed and 35 injured in attacks on the city earlier this week. More people have now been killed in the city. When the square was attacked, Zelensky said: ""This is terror against Ukraine. There were no military targets in the square - nor are they in those residential districts of Kharkiv which come under rocket artillery fire."" So where is Kharkiv and why has it seen so much of the war? Follow the latest updates in the Russian war on Ukraine in the Mirror's live blog Kharkiv is in northeastern Ukraine, around 250 miles east of Kyiv. The city is still reported to be under Ukrainian control despite sustained Russian attacks in the form of airstrikes. Russian troops have not had as much success as it was feared when war broke out. Historically, Kharkiv is culturally important as well, described by Britannica as ""one of the most important cultural and educational centres of Ukraine"". A hub of writers and developments in the arts developed there during the 19th and 20th centuries despite Soviet rule. This is not the first time the city has seen war and it changed a number of ties during World War Two when it was occupied by German invaders. An enormous portion of the city was destroyed and had to be rebuilt after the war. Along with Mariupol, Chernihiv and the capital of Kyiv, the main cities of Ukraine are strategically important and are likely to see more of the fighting - Kharkiv is only 20 miles from the Russian border The city appears to be important strategically too as it is well connected, with highways to both Moscow and Kyiv, as well as Crimea. As the second-largest city in Ukraine and with a population of around 1.4 million people before war broke out, it has a major airport. Taking Kharkiv could be key to the Russian advance on Kyiv, which is now reported to be stalling, due to what the UK Ministry of Defence today described as ""staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion"".

Clearly in distress, the first meekly agrees before being angrily told to speak up and say it again. The next repeats the interrogator's words saying “Glory to Russia”, which is echoed by those further along the line. Article 13 of the third Geneva convention says prisoners of war must be humanely treated and ""protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have also filmed Russian prisoners of war but no footage has emerged of them being coerced or intimidated. One of those taken prisoner is seen wearing a red cross on a white background, signally he is a medic. The location and fate of those in the video is unknown.

It comes as all men aged between 18 and 60 have been banned from fleeing Ukraine as the government attempts to fight back against the thousands of invading Russians. The order is to remain in place throughout the time martial law is instigated in the under siege nation. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. Earlier this week a video emerged from Ukraine showing Captured Russian soldiers breaking down in tears as they told their families they had been 'sent to their deaths' in Ukraine . The prisoners of war were interviewed on camera by Ukrainian forces and said they had been used as cannon fodder in the war. It comes after Ukraine claimed it had killed 9,000 Russian troops during the first six full days of the invasion. The Kremlin claims it is a much lower figure of around 498. One captive was filmed speaking to his mother over the phone, telling her: “They sent us to death, everyone killed everyone.” The soldier then broke down crying and told his mum ‘I love you too’. In another clip, a different Russian prisoner said: “We came for training. We were lied to and that’s why I am here.” His comrade added: “At the beginning we were told that we were going for training. Eventually after we were sent to the frontline everyone was demoralised. “Nobody wanted to fight but we were told that we would be enemies of the state and because it's wartime we might even get shot. “We were thrown as ‘gunmeat’, although people in our unit at least don’t want this war, they just want to go home and want peace.”",13,4.113082966273399,5.194384638815688,-1.0813016725422884,14

The dad, who was known only as Serhii, cradled his son Iliya's head as he bent over the stretcher set up at a maternity unit, which was covered by a blood-soaked sheet. The boy had arrived at the hospital moments earlier in the back of a car, with both legs having been ripped apart by a Russian shell. The Black Sea city hospital had been turned into a makeshift hospital to treat civilian victims of Russian shelling, as fighting continues in Ukraine amid Russia ’s invasion. Mariupol, the main port of eastern Ukraine, has been surrounded under heavy bombardment with no water or power. Officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog The city council compared the situation to the World War 2 siege of Leningrad, referring to Nazi Germany's siege of the then-Soviet city where about 1.5 million people died during two years of blockade. Earlier today Pro-Russian forces warned they would launch targeted strikes on the city of Mariupol unless Ukrainian forces there surrender. The news of yet another young casualty in the city comes as the war in Ukraine is entering its second week, with Ukrainian cities surrounded and under bombardment. It’s been a day of continued attacks on cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv, which have suffered intense damage. Swathes of central Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people, have been blasted into rubble. Attempts to seize both cities have failed so Kremlin forces have instead resorted to heavy bombing, causing thousands of civilian casualties. The city of Kherson has been taken by Russian troops but elsewhere the invaders have met with fierce Ukraine resistance. Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed since President Vladimir Putin sent his troops over the border on February 24, while Russia itself has been plunged into isolation never before experienced by an economy of such size. According to figures from the United Nations, more than 1 million refugees had fled the country in just seven days. Today has brought with it the announcement that Ukraine would call for Ukrainian corridors for its besieged citizens at peace talks with Russia - which began this afternoon. Negotiations began between the Russian and Ukrainian sides at about 3pm today. Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia posted a picture on Facebook of himself preparing to board a helicopter for talks. He did not say where. ""The minimum programme: humanitarian corridors,"" he said. Neither side has suggested it was expecting breakthroughs after a first round of talks held in Belarus on Monday led to no progress.

Major-General Andrey Sukhovetsky, 47, was the deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of the Central Military District. There has been no official announcement over his death but a military source confirmed: “This is true. Sniper.” His funeral back in Russia is scheduled for Saturday. Russia has admitted to 498 deaths in the Ukraine “special military operation” - but the figure is almost certainly higher. He is the most senior known casualty, and a blow to Putin in another sign his war effort is not going to plan.

It is not confirmed where he died but suspected it during in attempt to land in Hostomel. On the first day of the war, an assault by airborne forces just outside Kyiv was met with strong resistance from the Ukrainians. Defenders shot down a number of the Mi-8 troop-carrying helicopters during the assault. Sergey Chipilyov, of the All-Russian Union Airborne Forces Union of Russian Paratroopers, posted: ""With great pain, we received the tragic news about the death of our friend, Major-General Andrey Aleksandrovich Sukhovetsky, in Ukraine during a special operation. “We express our deepest condolences to his family.” Until 2021, he headed the Novorossiysk 7th Guards Airborne Assault Mountain Division, which specialised in combat in mountainous areas.

Mariupol, on the Black Sea, is under constant bombardment from Kremlin airstrikes, with vital civilian infrastructure cruelly targeted in an effort to force the southeastern city into submission. The then-Soviet city of Leningrad, now called St Petersburg, saw a protracted Nazi siege during World War 2, resulting in 1.5million people killed over two years. Dramatic maps show how invading troops have closed in, after shelling left citizens without water and in a blackout after the power was cut. Supplies are also unable to enter and people cannot evacuate. For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our live blog As well as missiles raining in, bloody street clashes are also taking place on the outskirts. Russia has already taken Kherson to the southwest, as well Melitopol to the east. ""They are breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade, as in the old Leningrad,"" the council said in a statement. ""Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying [Mariupol's] critical life-support infrastructure. ""We have no light, water or heat again,"" it added. The council went onto say it was seeking to create a humanitarian corridor for Mariupol, as well as trying to restore infrastructure. ""Mariupol remains under fire. Women, children and the elderly are suffering. We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" the statement concluded. The city is home to an estimated 400,000 and is a key target for Russia as its capture would allow Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine to join troops in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed in 2014. One resident said the people are ""terrified"" after two days of no water and food is running low. IT developer Maxim said he filled up his bathtub with water before it was cut off. He told the BBC today: ""The shelling started again at six this morning. ""The city was completely black overnight, there was no source of light apart from the explosions. ""It was quiet for a few hours but then at dawn it started again. We can hear it now from every direction. We are terrified."" Mariupol's deputy mayor Sergiy Orlov said 15 main power lines are now down, with only the natural gas supply left. Yesterday he described how whole districts have been levelled with the city surrounded by invading forces as artillery rains down. He said medics could not even get in to retrieve the dead as the Kremlin unleashed ""medieval"" tactics. ""We are near to a humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said. ""Russian forces are several kilometres away on all sides. ""The Ukrainian army is brave and they will continue to defend the city, but Russia does not fight with their army, they just destroy districts...We are in a terrible situation.""",17,3.3664384208753035,2.51571691391238,0.8507215069629237,26

Ukrainians have vowed to defend their country, with many deciding to stay and fight against Russia. The country's president Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Russia ’s murderous aerial assault on the city of Kharkiv this week. He said: “Russian forces brutally fired on Kharkiv from jet artillery. It was clearly a war crime. There will be an international tribunal. “No one in the world will forgive you for killing peaceful Ukrainian people.” Here, we look at how Vladimir Putin's invasion plan is going. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Even though the Russian advance from the north has slowed in recent days, Kyiv continues to face multiple attacks from the air. A series of loud explosions rocked those sheltering in basements this morning. The city’s main TV tower was also hit in an attempt to cut access to information. Hostomel Airport has been the scene of fierce fighting and has changed hands multiple times in the past few days, according to the Institute for the Study of War. Russian forces arrived near Obolon on the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday and clashes in north-western Kyiv were reported at the weekend – but so far, Russian tanks and armoured vehicles have not been seen in the capital. The most rapid advance on Kyiv has come down the west of the Dnieper river via Chernobyl, with the Russians taking control of a large area to the north and west of the capital. However the 40-mile-long column of Russian tanks and troop vehicles has stalled and the MoD said the main body of the Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 19 miles from the centre. Military experts say the unexpected resistance has caught Russian planners unawares, with insufficient food, water and fuel supplies. There have also been mechanical problems with the tanks. Russian troops are now advancing on the capital from the west after coming from the north, but are still thought to be 40 miles away. Analysts believe Putin wants to choke the Ukrainian economy by seizing its biggest port, Odesa. It is through the picturesque city that Ukraine exports grain and minerals such as iron ore to Europe. General Sir Richard Barrons, an ex-British military chief, has said to lose Odesa would be like the UK losing Dover. Ukrainian forces noted Russian Black Sea Fleet’s landing unit, consisting of four ships accompanied by three missile boats, heading “in the direction of Odesa”. Dnipro, on the Dnieper river which divides Ukraine, is of huge strategic importance. Over the last week many Kharkiv residents have fled there, but now it is thought Dnipro will be a main target. Air raid sirens have sounded almost continuously at night. Roads and buildings are being fortified and hundreds of armed volunteers are manning barricades and roadblocks on the edge of the city. Ukraine’s second-largest city has come under ferocious aerial bombardment in recent days. Dozens have been killed and hundreds more seriously injured, including in a missile strike on the city’s central Freedom Square. Although the Ukrainian military has retained control of Kharkiv, Russian paratroopers landed in the outskirts on Wednesday to conduct a raid on a military hospital, and an Indian student was reportedly killed while buying groceries. Close to the ultimate goal of Kyiv, the Russian military is desperate to subdue its second city neighbour, which has a population of 1.5million. By doing this, they will be able to close in on the capital on another front. The onslaught on Mariupol has been one of the most brutal inflicted on Ukraine since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. An incessant attack with artillery, rockets and air strikes has completely obliterated parts of the city, according to local officials, and left hundreds of bodies in the ruins. Russia’s determination to seize Mariupol stems from a desire to link Donetsk and Luhansk with Crimea, which Russia has controlled since 2014, and to effectively cut Ukraine off from the sea. General Sir Richard Barrons, former commander of the Joint Forces Command, told Sky News that would be “a crippling blow to the Ukrainian economy”. Russia’s capture of Black Sea port city Kherson is of huge strategic importance to the invaders as well as a blow to Ukraine’s dogged defiance. By taking the regional capital and other cities, Putin’s troops will be able to cross the Dnieper River and advance on Kyiv from the south. Crucially, army commanders will be able to link up the two main offensives. Kherson holds the region’s fresh water supply, which the Russians could then use in Crimea. The invaded city’s mayor Igor Kolykheav said Putin’s forces had taken over a council meeting, and imposed a curfew on residents. He urged the Russians to not attack civilians, claiming there are no more soldiers in the city.",17,2.703561622143324,2.59995772223723,0.1036038999060942,19

Negotiations took place between the Russian and Ukrainian sides this afternoon, with a humanitarian corridor to evacuate citizens agreed by 5.30pm. The announcement came just hours after the news that Ukraine would call for such corridors for its besieged people. It came as Moscow faces increased pressure from western countries to cease its intense bombardment of Ukraine, which has forced a million civilians to flee in just over a week. Ukraine’s presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak has said the two sides will work in conjunction to provide humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians as well as provide food and medicine to the worst-hit areas. Podolyak was reportedly happy with the corridors, though tweeted after the agreement was reached to say the results Ukraine needed were “not yet achieved”. Meanwhile, Russian invasion forces continued to surround and rain missiles on Ukrainian cities, with an airstrike on an apartment block in Chernihiv killing 22 civilians earlier today. Speaking to Express.co.uk, Dr Samuel Ramani, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies and International Relations tutor at the University of Oxford said the corridors may not be quite what they seem. He said: “I’m very sceptical that this phrase humanitarian corridor is nothing more than a euphemism. “What ended up happening in Syria in 2019, following the creation of corridors, was massive aerial bombardment and a renewed state of near siege. “This led to malnutrition and basically the destruction of lives up to three million people.” Dr Ramani referred to the Syrian government's creation of similar “corridors” with the help of the Russian Government back in 2019, with the aim of safely evacuating civilians. However, these corridors ended up being an excuse to shell cities, with the corridors soon becoming branded “death corridors”. Discussion of the corridors comes after another day of fierce fighting around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine. The battle came as Vladimir Putin claimed Ukraine is using civilians and foreigners as ""human shields"" - while his forces bomb densely-populated areas. The outrageous claim followed a day of continued attacks on cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv, which have suffered intense damage.

Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said in online posts today that the forces had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, after entering in tanks. Earlier, Mr Herashchenko said Russian troops were stepping up efforts to seize control of the power plant. The plant's workers live in the nearby town of Energodar. It comes as Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, some 100 km north of Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Kremlin troops stormed the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on the first day of the invasion. Fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the area in the north of the country may have led to damage at the facility, although these reports are yet to be independently verified. Earlier this afternoon, crowds of brave Ukrainians formed a human barricade in front of Zaporizhzhia, lining the road leading to the plant in a bid to prevent Russian troops from seizing it. The move of defiance came after Kyiv warned Russia risked creating “a new Chernobyl” if it went ahead with an attack. And this morning the UN nuclear watchdog voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Zaporizhzhia, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. According to Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant - which housed six of the country’s 15 reactors. Anton Gerashchenko, the interior ministry official, said in a Facebook post: “Russian generals – change your minds! Do not create conditions for the new Chernobyl! ""Radiation knows no nationalities, one does not spare anyone! Go around the Energodar and Zaporizhzhya.” Ukraine had requested that the IAEA declare a 30km safe zone around Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants. News of gunfire in the worrying new battleground comes as Vladimir Putin has today claimed Ukraine is using civilians and foreigners as ""human shields"" - while his forces bomb densely-populated areas.

The look on his face is one of complete devotion. The maternity unit was a makeshift ward hastily set up in a dingy Kyiv bunker. Outside is the shelling, death and destruction brought on this boy’s country by the blood-stained hands of Vladimir Putin. But not even the atrocities of conflict would prevent this father from experiencing that most precious of moments: holding your infant child for the first time. To have brought life into the world when so many are dying around you will have made this small act of humanity all the more poignant. For most parents this will have been a time of unparalleled joy. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog You ask yourself all the familiar questions: Will they take after their mother or father? What will they be like when they grow up? This young father will not even know if his family will survive Putin’s slaughter. But there is no stronger symbol of hope than the arrival of a new life. Today, Russia’s foreign minister warned World War Three “will be nuclear, and devastating” as Kremlin forces closed in on Kyiv Sergei Lavrov issued the chilling threat as Vladimir Putin’s troops encircled the Ukrainian capital and paratroopers landed in the north eastern city of Kharkiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the invaders “have an order to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all”. NATO bolstered air defences on the alliance’s eastern flank as tensions mounted. US F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jets were deployed to Lithuania, while E-3A Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System spy planes flew sorties over eastern Europe. Western leaders fear that if Putin’s military overruns Ukraine, he could quickly target Baltic states which form part of the 30-member NATO alliance. Veteran diplomat Mr Lavrov warned of escalation between Russia and NATO, claiming “a Third World War will be nuclear, and devastating”. Kyiv is braced for Russian forces to lay siege to the city after they failed to conquer the country in a week. A 40-mile long convoy thought to include 15,000 Kremlin troops was edging closer to Kyiv tonight. Residents fear soldiers will try to starve them into submission. Soldiers have already entered Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following days of intensive bombardment. A Russian-fired cruise missile struck a local council building, according to the region’s deputy governor - hours after paratroopers landed in the city earlier today. A rocket reportedly struck a regional police department building and part of Karazin University. At least 21 people were killed and 112 wounded in shelling, according to the city’s mayor. Mr Zellensky said: “Russian forces have today cruelly targeted Kharkiv with artillery fire. “This is a peaceful place, peaceful suburbs … the Russians knew where they were shooting.” Authorities were examining reports of a possible Russian rocket attack or artillery fire on the airport at Ukraine’s Black Sea port city of Odessa. Latest intelligence suggested Russian forces had moved into the centre of Kherson in south Ukraine. Reports claimed it was completely surrounded, and Ukrainian officials insisted the battle was continuing. But the Russian defence ministry said: “Negotiations are ongoing between the Russian command, the administration of the city and the region to address issues of maintaining the functioning of social infrastructure facilities, ensuring law and order and the safety of the population.” Mr Zelensky said a missile strike which hit a Holocaust memorial in Kyiv was “beyond humanity”. The Babyn Yar memorial commemorates the massacre of more than 33,000 Jews by Nazi troops in Kyiv during the Second World War. “Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital, about our history,” Mr Zelensky said. “But they have an order to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all.” Eyewitnesses told of desperate scenes at Dnipro railway station as people tried to flee. Crowds packed onto station steps, in ticket halls and on platforms - surging forward when trains arrived as they battled to squeeze aboard. But, eight days after they launched their offensive, Russian commanders were assessing their lack of progress and why they failed to meet their initial objectives. Mr Zelensky claimed nearly 6,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first week of the invasion - though the Russian defence ministry put its death toll at 498, with 1,597 wounded. More than 200 Russian soldiers have been taken captive by Ukrainian forces, according to the Ukrainian defence ministry. A spokesman also claimed 198 Russian tanks, 29 planes, 846 armoured vehicles and 29 helicopters had been destroyed. Western military experts believe Moscow is now focusing on aerial and artillery bombardment of cities rather than the kind of lightning, mobilised, armoured advances originally planned by the Kremlin. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace feared Moscow would now “carpet-bomb cities - indiscriminately in some cases”. He added: “What you have seen is the Russian pause on the outskirts and then ruthlessly pummel these cities with artillery and then hope to break the city.” The Cabinet Minister praised Ukrainian resistance for slowing the Russian advance. “The Russians are considerably behind their schedule, by days not hours, and that leads to stresses on their logistical supply chains,” said Mr Wallace. “That’s why you have seen some of these columns fairly grind to a halt. “They have also been surprised by the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.” More than 2,000 civilians have died since the invasion began, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service - though the death toll has not been independently verified. Mr Zelensky and Boris Johnson spoke by phone, with the Prime Minister condemning the “abhorrent attacks on Ukraine in the recent hours and days”, No10 said. The Ukrainian leader said defensive aid sent by the UK “had been vital in holding back Russian forces”, Downing Street added. The PM promised further support and weapons for forces resisting Moscow’s onslaught. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir - both former world heavyweight boxing champions - called for more help from allies so Ukraine could defend itself. Wladimir said: “It’s never enough. “There’s huge demand because infrastructure is partially destroyed by the shelling that is happening all over the country in the different cities. “It’s absolutely not enough and we definitely need to support and help - financial support, military equipment support, medical support.” His brother added: “Everyone has to be involved. It’s war not against Ukraine, it’s war against (all) civilians and it’s war against democracy. “We need support - support from the whole world.”",17,2.6714435214657106,2.213931600030418,0.45751192143529273,17

The second city of Kharkiv saw a rocket striking a university building and police station in the early hours of Wednesday morning, followed by the city council. For days it has been brutalised with missiles as Russia grows more and more desperate to claim a major scalp. With plans to move through the country quickly before taking Kyiv within 48-hours when war was declared last Thursday fallen flat, Putin has changed tack. Analysts have warned Russia, having suffered heavy losses against a much inferior military, is likely to begin surrounding cities and bombing them into submission. Ukraine estimates it has seen 2,000 civilians killed. If Mariupol falls, the thousands of defending troops in trenches along the frontline with Donetsk will be exposed, while Chernihiv, in the north east, and Sumy, in the east, could then follow suit. Russia today gave the town of Konotop the ultimatum ""surrender or be destroyed"". The strategic port city of Kherson in the south appears to have already fallen to the invaders after more heavy bombing with tanks seen rolling through the streets. While Zaporizhzhia, home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has also been surrounded. Ukraine's interior ministry had warned of a ""nuclear catastrophe"" if it was hit.

Vladimir Putin ’s forces are bombarding Ukrainian cities despite worldwide condemnation and strict sanctions which are threatening to cripple the economy. There have been continual reports of destruction from Russian missiles with buildings blown up and heavy military and civilian casualties. But the Russians have not been able to take a major city and are slowly encircling Kyiv with a 40 mile military convoy on its way. Russia 's defence ministry urged Kyiv residents to flee and said it would strike unspecified areas used by Ukraine's security services and communications. Russia describes its assault on Ukraine as a special operation, not an invasion seeking territory. Ukraine is still showing considerable resolve to repel the invasion while hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the war-torn country with women and children allowed to leave but men aged 18 to 60 must remain. And images have emerged showing the desperation of people, some with young children, trying to get out of Kyiv as they tried to find space on a train. There have also been long queues and chaos at the Ukraine border as people look to escape to Poland and other neighbouring countries. Russian troops have not had the immediate breakthrough that they are believed to have expected but they remain a massive force and are causing considerably damage. Kyiv's mayor published a video showing the moment when a tall TV antennae in the city was engulfed in flames, apparently hit by a rocket. West of Kyiv, in the city of Zhytomyr, four people, including a child, were killed on Tuesday by a Russian cruise missile, a Ukrainian official said. Elsewhere, rocket strikes on the centre of Kharkiv killed at least 21 people, regional governor Oleg Synegubov said. Similar strikes that killed and wounded dozens in Kharkiv the previous day involved cluster bombs, experts said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before meaningful talks on a ceasefire could start, as a first round of negotiations this week had yielded scant progress. ""It's necessary to at least stop bombing people, just stop the bombing and then sit down at the negotiating table,"" he said. Ukraine has called on the NATO alliance to implement a no-fly zone - a request rejected by Washington, which fears stoking a direct conflict between the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Washington and its allies have instead sent weapons to Kyiv, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the United States had agreed with partners to convene a task force ""to freeze and seize the assets of key Russian elites"". The move ""will inflict financial pain on the powerful individuals surrounding Putin and make clear that no one is beyond our collective reach,"" Yellen said in a statement following a Tuesday call with Group of Seven officials.

2022-03-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russias-most-deadly-weapons-thermobaric-26355727,Russia may have used some of its most deadly weapons like horrific vacuum bomb,"Russia's military is one of the most advanced forces on Earth and includes some terrifyingly deadly weapons. One, known as a thermobaric vacuum bomb, is of particular concern, even as Vladimir Putin places his deterrent troops - which includes nuclear weapons - on high alert. When Putin announced the invasion of Ukraine last week, few expected successful resistance for so long. As fierce resistance continues, it appears Putin's troops are resorting to more extreme measures, including heavy bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Russian forces struck Independence Square in central Kharkiv on Tuesday morning, causing a huge explosion. Having promised that civilians would not be targeted, reports seem to indicate that indiscriminate bombing is taking place as Putin attempts to grind down Ukrainian resistance. The shelling has also caused a wave of migration westwards, as desperate families seek shelter outside of the country. As there appears to be a link between ongoing resistance by Ukrainian armed forces and the lengths Putin will go to destroy it, there is concern that more deadly weapons will be used. One of the weapons there is most concern about is the vacuum bomb, which sucks in oxygen to create a high-temperature explosion. Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova claimed the bomb has already been used in the invasion, though this has not yet been confirmed and the ambassador gave no indication as to where it had been used. She said: ""They used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva Convention."" Vacuum bombs are known as some of the most deadly non-nuclear weapons in existence. They suck in the surrounding air, creating a massive explosion and blast wave said to be capable of vaporising human bodies. A CIA study said of the bombs: ""Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness."" The White House Press Secretary said if the ambassador's claims are indeed true, then the act of using them would be a ""war crime"". However, The Guardian was told that the bombs are indeed legal. A senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Dr Marcus Hellyer, said: ""They are not illegal even though their effects can be pretty horrific, because of that effect of creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders."" Evidence that Russia plans to actually use its nuclear weapons is currently non-existent and there are no indications whatsoever that Russia will use them in future. Upon announcing his invasion, Putin said: ""People should know Russia's response will be immediate and lead you to consequences you have never encountered in your history."" Some experts took this to mean that the threat of nuclear weapons is ""on the table"" at least. Fiona Hill is a former presidential adviser and wrote a biography of Putin. Speaking to Politico, she said: ""Basically, what President Putin has said quite explicitly in recent days is that if anybody interferes in Ukraine, they will be met with a response that they’ve ""never had in [their] history."" And he has put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert. ""So he’s making it very clear that nuclear is on the table."" Joachim Krause, academic director of the Institute for Security Policy at Germany's Kiel University, told Fortune: ""It's psychological warfare, but we have to see what's really coming out of this."" Cluster bombs scatter smaller munitions over a wider area. Amnesty International claims these were used in an attack on a pre-school in Okhtyrka, Northeastern Ukraine. It said: ""A 220mm Uragan rocket dropped cluster munitions on the Sonechko nursery and kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka in Sumy Oblast."" Three people were reportedly killed in the attack, including one child, with another child injured. Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International's Secretary-General, said: ""There is no possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school."" Putin claimed that civilian casualties would be avoided when his invasion into Ukraine began, but appears to have used cluster bombs on the city of Kharkiv, according to experts.",17,3.2113521087002623,3.8245188579746268,-0.6131667492743644,29

The statement read: ""We urge Ukrainian citizens who are being used by nationalists to carry out provocations against Russia, as well as Kyiv residents residing near relay stations to leave their home."" Officials claimed the strikes are being carried out to ""prevent information attacks against Russia"". Putin's government is still denying it has invaded Ukraine and continues to claim it is carrying out a special operation. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that in response to a request by the heads of what he calls ""the Donbass republics"" he had made a decision to carry out a special military operation in Ukraine. The Russian leader stressed that Moscow had ""no plans of occupying Ukrainian territories"". Russian Defense Ministry claims that their troops are not targeting Ukrainian cities, but are limited to surgically striking and incapacitating Ukrainian military infrastructure.

Britain's UN Ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward was among those at the UN to accuse the Kremlin of launching ""indiscriminate attacks against men, women and children"" and violating international humanitarian law.

""Missiles have rained down on Kharkiv, with cluster munitions hitting residential areas and injuring residents,"" she added. ""Disruption to supply chains has caused food shortages in Kramatorsk. ""The reckless bombing of an oil depot in Vasylkiv has unleashed toxic fumes in nearby communities. ""Violence in Kyiv has forced people to seek refuge underground, with many thousands, including the elderly and disabled, unable to evacuate."" The UK's permanent UN representative told the Security Council that ""hundreds of civilians had been killed as a result of the Russian invasion"" and seven million people had been displaced, with the figure ""rising exponentially"". Mr Kyslytsya told the council that Kyiv was ""sitting within Russian crosshairs right now"" and that 352 people, including 16 children, had been killed as of Monday in the fighting. He accused Moscow troops of attacking hospitals and ambulances in a determination to ""kill civilians"", adding ""there is no debate. These are war crimes."" But Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian UN permanent representative, said his country's armed forces did ""not have the goal of occupying Ukraine or harming the local population"". The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he plans to open an investigation ""as rapidly as possible"" into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed Mr Kyslytsya's statements in a late-night address on Monday. In a video posted to social media, the leader said that in five days Russian forces had launched 56 missile strikes and 113 cruise missiles in Ukraine. He added: ""Today, Russian forces brutally fired on Kharkiv from jet artillery. It was clearly a war crime. ""Kharkiv is a peaceful city, there are peaceful residential areas, no military facilities. Dozens of eyewitness accounts prove that this is not a single false volley, but deliberate destruction of people. ""The Russians knew where they were shooting."" He added: ""There will definitely be an international tribunal for this crime, it's a violation of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you for killing peaceful Ukrainian people.""

The President, an avid supporter of Vladamir Putin, addressed security officials today while standing in front of a battle map that seems to show a planned operation from southern Ukraine into neighbouring Moldova. The map pointed to the port city of Odessa into Moldova, suggesting Russia plans to march troops into Ukraine's neighbour. Nicu Popescu, Moldova's Deputy Prime Minister, admitted today that his country is in a ""very risky zone"" with the population feeling ""anxiety and fear"". But Mr Popescu added he does not expect to be invaded and instead sees the biggest challenge as handling an influx of refugees. Follow our Russia-Ukraine Live blog here. An estimated 36,400 refugees have fled to Moldova already and more are expected as the conflict rages on. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said last week: ""If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine we are going to see others under threat – the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with Nato.” The map featured behind Mr Lukashenko appeared to detail planned Russian lines of attack which have already materialised. It included forces storming towards Kyiv from the north and towards Kherson from Crimea. The map was split into four sections which align with the command districts of Ukraine's military, showing Russian attacks from Belarus, along Ukraine's eastern border and from occupied Crimea. There are increasing fears that as Russia becomes more isolated under an avalanche of Western sanctions, Vladimir Putin could become even more reckless and set off a world-altering war. Russia on Tuesday stepped up shelling of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, pounding civilian targets there. Casualties mounted and reports emerged that more than 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed after Russian artillery recently hit a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, the capital. But Ukrainian fighters are putting up fierce resistance and Russia has not been able to dominate the skies. Another attack target highlighted on the map appears to be the city of Cherkasy via the city of Sumy. This area is where Russian forces have been held up and a third target appears to show troops breaking off from the Kyiv assault heading towards Zhytomyr. A Ukrainian military official said Belarusian troops joined the war Tuesday in the Chernihiv region in the north, without providing details. But just before that, Lukashenko said his country had no plans to join the fight. In a clip of the meeting posted online, Lukashenko can also be heard talking about missile strikes launched from Belarusian territory at Ukraine in advance of the main Russian assault. ""Missiles in the Mazyr region hit those [Ukrainian] positions, after which we didn't see them again,' Lukashenko tells his top cabinet. ""Once the Russians began their advance, we no longer saw those positions. ""That's why I say that, yes, there were indeed missile launches from Belarusian territory and have shared honestly which targets we attacked.""

Under-siege President Zelensky released a social media video in which he slammed Russia’s murderous aerial assault on the city of Kharkiv. It came on a day dozens of UN diplomats in Geneva spoke for the world by turning their backs on Russian minister Sergei Lavrov and walking out during a video address from Moscow. Mr Zelensky said: “Russian forces brutally fired on Kharkiv from jet artillery. It was clearly a war crime. There will be an international tribunal. “No one in the world will forgive you for killing peaceful Ukrainian people.” Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Claims that Russia is committing war crimes are mounting, with growing international calls for the attacks on Kharkiv to be investigated. The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan said there was “reasonable basis” to believe war crimes had been committed and that he plans to open an investigation “as rapidly as possible”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the scenes “absolutely sickening”. “It has that feel to me of an atrocity committed deliberately against a civilian centre,” he said while visiting British troops in Estonia. He added: “I cannot think of a time in international affairs when the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, has been so obvious.” His Estonian counterpart Kaja Kallas warned: “What we are seeing in Ukraine is really very horrifying – to see what kind of steps they are taking, and now they are escalating this crisis.” Latvian PM Arturs Krisjanis Karins said: “Putin’s army is now starting to target civilians. It may be an act of military desperation but I think by all accounts this amounts to a war crime, this targeting civilians, killing women and children, targeting housing – this is not acceptable by any standard.” The White House confirmed it was studying whether “barbaric tactics” Being reported were war crimes. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey urged Britain to support Mr Khan’s ICC probe, with evidence difficult to gather during a war. He said: “He will need resources and technical experts, which Britain can supply.” Mr Johnson was full of praise for popular Mr Zelenski, who had also urged MEPs in Strasbourg to accept Ukraine into the EU. Wearing a green military T-shirt, the president said his country was fighting to protect European values. He raised his fist as he received a standing ovation after saying in his video address: “Do prove that you are with us, do prove that you will not let us go, and then life will win over death, and light will win over darkness.” The parliament said it would look at the request for EU candidate status. Speaking earlier in Warsaw, Poland, Mr Johnson said: “I marvel at his coolness under fire, his bravery, his invincible good humour. I think he is mobilising the world against the horror of what is happening.” The admiration was in stark contrast to the shunning of Russia’s Mr Lavrov at the United Nations Human Rights Council. As he began his statement, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told delegates it was “full of disinformation” and did not deserve their attention. Accusing the Russian President of having “blood on his hands”, she said: “The consequences of Vladimir Putin’s unjustified aggression are horrific. “Russian troops are laying siege to peaceful cities, tanks are tearing through towns while missiles barrage homes and hospitals, Putin is murdering Ukrainians indiscriminately. There is blood on his hands. “Putin is violating international law and human rights on an industrial scale and the world will not stand for it.There are no shades of grey. This is Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked war against a sovereign nation.”",13,3.464440919174625,2.46736470984818,0.9970762093264449,0

The blast, inflicted by the Russian military, is understood to have struck Chuguev airfield in the Kharkiv region. In multiple clips of the incident shared on social media, a mammoth bright orange blast wave, which hangs in the air, is seen erupting over the night sky. Shocked citizens - filming from apartment blocks - jump backwards as the dome wave pans out.

""The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large."" Thermobaric or vacuum explosives - dubbed the 'father of all bombs' - suck oxygen from the surrounding air to generate high-temperature explosions. They can vaporise a human body and were first developed by the Soviet Union and the US in the 1960s. Russia detonated the largest thermobaric weapon in 2007 which created an explosion equivalent to 39.9 tonnes.

Stricken Ukrainian cities were surrounded as Vladimir Putin ’s tanks and invasion forces tightened their steel noose, barraging civilians and troops with rockets. UK defence chiefs warned of an ever-increasingly more ruthless Russian assault on Ukraine’s civilians as its commanders became desperate to gain ground. In another day of bloodshed, missiles hit Kyiv’s TV tower, killing five people and sending black smoke billowing over the capital’s centre- an attack branded “barbaric” by Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry. Kyiv citizens were ordered to leave or die as Russian forces prepared to launch “precision” strikes against the country’s domestic SBU intelligence agency in the heart of Kyiv. The SBU - Kyiv’s equivalent of MI5- has been successfully hunting down Putin’s covert assassination, sabotage and reconnaissance units. Terrifying missile salvoes again smashed into Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, killing another ten people and wounding 35, adding to an appalling toll. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog And at least five died in a missile strike on the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Centre in Kyiv - where Nazi death squads killed more than 33,000 Jewish people in the space of just two days in 1941. Airing his frustration at the attack President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s tweeted: “What is the point of saying ‘never again’ for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar? At least five killed. History repeating.” But, despite the onslaught, defiant Zelenskiy’s government remained in control of Kyiv last night with its brave combined force of soldiers and civilians ready to fight street by street. Embattled Ukrainian troops held on ferociously to every city throughout the country, helped by Molotov Cocktail-hurling civilians, armed with AK47 assault rifles and bottles of petrol. One breathtaking video emerged of citizens performing a drive-by attack in a car, hurling plastic-filled petrol bombs at a Russian “electronic warfare” truck, screaming blood-curling and celebratory oaths. Another plucky Ukrainian, a farmer, was filmed by laughing locals mocking Putin’s troops as they watched him tow away a Russian armoured personnel carrier - using his tractor. But despite the amazing spirit and bravery of Ukraine, rising numbers of civilian deaths over the last two days were an ominous sign that frustrated Russian commanders are resorting to even more lethal tactics. Russia still has more forces to throw into the fight even though President Vladimir Putin faces worldwide condemnation and international sanctions for his actions. Between 2,000 and 4,0000 killer mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner Group, armed with a 24 man hit-list for assassinations is also moving in on Kyiv. Target number one is Ukraine’s hero leader President Zelensky and two additions earmarked for a grim end are Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko and his fellow boxing champ brother Wladimir. Both sports stars have publicly rallied Ukrainian civilians to join them in fighting for the civilian defence forces. It is believed Ukraine’s cities have been hit with cluster munitions, Multi Launch Rocket Systems and even banned Vacuum bombs. Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said similar strikes killed and wounded dozens in the previous day. He warned: “The rubble is being cleared and there will be even more victims and wounded,” as President Zelenskiy branded the strikes “terrorism.” Philip Reeker, the US Charge d’Affairs to the UK warned “medieval tactics are certainly what we can expect.” “That is exactly what President Putin and the Russian military have in mind.” In another chilling move Belarus joined Putin’s assault as thousands of its troops poured into the northern area of Chernihiv, on day six of the invasion of Ukraine. Pictures released by U.S. satellite company Maxar showed Russian tanks, artillery and fuel trucks stretching for 40 miles to the north. The huge column had travelled 30 miles towards Kyiv in the past day and was believed to bracing to encircle Kyiv - and grind it down, starving its people. President Zelensky warned: “For the enemy, Kyiv is the key target. “We will neutralise them all.” Some residents in the capital of 3 million people are sheltering in underground metro stations at night. There are long lines for fuel and some products are running out in shops, but by day the city is still holding out, with a semblance of ordinary life on the streets. Russian troops fired artillery at Kyiv, Kharkiv and the southern port city of Mariupol overnight while Ukraine side shot down Russian military planes around the capital, Ukrainian authorities also reported 70 soldiers killed in a rocket attack in a town between Kyiv and Kharkiv. The south eastern city of Mariupol was believed to be totally besieged by exhausted Ukrainian forces and citizen warriors who were still holding out. They have come under appalling missile attacks and infantry assaults from Russian marines. In Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the Kremlin would press its attacks until it achieves its goals. Britain’s MoD said in an intelligence update that the Russian advance on Kyiv had made little progress in the past 24 hours due to logistical problems. But it warned of a shift in Russian tactics that could worsen the plight of civilians. It said in a statement: “The use of heavy artillery in densely populated urban areas greatly increases the risk of civilian casualties.” Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst at RUSI think tank in London, said Russia was falling back on tactics that would involve far more intense bombardment of Ukrainian cities. He said: “The Russian army is an artillery army primarily, and it looks like they are shifting into war-fighting mode. “The failure of the Russians to achieve their goals quickly has galvanized Ukraine resistance to them. Really what we are seeing now is the Russian military shifting gears.” Kharkiv, a mainly Russian-speaking city of 1.5 million people near the Russian border, has borne the brunt of attacks since Monday. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian losses included 5,710 personnel, 29 destroyed and damaged aircraft and 198 tanks. Pictures from Ukraine have shown burnt-out Russian tanks and bodies on the road where they have been attacked by Ukrainian defenders. Putin’s forces could try to starve Ukrainians and “crush” their resistance, the country’s ambassador to Britain warned yesterday(TUES). Kyiv’s envoy to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko warned Ukrainians were struggling to access cash as tanks besiege major cities. Asked about the potential for a “food crisis” and looting, he told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee: “They will try to crush the will of the Ukrainian people to resist. “We see problems with cash for example - people just running out of cash and they have interruption in their services. “The terminals won’t be working and we will have to come up with some military solution to the distribution of food.” He admitted Ukraine had to “pump up all the food we can until the routes are blocked”. Mr Prystaiko told MPs of the humanitarian plight facing brave citizens remaining in major cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv rather than flee. “These people have to be fed and so far they have everything - they have communications, they have electricity, they have water,” he said. “But we see that these infrastructure objects (are) starting to be targeted specifically.” Mr Prystaiko said Putin was facing a “lack of progress”, with civilians meeting his tanks with “Molotov cocktails from their cars” rather than the “flowers” he dreamed of. “The support and resilience is going so much against his plans and in Russia themselves start asking questions, ‘What are we doing?’,” the ambassador said. “I believe they might … try to block our cities, try to soften political position, try and maybe ... some riots in Ukraine, because of the lack of food, against the Government.” Asked how Ukrainian forces were coping as they battled invaders, Mr Prystaiko said: “Our armed forces are trying their best. “People are signing up for territorial defence and for reserves.” “We have plus 100,000 people in forces. We have some issues with equipping them and arming them, but this is just logistical, we will cover it.” He also accused Moscow of plundering Ukrainian water to supply Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. “They have already started stealing water from the major rivers,” he said. “They blew up a dam which was covering a canal from a neighbouring area to Crimea.” Despite Kremlin soldiers again assaulting sovereign territory, Ukrainian medics were treating wounded Russian troops, he said. “We have found the softness in our hearts to treat Russians (who are) wounded and we are keeping them and we promised everybody they will be treated in our hospitals along with our own people and then be returned to Russia after war is over,” said Mr Prystaiko.",17,2.479006568275223,3.690878239569826,-1.211871671294603,19
2022-03-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/you-need-know-war-crimes-26361031,All you need to know about war crimes as Russian invasion of Ukraine continues,"Ukraine has accused Russia of committing ""war crime"" after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of the country, destroying buildings and killing innocent civilians. The country's president Volodymyr Zelensky spoke after a missile hit the centre of Kharkiv. He also condemned a rocket attack on the city of Kharkiv on Monday which killed at least nine people. Mr Zelenskiy said: ""This is terror against the city. There was no military target on the square … No one will forgive, no one will forget."" He added: ""This attack on Kharkiv is a war crime. This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation. After that, Russia is a terrorist state … We demand full responsibility for terrorists in international courts."" Here is everything you need to know about war crimes - from the history of the International Criminal Court to its work. The ICC was established in 2002 under the Rome Statute, which was agreed at a conference in the Italian capital in July 1998. It was set up to prosecute individuals and their commanders accused of crimes in cases where nations are unable or unwilling to hold their own trials. Based in The Hague in the Netherlands, its remit extends to war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. Its website currently lists 16 investigations and 46 defendants. The Geneva Conventions set out the rules of war - what is acceptable when states fight each other. Conduct not sanctioned by the Conventions could constitute war crimes. According to the ICC they can involve “serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflict”. The International Committee of the Red Cross says “violations are serious, and are war crimes, if they endanger protected persons (e.g. civilians, prisoners of war, the wounded and sick) or objects (e.g. civilian objects or infrastructure) or if they breach important values”. Bombing obviously civilian targets such as blocks of flats, schools and hospitals are examples. The ICC’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan today said there was ""reasonable basis"" to believe war crimes or crimes against humanity had been committed by Russian forces during the invasion. Instances he could examine include a tank driving over a car - apparently deliberately - on Friday in Kyiv. Another example could include the bombing of a residental apartment block in Kharkiv in which three children were killed. Some of the most infamous war crime prosecutions of recent years stemmed from the civil war unleashed by the breakup in the Balkans. But cases were heard by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia because the ICC did not exist. The hearings, including into Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, demonstrated the need for a permanent court. Radovan Karadžić, a Bosnian-Serb former politician who served as the President of Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War, was convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes by the Tribunal. He was jailed for 40 years. Last May it was announced he was being transferred to a British prison to serve the rest of his sentence.",13,3.6047210827516385,4.920703463843099,-1.3159823810914602,0

Retired soldier Shane Matthews, carrying 60kg of medical supplies which have already been donated to him, said he will hit the frontline to treat wounded Ukrainians and provide training for civilians rising up against Putin's forces. But the veteran, 34, added he is more than ready to bear arms and fight if necessary. He has bravely answered the call to arms from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who made an urgent plea for foreign fighters to help his country over the weekend. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates Matthews, who completed multiple tours of Afghanistan and Iraq, will be flying out to Poland on Monday before crossing the border and meeting a Ukrainian colonel, who has agreed to ""arm him"" and 21 others. The experienced sniper, who served as a Lance Corporal with the 2nd Battalion Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment for six years until 2009, then aims to travel to Kyiv, where Russian rockets have reportedly been causing widespread devastation. He said he took the decision to mobilise after foreign secretary Liz Truss said she would ""absolutely"" support Brits volunteering to fight in defence of Ukraine, saying the battle was crucial to protecting ""freedom and democracy"" in Europe. Mr Matthews, from Chichester, West Sussex, said: "" Russia is trampling on the democratic rights of an entire nation illegally and nobody is trying to stop it. ""What Russia has done is disgusting. It is beyond reprehensible. Russian people don't want to be involved. The Russian military doesn't know why they're there. ""As far as I'm concerned, if you can fight it's your duty to fight. You're looking at modern day Hitler steam-rolling across Ukraine."" Mr Matthews is believed to be among the first Brits to join Ukraine's newly-formed ""International Brigade"" which President Zelenskyy announced on Sunday. He will be flying out alongside two Ukrainians living in the UK and meeting several friends from his regiment who have also joined the war effort. Mr Matthews added: ""My friends were not surprised I wanted to do it, they expected it. My family were not too happy. ""I have several others from my regiment who I'm meeting out there. There's six of us who all did the same tours in Afghanistan. It's going to make the fighting side a lot easier because we all know how each other operates."" His mission has been backed by the veteran community across West Sussex and Hampshire, who have come to his aid in providing military kit and medical supplies. Defence secretary Ben Wallace said he didn't ""want to see British people killed any more than I want to see Ukrainians"" and asked people who were not properly trained or an ""experienced member of an armed forces"" not to join the war in Ukraine.",14,3.8555289984026304,5.048143295355868,-1.1926142969532378,6
2022-03-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/uk-eu-diplomats-walk-out-26360309,UK and EU diplomats walk out during Russian minister's speech at conference,"Dozens of UK and EU diplomats staged a walkout during a Russian Minister’s speech at a Geneva conference, in protest against Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. A pre-recorded video message by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was being played to the UN Human Rights Council at the disarmament conference today when diplomats from countries including Britain, the United States and France stood up and filed out of the room. The recording saw the foreign minister blame Ukraine for the war and claim Kyiv had been seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. However, the crowd thinned out as Lavrobv reasoned that what was going on in Britain required a Russian response. Once out of the room, the diplomats stood in a circle outside the meeting for the duration of the speech, holding a Ukrainian flag. “Today the dangers that (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelenskiy's regime pose for neighbouring countries and international security in general have increased substantially after the authorities set up in Kyiv have embarked upon dangerous games related to plans to acquire their own nuclear weapons,” Lavrov told the conference. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates “Ukraine still has Soviet nuclear technologies and the means of delivery of such weapons. We cannot fail to respond to this real danger,' he said, also calling for Washington to rebase its nuclear weapons from Europe.” Lavrov had been expected to attend the session in person, but the visit was cancelled at the last minute. Moscow blamed “anti-Russian sanctions” imposed by EU countries for the change in plans. Putin’s army invaded Ukraine on Thursday, in what Russia ’s government has called a special operation to demilitarise and “denazify” the country. The justification has been dismissed by Kyiv and the West as propaganda. The walkout on Lavrov’s pre-recorded video message was led by Ukrainian Ambassador Yevheniia Filipenko. Once outside the chamber and gathered around the large Ukrainian flag, Mr Filipenko thanked his followers for their “wonderful show of support” to Ukrainians who were fighting for their independence. French Ambassador Jerome Bonnafont said any invasion constitutes a “violation of human rights”. “It is important that the Human Rights Council shows with this walkout that it is united with Ukraine and with the people of Ukraine,” he said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has enlivened the negotiating forum - the disarmament conference - which has not reached a deal in decades in spite of holding more than 1,600 plenary meetings. It comes as Russia has been accused of violating international humanitarian law through its shelling of Ukraine and use of weapons of mass destruction. Britain’s UN Ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward was among those at the UN to accuse the Kremlin of launching “indiscriminate attacks against men, women and children” and violating international humanitarian law. She said: “As a result of President Putin’s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a country of 44 million people is now on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe. “Missiles have rained down on Kharkiv, with cluster munitions hitting residential areas and injuring residents. Disruption to supply chains has caused food shortages in Kramatorsk. “The reckless bombing of an oil depot in Vasylkiv, has unleashed toxic fumes in nearby communities. “Violence in Kyiv has forced people to seek refuge underground, with many thousands, including the elderly and disabled, unable to evacuate.” The UK permanent representative to the UN told the Security Council that “hundreds of civilians had been killed as a result of the Russian invasion” and seven million people had been displaced, with the figure “rising exponentially”. Ukraine’s representative, Sergiy Kyslytsya, told the council that Kyiv was “sitting within Russian crosshairs right now” and that 352 people, including 16 children, had been killed as of Monday in the fighting. He accused Moscow troops of attacking hospitals and ambulances in a determination to “kill civilians”, adding: “There is no debate. These are war crimes.” But Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian UN permanent representative, said his country’s armed forces did “not have the goal of occupying Ukraine or harming the local population”.",17,3.417754619769134,4.548356168583339,-1.1306015488142052,28

Kyiv's Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said the unit ""which came to kill our President, was eliminated"", during a televised address. It was sent into the fellow former Soviet nation by Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of Russia’s Chechnya region and an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking on Ukraine 24 TV channel, Danilov said: ""We are already aware of the special operation that was to be carried out by Kadyrov forces unit.

According to him, one group came under fire in Hostomel, while another group is currently being held at gunpoint. Danilov added: ""We will not give our President or our country to anyone. This is our land, get out of here."" In the hours after Russia invaded on Thursday morning, Zelensky went into hiding and said he feared for his life and those of his family. He said in a video address from his secret location, he had been marked ""target number one"" by Russian forces on a mission to 'abduct' him and take control of the capital. He claimed that his family's lives are at risk by Russian ""sabotage groups"" who had moved into the capital city. Over the weekend, it was then reported that roughly 400 mercenaries were operating in Kyiv under Kremlin orders to assassinate Zelensky. Armed militia from the Wagner Group were flown into the capital from Africa five weeks ago, it's claimed. The militia was ordered to decapitate Zelensky’s government in return for a handsome financial bonus. The scheme was part of Putin's plan to try and seize Kiev, knockout the government and conquer Ukraine within 48 hours - a plan that has so far failed. The Ukrainian government got wind of the mission on Saturday morning, reports The Times, and mere hours later Kyiv declared a 36-hour 'hard' curfew to sweep the city of saboteurs. Earlier today, Zelensky raised his fist as he branded Russia a ""terrorist state"" following a missile attack in front of a civilian public administration building in Kharkiv. The President said the attack on the city's central square was an ""open, undisguised terror attack"" - saying ""No one will forgive. No one will forget.""

The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday.

2022-03-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/moment-man-stops-russian-tank-26358987,Man 'stops Russian tank with bare hands' as unarmed Ukrainians confront soldiers,"Footage has emerged on social media of unarmed Ukrainian citizens confronting the Russian army - and even stopping their tanks with bare hands. Russia continues to take heavy military losses as its invasion of Ukraine continues into its sixth day today. And now a second country has entered the war - with Ukraine's lawmakers and Latvian ministers confirming that Belarus has sent troops to join the Russian onslaught. The Kremlin today confirmed troops have entered Kherson - a strategically important city beside the Dnieper River. Moscow has warned that troops will continue to pound Kyiv with airstrikes, telling Ukrainians earlier today to prepare for shelling. But elsewhere in the country, it appears Russians are meeting fierce resistance - even from unarmed civilians. In a series of clips shared by the BBC, everyday citizens can be seen challenging armed soldiers and standing in front of tanks trying to enter their hometowns. In one video, a man standing in front of a massive Russian tank tries to stop it with his bare hands. As he does, the tank pulls to a halt before the man slaps the bonnet and walks off. In another clip, a man pulls up beside a a Russian armoured vehicle and asks: ""Are you guys broken down?"". Soldiers respond, saying they've run out of fuel, before he jokes: ""Can I tow you back to Russia?"". Another shows a crowd of civilians cheering and whistling after a military vehicle bound for their town turns around. ""They haven't let the tanks into town, they turned them around"", one man says. In more videos of resistance, a Russian man who says he lives in Ukraine is seen blasting a pair of soldiers. ""You have your country and we have ours"", he says. Meanwhile Putin's war machine rumbles along, with footage from earlier today showing rockets hitting a civilian apartment block. It comes after Putin was accused of breaking international law by using deadly vacuum bombs. The bombs suck in energy from the surrounding area to generate extreme temperatures when it explodes. They are also capable of vaporising human bodies. It comes as Russia's defence ministry warned Ukrainians of looming airstrikes in Kyiv. Russian officials said they are preparing to launch ""high-precision strikes"" against ""technological centres of the Ukrainian Security Service and the 72nd main PsyOps centre in Kyiv"". The statement reads: ""We urge Ukrainian citizens who are being used by nationalists to carry out provocations against Russia, as well as Kyiv residents residing near relay stations to leave their home."" Earlier today Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was filmed raising his fist in solidarity as EU leaders gave him a standing ovation. Zelensky told the European Parliament that Ukraine was 'paying the ultimate price to defend freedom' during the video call. He told the EU lawmakers: “Do prove that you are with us. ""Do prove that you will not let us go. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness. Glory be to Ukraine.”",17,3.466901531080476,3.833122190257256,-0.36622065917678004,19

The devastating blast took place just minutes after the Kremlin warned all Ukrainians to flee the region. It saw reverberations spreading far and wide, with Ukraine's adviser to the interior ministry squarely pointing the finger at Moscow. Footage circulating on social media shows thick plumes of black smoke spilling from the site in the district of Dorogozhychi - while air raid sirens reminded residents to race to bomb shelters. It is unclear if the tower was directly hit. Ukraine's official advisor to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Anton Herashchenko, confirmed the tower's signal had potentially been disrupted. Work will be done to restore any lost signal, according to local media. It comes as Vladimir Putin's devastating invasion showed no signs of slowing, with his government pre-warning those living near the hulking intelligence structure to evacuate. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog The attack happened a few hours after diplomats staged a mass walkout as the United Nation's Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov delivered a speech. According to Russian state-owned TV, the Ministry of Defence is planning further strikes on Ukrainian intel and Military Relay Facilities in Kyiv. Such strikes aim to prevent ""information attacks"" on Russia, says the Kremlin. In a statement issued this afternoon, the Russian defence ministry said it was planning to hit targets in Kyiv. Russian officials said their forces were preparing strikes on the ""technological centres of the Ukrainian Security Service and the 72nd main PsyOps centre in Kyiv"". The statement read: ""We urge Ukrainian citizens who are being used by nationalists to carry out provocations against Russia, as well as Kyiv residents residing near relay stations to leave their home."" Officials claimed the strikes are being carried out to ""prevent information attacks against Russia"". Putin launched a special military operation in his former fellow Soviet nation last week after supposedly responding to a request by the heads of so-called People's Republics in the Donbass border regions. They had been occupied by Moscow-backed separatists days before. He had said some Moscow troops - which numbered nearly 200,000 lying in wait on the Ukrainian border - would move across the border and act as peacemakers. Almost immediately after his TV address in the early hours of last Thursday, air raids began across Ukraine with the invading forces moving in on the capital over the weekend. Devastating air assaults and ground attacks have ensued on opposing military forces and civilians, including children, as the war rumbles into its sixth day. The Russian leader has always stressed that Moscow had ""no plans of occupying Ukrainian territories"". Though this has been contested by western powers who are aiming to heavily sanction Russia and cripple its economy. It is understood Putin had intended to move in and quickly take Kyiv within 48 hours, an alleged plan which if true has spectacularly failed. Russian troops are yet to take a major city or solidify any hold on those areas they have taken amid bloody combat. Both sides have suffered heavy losses.",17,3.40988502496442,2.993629397170602,0.41625562779381786,19

The attack was in Okhtyrka in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region on Monday, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said on Facebook. Video footage shows the devastation at the scene, with piles of rubble, a burnt out building and car. Russia faces increasing isolation over its invasion of Ukraine, with fierce resistance on the ground denying President Vladimir Putin decisive early gains despite heavy shelling and a huge military convoy outside the capital, Kyiv. ""Barbaric rocket attacks and MLRS (multiple launch rocket systems) of peaceful cities are evidence that they are no longer able to fight armed Ukrainians,"" Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Facebook. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Ceasefire talks between Russia and its southern neighbour held on Monday failed to reach a breakthrough and negotiators have not said when a new round would take place. ""What I think is pretty certain is Russia is off their timeline. I think they thought that within 72 hours they'd hold Kyiv,"" US Republican Senator Marco Rubio said after a classified briefing with top Biden administration officials. But fighting on several fronts was taking a toll. More than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency, setting off a refugee crisis as thousands await passage at European border crossings. Public health experts say Ukraine is running low on critical medical supplies and fears of a wider public health crisis are growing as people flee their homes and health services and supplies are interrupted. Washington has ruled out sending troops to fight Russia or enforcing a no-fly zone as requested by Ukraine, fearing an escalation between the world's top two nuclear powers. But, the United States and its allies have instead promised military aid to Kyiv, as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned the capital was under constant threat. A stream of companies pulling out of Russia is expected to grow today. Oil companies Shell, BP and Norway's Equinor have said they would exit positions in Russia, which relies on oil and gas for export earnings.",17,3.1839085290909184,4.107106807755729,-0.9231982786648105,19

Magomed Tushayev, who was a military boss under the command of hardman Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, was killed in fighting at the Hostomel Airport, a key Russian target not far northwest of Kyiv. Tushayev previously led the 141 motorised regiment of the Checnyan National Guard and his death was confirmed by a spokesperson for Ukrainian president Vlodomyr Zelensky. Anti-LGBT+ purges were first reported in the southern Russian republic back in 2017 and reportedly involved kidnappings, torture and extrajudicial killings. Under the leadership of the infamous Kadyrov, who recently said Vlaidimir Putin needed harsher tactics in Ukraine, Tushayev was key in the persecution of LGBT+ people. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates The general was specifically implicated in playing a role in the 2021 kidnapping of activists and gay man Ibragim Selimkhanov, who was kidnapped from a Moscow subway station and bundled into a car and then a plane before he was flown to Grozny, Chechnya’s capital. He later questioned Selimkhanov, who then miraculously escaped back to Moscow. Tushayev's death came only a day after Kadyrov boasted his forces had not suffered a single loss. He said: “As of today, as of this minute, we do not have one single casualty, or wounded, not a single man has even had a runny nose. “The president (Putin) took the right decision and we will carry out his orders under any circumstances.” Chechen authorities always denied that an anti-LGBT+ crackdown occurred in the region. Yet at a Council of Europe meeting last year the suppression of gay people in Chechnya was described as ""the single most egregious example of violence against LGBTI people in Europe that has occurred in decades"". The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday.

This comes as Russia continues its push to try and seize key Ukrainian cities. In an intelligence update released this morning, the Ministry of Defence said that the Russian advance on the Ukrainian capital had made little progress overnight due to continuing logistical difficulties they believed. However, there have been reports of a huge 40 mile long convoy of Russian armour heading for Kyiv which may shift the balance of the fight in Putin’s favour. Throughout the night, Russian forces increased their bombardment of north Kyiv, and in the vicinities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Alongside that, a failure to seize control of airspace of Ukraine has seen Moscow’s forces shift to night time operations in an attempt to reduce their losses. As the invasion enters its sixth day, there have been warnings that Putin may turn to increasingly barbarous tactics to take control of Ukraine.",17,3.618723913705309,5.049911852802429,-1.4311879390971205,14
2022-03-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/putin-set-starve-ukrainians-murderous-26355990,"Putin set to starve Ukrainians in murderous tactics 'like Assad', diplomats warn","Vladimir Putin’s forces could try to starve Ukrainians and “crush” their resistance, the country’s ambassador has warned. Kyiv’s envoy to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, gave a bleak assessment of the six-day-old war launched by the Russian president. He warned Ukrainians were struggling to access cash as Kremlin forces encircled major cities. Asked about the potential for a “food crisis” and looting, the diplomat told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee: “They will try to crush the will of the Ukrainian people to resist. “We see problems with cash for example - people just running out of cash and they have interruption in their services. “The terminals won’t be working and we will have to come up with some military solution to the distribution of food.” It comes as Latvia's Deputy PM warned that Putin could apply tactics similar to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against his own people. In a grim Commons hearing, Mr Prystaiko told MPs that Ukraine had to “pump up all the food we can until the routes are blocked”. Mr Prystaiko described the humanitarian plight facing citizens who bravely opted to remain in major cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv rather than flee. “These people have to be fed and so far they have everything - they have communications, they have electricity, they have water,” he said. “But we see that these infrastructure objects (are) starting to be targeted specifically.” Mr Prystaiko said Putin was facing a ""lack of progress"", with civilians meeting his tanks with ""Molotov cocktails from their cars"" rather than the ""flowers"" he dreamed of. ""The support and resilience is going so much against his plans and in Russia themselves start asking questions, 'What are we doing?',"" the ambassador said. ""I believe they might … try to block our cities, try to soften political position, try and maybe ... some riots in Ukraine, because of the lack of food, against the Government."" Asked how Ukrainian forces were coping as they battled invaders, Mr Prystaiko said: “Our armed forces are trying their best. “People are signing up for territorial defence and for reserves.” “We have plus 100,000 people in forces. We have some issues with equipping them and arming them, but this is just logistical, we will cover it.” He also accused Moscow of plundering Ukrainian water to supply Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. “They have already started stealing water from the major rivers,” he said. “They blew up a dam which was covering a canal from a neighbouring area to Crimea.” Despite Kremlin soldiers again assaulting sovereign territory, Ukrainian medics were treating wounded Russian troops, he said. “We have found the softness in our hearts to treat Russians (who are) wounded and we are keeping them and we promised everybody they will be treated in our hospitals along with our own people and then be returned to Russia after war is over,” said Mr Prystaiko. Dr Artis Pabriks, Latvia's Deputy PM and Defence Minister, confirmed to MPs that Belarusian troops had entered Ukraine. “This basically means we have two aggressives at the moment officially,” he said. He warned that Putin would use any means against the Ukrainian people. “I am very much concerned that Russian troops, following orders from the top, will go into the mode similar to that President [Bashar al-] Assad was using against his population,"" he said. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said it was clear that Putin has ""no boundaries"" to what instruments he will use against Ukraine. ""It is possible that this war will become a massacre,"" he told MPs. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson warned “Putin will continue to tighten the vice” on Ukraine as he travelled out to the region for crisis talks. The Prime Minister arrived in Poland where he warned the Russian war in Ukraine ""is worse than our predictions"", ""we’re seeing an unfolding disaster in our European continent."" Standing beside Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, he said: "" Vladimir Putin is prepared to use barbaric and indiscriminate tactics against innocent civilians. ""To bomb tower blocks, to send missiles into tower blocks, to kill children, as we are seeing in increasing numbers"". But in a speech in Warsaw, he said Vladimir Putin had made a ""colossal mistake"" by invading Ukraine. ""Putin has lied to his people and to his troops about how this conflict would go, and he has now been caught out in that lie,"" he said. ""They have not been welcomed to Ukraine as he prophesised, their tanks have not been cheered in the streets or garlanded with flowers. ""Instead, Ukrainians have mounted an astonishing and tenacious resistance.""",17,4.0494379299558645,5.047095435070739,-0.9976575051148746,4

Experts on the network of military contractors known as the Wagner group, which includes former and active duty soldiers from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Serbia, say they have been on the ground in Ukraine for at least a month. The group is believed to be made up of some 400 mercenaries, who are linked to a string of robberies, murders, rapes and alleged war crimes. It is thought that they now have a hit list of another 23 key figures - including President Zelensky. According to reports from The Times, the soldiers are awaiting a signal from the Kremlin to wipe out Zelensky and his Government. The assassination crew have been promised both hefty bonuses and safe passage out of Ukraine for killings in the next few days. It is widely believed that the group is at the beck and call of Vladimir Putin, although the Kremlin has repeatedly denied this. Click here to follow the Mirror's live blog on the Russia/Ukraine conflict The force is said to be heavily involved in supplying weapons, experienced operations personnel and military training to pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine. The group has previously been deployed by the Kremlin outside of Russia, to carry out black ops operations that Putin wants done while avoiding direct responsibility, And now, the army of soldiers is believed to be active in Ukraine, waiting for the green light to pounce on his hit list of targets. The list is believed to include Ukraine’s prime minister as well as the entire cabinet, mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir - both of whom are boxing champions who have become iconic figures on the front lines of the capital. However, their plans are believed to have been thwarted when Kyiv declared a 36-hour “hard” curfew, ordering everyone indoors to allow soldiers to sweet the streets for Russian saboteurs. Civilians were warned they risked being 'liquidated' if they stepped outside. The Times reports that a source close to The Wagner Group, which is run by one of Putin's closest friends, said between 2,000 and 4,000 mercenaries are operating across the whole Ukraine. The 400 soldiers in the capital were believed to have slid into Kyiv via Belarus. It was hoped that peace talks, set to get underway today, may begin to de-escalate the war although there were also fears Belarus could soon send troops into Ukraine, backing their long-time ally Russia. But it is not known how serious Russia are about the talks or what their demands will be five days after invading Ukraine following weeks of troop build up along the border. After Moscow invaded last week, Zelensky addressed the nation, claiming that Russian special forces were in the capital searching for him as “target No 1”. However when he was offered the chance to flee by America he said: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” Boris Johnson has said Britain will do all it can to get more arms to the beleaguered Ukrainian military as Russian forces continue to threaten Kyiv. The Prime Minister spoke again on Sunday evening to President Zelensky who told him the next 24 hours would be a ""crucial period"" for his country.

Russian forces and pro-Kremlin saboteurs have allegedly been marking buildings with the chilling messages to aid Vladimir Putin ’s troops. It comes as Russia continues its attack on Ukraine, with Putin having ordered part of his nuclear forces to be on enhanced combat duty in an alarming escalation of tensions. Alarming images show apartment buildings in Kyiv with red crosses on their roofs, presumably marking them for airstrikes. According to Sun Online reports, footage shared on Twitter allegedly shows a pro-Russian marking the location on a high-rise residential building, to allow Moscow’s forces to target it for maximum impact. Authorities in Kyiv are urging its citizens to be vigilant for any suspicious symbols or marks. Click here to follow the Mirror's live blog on the Russia/Ukraine conflict ""Residents of high-rise buildings that have access to the roof, please urgently check the roof for signs,"" the Kyiv local Government said on social media. ""Tags on wood can be either painted or covered with reflective tape,"" another warning said. Residents are being urged to smear such signs with dirt, knock them down, or otherwise cover the marks up. Other sinister gadgets believed to be being used by Russian forces included homing transmitters allowing enemy weapons to silently pinpoint specific targets - which Ukrainian authorities say are appearing on significant road intersections. A video shared on social media depicts a mysterious transmitting item with a green flashing light, which was reportedly captured by Ukrainians from the Russians. A caption reads: ""Footage of the device that is used by Russian saboteur units in Ukraine. ""The light-emitting object has been retrieved by Ukrainian forces. ""These are beacons that are used for either airstrikes, artillery strikes or for the landing of Russian troops."" Suspicious activity has been reported by Kyiv residents on social media, with footage of people appearing to place marker pins and UV signs being widely circulated. A Ukrainian news agency has also shared a short video filmed from a high rise, showing a figure appearing to mark a gas pipe on the side of an apartment building. A caption accompanying the video reads: ""Warning! The saboteurs placed many marks around the city. ""In particular, ballistic. And today Kyivans filmed how gas pipes are marked on apartment buildings. ""Be vigilant! As soon as you see this, contact the police immediately!"" Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv’s mayor, has urged residents to remain vigilant for any potential symbols springing up to guide Russian missiles and report suspicious activity they do see. He has also accused Ukrainian collaborators of ""treason"" and threatened to jail anyone who helped Putin’s invaders. Other suspected markers are small reflective tags, which were believed to have a similar effect to an aircraft transponder, in reflecting and amplifying any radar pulse that hits it to stand out among the rubble. Police have urged residents in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv to use backlights or UV lights to help them detect fluorescent paint. These markings were used by Russian agents who had infiltrated the city to direct missile strikes, they said. Warnings about the old school war tactics come as satellite imagery has highlighted a large deployment of Russian ground forces including tanks moving in the direction of Kyiv. The images released by Maxar Technologies Inc showed a deployment comprised of hundreds of military vehicles. The convey was situated northeast of the Ukrainian city of Ivankiv and contained fuel, logistics and armoured vehicles including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery. Russian artillery bombarded residential districts of Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv on Monday, killing possibly dozens of people, Ukrainian officials said. Moscow's invading forces however met stiff resistance from Ukrainians on the fifth day of conflict.

Some of the harrowing images are heartbreaking. Most of them are so horrifically graphic they cannot be published here. But their parents insist the world should see what Vladimir Putin is doing to their families. And it was claimed the Russian army are even using controversial banned cluster bombs - one hit a kindergarten killing two adults and a child. Another exploded in Kharkiv today. Some of the most shocking scenes were filmed with the permission of doctors. A six-year-old girl was killed while she was wearing her pink unicorn pyjamas. The unnamed girl died when a shell hit her parents’ apartment in Mariupol. Despite frantic efforts to save her, she died. During the rescue attempt, a doctor in blue medical scrubs, pumping oxygen into the girl, looked directly into the video camera capturing the scene. He shouts angrily: “Show this to Putin. The eyes of this child, and crying doctors.” A woman, believed to be her mum, is carrying the girl’s slippers, a pompom scarf and bobble hat. Then the girl’s dad, holding his lifeless child’s hand, as the paramedic performs CPR on her tiny body. He is crying while covered in blood. A team of doctors then carry her into the hospital. Seven doctors work on her body, which is still being gripped by her praying father. The final image shows the child alone on a gurney in an empty ward, having been declared dead. She and 15 others have paid the ultimate price. Another 112 have been injured - some with life-changing injuries. The Deputy Mayor of Kyiv shared a photo of an 11-year-old girl named Polina, who was killed while in a car with her family. She was in her last year of primary school and died while trying to escape the capital in a car with her parents. Her younger brother and sister were taken to hospital, where they are in intensive care. The mayor said: “Her name was Polina. She studied in the 4th grade of school in Kyiv. “This morning on Teligi her and her parents were shot by Russian DRG.” Elsewhere, seven-year-old Alisa Hlans was killed in the cluster bomb attack that hit the kindergarten in Okhtyrka. Amnesty International said cluster bombs - which contain multiple lethal explosive submunitions - were being used. Secretary general Agnes Callamard said: “There is no possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school.” She tweeted: “Cluster munitions kill child and two other civilians taking shelter at a preschool in Ukraine. “This attack bears all the hallmarks of Russia use of this banned and inherently indiscriminate weapon, and shows flagrant disregard for civilian life.” Another boy was killed when a block of flats caught fire after being shelled in Chuhuiv, a small town outside Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv. Children including those diagnosed with cancer were moved to the basement of Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital Fighting was fiercest in the eastern city of Kharkiv. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Kyiv’s interior minister said Russian troops had bombarded residential areas with Grad missiles, saying: “Dozens have been killed and hundreds wounded! “The whole world must see this horror! Death to the occupiers!” While fighting continued across the country the expected massive Russian air blitz did not take place. Kyiv was fairly quiet overnight but there is a huge Russian build up of tanks 20 miles to the north. Chernihiv in the north-east faced heavy shelling from Russian troops overnight, but remained in Ukrainian hands. Mariupol residents said the port city on the sea of Azov was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. The Ministry of Defence tweeted an intelligence update on the situation. It said: “The bulk of Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict.

She said: “I don’t have any plans to leave. This is my city, this is my country, and I plan to defend it for as long as will be needed. “There is no chance that some Russian crazy dictator would be able to push me away from where I live and where I love.” Rudik is one of many who have taken up the offer of arming themselves, with military forces looking to bolster key positions. She said: “We received rifles in the Ukrainian parliament and for the last couple of days I was training to use it, so right now I’m pretty confident I would be able to shoot somebody if they come to my home. “I assembled a resistance crew which now consists of 15 people, and we were able to stand up for ourselves and help our army patrol the streets.” Tonight it emerged Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly killed on Snake island are still alive, according to a statement posted on Facebook by Ukraine’s naval services. “We are very happy to learn that our brothers are alive and well,” the statement said.

At least two very loud explosions struck in the Ukrainian capital - and a third is thought to have hit on the horizon - as the relentless Russian attacks continue. TV cameras have been able to pick up the moment one of the blasts hit and filled the night sky with bright out flames. Sirens rang out with the feeling on the ground the violence is growing nearer the heart of the city amid bloody skirmishes in its border areas and throughout the country. BBC reporter Clive Myrie was one of those to have gone back underground. He tweeted: ""Our position shaken by nearby missile fire. Windows shook. Closest blast yet to our base. Fighting coming closer to heart of Kyiv."" Sky presenter Mark Austin is also among the press who were caught up in the explosions and took cover in a basement. Follow the Mirror's live blog on the Russia/Ukraine conflict here He described hearing ""two very heavy explosions"" and then a third on the horizon - which were the heaviest his team had heard yet. Sky security editor Deborah Haynes said the windows rattled during the explosions, with a boom caught on camera. Further damage includes an air strike to the radar communications at a military centre in Kyiv's suburb of Brovary. At least five people are said to have been injured, according to journalist at the scene Terrell Jermaine Starr. However, he said he does not believe there were any fatalities. The capital first began being shelled on Friday in a second round of air strikes green lit by the Kremlin, a day after Vladimir Putin declared war. The cities of Kharkiv and Zhytomir are also under attack this evening. It comes as talks between the two sides came to an end for the day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is quoted as saying by Russian state news agencies. Zelensky was earlier pictured signing a request to join the European Union. Putin is understood to have used illegal cluster bombs to shell civilian areas in eastern Ukraine. He also ordered part of his nuclear forces to be on enhanced combat duty in an alarming escalation of tensions. It was announced this morning that 4,500 Russian soldiers had died and 16 Ukrainian children killed during the invasion so far.",17,4.511787264938613,3.919996679090943,0.5917905858476704,16

Horrific images, which the Mirror has chosen not to show, emerged from the bloody attack showing the dead and wounded as Russian Grad missiles rained down on apartment blocks. A woman reportedly had her legs torn off in an attack that saw dozens die as Putin's troops are thought to be using unguided Grad rockets or banned cluster bombs to indiscriminately fire on residential areas.

At least 14 children have been amongst the dead in Ukraine, meanwhile Russia has reported heavy casualties amongst its invading army. As the scale of the attack was confirmed, delegations from Ukraine and Russia sit down today to discuss a possible peaceful solution to the ongoing invasion. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that the goal of these talks for his country was an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. The brutal bombardment came shortly after Russian troops were pushed back out of the city, ending street-to-street fighting between the opposing armies. Last night, thousands in Kharkiv hid in basements and shelters as the city was relentlessly shelled. Today, the Ministry of Defence tweeted out its latest intelligence update on the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. It said that the main body of Putin's ground forces are still more than 30km outside of Kyiv. Their advance has been slowed by Ukrainian resistance defending the Hostomel airfield, which they said was a key objective Russia had hoped to take on the first day of the conflict - last Thursday. Heavy fighting continues around Chernihiv and Kharkiv without any falling into Russian control and a mixture of “logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance.""

The 13 troops on the tiny Black Sea island, 186 miles west of Crimea, were thought to have been among the first victims of Putin’s invasion amid rumours they were killed in Russian air and sea bombardment. Rumours they had survived spread over the weekend and now the Ukrainian Navy has confirmed they are alive, albeit captured by enemy soldiers. In a clip which went viral, the border guards had responded to a Russian warship warning they would be bombed by saying: “Russian warship... go f*** yourself.” In a Facebook post the Navy wrote: “Regarding the Marines and border guards on the island of Snake…we are very happy to learn that our brothers are alive and well.

The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv.

Shortly after the attack Russian media reported they were taken as prisoners from their base on Snake Island in the Black Sea to Sevastopol, a Crimean port city. On Friday, Russia's defence ministry said Ukrainian soldiers on the island had surrendered to them voluntarily. It made no mention of carrying out strikes or inflicting casualties. Russian Major-General Igor Konashenkov stated how the servicemen on the island “laid down their arms and voluntarily surrendered to a unit of the Russian Armed Forces”.

2022-02-28,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-evidence-ghost-kyiv-real-26348518,Evidence for ace Ukrainian fighter pilot 'Ghost of Kyiv' remains questionable,"While the war in Ukraine continues to rage on, stunning reports of acts of courage and bravery by Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have emerged. However in times of war, some information can be easily twisted or misused, and one of these stories involves the so-called 'Ghost of Kyiv'. When the war broke out, the general expectation among many experts in the West was that the Ukrainian armed services would have difficulty holding out against the might of the Russian advance. As a result of this, false reports can spread quickly as hopeful people search for some good news. Even with some false reports out there, the Russians have indeed so far failed to gain much of a foothold in Ukraine since they invaded and have not yet gained air superiority. So why is this the case and does it have anything to do with the fabled Ghost of Kyiv? The Ghost of Kyiv is an unconfirmed fighter pilot who has supposedly downed a number of Russian jets, according to social media and the Ukrainian government. The Ghost is estimated to have shot down up to ten Russian jets from his MiG-29 fighter jet, but the social media claims are yet to be independently verified. If the rumours are true, it would make them likely the first pilot to achieve this in the 21st century. The reports of the Ghost of Kyiv are unconfirmed and unlikely to be true, but that hasn't stopped even Ukrainian officials from jumping on the rumours. In a tweet, the Defence of Ukraine said: ""People call him the Ghost of Kyiv. And rightly so – this UAF ace dominates the skies over our capital and country, and has already become a nightmare for invading Russian aircraft."" It is understandable that Ukraine would want to promote the idea, both to attract Ukrainian civilians to join the fight against Russia and to boost morale. Reports emerged of the incredible feat on social media, claiming that the Ghost had shot down six Russian planes in the first 30 hours of the invasion. A video released on Ukraine's official Twitter said: ""In the first 30 hours of the Russian invasion in February 2022 he shot down six Russian military aircraft. As of February 26 – 10 military planes of the occupiers. ""To become an ace pilot, you need to shoot down five planes. And the Ghost of Kyiv shot twice as many. ""And although it is still unknown who is piloting the Ukrainian MiG-29 plane and whether he is responsible for the 10 downed Russian planes, Ukrainians are grateful to this hero with brass balls, who’s having Russian aircraft for breakfast."" Some of the footage that was claimed to be the Ghost on social media was actually revealed to be footage from a 2008 video game called Digital Combat Simulator. This was viewed over five million times. Reuters Fact Check said: ""A vertical video shared online does not show a Ukrainian fighter jet shooting down a Russian plane, but comes from the videogame DCS.""",14,4.138495638271165,3.3569054384769657,0.781590199794199,8

This comes as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues but the cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv have survived another night of fighting. According to British and Ukrainian defence sources, Russian President Vladimir Putin had hoped to conquer Ukraine, its capital and major cities in just 48 hours. The invasion, which began nearly 100 hours ago, is still being fiercely resisted by Ukrainian soldiers who have been engaged in fighting around the two largest cities. Despite frequent shelling and missile attacks, the capital remains free from Russian control. On top of that, the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk is now reportedly back under Ukrainian control. Donetsk is situated in the easternmost region of the country, and has been deep in Russian-backed separatist territories since 2014. The city was reportedly on the brink of a humanitarian crisis. Even as the fighting is ongoing, peace talks commenced yesterday between Ukraine and Belarus. After an initial meeting yesterday, talks are set to continue this afternoon. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, once the voice of Paddington Bear, said on Sunday that he needed to use every opportunity to secure peace, as Ukraine was due to meet with Russia for peace talks. He said: ""I do not really believe in the outcome of this meeting, but let them try so that later not a single citizen of Ukraine has any doubt that I, as President, tried to stop the war, when there was even a small, but still a chance."" However, even as talks about peace are ongoing, Belarus is set to hold a referendum about whether the country should hold nuclear weapons or not. On top of that, there are reports the country may send troops into Ukraine to help the struggling invasion, the Kyiv Independent reported.

The Times reports that a source close to The Wagner Group, which is run by one of Putin's closest friends, said between 2,000 and 4,000 mercenaries are operating across the whole Ukraine with the 400 in the capital having slid into Kyiv via Belarus. It is hoped that peace talks, set to get underway today, may begin to de-escalate the war although there are also fears Belarus could soon send troops into Ukraine, backing their long-time ally Russia. But it is not known how serious Russia are about the talks or what their demands will be five days after invading Ukraine following weeks of troop build up along the border. The Wagner Group mercenaries are in contact with the Kremlin are awaiting a signal before unleashing bloodshed on the streets, The Times says, with a hitlist that contains Zelensky and 23 other figures including the prime minister, the cabinet, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir, both popular former boxing champions. After Moscow invaded last week, Zelensky addressed the nation, claiming that Russian special forces were in the capital searching for him as “target No 1”. However when he was offered the chance to flee by America he said: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” Boris Johnson has said Britain will do all it can to get more arms to the beleaguered Ukrainian military as Russian forces continue to threaten Kyiv. The Prime Minister spoke again on Sunday evening to President Zelensky who told him the next 24 hours would a ""crucial period"" for his country.

According to British and Ukrainian defence sources, Putin believed he could capture the capital city of Kyiv and four other major cities within 48 hours of launching the invasion. He was confident that President Volodymyr Zelensky would surrender and sign Ukraine over quickly, The Times reports. Unfortunately for Putin, Russian troops have faced fierce resistance from Ukrainian troops and citizens.

Follow all the updates on our live blog He added that the Ukrainian people and military, with support from their allies across the world, had ""no fear"". Ukrainian forces have so far surpassed expectations by preventing Russia from gaining control of their airspace. They also blew up tanks, armoured vehicles, and brought down cruise missiles sent from Russia with a comparatively tiny army. Ukraine only has 196,600 troops against Russia's 900,000 but have so far slowed the invading forces. Russia has suffered heavy casualties as the invasion enters its fourth day, with The Economist reporting on Friday that the Russian army has had more casualties in 24 hours than in eight years fighting in Syria. The Kremlin is yet to acknowledge any widespread casualties or issues with the invasion. Some reports have also claimed that Russian soldiers are now refusing to fight. Taras Kuzio, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, said today: ""Ukrainian News Channel 24: 5,000 Russian soldiers in staging area in Russia, North of Kharkiv, have revolted and are refusing to attack Ukraine."" Kuzio also claimed that reports from the front lines near Crimea showed ""1/2 of Russian soldiers have turned over their equipment to the Ukrainians, again refusing to fight."" There seems to widespread anger against Putin in Russia over the invasion, with many Russians protesting in Moscow while some government employees have resigned as a result. These reports were followed Russian soldiers yesterday (February 27) advanced into the city centre of Kharkiv but were pushed back by local forces and later captured. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv Oblast, said that the soldiers had been taken into custody by the Ukrainian army. He said: ""The Russian soldiers, who were taken captive, talk about total extortion and demoralisation, they have nothing to do with the central command, do not understand and do not know their further actions. ""Since the beginning of the attack on Ukraine they do not receive food and water, the technology has no fuel supplies."" Around 22,000 Ukrainian troops have been trained by the British Army since 2015, which could explain their ability to hold their own against Russia – especially if Russian troops are ""very green"". Kevin Price, a former major who served 20 years with the British military, told The Times that the soldiers advancing were inexperienced in comparison to Ukrainian forces who have massively improved in recent years. He added that the current military strategy does not make much sense, asking: ""Is Putin just throwing in a whole bunch of youngsters to the fight to get the sense of what Ukrainian forces are like, and holding back the more battle-ready troops?""",14,2.2801419494685047,2.646425740324623,-0.3662837908561185,19

He added that the current military strategy does not make much sense, asking: ""Is Putin just throwing in a whole bunch of youngsters to the fight to get the sense of what Ukrainian forces are like, and holding back the more battle-ready troops?"".",14,1.566219960139263,4.763077873887241,-3.196857913747978,15

Suheil al-Hammoud gained notoriety during the Syrian Civil War when he used American anti-tank missiles to wipe out Assad's tanks. The Free Syrian Army rebel has now tweeted his support for the Ukrainian resistors and asked how he could get involved, as the Daily Star reports. On Saturday, February 26, he said: ""How can I go to Ukraine and fight alongside the Ukrainian army. Is there a way? I'm ready."" The militant would undoubtedly help matters on the ground because as combat CVs go, his is particularly impressive.

War-torn Ukraine is establishing an ""international"" legion for volunteers from across the world – including Brits – who wish to take on ""full Tonto"" Vladimir Putin themselves. In a statement delivered from Kyiv after three days of fighting, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on people across the world to volunteer to defend Ukrainian sovereignty against Russian invaders. ""This will be the key evidence of your support for our country,"" he said in a statement released on the morning of Sunday, February 27. However, there have long been concerns that British soldiers, or in fact soldiers from any NATO country, coming into direct conflict with Russian forces could spark World War Three. It is doubtful leaders in the west will encourage anyone to volunteer to go and fight in Ukraine, for fear of Russia's response. Do you have a story to sell?

It comes after a huge explosion at a gas pipeline on the edge of the city. Russian troops approached the city, about 12 miles south of the border from Russia, shortly after the invasion was ordered by Vladimir Putin on Thursday morning. Until today the heavily armed soldiers had remained on the outskirts of Kharkiv without trying to enter it. Now Oleh Sinehubov, head of the city's regional administration, has warned civilians to stay inside and not to leave their homes as their troops are fighting Russians on the streets.

President Volodymyr Zelensky's office said enemy forces had blown up a gas pipeline near Kharkiv, prompting advice for people to protect themselves from smoke by covering windows with a damp cloth or gauze. An apartment building is also thought to have been damaged by a missile strike. Earlier unsubstantiated claims by the Russian Defence Ministry claimed the 302nd anti-aircraft missile regiment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Kharkiv region had laid down its arms. According to military sources, 471 people had been detained, although it was not confirmed.

Flames billowed into the sky before dawn from an oil depot near an air base in Vasylkiv, where there has been intense fighting, according to the town's mayor. More than 150,000 Ukrainians have fled for Poland, Moldova and other neighbouring countries, and the United Nations warned the number could grow to four million if fighting escalates.

Russian forces are suspected to be targeting infrastructure sites near key cities as they continue their brutal and bloody invasion. Yesterday evening the cloud was seen near Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, which is to the east of capital Kyiv. Cities such as Kharkiv and Kyiv are expected to come under intense pressure from Kremlin troops overnight. In the capital citizens have been armed with AK-47s and urged to create Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs) so they can repel the invaders. For all the updates on the war follow our dedicated liveblog The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has refused an offer from Western allies to flee Kyiv and has pledged to fight alongside his countrymen against Russian forces. The UK Ministry of Defence has said that Russian forces ""are not making the progress they had planned"". ""They are suffering from logistical challenges and strong Ukrainian resistance,"" a short statement released on Twitter reads. There are also reports this evening that an oil depot in Vasylkiv, a city in the Kyiv region, has been hit by a Russian rocket. Local media reported both the city's mayor Nataliia Balasynovych, as well as Ukraine government adviser Anton Geraschenko, have confirmed the hit. Footage on social media shows huge flames billowing from the terminal. People living nearby have been told to close their doors and windows to keep out the acrid and possibly dangerous smoke. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the Russian advance had been temporarily halted – and denied Moscow’s claim that it had captured the south-eastern city of Melitopol. President Zelensky, meanwhile, also staged a dawn address to tell EU leaders: “This might be the last time you see me alive.” He added: “The occupiers wanted to block the centre of our state... we broke their plan. “We will fight as long as it takes to liberate the country.”",17,3.134779962267996,2.683664590368087,0.4511153718999088,19

It was thought the troops on the tiny Black Sea island had been killed by Russian shelling, with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky saying they'd all posthumously be recognised as heroes. But now it has emerged that they may have survived. In a clip which quickly went viral, a Russian voice warns the border guards that they will be attacked if they do not give up. “I am a Russian warship,” a voice says. “I ask you to lay down your arms and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary deaths. Otherwise, you will be bombed.” The Ukrainians responded: ""Russian warship... go f*** yourself."" For all the updates on the war follow our dedicated liveblog The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said in a statement posted to their Facebook page the guards may be alive. Shortly after the attack Russian media reported they were taken as prisoners from their base on Snake Island in the Black Sea to Sevastopol, a Crimean port city. Ukrainian officials said in the Facebook post the border guards were attacked by Russian aircraft and weapons from the ship, and that they then lost communication with them. It now appears it was assumed that the guards were killed. On Friday, Russia's defense ministry said 82 Ukrainian soldiers on the island had surrendered to them voluntarily. It made no mention of carrying out strikes or inflicting casualties. Russian Major-General Igor Konashenkov stated how the servicemen on the island 'laid down their arms and voluntarily surrendered to a unit of the Russian Armed Forces.' Overnight in Ukraine night has seen major blasts at oil and gas facilities in Kyiv region and other locations, and a claim of a Russian strike on a radioactive dump in the capital. There were reportedly strikes on an oil terminal in the Luhansk People’s Republic at Rovenky, a coal mining city. An LPR source said: “It could have possibly been a missile attack, our emergency services have left to the site.” The source of the alleged attack in the LPR was unclear. In Kyiv, Ukrainian sources claimed a Russian shell strike hit radioactive dump. “The occupiers fired on a radioactive object in Kyiv,” said a report. “They hit the radioactive burial site… “Although the radiation monitoring system failed, surveillance cameras recorded the shelling.” A preliminary assessment indicated “no threat to people outside the sanitary protection zone”. Russian defence sources claimed they had agreed with Ukrainian forces a pact to guarantee safety at Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

It comes as Russian troops have so far failed to capture the capital of Kyiv. Overnight, Russian troops and tanks entered Kharki v triggering a fight on the streets for Ukraine's second city. The military also blew up a natural gas pipeline close to the northeastern city overnight, prompting warnings of an ""environmental catastrophe"" by Ukrainian authorities, before their forces breached its perimeters. Follow the latest updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine in our live blog However, Putin's progress seems to be slower than he anticipated as he thought it would all be over in less than five days, according to a member of the European Union Parliament who said he was citing Ukrainian intelligence reports. Riho Terras, who is also the former defence chief of NATO member Estonia, tweeted: ""Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days. “The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered."" He also claimed the reports shows that the Russian military doesn't have a ""tactical plan"" to take Ukraine. Mr Terras added that Putin's invasion plan relied on “sowing panic among civilians and armed forces and forcing [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky to flee"". Mr Terras also shared an image of what appears to be an intelligence report that is in Russian and wrote: ""Putin is raging. He was sure it would be a cakewalk.” US Defense officials yesterday said Russian forces are growing increasingly frustrated at the Ukrainian resistance. Images show civilians taking up arms to fight alongside Ukrainian forces, making Molotov cocktails and blocking roads. Mr Terras, citing the intelligence report, said the Russian military has enough rockets only for three or four days. He said the intel report said that ""there are not enough weapons"" as fresh sanctions imposed on Russia are hoped to cripple the country's economy and force Putin to withdraw his troops. Mr Terras said the war was costing £14.9billion a day and added: ""If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. “Because they have no money, weapons, or resources.” He also added that Putin is currently in his ""lair in the Urals"" and has brought Russian oligarchs with him so they couldn’t flee the country. It comes as Putin today praised his special forces for “heroically carrying out their military duties” in his Ukrainian invasion. Zelensky has since stood firm in his position to not back down as he refused to enter negotiations with the Russian government. This morning he said the Kremlin said a delegation has arrived in Homel, Belarus for talks with their Ukrainian counterparts. Zelensky said: ""If there had been no aggressive action from your territory, we could talk in Minsk... other cities can be used as the venue for talks. ""Of course we want peace, we want to meet, we want the war to end. Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku - we've offered them to the Russians.

The sheer force of Vladimir Putin ’s troops was expected to have crushed Ukraine by now. But they had not counted on the bravery of the Ukraine people. Their David vs Goliath battle has stunned the world. In one amazing scene, Ukraine civilians walked en masse towards Russian tanks, forcing them to stop. The powerful images from Koryukivka have been viewed millions of times on social media. An estimated 4,300 Russian troops have been killed in action. A Chechen unit sent to assassinate President Zelensky of Ukraine was wiped out. And Ukraine may soon be bolstered by foreigners flocking to answer the country’s president’s call to arms. Astonishingly, in its second city of Kharkiv, Ukraine appears to have successfully repelled an attack after fierce clashes. Regional governor Oleh Synehubov said the city was now clear of Russian troops after street-to-street fighting. Thousands of people spent the night in basements and shelters, with the intense shelling described by one resident as “something like Star Wars above your head”. He added: “The wave of the blast was so strong that my ears popped.” But there were fears last night that Russia ’s ally Belarus would soon enter the war. Their special forces are believed to be preparing to assault Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Ukrainian intelligence has learned from within Belarus that “special ops” troops have been spotted loading up planes for a major attack. A senior Ukrainian source told the Daily Mirror: “If this happens, it will mean Belarus has openly joined Russia in its invasion of sovereign Ukraine. We believe they are being targeted at Kyiv and Zhytomyr.” For weeks during the Russian build-up, large numbers of Russia’s elite Spetsnaz troops were on so-called “exercises” with Belarus counterparts. Belarus has already allowed missiles aimed at Ukraine from within its borders. Ukraine’s interior minister last night said that missiles launched from Belarus have hit an airport in the city of Zhytomyr. It came as Ukrainian sources said Russia’s losses were mounting. Yesterday President Volodymyr Zelensky put the Mirror’s powerful front page from Saturday on his official Instagram page. Ukraine’s President has become a worldwide hero. He put out a stirring call inviting volunteers to come and fight “side-by-side” with Ukrainians. The social media post read: “The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is addressing all citizens of the world, friends of Ukraine, peace and democracy. Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come.” UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she backed the idea of Brits heading to Ukraine to fight against the Russian invasion. She said: “The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe. “Absolutely, if people want to support that struggle I would support them in doing that.” Kyiv and Moscow last night confirmed they would hold peace talks at the Ukraine/Belarus border, a deal brokered in a phone call by Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus.

The Ukrainian President’s office said the two delegations would meet “without preconditions” near the Pripyat River, to the north of Chernobyl – though it said Mr Zelensky held little hope of serious progress. It added: “Alexander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, talks and return.” Earlier President Zelensky had rejected the Russian offer of talks in Belarus, pointing out it had helped in the invasion. His resistance to Russian aggression has bolstered his popularity. Top Ukrainian journalist Kristina Berdynskykh tweeted: “I have a lot of complaints against Zelensky over his domestic politics. But the way he behaves during the offensive of absolute evil against Ukraine is real political leadership and tremendous courage.” Both the US government and Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered to transport Zelensky out of Ukraine, to prevent his capture by Russians. He declined both offers. Charity Save The Children said attacks on schools in Ukraine were endangering the lives and futures of the country’s 7.5 million children. There were reports up to 10 children have been killed in the fighting and as educational facilities were damaged by widespread bombing across the country. Artem Vorobyov, the Ukrainian consul in Barcelona, said: “We are facing World War Three” and called on Western allies to do more to help his country. As well as the thousands of its soldiers killed, Russia is reported to have lost 27 warplanes, 26 helicopters, 146 tanks, 49 artillery and 30 vehicles. It is also said to have lost a Buk missile system, four multi-launch rocket systems and two ships. Ukraine’s health ministry said yesterday 352 civilians, including 14 children, had been killed.

One woman said: “Oh God, he’s climbing on top of the tank. “They’re begging them to stop. He threw himself in front of the wheels.” Kyiv’s defence ministry has put Russia ’s losses at around 80 tanks, 516 armoured vehicles, 10 airplanes and seven helicopters. Adviser Oleksiy Arestovych claimed around 3,500 Russian soldiers had been killed or injured. He said: “We are striking the enemy around Kyiv. The enemy is not moving for now.” Estonia’s former defence chief Riho Terras said: “The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance. “Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance.” On the Russian side, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, an ally of Putin, deployed a number of his fighters to Ukraine. But Russian commanders are said to be frustrated by the slow progress – even complaining they were running out of fuel. Tanks and military vehicles were seen stranded in remote areas while locals taunted Russian troops. Meanwhile, Germany approved the delivery of 400 rocket-propelled grenades, 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. As protests against the invasion took place across the globe, the Ukrainian people vowed not to roll over. Software engineer Oleh Zimokha, 29, said a bomb shelter in Kharkiv, more than 500 miles from the capital: “Putin will never win. “It is impossible for him to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people.” Across Ukraine almost 20,000 ordinary people now have been given guns in the fight.

But western officials believe the Russian advance has not gone as quickly as Vladimir Putin hoped, with their intelligence suggesting he thought he would have control of Kyiv in 48 hours. It has prompted fresh fears among Western officials that the Russian leader will utilise deadly thermobaric missiles, which have allegedly already crossed the border into Ukraine. The deadly missiles which use a fatal mix of chemicals to launch a supersonic blast would 'rupture lungs' of any human nearby and decimate buildings to rubble.

The Russians are said to be shocked by the resistance being put up by brave Ukrainians who are taking up guns to fight back against the invaders. And intelligence sources say poor tactical planning by the Russians has resulted in the invasion taking much longer than they expected. The Russian army has now been ordered to broaden its advance ‘from all directions’. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates Estonia’s former defence chief Riho Terras has claimed that Putin’s war is not going to plan because Russia is running out of money and weapons. Mr Terras added that he believes Putin will have to enter negotiations with Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s government, if his soldier's fail to take the capital Kyiv soon. The MEP tweeted: ""The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered. ""The Ukrainians must avoid panic! . "" Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance."" Citing Ukrainian intelligence sources, Mr Terras claimed that the war is costing Russia around £15billion-per-day, and that they have rockets for three to four days at most. He added they are using the rockets they have sparingly. He added that the plan had been to simply scare the residents of Ukraine, firing missiles at random at residential buildings to intimidate people. Mr Terras adds that Putin was relying on President Zelensky fleeing his country. Meanwhile, Britain has pledged to continue to supply arms to Ukraine's embattled military as the fighting with Russian forces reached the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv. Armed forces minister James Heappey said Russians troops had not made the progress they might have hoped, with the main armoured columns still some way from the city. He warned that the defenders faced ""days, weeks, months more"" of heavy fighting as Russian President Vladimir Putin strives to topple the Ukrainian government and impose his writ on the country. ""This is going to be a long slog. It is going to be brutal. We are going to see some horrendous things on our TV screens.""",14,2.6376534580721547,3.5102883391600477,-0.872634881087893,19
2022-02-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-troops-closing-kyiv-uk-26325922,Russian troops close on Kyiv but UK says invasion 'failing' with 450 casualties,"Russian troops have nearly reached the Ukraine capital city, with fighting raging outside of the city. But the UK Defence Secretary says the invasion failed to achieve its targets on the first day and that the attacking forces had lost 450 men. Kremlin soldiers are closing in on Kyiv on only day two of the Russian invasion. In the early hours of this morning, the capital city was pummelled by missile strikes that left plumes of smoke rising above the city, and residential blocks and homes in ruin. Air raid sirens sounded as many residents fled to underground bomb shelters for the night as missiles struck the city around 4am local time. And now, as fighting has reached the outskirts of the city, it will increase worries that the capital of 2.8million people, known as the ‘mother of Russian cities’ will fall into Moscow’s hands. However, despite Russia's advances, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he thought the invasion was failing to achieve its aims. Speaking to Sky News, he said: ""Our assessment as of this morning is that Russia has not taken any of its major objectives, in fact it is behind its hopeful timetable. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates “They’ve lost over 450 personnel and… one of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite Spetsnaz has failed to be taken, and in fact the Ukrainians have taken it back.” The UK was not alone in that assessment, the Ukraine defence ministry echoed Wallace’s claims. Outside the northern city of Chernihiv, Ukrainian troops halted the Russian march, and fighting continues outside the city according to the country’s Ministry of Defence. The country’ Ministry of Defence said that it thought Russia had failed to achieve its day one objectives and had been met with “fierce resistance” across all fronts. Speaking about the nighttime barrages, Ukrainian interior ministry advisor Anton Gerashchenko said: “Air defence of Kyiv shot down missiles fired by the invaders. We stand.” He also claimed a Russian warplane was shot down by Ukrainian air defence forces and fell in the Darnytskyi district near a residential house. The deputy head of Ukraine ’s defence ministry said there had been six major explosions. The secretary of state also added that it was believed Russia intended to take the entire country, but there have been some questions raised how it intends to maintain this control. He added: “I certainly think what Putin is doing is deeply irrational. I certainly think he has gone full tonto, that’s what I said the other day talking to some soldiers. “But that’s no comfort to the people of Kyiv.” Speaking to BBC Breakfast later on, he confirmed that no British troops would be sent in to fight. He said: “No. We are not going to be sending British troops to fight directly with Russian troops. “We’re going to hold the line in NATO. We’ve always supported Ukraine’s application to NATO over the last 15 years, not every country has wanted them to join. “That would trigger a European war, because we are a NATO country.” In the Black Sea, there were claims that 13 border guards had been killed in a Russian missile strike on strategic Snake Island, near the mouth of the Danube, after refusing to surrender to Putin’s forces. An audio message was released of the warning: “I am a Russian combat ship. Lay down the arms, and give up - or else you will be bombed. “I repeat: I am a Russian combat ship, give up your arms and surrender, or else you’ll be bombed.” The defiant reply from the Ukrainian border guards said: “F*** off Russian combat ship.” Seconds later the border guard base on the island was hit by a blitzkrieg, according to Ukrainian interior ministry advisor Anton Gerashenko. He said: “I heard two explosions. It was either cruise or ballistic missiles…. “Then the missile and artillery strike began. 13 Ukrainian border guards died. “Perhaps the brave hero who told them to F off just like Zaporozhian Cossacks said to enemies of Ukraine in the past also died. “Eternal glory to the Heroes! Shame and death to the Russian occupiers!”",17,2.808463170750072,2.8274657732136586,-0.019002602463586538,19
2022-02-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/disguised-russian-special-forces-killed-26327804,Moment Ukrainian troops lie in wait for Russian invasion only 5 miles from Kyiv,"Brave Ukrainian troops are positioned on the streets of capital Kyiv ready to block Russian invaders. A striking image shows soldiers preparing for battle as the government calls on civilians to help drive Vladimir Putin's forces out of the country. Earlier today attackers who seized two Ukrainian army trucks and dressed in enemy uniforms to launch an assault on the city were killed, officials announced. Civilians have been urged to target invaders using petrol bombs, with Ukrainian men aged between 18 and 60 barred from leaving the country and told to take up arms. This morning Ukrainian deputy defence minister Anna Maliar said enemy troops had driven two Ukrainian army trucks into Kyiv, followed by a convoy of military trucks. In a Facebook post she said the Russians were “moving at speed"" to the centre of Kiev, adding: “They will surely be destroyed.” Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates Less than an hour later she said that the convoy had been stopped. Fierce fighting is now taking place on the streets of Kyiv. Footage was posted on Twitter by journalist Alexander Khrebet purportedly showing a dead Russian troop in a Ukrainian uniform. Mr Khrebet wrote: ""Russian troops dressed up like Ukrainian military uniforms eliminated in Obolon district, Kyiv."" It is the latest in a string of claims that Russian forces have been donning the uniforms of peacekeeping and Ukrainian forces. The National Police yesterday claimed that Putin's troops had used the insignia of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as they bore down on cities across Ukraine. A statement said: “Columns of Russian tanks entered the Luhansk region at the borders of Krasnaya Talovka, Milove, and Gorodishche. The enemy insidiously placed white vehicles with OSCE symbols at the front. Fighting is currently underway there."" Meanwhile Mayor Ruslan Serpeninov, of Sarny, Rivne, told residents that Russian sabotage and reconnaissance units were wearing Ukrainian police and military uniforms after crossing from Belarus, the Daily Beast reports. The government called on civilians to report any movement of enemy equipment and to fight back against Vladimir Putin's forces. It also warned ""peaceful"" citizens not to leave their homes as cities endure heavy shelling from Russian forces. An official government Twitter account this morning said: ""We ask citizens to inform about the movement of equipment! ""Make Molotov cocktails, neutralise the occupier! Peaceful residents - be careful! Do not leave the house!"" Last night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 137 civilians and military personnel had been killed on the first day of the Russian attack. Mr Zelensky described those who died as ""heroes"" in a video address in the early hours of the morning. He added that 316 people had been wounded, although the true number is likely to be far higher. Describing the invaders, the Ukrainian president said: “They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven."" Mr Zelensky said the Russian military's claim it is not targeting civilian areas is ""a lie"". Attacks have continued through the night with homes wiped out by Russian missiles. Vitaly Klitschko, mayor of capital city Kyiv, said at least three people were injured when a rocket hit a multi-storey apartment building in Ukraine's capital on Friday, starting a fire. The Mirror's chief reporter Andy Lines, who is in the Ukrainian capital, said this morning: ""I had to be evacuated twice to an underground car park after air raid sirens sounded. ""I watched several Ukrainian armoured personnel carriers race through one of the city’s main thoroughfares which was deserted. ""Thousands continue to flee west to escape the incoming Russian forces."" Higher than usual gamma radiation levels have been detected in the area near the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, after it was seized by the Russian military, according to Ukraine's nuclear energy regulatory agency. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate said on Friday that higher gamma radiation levels have been detected in the Chernobyl zone, but did not provide details of the increase. It attributed the rise to a ""disturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the air"". Ukrainian authorities said that Russia took the plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle on Thursday. A Ukrainian MP said “that’s exactly why I’m looking at my AK-47 in front of me” when he was asked about the Russia invasion closing in on Kyiv. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Sviatoslav Yurash said he was readying to fight the Russians himself if necessary with his own gun. Kyiv citizens have been urged to make their own molotov cocktails as part of the defence of the capital. Yurash said: ""This is a full-scale invasion intending to destroy the Ukrainian state and take it over. “We will fight with everything we have and all the support the world can provide us. ""We are arming people who will be taking that fight to the Russians in every way. “We are a nation of 40 million people and we are not going to just stand idly by as Russia does as it wants all across its borders."" Martial law has been announced in Ukraine following the invasion in the early hours of Thursday. In a statement the interior ministry said: “The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine reports that due to the imposition of martial law in Ukraine, a certain category of citizens is temporarily restricted from leaving Ukraine. “In particular, male citizens of Ukraine aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine. Such a rule will apply for the period of martial law. We ask citizens to take this information into account.”",17,3.2488578327177,2.9299517173663143,0.31890611535138547,18
2022-02-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/sky-news-journalist-runs-cover-26328402,Sky News journalist runs for cover on live TV as Russian mortar fire rains down,"This is the horrifying moment that a British journalist ran for safety after coming under mortar fire during a live broadcast from Ukraine. The Sky News crews had been reporting from the southeast of the country when shells dropped from the sky. The dramatic clip shows Sky correspondent Alex Rossi scrambling for cover with his camera crews as the shelling descended in the coastal city of Berdyansk, just 50 miles from strategically vital city of Mariupol. After getting to safety in a nearby building, Alex told viewers: ""It just shows how quickly things can change here. We were outside filming. ""[It was] really calm. There had been shells that had come in this morning. But again, it had gone quiet, everything felt very, very normal. Follow our live blog of the Russia Ukraine conflict here ""We’ve just had to come in here to take cover because there’s been incoming mortar fire."" Mariupol is the most important Ukrainian port in the Azov Sea but mainly handles smaller ships between 3,000 to 10,000 tonnes deadweight, the Mail reports. But the city appears to have come under attack by Russian forces as Putin attempts to cripple the Ukrainian economy by destroying the vital shipping route. The port alongside others connected to the Avoz Sea is a major exporting route for goods such as wheat, barley and corn to Mediterranean importers including Turkey, Italy, Cyprus, Egypt and Lebanon. Russian troops have already been deployed to guard the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, launch strikes on key airbases and surrounded Kyiv on three sides as they attempt to take the city. Fears have been raised about increased levels of radiation after Russian forces took over the Chernobyl exclusion zone and disturbed the top soil, kicking up radioactive dust. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. But Russia has refuted Ukrainian officials claims that there has been any increase in gamma radiation. Speaking in a televised statement this morning, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was Russia's ""number one target"" and feared he would be abducted in an effort to topple the country's political system. He said: “According to our information, the enemy marked me as target number one, my family as target number two. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state. We have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv.” Zelensky is in hiding but claimed he was still in Kyiv last night as he resists fleeing his capital. “I am staying in the government quarter together with others,” he said.",17,4.733638031388225,3.028659356621207,1.7049786747670184,14
2022-02-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/how-many-people-died-ukraine-26328492,Death toll in Ukraine rises as troops and civilians killed in brutal Russian war,"When Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, he signed the death warrants of thousands of people. As fighting continues to rage, Ukraine refuses to surrender to Russian troops in cities all over the country. Around 10 million people are believed to have fled their homes, including 3.5 million who have left the country altogether. Missiles have crashed into residential buildings causing large parts of cities like Kharkiv, Mariupol and the capital of Kyiv to be destroyed. Putin's aggression has had huge consequences, with peace on the continent of Europe shattered and sanctions seemingly the only answer without a full-scale world war breaking out. Ukrainians can only hope said sanctions by NATO states and the EU will help their cause, while protesters on the streets of Moscow and Saint Petersburg risk jail to protest their disgust. Thousands have already died, including soldiers on both sides and hundreds of civilians, but the exact death toll is not entirely clear, despite a supposed 'leak' by pro-Kremlin Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) says 925 civilians have been killed and another 1,496 wounded in Ukraine. Of these, 75 are believed to be children and these are the most recent figures posted by OHCHR on March 20. The actual death count is likely to be much higher than this. In terms of soldier casualties, this figure is heavily disputed. Both sides have an incentive to suggest that their figures are a particular number and it is widely believed, based on various reports, that the Kremlin has not posted the true death toll and casualty lists. However, pro-Putin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda briefly published a toll yesterday in which it cited the Russian Ministry of Defence as a source, saying that 9,861 Russian soldiers had been killed and 16,153 injured since the invasion of Ukraine. The general conclusion from a number of reporters is that either the site was hacked, or the information was leaked onto the site and quickly removed. The site administrators have since said: ""On March 21, access to the administrator interface was hacked on the Komsomolskaya Pravda website and a fake stuffing was made in this publication about the situation around the special operation in Ukraine."" So far, Moscow has confirmed 498 soldiers dead, though this was only as recent as March 2. US intelligence reports recently put the figure at around 7,000, while the Ukrainians claimed it is around 14,000. As for Ukrainian troops, a March 13 estimate by Ukraine put the death toll of its soldiers at around 1,300. Fighting in Ukraine continues to be fierce in some parts and Ukraine has Kremlin intends to use chemical weapons in the country in the south of the country. In the capital, the closest Russian troops are now reported to be roughly 15 miles from the city centre. There is also real concern that the Putin intends to use them himself. The bombing of civilian areas has been indiscriminate and Russian troops have not shied away from raining down bombs on the heads of innocent people. Russia is currently accusing Ukraine of having biological weapons, to which US President Joe Biden said the claims may be a sign 'clear evidence' of Russian war crimes. He said: ""[Putin’s] back is against the wall and now he’s talking about new false flags."" The Pentagon has said there is also 'clear evidence' of Russian war crimes.",17,4.820533093670888,4.158365272495127,0.6621678211757613,29

The bloody image of Helena has been one of the most noticeable during the Russian invasion of Ukraine so far. It shows the 53-year-old teacher bloodied and bandaged after she was badly injured during a Russian bombardment of the northern Ukraine city of Chuhuiv. During the relentless missile strikes on the city, Helena was hurt by shards of glass that cut open her head. She was photographed bandaged up outside a burnt out apartment building that had also been the victim of Russian bombings. This became one the iconic pictures of the early hours and days of the Russian invasion, and was a precursor for the violence and death that would follow. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates Her injuries were down to the ongoing Russian missile strikes on cities which have been ongoing since the invasion first began. A number of cities and major urban centres and air bases have been targeted. In Kyiv, residens were pictured taking cover underground in bomb shelters to escape the deadly blasts. The capital is also now the site of increased conflict as Russian forces move closer and closer, with reports that Russian special forces are already inside. Ukrainian troops have set up in the centre of the city along with armoured vehicles and support, awaiting Russian forces. MPs have also been given weapons, one of the clearest indications that the fighting will reach the capital’s heart sooner rather than later. Since then, hundreds have died on both sides, with the invading Russian forces suffering the heaviest casualties. As of last night, at least 450 Russian troops had been killed, but the figure would have risen since then. Around the same time, Ukraine had suffered 137 casualties and 316 injuries. As the invasion continues into its second day, there are more and more reports of gunfire and conflict from the outskirts of and within Kyiv. Ukraine continues to fight invasion four front, and has been successful in repelling and holding up Russian forces on some occasions. Outside Helena’s city of Chuhuiv, Ukraine forces held up the Russian advance and kept it from entering into the city. Fighting continued outside the city. Chaos continues across Ukraine as many have tried to flee their homes in face of the oncoming invasion. On the morning of the first invasion, thousands could be seen trying to leave Kyiv by car, clogging up the roads out of the city. Since then, a number of countries have committed to taking in Ukrainian refugees and the Moldovan President Maia Sandu confirmed they had received 4,000 refugees in the first day only.",17,3.3272960799778373,3.3748649733493368,-0.0475688933714995,19

Even now more Chechens are deploying from their hometown Grozny, escalating fears the battle for Ukraine will turn into an horrific bloodbath. Among the Chechen battalions are believed to be special forces kill squads deployed to focus on key members of the Ukrainian government with President Volodymyr Zelensky target number one. One British military source told the Daily Mirror: “These Chechen forces are tough, battle-hardened and utterly ruthless.

So far more than 1,000 Russian troops have been killed by a ferocious Ukrainian resistance but Moscow’s special forces are already inside the capital. The battle for Ukraine’s cities is about to become a bloody insurgency as men and women civilians have been handed firearms to defend their homeland. Men aged between 18 and 60 years of age are being called up to resist the Russian onslaught as Kyiv’s airport fell to Moscow’s forces.

Experts fear Kyiv could fall within two days unless Ukraine’s troops can hold the line and protect the government from being toppled by the attackers. A battalion of Chechen forces were spotted hiding within dense forests outside Kyiv but are now believed to have started to close in on embattled Kyiv city. These tough fighters were recruited by Putin’s commanders to form militia units and enforce Moscow’s will in Chechnya after troops became bogged down in conflict. Russia has pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital after unleashing air strikes on cities and military bases, particularly in the eastern city of Kharkiv. It has sent troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order. Explosions sounded before dawn on Friday in Kyiv and gunfire was later heard near the government quarter. Ukraine’s president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his government and cause massive casualties. The Russian military said it had seized a strategic airport just outside Kyiv and cut the city off from the west. The Ukrainian military said a group of Russian spies and saboteurs had been seen in a district of Kyiv about three miles north of the centre. Elsewhere in the capital, soldiers established defensive positions at bridges, and armoured vehicles rolled down the streets. Earlier, the military said that Russian forces had seized two Ukrainian military vehicles and some were heading towards the city to try to infiltrate under the guise of being locals. President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to global leaders for even more severe sanctions than those imposed by Western allies and for defence assistance. He said: ""If you don't help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.” Mr Zelensky said he is the number one target for the invading Russians but that he planned to remain in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said they lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world's worst nuclear disaster. Mr Zelensky said in a video address that 137 ""heroes"", including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded. He concluded an emotional speech by saying that ""the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.""",17,3.405719909427228,1.5799637819853685,1.8257561274418597,14

It is claimed that the huge military vehicle was being driven by Kremlin troops when the horror crash happened. Incredibly the driver, said by witnesses to be an elderly man, survived the shocking ordeal in the under-siege Ukrainian capital. The widely shared clip shows the tank, believed to be a Strela-10 anti-aircraft vehicle, swerve across the road into the car, which was driving in the opposite direction. After remaining still with the crushed vehicle beneath it for nearly 20 seconds, the tank then slowly reverses back into the road, leaving a wreckage in its wake.

""It's usually after 12am that we've been hearing loud bombing noises, shootings, yesterday during the day we saw planes flying above us."" It was just two weeks ago that Ms Nykytyuk got engaged to her fiancé Sasha. He has now volunteered to fight - which his fiancé said makes her “so, so proud” but also makes her “want to cry”. The situation was worlds away from that which she grew up in - the Adelaide suburbs of Woodville West and Findon, where she went to school. ""Now we're thinking about how to survive, we can't take any money out, we can't buy any food products, there's no petrol left, no money left at the ATMs,"" she said. Ms Nykytyuk’s reports of chaos amid the invasion of Russian troops come amid local reports of guns being handed out to Ukrainian civilians and the Defence Ministry urging citizens to make Molotov cocktails to protect themselves.

Fierce fighting has already broken out across the country, including in the Donetsk and Luhansk border regions - both declared People's Republics hours before war commenced. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos.

On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes.

Another Australian, Marko Kvasniuk, is worried about his fiancé - Tetiana - who is currently in western Ukraine. Mr Kvasniuk said he was trying to assist her in getting over the border into Hungary, Poland or Slovakia. “She has decided to leave but the path out isn't clear,” he continued.

A new video shows a Kremlin warship warning Ukrainian border guards on the strategic Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender or be bombed. An officer on the warship delivered an ultimatum saying: ""I am a Russian military ship. I repeat, I am a Russian military ship. ""I am proposing you put down your arms immediately to avoid bloodshed and unjustified deaths int he worse case you will be hit with a bomb strike."" They then repeated the message, demanding acknowledgement. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates When given the ultimatum from a Moscow warship demanding surrender, the border guards defiant response came by radio, they said: “F*** it as well. Russian warship go f*** yourself!” Ukraine said that the men were killed in the gunfire however Russia claimed today that the men, and others on the island, are all alive and unharmed. ""All border guards died heroically but did not give up. They will be awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine posthumously,"" Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said. Snake Island sits about 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the southern tip of the Ukrainian mainland in the northwestern Black Sea. It's about 185 miles (300 kilometers) west of Crimea, the Ukrainian territory that Russia annexed in 2014. Russia has consistently attempted to play down or minimise the full-scale invasion and denied targeting civilians in their bombing campaign in Kyiv, despite significant evidence otherwise. A statement from the Russian defence ministry, known for sewing disinformation, said: ""In the area of the Zmeiny (Snake) Island, 82 Ukrainian servicemen laid down their arms and voluntarily surrendered to a unit of the Russian Armed Forces. “At present, they are being asked to sign a refusal to take part in hostilities. “In the near future they will be returned to their families”. Ukraine officials say that 13 men were all slaughtered in a hail of missile fire. In the moments before the attack, the border guards said: “They struck there and also there [with their missiles], '' says one. He asks: “They try to scare us, or what…? “So far nothing is destroyed. “Cannot understand what they’re doing, most likely trying to scare us. ""They strike the rocks.” Soon afterwards the men were reportedly killed in a huge strike from the warship, but Russia maintain they are alive and kept as prisoners. This comes during the second day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as it is confirmed Russian forces have reached towns only 15 miles outside of Kyiv. As Moscow’s forces continue their push towards Kyiv it is unsure what Putin’s plans are, whether they intend to turn Ukraine into a vassal state, or not. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and the Ukraine Ministry of Defence both said that despite all of this, the invasion failed to achieve its day one objectives.

Mr Zelensky described those who died as ""heroes"" in a video address in the early hours of the morning.

Vitaly Klitschko, mayor of capital city Kyiv, said at least three people were injured when a rocket hit a multi-storey apartment building in Ukraine's capital on Friday, starting a fire. The Mirror's chief reporter Andy Lines, who is in the Ukrainian capital, said this morning: ""I had to be evacuated twice to an underground car park after air raid sirens sounded. ""I watched several Ukrainian armoured personnel carriers race through one of the city’s main thoroughfares which was deserted. ""Thousands continue to flee west to escape the incoming Russian forces."" Higher than usual gamma radiation levels have been detected in the area near the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, after it was seized by the Russian military, according to Ukraine's nuclear energy regulatory agency. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate said on Friday that higher gamma radiation levels have been detected in the Chernobyl zone, but did not provide details of the increase. It attributed the rise to a ""disturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the air"". Ukrainian authorities said that Russia took the plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle on Thursday.

Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of Nato membership? Everyone is afraid.” Ukrainian officials claimed that a number of residential districts had already been hit by dozens of missile strikes on Kyiv, yesterday evening. Footage released on social media showed the moment explosions ripped through the city as flaming debris and ash fell from the sky. Some suggested that the footage showed a Ukrainian aircraft shot down by a Russian anti-air battery, while other reports claimed the blast was a launch by Ukrainian forces as they intercepted a Russian missile or plane. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said in a tweet: “Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv. Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one.” Speaking on Friday a spokesman for Russia's defence ministry told a briefing that Putin's troops have already destroyed 118 Ukrainian military infrastructure sites. Anton Hereshchenko, an adviser to the interior ministry, confirmed that an airfield just outside Kyiv had fallen into Russian hands after an 'intense battle' The Times reports. The Antonov airfield in Hostomel, 14 miles north of central Kyiv had been taken by Russian paratroopers, he claimed, who are seeking to use it to send further troops into the capital. He told reporters via text message: “Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued.” Officials in the US have claimed their intelligence shows 160 missiles have been launched against Kyiv by Russian forces so far. President Zelensky reported that some 137 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and hundreds more injured in the first day of battle. Russian newspaper Pravda reported that Ukrainian forces had blown up a bridge near Ivankiv in a bid to stop Russian troops which have descended on three fronts in an effort to encircle the city. The paper said the move was “important as Ivankiv is halfway from the border to Kyiv. After that, it becomes possible to attack Kyiv via Vyshhorod”. Now new satellite images have pictured Russian military vehicles as they crossed a pontoon bridge over the Pripyat River as they seized Chernobyl during the first day of the invasion yesterday.

The region has no land border with Russia but lies on the coast of the Azov Sea shared by the two countries.

2022-02-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-president-says-country-not-26334100,Ukraine and President vows 'we will not yield' and are 'not afraid of Russia',"Defiant Ukraine’s citizen army rose up today and took up arms against Russia’s brutal invasion - as Putin’s troops closed in on Kyiv. In stirring scenes one man stood in the way of tanks and tens of thousands of assault rifles were handed out to Ukraine’s brave civilians. All over Ukraine people prepared to rise up against Vladimir Putin’s invaders, even studying government advice on making petrol bombs. Ukraine’s civilian struggle started as its people prepared to back the country's courageous troops who have fought ferociously to defend its cities. The Mirror can reveal Russia has deployed over 10,000 battle-hardened Chechen fighters to Ukraine - some of them crack Spetsnaz troops - to bolster the battle for Kyiv. More Chechens are setting off for war from their hometown Grozny, escalating fears the battle for Ukraine will be a bloodbath. Ukraine’s forces are putting up a tough defence as 80 of Moscow’s tanks are thought to have been wiped out, ten warplanes, seven helicopters and more than 500 Russian vehicles. As many as 2,800 Russian troops have been taken out of the battle, among them 1,000 dead and the rest either captured or injured. It is believed Russia is calling up the Chechens to help seize Kyiv as the Russian advance appeared to falter throughout Ukraine. Among the Chechen battalions are special forces kill squads deployed to focus on key members of the Ukrainian government with President Volodymyr Zelensky target number one. He said today: “We are not afraid. We are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid of Russia.” Russian special forces were closing in on Kyiv’s centre tonight as an eerie silence fell on Independence Square, scene of the 2014 riots that sparked war in the east. A staggering 18,000 machine guns have been handed out to Kyiv’s citizens as they prepare to join troops in defending their city. Information on how to make a molotov cocktail petrol bomb, provided by Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was put out on social media. Ukraine’s citizens are now being encouraged to start the bloody insurgency they had always planned if Russia came for them. Gunfire and explosions could be heard today towards the city centre as Russian forces bore down on the government offices. Tonight Zelensky and his aides were sheltering in an underground bunker after he announced he believed his wife and children are target number two. He said his family, architect wife Oleana, 44, and two children Aleksandra, 17 and son Kiril, nine, were also sheltering but did not reveal their location. Zelensky added: “My family is not a traitor but a citizen of Ukraine. According to our information the enemy marked me as the number one target. My family is the number two goal. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the Head of State.” One British military source told the Daily Mirror: “These Chechen forces are tough, battle-hardened and utterly ruthless. “They are not above beheadings and they are likely to have little regard for civilian lives as they focus on their mission.” There are now believed to be more than 200,000 Russian troops in Ukraine as waves of Moscow’s tanks poured into the region as reinforcements. Evidence of the Russian ferocity was seen in a horrific video of an armoured vehicle running over a moving civilian vehicle, then reversing over it. The driver, a man, survived after being dug out of the wreckage. In other horror imagery, a man’s body was collected by troops after he was shot dead randomly by a passing Russian vehicle. Ukraine’s resistance has been far more robust than Vladimir Putin appears to have predicted but Moscow’s special forces are already inside the capital. Local civilian men were seen brandishing AK47s and walking off to war to defend the city, having been called to arms by the authorities. As many as 80 Russian tanks have been destroyed, seven helicopters and a staggering 516 Russian military vehicles have been disabled. The death toll of Ukrainian forces reached 337, although the toll of civilians is not known. More than 100,000 Ukrainians have been displaced from their homes, officials revealed tonight. The battle for Ukraine’s cities is about to become a bloody insurgency as men and women civilians are being handed firearms to defend their homeland. Men aged between 18 and 60 years of age are being called up to resist the Russian onslaught as Kyiv’s airport fell to Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s military was fighting bitterly to defend their cities, such as Kharkiv, to the east and just 20 miles from Russia. But experts fear Kyiv could fall within two days unless Ukraine’s troops can hold the line and protect the government from being toppled by the attackers. Chaotic scenes were seen at Kyiv train station as thousands tried to flee the capital and the Russian forces advancing on them. A battalion of Chechen forces were spotted hiding within dense forests outside Kyiv but are now believed to have started to close in on embattled Kyiv city. These tough fighters were recruited by Putin’s commanders to form militia units and enforce Moscow’s will in Chechnya after troops became bogged down in conflict. Russia has pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases, particularly in the eastern city of Kharkiv. It has sent troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order. Explosions sounded before dawn on Friday in Kyiv and gunfire was later heard near the government quarter. Ukraine’s military used armoured vehicles and snowploughs to defend Kyiv and limit movement, and said Russian spies were infiltrating the city. Russia’s military said it had seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv that would allow it to quickly build up forces to take the capital. It claimed to have already cut the city off from the west - the direction most of those escaping the invasion are heading in, with lines of cars snaking towards the Polish border. An intense fire broke out on a bridge across the Dnipro River dividing the eastern and western sides of Kyiv, with about 200 Ukrainian forces establishing defensive positions and taking shelter behind their armoured vehicles and later under the bridge. Ukraine’s president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his government and cause massive casualties. Zelensky pleaded with Moscow to hold talks, and with western powers to act faster to cut off Russia’s economy and provide military help. He warned Russian President Vladimir Putin would not stop at Ukraine and now represents a major threat to the rest of Europe. He said: “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine. “When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.” The Russian military said it had seized a strategic airport just outside Kyiv and cut the city off from the west. The Ukrainian military said a group of Russian spies and saboteurs had been seen in a district of Kyiv about three miles north of the centre. Elsewhere in the capital, soldiers established defensive positions at bridges, and armoured vehicles rolled down the streets. Earlier, the military said that Russian forces had seized two Ukrainian military vehicles and some were heading towards the city to try to infiltrate under the guise of being locals. President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to global leaders for even more severe sanctions than those imposed by Western allies and for defence assistance. He said: “If you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.” Mr Zelensky said he is the number one target for the invading Russians but that he planned to remain in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said they lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. Today Ukraine said it had recorded increased radiation levels from the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant, a day after the site was captured by Russian forces, due to military activity causing radioactive dust to rise into the air. The still-radioactive site of the 1986 nuclear disaster lies some 100 km (62 miles) from Kyiv. Experts at Ukraine’s state nuclear agency said the change was due to the movement of heavy military equipment in the area lifting radioactive dust into the air. Mr Zelensky said in a video address that 137 “heroes”, including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded. He concluded an emotional speech by saying that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.” Around 200 Ukrainian special forces were killed later by Russian forces as they took Hostomel airport outside Kyiv. The invasion began early on Thursday with a series of missile strikes on cities and military bases, and quickly followed with a multi-pronged ground assault. Troops rolled in from several areas in the east, from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and from Belarus to the north. After Ukrainian officials said they lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, Russia said it was working with the Ukrainians to secure the plant.",17,2.4430327947856796,4.720876427738942,-2.277843632953262,19

The horrifying clip appeared to show a kindergarten, named the Sunshine nursery, surrounded by bodies in the eastern Ukrainian city of Okhtyrka. Drone cameras show the scene with the slides and sandbox visible in the play area outside as missiles continue to fly. Bodies of two adults appear to be lying in pools of blood, with other people crouched alongside them. The clip follows footage appearing to show a Russian hit on a cancer centre within the grounds of a hospital in Melitopol. Follow the latest updates on the Ukraine and Russia situation in our live blog A harrowing clip shows a missile fired at the building before it partly erupts into a ball of flames. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russain shelling of a hospital was ""beyond evil"". He said in a tweet: ""Consider this: Putin has launched a massive war of aggression in Europe during a still raging pandemic. ""On top of that, Russians bomb Ukrainian hospitals now. “This is beyond evil. The only moral choice any government can make now is to support Ukraine by all means."" Kuleba accused Russia of war crimes after earlier reports of attacks on orphanages and nurseries. He promised Ukraine would send evidence of the attacks to The Hague. ""Today’s Russian attacks on a kindergarten and an orphanage are war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute,"" Dmytro Kuleba tweeted, referring to the agreement that established the International Criminal Court. ""Together with the General Prosecutor’s Office we are collecting this and other facts, which we will immediately send to the Hague. ""Responsibility is inevitable."" The kindergarten appears to be flying a Ukrainian flag above its doors. The claim came as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow has called a ""special military operation,"" moved in on the capital city of Kyiv. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. The skies in Ukraine were tonight filled with a devastating fireball as Russian missiles targets a fuel depot. Frightened families watched on in horror in the village of Kulinichi close to Kharkiv city in eastern Ukraine. The fireball ""mushroomed"" into the air as Putin celebrated a direct hit.

2022-02-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/fears-vladimir-putin-could-attack-26333802,Fears Vladimir Putin could attack Baltic states after Ukraine invasion,"Obsessed Vladimir Putin may be planning to launch an invasion of the Baltic states – dragging Britain into a Europe-wide war, the Defence Secretary warned today. Ben Wallace said the Russian leader “won’t stop” at Ukraine, with NATO members Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia likely next in the firing line. Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Wallace said: “Putin is not rational. He won’t stop after he’s [finished]... with Ukraine. He will use everything in the Baltic states. And we will have to stand up to it.” His comments came as the UK doubled the number of troops in Estonia, with armoured vehicles from the Royal Welsh Battle Group pictured heading there via Latvia. Britain is also sending tanks as part of NATO’s increased presence in Eastern Europe. And Navy ship HMS Diamond set sail for the Mediterranean from Portsmouth as worried relatives waved off their loved ones. The Type 45 destroyer will join offshore patrol vessel HMS Trent with four additional RAF Typhoon jets also deployed to Cyprus. The family of Chief Petty Officer Sean Baldwin, 35, from nearby Havant, watched as the ship began its journey, with his children heard calling out: “Love you, Daddy”. And CPO Baldwin’s proud mum, Beverley Baldwin, said: “We are quite apprehensive. “We’ve just got to support him and hope they all come back safe.” There is also a British presence in Poland. But Mr Wallace repeated Britain would not send personnel to Ukraine, as that would also spark a much wider conflict. He said: “We’ve always supported Ukraine’s application to NATO over the last 15 years, not every country has wanted them to join. “We’ve done the next best thing, which is train over 20,000 Ukrainians, provided them with lethal capabilities, which they are using right now. But I’m not putting British troops directly to fight Russian troops. That would trigger a European war, because we are a NATO country.” Mr Wallace also insisted it would not be possible to create a no-fly zone as that would “put British fighter jets directly against Russian fighter jets”. The Baltic states have a turbulent history. They were occupied by the Soviet Red Army from 1944 having previously being invaded by the Nazis. In the late 1980s, there was a huge campaign of resistance dubbed the Singing Revolution. Under Soviet leader Mikael Gorbachev, the process of independence started, and the last Russian troops left in 1994. As with Ukraine, Putin has long regarded Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as part of Russia, and never accepted their integration into the EU. And now he has shown his contempt for world opinion, the people there have reason to be scared, despite their NATO status.",29,6.055669227553843,4.127476092254897,1.9281931352989465,4

The Far East superpower is said to be keeping close watch on the Kremlin’s brutal and deadly invasion of its southern neighbour. Ukraine confirmed earlier today that 137 civilians and military personnel had been killed in the country during the first day of the assault, with more than 300 wounded in the fighting. Far from the frontlines, Putin took a call from China’s President Xi Jinping, Aljazeera reports. According to state broadcaster CCTV, XI said: “[The] “situation in eastern Ukraine has undergone rapid changes … [and] China supports Russia and Ukraine to resolve the issue through negotiation."" He added Putin should “abandon the Cold War mentality, attach importance to and respect the reasonable security concerns of all countries, and form a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism through negotiations”.

According to the Chinese media readout, Putin replied saying: “The United States and NATO have long ignored Russia’s reasonable security concerns, repeatedly reneged on their commitments, and continued to advance military deployment eastward, challenging Russia’s strategic bottom line. “Russia is willing to conduct high-level negotiations with Ukraine.” China has refused to call its ally’s actions an invasion or criticise Putin’s actions which have dragged the world to the brink of war. This evening the nation abstained voting in the United Nations Security Council draft resolution that condemned Russia for invading Ukraine. Other world leaders have heavily criticised Russia's invasion, amid warnings of heavy sanctions on the Kremlin. Putin’s troops are marching on Kyiv with brave Ukrainian troops positioned on the streets to block Russian invaders. Civilians have been urged to target invaders using petrol bombs, with Ukrainian men aged between 18 and 60 barred from leaving the country and told to take up arms. This morning Ukrainian deputy defence minister Anna Maliar said enemy troops had driven two Ukrainian army trucks into Kyiv, followed by a convoy of military trucks. In a Facebook post she said the Russians were “moving at speed"" to the centre of Kiev, adding: “They will surely be destroyed.” Boris Johnson earlier condemned Russia for unleashing a “tidal wave of violence” on Ukraine , warning Putin would achieve “pariah status”. He told MPs: “We will continue on a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia from the global economy piece by piece, day by day, week by week.”",17,3.525499881132192,4.56413191364284,-1.0386320325106482,14

About twelve of the tiny infants were taken by brave doctors and nurses to the basement of the building in Dnipro. Inside, they were carefully cradled by staff from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Children’s Hospital who feared for the lives of their young charges, The Sun reports. It follows reports of other hospitals suffering missile damage in cities under siege by heavily armed Kremlin forces. Dr Denis Surkov, 51, chief of the neonatal unit at Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Children’s Hospital said of the bunker: “This is the neonatal intensive care unit. In a bomb ­shelter. “Can you imagine? This is our reality.” Earlier it was reported that the oncology centre of another hospital was left in flames after Russian forces opened fire on the building. Shocking footage shot in Melitopol, in the south east of the war-torn nation, showed heavy fire close to the hospital before explosions in the building. The site then immediately starts to burn before more gunshots are aimed at the centre - used to help those suffering with cancer - leaving dozens of bullet holes.

2022-02-24,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-map-how-big-country-26317205,Ukraine's huge size and border countries as 'barbaric' Russian invasion begins,"Vladimir Putin's Russian forces have stunned the world with a ""barbaric"" invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Ukraine has been independent since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, but there have long been disputes about its territory, due to its close cultural ties with Russia. Regardless, cultural bonds do not make up enough of a reason for a violent invasion of a country under various charters around the world set up to try and prevent this sort of thing from happening. Ukraine is the second-biggest country in Europe and has a long and proud history like any of the independent countries that emerged from behind the Iron Curtain in the early 1990s, when communism disintegrated and a huge change in the world dynamic took place. So how big is it and who borders Ukraine? Ukraine is around 233,000 square miles, making it the second-largest country in Europe behind Russia and the 45th largest country in the world. It is far bigger than the UK, which is only around 93,000 square miles. To the south of Ukraine is the Black Sea and geographically speaking, one thing the country is known for is how flat it is, with its mountainous regions on its border making up only 5% of its land. The current disputed regions are Crimea in the south and the Donetsk and Luhansk in the east. In 2014, Russia annexed two areas, the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol in March 2014, and they have both now switched to Russian time. This led to an uprising in Luhansk and Donetsk, with rebel forces wanting their regions to become part of Russia, and Ukraine has had little control of these areas since. Together, Luhansk and Donetsk is a region known as the Donbas and is one of the justifications Putin gave behind his decision to invade Ukraine, as the Russian president claimed their independence. Ukraine's significant size means it borders a total of seven countries, four of which are in the European Union. Ukraine's border countries are: Several countries declared their independence from the Soviet Union upon its collapse and many have become members of NATO and the European Union, including ones on Ukraine's western border. Russia takes exception to this and the geographical location of Ukraine is an important factor in the crisis. Ukraine - not an official member of NATO but has outlined its intentions to join at some point in the future - is perceived partly as a threat by Russia on its own border. This fear stems partly from a now-debunked 'pledge' that NATO expansion eastwards would not occur after the fall of the Soviet Union.",29,4.626719496731761,4.54389754278858,0.08282195394318137,29
2022-02-24,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/how-russia-launched-deadly-invasion-26315794,Russia launches deadly invasion of Ukraine - everything we know so far,"Dozens of people are feared dead and many more injured after Russia launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine. Following a fiery address by Vladimir Putin last night, troops and tanks rolled in over the north and south borders and shells were launched into cities. Blasts and explosions rang out in cities including capital Kyiv overnight before harrowing photos of casualties began to emerge this morning. As Western countries prepare to respond to the invasion, this is how invasion broke out overnight and turned into war. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates on the conflict. Hours before the invasion began, the President of Ukraine made a televised address imploring Russia not to attack. ""We know for sure that we don’t need the war,"" he said. ""Not a Cold War, not a hot war. Not a hybrid one. But if we’ll be attacked by the (enemy) troops, if they try to take our country away from us, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. ""Not attack, but defend ourselves. And when you will be attacking us, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces."" At 6am Moscow time (3am GMT), the Russian President said that his troops would 'demilitarize' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine. He urged Ukrainian service members to lay down their arms and go home, before warning that clashes between the two sides was now 'inevitable'. ""To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside - if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,"" he said. At around 5am local time the first missiles began to fall on military facilities across Ukraine. Cities have also been targeted, with a huge explosion ringing out in Kyiv and the eastern city of Kharkiv being hit. Ukrainian soldiers have been photographed inspecting a shell in Kyiv, which was a non-targeted projectile according to some reports which contradict Russian claims that its only using high-precision missiles. Photos from the scene show rubble spread across the the road in the capital after a military building there was hit. In Donbas, which is in the separatist Donetsk region, a man was seen weeping above the body of a person thought to be his son apparently killed in one of the strikes. Later on a blast rang out in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk in the west of Ukraine, with reports suggesting that the airport there had been targeted by missile strikes. Officials have said an attack on a military unit in Podilsk, outside Odessa, killed six people and wounded seven. An apartment block in Chuhuiv in the north east has been completey gutted by a blast which knocked out all the windows and tore down its balconies. According to analysis by Bellingcat, the apartment block was likely hit by mistake due to its proximity to a nearby airport. The Russian military pushed further into Ukraine from the north and south as the missiles rained down. Interfax reported that soldiers had landed in the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol in the south east and and Odessa on the Black Sea. Troops atop a column of military vehicles entered Ukraine from a border crossing with Belarus to the north, CNN reported at around 6.48am local time. ""Russia conducted strikes on our military infrastructure and our border guards. There were blasts heard in many cities of Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Zelensky said hours after the shelling first began. ""We’re introducing martial law on the whole territory of our country. “A minute ago I had a conversation with President Biden. The US have already started uniting international support. ""Today each of you should keep calm. Stay at home if you can. We are working. The army is working. The whole sector of defence and security is working,” he added. “No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything. We will win over everybody because we are Ukraine.” Just before 5am GMT, around the time President Zelensky declared martial law, the UK's PM condemned the attack and pledged to support Ukraine. ""I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelensky to discuss next steps,"" he tweeted. ""President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively."" At 7.30am the PM chaired a meeting of Cobra ahead of an address to the nation and statement to the Commons later today. Ukraine’s military has said it had destroyed four Russian tanks on a road near the eastern city of Kharkiv, according to Reuters. It claimed to have killed 50 troops near a town in Luhansk region and downed a sixth Russian aircraft, also in the country’s east. Russia has denied reports that its aircraft or armoured vehicles have been destroyed. Ukraine’s border guard service said that three of its servicemen had been killed in the southern Kherson region and that several more were wounded. Whizz Air, a Hungarian airline which typically has many services into and out of Ukraine, has said it will be stopping these flights as Ukrainian airspace is shut down. ""Due to the current events in Ukraine and the airspace closure, Wizz Air regrets to inform our customers that the airline must temporarily suspend all flight operations in the country,"" it said. Up until now, commercial routes out of the country had been available to those hoping to leave. Airline Ryanair has also suspended flights to Ukraine, for at least the next two weeks. Ryanair said: ""Due to the closure of Ukrainian airspace overnight, and the apparent invasion by Russian forces all Ryanair flights to/from Ukraine have been suspended for at least the next 14 days. After holding a meeting with his minister this morning, at around 9am GMT Volodymyr Zelensky made a plea for any Ukrainians with military experience to joint the country's defence. The government will provide weapons to people who want them, he said, before urging people to donate blood to help injured hospitals. Ukraine has now severed diplomatic ties with Russia, the president confirmed. ""We will fight for our country and we will support our country in the squares of each town,"" he said. The UK's PM has called for the allied Western forces to meet as soon as possible. ""This is a catastrophe for our continent,"" he tweeted. ""I will make an address to the nation this morning on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I will also speak to fellow G7 leaders and I am calling for an urgent meeting of all NATO leaders as soon as possible."" His comment came shortly after a siren was heard in the Polish town of Medyka, according to Reuters. The town acts a border crossing between Poland, a Nato member, and Russia. EU leaders will hold an emergency meeting later today to discuss further sanctions on Russia, with the leaders will be considering ""massive and severe consequences"".",17,4.521157810700999,1.840082236664075,2.6810755740369245,19

Thousands of people have been seen trying to flee the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv this morning after Russia missile strikes began against the city. Roads have been gridlocked as citizens try to escape the full-scale invasion. Others have waited in long queues for buses or took shelter in subway stations and basements as they desperately prepare to flee the capital and Russia's airstrike assaults. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, General Sir Richard Shirreff, a retired Army officer, said any incursion into Nato territory would bring Britain into direct involvement in the conflict. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates ""There is no surprise and there is profound sadness and a sense of appalling horror at what is about to unfold for the people of Ukraine,"" he said. ""And I think we have to assume that this is not Russia biting off a chunk of Ukraine - for example, establishing a land corridor in Crimea - but a full-blown military offensive to occupy Ukraine."" Aircraft flying to or from UK airports are being ordered to avoid Ukraine airspace after the crisis in the country intensified. Wizz Air cancelled its flights between Luton Airport and the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Lviv on Thursday. Ryanair and Ukraine International Airlines – the other carriers which fly between the UK and Ukraine – are also expected to suspend those routes. The lack of flights will make it harder for British nationals to evacuate from Ukraine to the UK. In Ukraine, horrifying photos have shown Ukrainian firefighters arrive to rescue civilians after an airstrike hit an apartment complex in Chuhuiv, Kharkiv Oblast. One harrowing photo showed a man mourning a body while in tears with debris strewn from the airstrike. It's also been reported that a Ukrainian border guard has died as a result of a rocket shelling from occupied Crimea. State Border Guard Service said Russia had fired arms on them from occupied Crimea onto Preobrazhenka village, Kherson Oblast. Ukraine Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has called on all Ukrainians who are able to hold a weapon to mobilise, and people only need a passport to join their ranks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is chairing emergency Cobra talks and is set to reveal more sanctions against Russia when he addresses MPs later. He's already said the UK will respond decisively to Russia's ""unprovoked attack"" on Ukraine and will make an address to the nation this morning. The PM has also confirmed he will speak to the other G7 leaders and is calling for an urgent meeting of all Nato leaders as soon as possible. And Sir Richard said it is ""entirely plausible"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be aiming to revive the Soviet Union, adding that if Russia puts ""one bootstep"" into Nato territory, the entire alliance will be at war. Asked whether Britain might be expected to take part directly in the current military confrontation, he said: ""Absolutely there is a possibility that we as a nation could be at war with Russia, because if Russia puts one bootstep across Nato territory, we are all at war with Russia. Every single one, every single member of the Nato alliance. ""Article 5 (of the Nato alliance) says an attack on one is an attack on all, so we need to change our mindset fundamentally, and that is why I say our defence starts in the UK on the frontiers of Nato.""",17,3.6060755028801497,2.6975184574636857,0.908557045416464,19

As the sun rose of Ukraine this morning, the initial toll of Russian missile strikes on heavily populated cities started to become clear. Officials have said an attack on a military unit in Podilsk, outside Odessa, killed six people and wounded seven. Photos believed to be from Donbas, which is in the separatist Donetsk region in the east of the country, a man was seen weeping above the body of a person thought to be his son, apparently killed in one of the strikes. A harrowing photo shows the man on his knees in the rubble weeping with his hands to his face. Follow our live blog for updates on the invasion Among the wreckage beneath him is a dead man, lying face down in the ruins of a building. Footage of destruction from cities including Donbas, Kyiv, Chuhuiv and Uman suggest the early death tolls will rise significantly. Unconfirmed and graphic footage from Uman in the centre of the country shows a woman lying dead on the street with blood trickling out from the sides of the blanket which covers her. An apartment block in Chuhuiv in the north east has been completely gutted by a blast which knocked out all the windows and tore down its balconies. According to analysis by Bellingcat, the apartment block was likely hit by mistake due to its proximity to a nearby airport. The explosion is believed to have claimed the life of at least one person. According to previous Amnesty International analysis of strikes on Gaza, the use of indiscriminate weapons towards civilian areas may constitute war crimes. ""You can see the utter devastation caused by this indiscriminate attack on a clearly civilian target,"" defence analyst Jimmy Sec wrote on Twitter of the apartment block strike. ""This is a clear and unambiguous war crime."" Later on a blast rang out in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk in the west of Ukraine, with reports suggesting that the airport there had been targeted by missile strikes. Dmytro Kuleba, minister of Foreign Affairs for Ukraine, condemned the strikes early this morning. ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,"" he tweeted. ""Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. ""Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now."" How Western forces will respond to the invasion remains to be seen, with further EU, UK and US to be announced later today.

The Prime Minister will then give a 5pm statement to the Parliament on the unfolding war, which he branded a ""catastrophe for our continent"". He is expected to unveil a new package of ""severe"" sanctions after action taken this week against five Russian banks and three oligarchs was branded not good enough. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine"". Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders into the eastern Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, and landing by sea at the port cities of Odessa and Mariupol in the south. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss today summoned the Russian Ambassador to the Foreign Office to ""explain Russia’s illegal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine"". Mr Johnson was woken by No10 officials at around 4am UK time and spoke to Ukraine's President before hosting a COBRA meeting at 7.30am. He said it was a “catastrophe for our continent” and called for an urgent meeting of Nato leaders. Earlier he said: ""President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively."" Mr Putin announced the action during a chilling televised address early in the early hours, saying the move was a response to threats from Ukraine. People in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv were awoken to sirens as gunfire rattled near the capital's main airport, the Interfax news agency said. A boy was killed in eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region after shelling struck an apartment building, emergency services said. An adviser to Ukraine's presidential office said more than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were dead and dozens wounded. Retired Army officer General Sir Richard Shirreff told the BBC: ""Absolutely there is a possibility that we as a nation [the UK] could be at war with Russia. “Because if Russia puts one bootstep across Nato territory, we are all at war with Russia.

""Article 5 (of the Nato alliance) says an attack on one is an attack on all, so we need to change our mindset fundamentally, and that is why I say our defence starts in the UK on the frontiers of Nato."" Vladimir Putin said Russia does not have a goal to occupy Ukraine, but the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian ""regime"". Russia's military said it had targeted Ukrainian air bases and other military assets and had not targeted populated areas. But European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said ""President Putin is responsible for bringing war back to Europe"" as the EU prepared new sanctions. Russian assets in the EU would also be frozen and Russian banks' access to the European financial market would be stopped. However, cutting Russia off the SWIFT global interbank payments system - one of the toughest, non-military sanctions the West could impose - is unlikely to be agreed at this stage, several EU sources told Reuters. In other developments: Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “All those who believe in the triumph of democracy over dictatorship, good over evil, freedom over the jackboot of tyranny must now support the Ukrainian people. They have been cast onto the frontline of a war, simply for existing.” Oil prices broke above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, stock markets slumped and the rouble hit a record low this morning. Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat warned the cost-of-living crisis will become ""driven by war"", with gas and food prices in danger of rising much higher than expected. He added: ""10% of the world's wheat is grown in Ukraine and the idea that this year's going to be a good crop, I'm afraid, is for the birds. ""This is absolutely one of those moments where we're going to see the cost-of-living crisis driven by war."" Former Foreign Secretary William Hague said: “It is the most significant event in Europe since the Second World War. Absolutely. ""This is a member of the United Nations Security Council, permanent member of the UN Security Council, charged with maintaining international peace and security in the world, deciding unprovoked to invade on a massive scale, a neighbouring country, and no doubt with great loss of life to come. ""And so that is something we haven't seen, we haven't seen that in the world since 1945. And it's an immense event and it changes the world."" The Mirror's Andy Lines, who is in the capital Kyiv, said: ""On the horizon I could see a huge ominous bright red and orange glow as a Russian missile hit its target. ""There was a massive explosion which I could feel as I stood outside by hotel in central Kyiv. Over a two hour period early this morning I heard 15 to 20 explosions in the distance.

2022-02-24,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-cyber-attack-russia-using-26321481,"UK hit with record cyberattacks, as Ukraine targeted after Russian invasion","Russia has invaded Ukraine, with reports of widespread breakouts of violence and aggression in multiple parts of the country. Reports of attacks on key strategic points such as airbases and military facilities have been widespread, with loss of life thought to have taken place on both sides. There are videos and images to boot, with footage of helicopters and troops in action flooding the internet. But sharing harrowing evidence of the fighting isn’t the only role the internet will play in the conflict. Digital technology can itself be a weapon, with cyber attacks an increasingly common part of 21st-century warfare. A cyber attack can come in many forms and be carried out for many reasons, from crime to warfare. IBM, one of the largest computing firms in America, said: “Cyber attacks are unwelcome attempts to steal, expose, alter, disable or destroy information through unauthorised access to computer systems. “In addition to cybercrime, cyber attacks can also be associated with cyber warfare or cyberterrorism, like hacktivists. Motivations can vary, in other words. And in these motivations, there are three main categories: criminal, political and personal.” The firm says there are a number of different ways cyberattacks can be carried out, from phishing and malware to those that find weaknesses and poison systems from the inside and give the hacker control. For more information on the types of cyber-attacks out there, visit the National Cyber Security Centre. On the morning of Thursday February 24, large-scale cyber attacks were aimed at the Ukrainian government website. Websites for Ukraine ’s defence, interior and foreign ministries were all targeted, leaving them slow or unresponsive. Another attack was reported to have hit the Ukrainian government the day before. The type of attacks that have been used against Ukraine direct junk traffic at the sites leaving them unusable, the Independent reports. The UK government said the same type of attacks, known as distributed denial of service (DDoS), were also carried out on the Ukrainian banking system on February 15 and 16. They said the attacks “involved the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate”. Speaking about the banking attacks, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The attack showed a continued disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty. This activity is yet another example of Russia ’s aggressive acts against Ukraine. “This disruptive behaviour is unacceptable – Russia must stop this activity and respect Ukrainian sovereignty. We are steadfast in our support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.” Cyber attacks are not unheard of in the UK, and could feasibly take place were a hacker able to navigate the defences of businesses and government. They can vary in scale and intention, with attacks affecting British business and interests not uncommon. In November 2021, Sky News reported that the number of cyberattacks on the UK had reached a new high, with a number of attacks believed by GCHQ to have come from countries including Russia and China. The publication reported that the UK had to deal with 777 attacks over the course of the year, two of which were described by the director of GCHQ, Jeremy Flemming as ""two of the most serious global cyber incidents we've seen in recent years"". In the past, cyber attacks have been known to target the NHS and Microsoft. It has since been reported that UK firms have been warned to prepare for fallout from cyber-attacks surrounding the Ukraine conflict, the Guardian has said. British officials are reportedly concerned about ‘spillover’ from the conflict, which was demonstrated by the attacks on the banks last week.",3,4.066650841179422,3.3080105837464413,0.7586402574329809,18

Fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the area in the north of the country may have led to damage at the facility, although these reports are yet to be independently verified. Large parts of Chernobyl were closed to the public for decades after a nuclear power reactor melted down there during the Soviet Union's reign in 1986. ""Advisor to Ukrainian interior ministry says Russian forces entered Chernobyl and that fighting there destroyed a nuclear waste storage facility,"" NBC's Richard Engel tweeted this afternoon. This was initially reported, but was later clarified due to a mistranslation. He added shortly after: ""Clarifying: advisor says heaving fighting MAY disturb nuclear waste."" Click here to follor our live blog with the latest updates After a two-hour fight Russian forces were reported to be in control of the facility and have taken hostages. An adviser for the Interior Minister of Ukraine, Anton Gerashchenko said today, according to LBC: ""The invaders from the territory of Belarus have moved into the Chernobyl AES Zone. ""The National Guardsmen, who guard the collectors of unsafe nuclear radioactive waste, are fighting hard. ""If the invaders artillery hits and ruins/damages the collectors of nuclear waste , radioactive nuclear dust can can be spread over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the country of the EU!"" The President of Ukraine took to Twitter to say Russian forces are trying to seize the zone. ""Russian occupation forces are trying to seize the #Chornobyl_NPP,"" tweeted Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated. Reported this to @SwedishPM. ""This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe."" It comes after President Vladimir Putin said allies of Ukraine who try to interfere with his attack will ""face consequences greater than any you have faced in history"", in what was a chilling warning. Air sirens have been heard across the city centre, reports the Mirror's Andy Lines from Kyiv, as residents try to flee for safety. Five Ukrainians have also lost their lives after a military plane was shot down. Photos also showed a radar station that Russia had bombed on outskirts on Mariupol. Terrifying footage also showed a number of Russian helicopters swarming towards the Ukrainian capital as they fired missiles at an airport. Western officials believe Russia intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban area but are yet unclear whether that will mean occupying the whole country, for which Russian forces don't yet appear to be ready. The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday that the situation in Ukraine was quickly deteriorating after Russia's invasion and pleaded with neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking protection. Poland is one country currently preparing hospitals to help Ukrainians who have been injured in the conflict. The nation had prepared a list of 120 hospitals where Ukrainians could be treated. Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine is ""putting up a real fight"" but added some places are proving difficult to defend. ""We are defending our land,"" he said. Earlier, Boris Johnson condemned Russia for unleashing a ""tidal wave of violence"" against Ukraine without provocation or credible excuse. ""It is an attack on democracy and freedom in East Europe and around the world,"" he said in a statement before addressing the country again this evening.

As Vladimir Putin’s forces swept westwards across the country, from the Russian-backed-separatist areas in the east, the city has come under more and more fire, with increasing reports of explosions from the area. It comes as a Russian helicopter was shot down in an air attack on a key Ukraine defence airport just outside Kyiv. Two attacking gunships were shot down as they approached Ukraine's capital city. They were destroyed near the Gostomel airport, an important airbase in Kyiv Oblast, the region surrounding, but not including the capital.

Not long after, reports emerged from Ukraine that the Russian army had entered Kyiv Oblast. Inside the city, shocking footage and photos have showed the plight of thousands of Ukrainians trying to flee the city. Traffic jams have stretched along roads and motorways as they sort to escape this morning before the Russian army swept in. This all comes on the first day of the Russian invasion into Ukraine. What began in the early hours of this morning may soon be over if the Russian forces can seize the capital. Even in the face of the Russian forces, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky spoke defiantly this morning, promising to fight Russia every step of the way.

In an address to the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that ""diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure"". Analysts believe the threat of deploying nuclear weapons should the Russian Army be attacked by forces outside of Ukraine was implicit in President Putin's speech.

Russian tanks have have also crossed the Ukrainian border via Belarus. NATO has now announced that it will take additional steps to strengthen the alliance's deterrence and defence and officials said it would hold an emergency summit of its 30 member nations on Friday. President Putin's chilling address was a stark reminder to the West of Russia's nuclear power. ""No one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor,"" he said in his speech that acted as a declaration of war on Ukraine. The invasion followed shortly after, leading to widespread horror and anguish as the human impact of the war began to take its toll. Nuclear options represent the most drastic weapon in the armoury of superpowers, and the decision to use them carries the gravest of consequences. While Russian nuclear weapons have the range to hit the UK, the possibility of nuclear weapons being used remains a long way off. That's because the devastation it could cause would outweigh any potential benefit from the mass destruction. Britain's nuclear deterrent is based in the Royal Navy and is in place to protect both the UK and its NATO allies. Harrowing photos from Russia's invasion have been shared across the world, with Ukrainian firefighters arriving to rescue civilians after an airstrike hit an apartment complex in Chuhuiv, Kharkiv Oblast. A cyclist also appeared to have been hit by an explosive and knocked to the ground.

Russian forces later attempted to take Chernobyl power plant, leading to Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy describing Moscow's action as a ""declaration of war"" against the whole of Europe. He tweeted: ""Russian occupation forces are trying to seize the #Chornobyl_NPP. Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated. ""Reported this to @SwedishPM. This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe."" The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday that the situation in Ukraine was quickly deteriorating after Russia's invasion and pleaded with neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking protection. Meanwhile General Sir Richard Shirreff, ex-deputy supreme commander of Nato, warned the UK may be dragged into the conflict if Russia continues its march west. He said: ""There is a possibility that we as a nation will soon be at war with Russia. We in this country must recognise that our security starts not on the white cliffs of Dover - it starts in the forests of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.""",17,2.678452094037585,2.40883699350875,0.26961510052883497,29
2022-02-24,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/uk-army-size-nato-vows-26318753,UK Army size as NATO vows response to Russia's 'full-fledged' Ukraine invasion,"NATO will send more troops to the Baltic states near Russia after Vladimir Putin began a “full-fledged invasion” of Ukraine. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg today said there will be “even more” soldiers “in the coming days and weeks” to protect the alliance of 30 nations, including Estonia and Latvia. He said today: “What we see now is a full fledged invasion of Ukraine from many, multiple directions, we see air, land and naval forces taking part…This is extremely serious.” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson slammed Russia’s ""tidal wave of violence"" which he described as an ""attack on democracy', saying the UK ""will always defend"" Ukraine's rights to sovereignty. Mr Johnson said: ""Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure."" But there is no suggestion that NATO troops will actually put boots on the ground in Ukraine, despite the invasion. Meanwhile, the unfolding war has prompted fresh questions about the size of the British Army and ongoing cuts to troop numbers. Here are some common questions answered on troop numbers in Britain, Russia and the NATO forward groups. As of 1 October 2021, the “trained strength” of the British Army is 77,526 personnel, 29,688 in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, and 29,913 in the Royal Air Force. That gives a total of 137,127 in the UK Armed Forces. This total will however be cut by around 2,000 to achieve a smaller Army as envisaged in ‘Defence in a Competitive Age’ command paper. The target is to cut the Army, which has already been slashed back, by nearly 5,000 to 73,000. The Navy and RAF would increase in size slightly, to 30,450 and 31,750 respectively. Infantry, the “close combat” troops at the “core of the Army” - some of whom are stationed in Estonia to protect NATO allies, are falling by a fifth. Tory ministers admit their numbers will drop from 24,940 in 2010 to 19,400 in 2024/25. Overall Army numbers are being cut as part of a long-term plan by the UK government to ‘modernise’ the military. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has claimed: “We will have a modernised fleet, it will have a modern soldier and I think it will be really quite exciting.” He added with investments in new technology, including to counter cyber-attacks, the Armed Forces can do “what it says on the side of the tin rather than boasts about having lots of people and actually equipment that is 20 years out of date”. But General Sir Richard Sherriff, a former deputy supreme commander of NATO Europe, told the BBC : “We in this country must recognise that our security starts not on the White cliffs of Dover but it starts in the forest of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. “That means we must really man the ramparts in Eastern Europe as an alliance. We should mobilise our forces such as we’ve got. ""I’m afraid the cupboard is pretty bare after the cumulative defence cuts over the last decade plus.” Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey told the Commons: “By the time of the next election we will have the smallest Army in 300 years.” Russia's army has about 280,000 personnel and its combined armed forces total about 900,000, according to Reuters. Its 2,840 battle tanks outnumber Ukraine's by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). A US intelligence assessment in December suggested Russia was amassing a force of up to 175,000 troops near Ukraine. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday that 165,000 Russian ""combat troops"" are ""on the edge"" of Ukraine, spread between ""more than 110 battalion tactical groups"". Western officials believe Russia intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban area. But they are unclear whether that will mean occupying the whole country, for which Russian forces do not yet appear to be ready. Likewise, Western officials are unclear whether Vladimir Putin intends Russia to rule Ukraine directly, or to replace the government in Kiev with a more favourable puppet regime. Western intelligence suggests Russian forces spilled over Ukraine’s border from multiple directions including from Russia to Donbas, from Belarus and from occupied Crimea. There was a cyber-attack on Ukrainian financial institutions last night, and a large number of missile strikes on Mariupol port this morning but no amphibious attack in the opening hours. Not all of the estimated 165,000 Russian troops that were amassed near the borders have yet invaded. But Russian special forces are thought to be flooding into Ukraine to soften up resistance, officials believe. The UK contributes troops to NATO battlegroups, which as of last March stationed around 5,000 personnel at bases in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (more below). Britain leads the battlegroup in Estonia and was due soon to have around 1,800 troops there, after it promised to double the number of UK forces in the country. As of March 2021 the UK had 828 troops in Estonia - including one armoured infantry battalion with main battle tanks and armoured fighting vehicles. The UK also had 140 troops in Poland - a Light Cavalry Squadron from the Royal Dragoon Guards, as part of a US-led force. Latvia’s battlegroup is led by Canada while Lithuania’s is led by Germany. These figures are likely out of date. US president Joe Biden said tonight: “Over the past few weeks I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to Nato. On Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action… I authorised the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s Eastern flank allies - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania.” He added: “Now I’m authorising additional US force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including US base forces… put on standby weeks ago.” NATO’s ‘forward presence’ troops have been stationed in member countries Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. NATO allies are also co-ordinating financial sanctions against Russia, while the UK and other allies are sending defensive lethal weapons and military support to Ukraine. However, Ukraine is not a NATO member - despite Putin’s claims that the alliance is expanding - and therefore is unlikely to have Western troops on the ground. This is a crucial distinction, because Article 5 of NATO’s charter - that all 30 member countries must respond to an attack on one member - only applies to member states. Speaking to the BBC on January 30, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg ruled out sending NATO ""boots on the ground"" in Ukraine. Again today he said there were no plans to do so. Asked on January 30 if we could see a scenario where NATO troops fight Russian troops in Ukraine, he replied: ""No. We are focusing on providing support to Ukraine."" He added: ""We have to distinguish between NATO allies and Ukraine. ""Ukraine is a partner. We provide support. We help them with modernising their defensive security institutions, NATO allies as the United Kingdom, United States, Canada are providing training. Thousands of Ukraine soldiers have been trained."" UK Defence Committee member Tobias Ellwood has said NATO forces should have been placed in Ukraine but “we blinked” and failed to do so.",29,3.195734692322598,2.9791582335766007,0.2165764587459975,10

Footage taken from a vantage point close to Ivano-Frankivsk airport shows the projectile streaking across the grey sky before exploding in a plume of fire on an already smoking building. The building bursts into flames before a large cloud of dark smoke rises over the central Ukranian city. Cruise missiles, guided bombs and GRAD rockets have taken out targets in cities across Ukraine. They have been aimed at airfields, military bases, ammo caches and command posts, but have also hit a least one civilian apartment block. Follow our live blog for updates on the invasion One particularly graphic piece of CCTV footage shows a cyclist being blown off her bike by a shell in the Cherkassy region in central Ukraine. A photo later emerged of a woman lying dead beneath a blanket, blood trickling out from its sides onto the streets below. The Russians appear to be making attempts to control the skies above Ukraine by taking out airports, among them Chuguyev airport near Kharkiv in the country's east. Airspace above Ukraine was shut down overnight, leading carriers including Ryanair and WhizzAir to halt services in and out of the country. Ukraine claimed that six Russian jets were shot out of the sky over the eastern Donbass region. Kyiv said that 50 Russian troops were killed in the attack. Russian strikes on airports do not appear to have been entirely successful, with an apartment block close to a runway in Chuhuiv in the north east seemingly hit by mistake. It was completely gutted by the blast which knocked out all the windows and tore down its balconies. Overnight deep thuds were heard in cities including Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city which sits on the eastern border. Footage reportedly taken in Hostomel, close to Kyiv, shows at least eight attack helicopters flying close to the ground as smoke rising around them. Missiles can be seen being fired off them into the ground below. Ukrainian officials said a Russian helicopter landing attempt was under way at the Hostomel military airport just outside Kyiv at around 11.30am GMT. Separate footage shows explosions hitting Svatove, a city in the east of Ukraine. Reports said the missiles had hit 'near' a warehouse storing Ukrainian army equipment. In addition to the air assault, ground forces have rolled in from Belarus, Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk. The attacks overnight has led Kyiv to declare a state of emergency across the country and to urge citizens to donate blood. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov on Thursday said that anyone who is ready and able to hold a weapon can join the ranks of the territorial defence forces, as the police said they would distribute weapons to veterans. Dmytro Kuleba, minister of Foreign Affairs for Ukraine, condemned the strikes early this morning. ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,"" he tweeted. ""Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. ""Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin.

An adviser to Ukraine's presidential office said more than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were dead and dozens wounded. It's after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine with explosions heard across major cities. Harrowing images have been shared of civilians fleeing the capital of Kyiv, as well as families taking shelter in basements and subways.

A cyclist was also hit by a shell in Uman, in the Cherkassy region and, according to reports, one civilian was killed with five others wounded. Police sources have reported explosions as air raid sirens sounded as far west as Lviv. Meanwhile, Russian troops are reported to be moving towards the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson Oblast. A resident of the town of Chaplynka in the region told the Kyiv Independent that the mobilised Kremlin troops moving through from the Russian-annexed Crimea include tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and multiple rocket launchers as terrified families seek cover. Ukrainian defence officials have also said that Kyiv's main international airport had come under a Russian bombing attack. President Volodymyr Zelensky quickly announced Martial Law across all territories and he has called for all Ukrainians to fight the invaders if they're able to hold weapons. Ksenya Michenka took cover with her teenage son in a metro station off Kyiv's Maidan Square and is reported as saying: ""We need to save our lives.

Troops have been seen streaming across the border following this morning's initial deadly aerial blitz. Their fearsome tanks, trucks and armoured vehicles - some marked with the distinctive ""Z"" symbol - have been seen storming into the nation from Crimea. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack on Chernobyl today was a ""declaration of war on Europe"" as his country tries to fight off Putin's invading forces. Now troops have been spotted flying their country's flag following Russia's major assault on the country. Follow the latest updates on the Ukraine and Russia situation in our live blog Four soldiers put on a show of strength as they paraded the red, white and blue striped flag on top of the power plant in Kharkiv, southern Ukraine. Russia is said to have surrounded its neighbours with around 200,000 troops. They earlier seized the Chernobyl power plant after a fierce battle near the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. It has now been claimed other vehicles crossed the border from Belarus marked with an ""O"". The ""Z"" symbol has already become a telling image of the early stages of the invasion. Various theories about the menacing markings have been aired since the symbol was spotted on Russian tanks and trucks which have entered eastern Ukraine. “It would suggest final preparations are complete,"" a military source explained. “It’s vital that any attacking force can be distinguished, particularly from the air where Russian forces will have complete control. “The Ukrainians have very similar tanks and vehicles and will want to reduce the risk of friendly fire,” they told The Sun. But Russia analyst Rob Lee believes the symbols may refer to ""contingents of the invasion force assigned to Ukraine regions"". Others, however, simply believe the Z stands for ""Zorro squad"". It could refer to a new unit or the whole invasion army. Putin has told allies of Ukraine who try to interfere that they will ""face consequences greater than any you have faced in history"", in a chilling warning, thought to be hinting towards his country's massive nuclear arsenal. President Joe Biden said additional U.S. forces will also be sent to Germany. “Our forces are not, and will not be, engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,” Biden said in an address tonight in the States. “Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our Nato allies and reassure those allies in the east.” Russian police have detained at least 1,000 people at anti-war protests in 47 cities. This afternoon, Ukrainian protesters hit the streets of London today as they pleaded with the UK to do more to stop Vladimir Putin taking over their country.

Last night Vladimir Putin announced he has launched a special military operation in the separatist east of Ukraine. Ukrainian citizens woke up to devastation and death this morning following the full scale invasion. Cities across the country were hit with shells overnight, with harrowing pictures showing bodies in the street and residential buildings destroyed. This morning attack helicopters flew over the capital, raining missiles down on the historic city. An adviser in Ukraine's presidential office says that there have been civilian casualties and that more than 40 soldiers have been killed. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates Officials said that five Ukrainians had been killed when a military plane was brought down in Ukraine. The attack led to strong condemnation from Western forces, which vowed to unleash crippling sanctions on Russia. Boris Johnson condemned Russia for unleashing a ""tidal wave of violence"" against Ukraine without provocation or credible excuse. Speaking in a rare national address, Mr Johnson warned the parents of Russian soldiers that their children would ""lose their lives"" and Moscow would achieve ""pariah status"". Earlier on this morning Ukraine foreign minister said that Russia has launched a ""full-scale"" attack and that the country will ""defend itself and win"". Ukraine is facing invasions on several fronts with Belarus having provided support for Russia from 5am, while there have also been attacks from annexed Crimea, according to Ukraine's border guard service. It added that assaults against border guard units and check points were under way using artillery, other military hardware and small arms in the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr. Missile strikes have been carried out on ""infrastructure and on boarder guards"" said the Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy who has declared martial law with air raid sirens heard ringing out on Thursday morning. He stated that he has already called on the world to use all possible sanctions against Putin. At around 9.30am President Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians with military experience to sign up to defence the country, while calling on civilians to give blood. The Russian Defence Ministry said the Russian strikes have ""suppressed air defence means of the Ukrainian military,"" adding that the infrastructure of Ukraine's military bases has been ""incapacitated"". It denied claims that Russian warplanes had shot down over Ukraine and four Russian tanks destroyed on a road near the eastern city of Kharkiv, killing 50 troops. And Russian-backed separatists are also claiming to have taken control of two in the Luhansk region, reported RIA. At the same time the Ukraine government has said that shelling has caused one dead and one wounded in Brovary in the Kyiv region. That death toll is almost certain to rise significantly as the day goes on. Missile attacks have hit major cities and troops have landed on the south coast of Ukraine, said officials, while the country has been hit by continual cyber attacks that downed government websites yesterday. Footage shows people leaving Kyiv in droves with chaotic scenes on roads packed full of cars as people flee. Residents in the city are being told to ""not panic"" and remain at home unless they have essential jobs, said the government.

""I will make an address to the nation this morning on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I will also speak to fellow G7 leaders and I am calling for an urgent meeting of all NATO leaders as soon as possible."" US President Joe Biden has called Russia's decision to commence a military operation in eastern Ukraine an ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"". He added the Putin had ""chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering"". Heartbreaking images of the early toll and loss are already emerging from the country showing the death and injury already inflicted. Photos circulating online show one woman's body lying in the street surrounded by blood and a man weeping above a corpse in rubble. Another shows a woman's bloody injuries in the same city. Ukrainian military command centres in the cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv have been attacked by missile strikes, the Ukrainska Pravda news website cited a Ukrainian interior ministry official as saying on Thursday. Regular blasts have been heard from the Ukraine capital Kyiv and the sound of gunfire came from near to the main airport of Boryspil in Kyiv. Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk have launched large-scale strikes against Ukrainian forces along the line of contact, Russia's Interfax news agency cited a separatist spokesman as saying. Amid the global condemnation, the EU's chief executive said she would present ""massive"" sanctions to the bloc for approval on Thursday February 24. She said: ""(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin is responsible for bringing war back to Europe."" She promised that new EU sanctions would block Russia's access to ""key technologies and markets"" and the Union would also freeze Russian assets in Europe and halt Moscow's access to European financial markets. ""We will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise... These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and on their ability to finance the war."" There are reports that Russian forces have destroyed or rendered unusable the Ukrainian navy, that included an amphibious landing from a tanker and helicopter aircraft took place near Odessa. Russia is targeting Ukraine's military infrastructure, air defence, and air forces with high-precision weapons and is not attacking Ukrainian cities, Russia's RIA news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying.

""We stand with Ukraine and we will work with our international partners to respond to this terrible act of (aggression)."" Putin has told the Ukraine army to lay down their arms in the area. It comes as Vladimir Putin said that Russia will carry out a special military operation in the Donbass and he has called on all Ukrainian soldiers to ""immediately"" lay down their weapons and go home, according to the Tass new agency. He claims that Russia is acting out of self-defence and told the Ukrainian military that their ""fathers and grandfathers"" didn't fight so they could help ""neo-nazis"". In a televised address early on Thursday morning, Putin said the action comes in response to threats coming from Ukraine. He added that Russia does not have a goal to occupy Ukraine, but said the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian ''regime''. Putin said Russia has been left with no choice but to defend itself against what he said were threats emanating from modern Ukraine. Putin also made an appeal to the Ukrainian military: ""I urge you to immediately lay down your weapons and go home. All servicemen of the Ukrainian army who fulfil this demand will be able to freely leave the combat zone and return to their families."" The scope of the Russian military operation in Ukraine was not immediately clear. A Reuters reporter in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, heard explosions which sounded like artillery shelling in the distance soon after Putin had finished speaking. Putin said Russia would respond instantly if any external force tried to interfere and that Moscow would try to de-militarise and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine. ""Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine,"" said Putin. Earlier US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he believes Russia will invade Ukraine within hours after separatists on Wednesday asked for Russian help to repel ""aggression"" and as explosions rocked the breakaway eastern city of Donetsk. Putin has said this week that he wants to take the important Azov sea port of Mariupol which deals with around half of Ukraine's steel and mineral exports, it is reported. Blinken told NBC News he expected Russian forces would attack Ukraine overnight although he still held out hope for diplomacy to pull Europe back from the brink of war. ""Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken said in an interview, adding he could not be precise about time or place. A pro-Ukraine rally was held in Mariupol on Tuesday night where people gathered to protest in the face of a Russian invasion, waving Ukraine flags. Separatists have requested help from Russia in the east of Ukraine and hours after the plea on Wednesday, at least five explosions were heard in the separatist-held eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk on Thursday morning. Four military trucks were seen heading to the scene, but the cause of the explosions was not known and it is feared that it was being used as ""false flag"" by separatists to give Russia an excuse to invade. Convoys of military equipment including nine tanks were seen moving towards Donetsk on Wednesday from the direction of the Russian border. Shelling has intensified in the east, where Putin has recognised two separatist regions as independent and ordered the deployment of what he called peacekeepers, a move the West calls the start of an invasion.",17,0.0,0.0,0.0,19

The attack, described by Boris Johnson as a ""vast invasion"", began early on Thursday with a series of precision missile strikes and air strikes followed by ground troops crossing the border. The first targets included Ukrainian air defences, designed to ensure Russia's aerial superiority in the conflict. Western officials have reported forces moving crossing over from Belarus, where they have been engaged in large scale exercises, and from Russian-occupied Crimea.

So far, officials say that it is unclear whether he intends to take control of the entire country. However they believe that his objectives include the capital Kyiv and the port city of Odesa as well as joining up Crimea, which he seized in 2014, with the Donbas. Ukrainian forces have been putting up resistance, with reports that at least one Russian warplane has been brought down. However analysts believe that the combination of aerial superiority, precision munitions and artillery firepower gives Moscow's forces a marked military advantage. The Russians are able to mass their troops in particular locations supported by overwhelming firepower whereas the stretched Ukrainians are trying to defend a large territory. Ahead of the invasion there were reports of cyber attacks overnight on a number of Ukrainian financial and government institutions, amid widespread suspicions that they were carried out in support of the attack. Officials believe that Russian special forces are now active inside Ukraine conducting operations to soften resistance in ahead of the main conventional forces advance. There are particular concerns now about the prospect of an assault on Kyiv, a city with a population of more than 2.8 million.
