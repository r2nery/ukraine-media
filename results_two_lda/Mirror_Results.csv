The gruesome discovery was made during a patrol of the city by the SBU secret service and national police officers, who were believed to have been tipped off by locals. In brutal conditions, the invaders interrogated “local patriots” who “refused to cooperate with the enemy”, said the Ukrainian government. The authorities said: “Kherson residents were interrogated and brutally tortured. During the inspection, torture law enforcement officers found objects that directly indicate signs of torture.” Among the sinister finds were gas masks and bottles of liquid which are now being analysed. Wall markings from inmates were used to count the days they were held for. They claim to have found 11 illegal prisons and four torture chambers in Kherson after it was liberated. More than 700 people have been reported missing. Interior minister Denys Monastyrsky said the investigation into crimes there had only just begun, ""so many more dungeons and burial places will be uncovered"". Writing from a detainee on the wall of the hell chamber says: ""Pray to God for us. God, give us strength. God, save and protect."" There was also evidence that the Russians sought to clear away evidence before they fled Kherson. “A series of investigative and operational measures are being carried out to document all the crimes of the occupiers, identify the culprits and bring them to justice,” said the Ukrainian government. The Ukrainian minister of internal affairs, Denys Monastyrskyi, also said in a TV interview broadcast on Wednesday that the bodies of 63 people who had been tortured were found in the Kherson region. He said exhumations were ongoing. Oleksandr Kuzmin said to the Washington Post he was held in the detention centre for a day, during which people he suspected to be FSB agents smashed his leg with a hammer. He said that in a room below his cell, he could hear people screaming in pain and a young man he shared a cell with had electric shocks by the Russians on his nipples and penis. The Washington Post revealed that prisoners were forced to say, “Hail Putin” or “Hail Russia” to receive meals. Russia this month staged a humiliating retreat by Vladimir Putin ’s forces from the provincial capital in the face of a powerful Ukrainian counteroffensive. A feature of Russian retreats has been the discovery of torture chambers used by the occupiers. Read more",45,0.0,0.0,0.0,9
2022-11-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/dnipro-missile-attack-caught-camera-28514253,Missile attack caught on camera as commuters in cars hit by huge explosion,"At least four people have been killed and more than a dozen others wounded in drone and missile strikes around Ukraine with one horror video showing the moment of a blast. Air raid sirens sounded all across Ukraine early Thursday as the Kremlin unleashed its sixth mass attack since early October. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a terrifying video that he said was one of the blasts in Dnipro. The video from a vehicle dashcam shows cars heading down a road on Thursday morning before a fiery blast engulfs a rainy road and a huge fireball explodes. The attack wounded at least 14 people, among them a teenage girl. Maria Avdeeva, Research Director at the European Expert Association in Ukraine, wrote on Twitter : ""The moment of explosion in Dnipro. People commuting to work in the morning. Currently, 14 are injured, including a 15-year-old girl."" In Kyiv, the city’s military administration said air defences shot down at least two cruise missiles and five Iranian-made exploding drones, but some missiles and drones still got through in Dnipro and Odesa. According to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Russian troops hit the building of the Pivdennyi Machine-Building Plant, Ukraine’s largest aerospace manufacturer. Dnipro mayor Borys Filatov said a city hall employee was caught up in this morning’s attack while out helping elderly women. He said the employee is being operated on and shrapnel was stuck in her coat. ""During today’s rocket (attack), she and her colleague were just doing their job. Helping infirm elderly women"", he said. Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, said a large fire erupted in Dnipro after the strikes on the city hit an industrial target. A Russian strike that hit a residential building also killed at least four people overnight in Vilnia in the Zaporizhzhia region. Zelensky said: ""This is another confirmation from Dnipro of how terrorists want peace. The peaceful city and people’s wish to live their accustomed lives. Going to work, to their affairs. A rocket attack!” State energy company Naftogaz said that the Russian missile strikes on Thursday damaged or destroyed some of Ukraine’s gas production facilities. “Currently, we know of several objects that have been destroyed. Others have suffered damage of varying degrees,” Naftogaz chief executive Oleksiy Chernyshov said. The strikes came on the same morning that the Black Sea grain deal was extended by 120 days with the efforts of Turkey and the United Nations. “Grain Deal will be prolonged for 120 days. Ukraine together with [UN Secretary-General] Antonio Guterres and [Turkish President] Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a key decision in the global fight against the food crisis. Waiting for the official announcement from partners – Türkiye and UN,” Zelensky said on Twitter. Read more",47,0.0,0.0,0.0,21
2022-11-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/poland-missile-attack-nato-jolted-28505698,NATO 'jolted into near-war catastrophe' after 2 killed in Poland missile strike,"This was the knife-edge escalation that NATO leaders have been bracing for over the past nine months of brutal warfare in Ukraine. Thousands of missiles have been fired at Ukraine, most of them aimed at and many of them hitting, civilian targets. Soon after a missile smashed into Przewodow, just inside Poland’s border, a flurry of calls were made between NATO’s 30 member states. Last night (15 November) a missile struck NATO -member Poland, killing two people, just outside of the rural Polish village - about four miles (6.4 kilometers) west from the Ukrainian border. While it appears to have been an ""unfortunate accident"", it currently is not known who fired the missile, or precisely where it was fired from. Following this, world leaders gathering at the G20 summit in Bali are attempting to diffuse a potential escalation in the months-long Ukraine war. Meanwhile, NATO ambassadors have also met in Brussels to assess how to react to Russia's war spilling over into a member state, with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg telling reporters: ""Let me be clear, this is not Ukraine's fault. ""Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine."" Poland immediately called for NATO article 4 escalation - a demand for NATO to meet and discuss how to react - but one step from article 5 and possible war. Unnamed US intelligence officials and others behind the scenes ignited the escalation, stating that it was a Russian missile, leaving the world on a knife-edge, fearing all-out war. Behind the scenes NATO analysts were examining spy plane records of missile trajectories and hoovered up communication between Russian commanders. They will have quickly established whether Russia deliberately targeted Poland, whether it was an Russian overshoot or if Ukraine’s air defences had overshot. As the intelligence analysts worked away Poland’s military mobilised to the border and was put on high-alert. But US President Joe Biden ’s swift casting of doubt on whether it was a deliberate Russian attack calmed the mood. In the cold light of day even article 4 now looks unlikely. The G20 summit means western ambassadors were able unofficially to meet and talk about early indications of what really happened, avoiding the need for article 4. It now appears one or two Russian-made S-300 air-defence missiles landed inside Poland, hitting a grain silo and killing two victims. These are ground-to-air weapons, similarly used by Ukraine, primarily used to intercept incoming missiles. But Russia, desperately short of missiles, has adapted S-300’s to be fired at ground targets and they are notoriously inaccurate. These are thought to have a range of little more than 300 miles so could possibly have been fired from a warplane launched from Russian ally Belarus. They can be adapted to fire further, with lighter warheads and boosters to lengthen their journey. The target would likely be Lviv, in western Ukraine, a hub for incoming supplies from Poland, including weapons, or an infrastructure site nearby. In one day alone a record 100 missiles were fired into Ukraine on Tuesday so Kyiv’s air-defences were working at breakneck speed to shoot them down. Even if the missile strike in Poland was an S-300 Ukrainian air-defence missile, as NATO now believed is likely, these weapons would not be fired without provocation from Russia. A Russian missile was very likely fired close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, triggering Ukraine’s air defences. So without Russian missiles piling into Ukraine at such a deadly rate two people in Poland would not have been killed and the west, including the UK, would not have been jolted into a near-war catastrophe. Even though the blast appears not to be deliberate and may indeed have been a stray Ukraine air defence missile it is still a Russian provocation testing NATO resolve.",49,0.0,0.0,0.0,7
2022-11-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-poland-says-deadly-missile-28505096,Poland says missile strike was 'unfortunate accident' but Russia still to blame,"Poland's president has said a missile blast that killed two people near its border with Ukraine appears to have been an ""unfortunate accident"" and not an ""intentional attack"". But ultimately responsibility lies with Russia, which launched a barrage of missile attacks on Ukraine on Tuesday, Andrzej Duda said. It was highly probable that the rocket, which was Russian-made, was used by the Ukrainian air defence. He continued: ""From the information that we and our allies have, it was an S-300 rocket made in the Soviet Union, an old rocket and there is no evidence that it was launched by the Russian side. It is highly probable that it was fired by the Ukrainian anti-aircraft defence."" The missile landed outside the rural Polish village of Przewodow, about four miles west of the Ukrainian border on Tuesday afternoon, killing two people. It came just hours after Russia launched a huge barrage of strikes on cities across Ukraine, plunging around 10 million people into darkness without power. Ukraine’s military said 77 of the more than 90 missiles fired were brought down, along with 11 drones. It marked the first time a NATO country has been directly hit during the almost nine-month conflict. Duda said “it was not an attack on Poland,” but added that Tuesday’s incident was a missile used for anti-missile defence, meaning it was used by Ukraine’s defence forces. Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary General of NATO, said the Polish missile incident demonstrates that the war in Ukraine “which is President Vladimir Putin’s responsibility – continues to create dangerous situations”. He continued: ""[The missile was] likely caused by Ukraine but not Ukraine’s fault. Let me be clear, this is not Ukraine’s fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine."" “Ukraine’s defence was launching their missiles in various directions and it is highly probable that one of these missiles, unfortunately, fell on Polish territory"", he said. If Russia had deliberately targeted Poland, it would risk drawing NATO into the conflict. Russia’s Defense Ministry denied being behind “any strikes on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish border” and said in a statement that photos of purported damage “have nothing to do” with Russian weapons. As a former Soviet-bloc country, Ukraine holds stocks of Soviet and Russian-made weaponry, including air-defence missiles. The Kremlin has accused some western countries, especially Poland, of reacting “hysterically” to the missile strike, but said in a rare show of praise that President Biden had shown restraint. Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of state news channel Russia Today, baselessly suggested that the UK could have played a role. She said: “This is either a Ukrainian mistake or a Polish provocation. Or British."" Germany said on Wednesday it could send its own warplanes to support patrols over Poland.

2022-11-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-deploying-missiles-close-28507025,Putin deploying missiles close to NATO borders is act of 'a fool or a madman',"Vladimir Putin's decision to launch missiles close to Ukraine's borders with NATO member states is a clear indication that the despot is either stupid or deranged. NATO leaders have spent the past two days on a knife-edge after a missile smashed into a farm in Przewodow, just inside Poland’s border, killing two elderly men last night. The missile was one of a flurry of an estimated 90 that bombarded Ukraine's energy infrastructure the same day. The nefarious targeting of Ukraine's electricity and water supplies has been branded a war crime and an attempt to commit genocide. But Putin's decisions may be the only choices he has left after a series of humiliating defeats on the battlefield. Professor John R Bryson, who teaches Enterprise and Economic Geography at Birmingham Business School, believes the warlord's actions are a clear indicator of his military ""failure"". He tells The Mirror: “Perhaps, targeting Ukraine ’s civilian infrastructure is the only option left for Putin in his failing Ukrainian war… this targeting is a crime against humanity, a climate crime and a war crime. ""Now is the time for all responsible nations to stand up and support Ukraine and to work to force Vladimir Putin to accept that he can never win his Ukrainian special operation, and in fact he has already lost.” He added that effective warfare involves strategically using scarce resources to defeat the enemy. In the case of the Russo-Ukrainian war, Putin has been ""extremely ineffective in finding and hitting critical Ukrainian military assets"". This has left him no other option than to target civilian infrastructure instead. He said: ""Now is the time for all responsible nations to stand up and support Ukraine and to work to force Vladimir Putin to accept that he can never win his Ukrainian special operation, and in fact he has already lost."" After much speculation and suspicions that the blast was caused by Russia, NATO's Secretary General revealed today it was most likely caused by a Ukrainian air-defence missile. Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Our preliminary analysis suggests the incident was likely caused by a Ukrainian air-defence missile fire to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian cruise missile attacks. ""But let me be clear this was not Ukraine's fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine."" With the blame still resting squarely on Putin's head, it's time for all responsible countries, including those who have steered clear of outright condemning the tyrant, to show a united front by beefing up Kyiv's war chest. Professor Bryson said: ""For the US and all NATO members now is the time to provide more funding and military hardware to Ukraine and to project a united front. ""The extent of this funding and military hardware should be such that Russia appreciates that there is no possibility that they can win the war with Ukraine. ""China and India are beginning to distance themselves from Russia, but it is time for both these countries to tell Putin that enough is enough. ""All responsible nations must declare that Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine is a crime against humanity and a climate crime and must work against Putin’s attempt to weaponize energy and food.""

2022-11-15,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/fears-war-ukraine-grind-through-28495391,Fears war in Ukraine will 'grind' on through next year despite weapons shortages,"Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine will “grind” on throughout next year even though both sides are rapidly running out of ammunition and weapons, it is feared. The two armies are now in a race against time as winter approaches to replenish ammo and weapons stocks amid fears Winter freezes will cause more battlefield casualties. Western officials also believe Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s brutal mercenary unit The Wagner Group is fast becoming part of Moscow’s regular military. Out of around 100,00 Russian troops currently fighting in Ukraine several thousand Wagner fighters - many of them ex-jailbirds- are on the frontline. And the west believes Wagner’s brutal, filmed “sledgehammer execution” of 55 year-old deserter Yevgeny Nuzhin was a warning to other recruits. Nuzhin changed sides as a defector and was then abducted and hammered to death by fighters working for Wagner, headed by Putin’s “chef” Yevgeny Prigozhin. The Wagner leader recruited many of his fighters from Russia ’s jails in return for clemency, despite their crimes, such as murder, kidnapping and robbery. It is believed Russia has just 120 Iskander missiles left and a mere month’s supply remaining of artillery shells available for the battlefield. Russia is also increasingly relying upon Iranian made, explosives -tipped Kamikaze drones, most of which are being shot down by Ukrainian defence systems. A Western official said: “Munitions supply is a big, limiting factor for both sides and that’s why we’ve seen the Russians going to great lengths to replenish. “The Ukrainians are doing the same thing. “We are still expecting to grind and it to be largely static, expecting neither side to win or lose and that extends all the way through 2023. “If people are expecting the collapse of forces on either side we can’t see anything which would indicate that from now through to the end of the year. “Neither side is in such a condition for their forces to collapse.” Officials said the horrific sledgehammer execution is likely to be probed as part of the near 40,000 alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces and their proxies. One said: “On the execution video - the use of a hammer as a tool is something which we’ve seen from Wagner before in the Syria conflict. “It’s absolutely messaging, aimed at the various people who have been conscripted and from prisons and from elsewhere - and the choices they will make. “It’s a brutalisation of war and I expect it’s an extra-judicial killing expected to feature in further investigations in due course.” The official added that the “Wagner Group now appears to be becoming more a part of Russian forces.” Even though fighting may slow down during the Winter freeze it may cause more deaths One source said temperatures are plummeting form 13 degrees to freezing and added that this will cut short the time needed to get casualties to aid stations, called the “Golden Hour.” The source said: “That impacts the golden hour - so we can expect more, more fatalities as a consequence of injuries on the battlefield.”",7,0.0,0.0,0.0,13
2022-11-15,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-kyiv-hit-missile-strikes-28496959,Kyiv hit by missile strikes as residential buildings seen burning,"Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of launching a barrage of strikes on civilian targets across the country, including in the capital Kyiv. Mayor Vladimir Klitschko reported two residential buildings were hit and Kyrylo Tymoshenko of the President's Office has shared a video of the aftermath of the strike with buildings engulfed in flames. The city of Kryvyi Rih, Poltava and Cherkasy regions have been hit, according to their respective city and regional heads. Hitting residential buildings constitutes a war crime and the barrage from Moscow’s depleting missile stock happened within hours of the Ukrainian President celebrating Kherson as akin to D-Day starting the end of World War II. The explosions sent plumes of smoke rising above the capital and sirens were heard across the city as medics raced to Kyiv’s Pechersk district, a wealthy area that is home to many embassies. At least four missiles were shot down over the capital, city officials said and the air attacks also smashed into targets in Lviv in the far west and Kharkiv — as the entire country was put on air-raid alert and braced for rising civilian casualties. On Twitter, it was claimed that Russia launched more than 100 missiles - targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure. At least one person has been killed after one missile hit a Kyiv building, the reports say. Electricity is out in half of Kyiv, 80 per cent of Lviv, as well as parts of Odesa, Mykolaiv, Dnipro. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget A Brink has described the series of attacks launched today by Russia on Ukraine as “another round of cruel attacks.” Several missile strikes also hit Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's native city and emergency services battled to rescue survivors. Both sides are now in a race against time as winter approaches to replenish ammo and weapons stocks amid fears Winter freezes will cause more battlefield casualties. It is believed Russia has just 120 Iskander missiles left and a mere month’s supply remaining of artillery shells available for the battlefield. Andriy Yermak, an adviser to President Zelensky wrote on Twitter: “Does anyone seriously think that the Kremlin really wants peace? It wants obedience. But at the end of the day, terrorists always lose.” A Western official said: “Munitions supply is a big, limiting factor for both sides and that’s why we’ve seen the Russians going to great lengths to replenish. “The Ukrainians are doing the same thing. We are still expecting to grind and it to be largely static, expecting neither side to win or lose and that extends all the way through 2023. “If people are expecting the collapse of forces on either side we can’t see anything which would indicate that from now through to the end of the year.

2022-11-15,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-russian-missiles-land-nato-27740368,Russian missiles land in NATO-member Poland killing 2 causing 'crisis situation',"Two Russian missiles have landed in NATO state Poland, killing two people and prompting a furious backlash from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky and western heads of state as Russia denied the reports. The rockets fell on a farm in Przewodow, a village in eastern Poland, close to the Ukraine border where they exploded around 3:40pm local time yesterday afternoon. It is not yet known if the strike was intentional or not. The Polish Foreign Ministry said a Russian produced rocket had hit a grain drying facility in the farm, and confirmed they had since summoned the Russian ambassador. Three US officials speaking anonymously on Wednesday morning said that preliminary assessments suggested a missile could have been fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian projectile, resulting in the explosion. The incident could have serious ramifications because of Poland's status as a NATO country, meaning it could opt to invoke NATO's Article 5 - which states an attack on one member state is treated as an attack on them all. But reports suggest that the 30 member states will meet tomorrow morning as Article 4 may be activated instead, allowing NATO members to bring issues of concern to the bloc for discussion. A press secretary for the Pentagon warned: ""When it comes to our security commitments and Article 5, we have been crystal clear: we will defend every inch of NATO territory."" US President Joe Biden, who was woken up by his advisors to inform him of the attack, has called Polish President Andrzej Duda to express his ""deep condolences"" for the loss of life. He later held an emergency meeting of G7 world leaders in Bali, and afterwards told reporters that ""preliminary information"" suggested the missile may not have been fired from Russia itself. ""I don't want to say that until we completely investigate, but it's unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia, but we'll see"", he added. Russia dismissed claims of an attack on Polish soil as a 'deliberate provocation' - but Ukraine said that it had warned of such an attack for a long time. At 8pm GMT, government ministers in Poland gathered to discuss the incident and raised the readiness of parts of the country's army as they continued to investigate throughout the night. Poland's Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, convened the Committee of the Council of Ministers for National Security and Defence Affairs ""as a matter of urgency"" this evening, government spokesman Piotr Müller confirmed. Müller did not immediately confirm the reports of the US intelligence official and said the meeting was being held due to a 'crisis situation'. He confirmed two people had been killed, and said Poland was looking into whether it could activate NATO Article 4 - an article that lets members bring any issue of concern to the table for discussion. This would trigger a meeting of all NATO members. Reports since have suggested that Poland will trigger Article 4 and bring together NATO's member states for a meeting over the incident this morning. Poland President Andrzej Duda also announced a further meeting of the National Security Council, which will be held at midday on Wednesday. The two people who were killed were said to have died at the scene following the impact of the rockets, thought to have happened some time yesterday afternoon. Initially, local fire services confirmed an explosion in the area but it later emerged that rockets had fallen there. Both Russian missiles, according to Mirror sources, were S-300 weapons and Polish fighter jets were scrambled from Tomaszow-Lubelski airfield. Images from the impact site of the rockets show burnt and twisted farm equipment, destroyed by the rockets and a huge crater in the ground. Another image shows a plume of smoke rising into the air after the attack. Further pictures show had large bits of metal debris thrown across the area. Reports suggest local residents heard two explosions when the rockets fell, and the area remains cordoned off as Polish authorities investigate. NATO's Article 5 focuses on the principle of collective defence, and that any of its members is duty-bound to come to the aid of any other under attack. The bloc itself says this focus on 'collective defence' is at the 'very heart of NATO's founding treaty'. Simply put, an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all NATO members. So a deliberate attack on Poland is an attack on the UK and US according to the treaty. Article 5 was last used in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack. Click here to read more about NATO's Article 5. Jens Stoltenberg, the General Secretary of NATO, said it was 'closely monitoring' the incident. He tweeted: ""Spoke with President Duda about the explosion in Poland. I offered my condolences for the loss of life. NATO is monitoring the situation and Allies are closely consulting. Important that all facts are established."" The British Foreign Office were also 'urgently seeking clarity' like many countries who are scrambling to confirm all the facts before launching any action against Russia that could lead to the escalation of the war. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: ""I have just spoken with the Foreign Secretary and Defence Secretary. We are urgently looking into reports of a missile strike in Poland and will support our allies as they establish what has happened. ""We are also coordinating with our international partners, including NATO."" Politico reported that US officials believed the explosion wasn't caused by the remnants of a missile shot down by Ukraine armed forces, but rather a deliberate strike or an errant missile. Following the deaths, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russian terror would only continue to spread. In a video message this evening, he said: ""Today, something that we have been warning for a long time has also happened. Terror is not limited to our state borders. Russian missiles hit Poland ... hit missiles on NATO territory. ""It's a matter of time before Russian terror goes further. The longer Russia feels impunity, the more threats there will be for anyone who is in range of Russian missiles."" One of Zelensky's advisors said the attack was a 'disguised mistake' and not an accident but a 'deliberately planned hello'. Lord Richard Dannatt, former head of the British Army, told Sky News: ""Modern technology is pretty accurate, so it's quite difficult to explain away that this might have been an accident. ""If it wasn't an accident then it was a test of the West's response, and that's something that's got to be thought through very carefully."" Latvia's Minister of Defence, Artis Pabriks expressed their condolences to Poland and blasted the Russian regime as 'criminal'. Scenes from the on the ground this evening show a heavy presence of emergency services at the rural town as Poland continues its investigation. The Estonian Foreign Ministry: ""Latest news from Poland is most concerning. We are consulting closely with Poland and other Allies. Estonia is ready to defend every inch of NATO territory. We’re in full solidarity with our close ally Poland."" The Russian Defence Ministry denied reports of the attack and claimed it had nothing to do with them. It said: ""Statements by the Polish media and officials about the alleged fall of 'Russian' missiles in the area of the settlement of Przewodow is a deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation. ""No strikes were made against targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border by Russian means of destruction."" Neighbouring Moldova was also affected by more Russian strikes today after their bombardment of Ukraine knocked out power to much of the nation. The Pentagon said it is looking into the reports around the explosion but could not currently corroborate them. Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder reportedly said: ""When it comes to our security commitments and Article 5, we have been crystal clear: we will defend every inch of NATO territory."" Lithuania's president echoed this message as well and Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said on Twitter that the agency had seen reports out of Poland and was working with the Polish government to gather more information. Poland plays a vital role in NATO supplies reaching Ukraine and Russia has warned in the past of its actions supporting Kyiv. Russian ally Hungary have also convened a meeting of his country's defence council after the explosion in the eastern Polish village led to crude shipments on the Druzhba pipeline being suspended. Germany, long criticised for not taking a hard enough line on Russia, spoke out on the attack as well. The country's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said: ""My thoughts are with Poland, our close ally and neighbor. We are monitoring the situation closely and are in contact with our Polish friends and NATO allies."" It is not known if the missiles were a purposeful strike or an unintended consequence of its missile strikes on Ukraine which included strikes on Lviv in western Ukraine, just 50 miles from the border. But the action comes during the ongoing G20 summit where Putin's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov is present after Putin snubbed the meeting. French president Emmanuel Macron said the G20 meeting would be an important moment to highlight what has happened in Poland. Since the attack, Russian markets have responded and are significantly down and when confronted on the allegations over the deaths, Kremlin spokesperson told ITV News that: ""Unfortunately I don’t have any information on that."" Today, Russia also pounded Ukraine's energy facilities with one of its biggest barrage of missiles yet, causing widespread blackouts. They fired at least 90 missiles, estimated to be worth approaching half a billion dollars in total, in the shocking attack - one of the largest of its kind since the war began in February this year. Zelensky said around ten million Ukrainians were left without power, including most of the city of Lviv and the entire Kharkiv region.",49,2.9118002119808417,4.187614082966695,-1.275813870985853,7

Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces made the claim on Monday after revealing 71,200 of Vladimir Putin 's soldiers were estimated have died since the invasion started in February. A total of 950 of these had been killed on Sunday alone, they said, as Volodymyr Zelensky ’s forces continue to advance on the key southern city of Kherson. The latest count brought the number of Russian soldiers taken out by Ukrainian forces in October up to 12,730, an average of 400 day. It came as the UK Ministry of Defence reported that many reservists sent by Moscow from the recent mass mobilisation were suffering from a lack of equipment and preparation for combat. A tweet on the MoD's official Twitter account @DefenceHQ on Monday said: “ Russia has deployed several thousand newly mobilised reservists to the front line in Ukraine since mid-October. In many cases they are poorly equipped. “In September, Russian officers were concerned that some recently mobilised reservists were arriving in Ukraine without weapons.” Open-source images purportedly showed Russian soldiers had been equipped with AKM rifles - an outdated weapon first introduced in 1959. Many of these were likely given to them in ""barely usable condition following poor storage"", the ministry added. It comes after a series of explosions struck Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine yesterday morning as Russian forces restarted missile barrages on civilian areas following recent setbacks. Smoke could be seen rising above Kyiv after about 10 explosions, witnesses said. New leaked footage taken back in Russia meanwhile shows a bloody fight between ""drunk"" Russian soldiers and high-ranking military intelligence officers. The conscripts are from the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, based in Yurga, Siberia, who are undergoing training ahead of deployment to the frontline in Ukraine. The bloody fight indicates the chaotic reality of Vladimir Putin ’s mobilisation drive for the war, as mayhem is seen breaking out among dozens of reservist troops. Putin’s army intelligence and military police are seen dragging troops away from a bloody brawl.

Witnesses described hearing the blasts this morning in the Ukrainian capital while regional authorities in northern, eastern and central Ukraine also reported similar attacks. Russia has increased strikes in recent weeks after blaming its former Soviet ally for the explosion that damaged the Crimean bridge. Smoke could be seen rising above Kyiv after about 10 explosions, witnesses said. Ukrainians have been warned to remain in shelters. Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's chief of staff, wrote in messaging app Telegram: ""Russian losers continue waging war on civilian facilities."" Oleg Nikolenko added: ""Russia is not interested in peace talks, nor in global food security. Putin’s only goal is death and destruction."" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said there is no water supply or electricity in parts of the capital. Have you witnessed these attacks? Let us know in webnews@mirror.co.uk Reports suggest there were further electrical blackouts in other areas targeted by the attacks. Ihor Terekhov, the Mayor of Kharkiv, said his city has been struck by two missiles which targeted ""a critical infrastructure facility"". A video taken from inside a moving car showings a huge line of black smoke billowing from the Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Plant after it was reportedly struck. Air defence systems are understood to have fended off strikes in some areas. At least a dozen cruise missiles have been reported in the airspace above Ukraine with an air alert for the entire territory in place. A video purportedly shows Ukrainian air defences stopping a missile above Kyiv. Oleksii Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said reassured the Ukrainian people the country's air defence was 'working out' the targets. He added: ""Stay in shelters!"" Olena Halushka, a board member for Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Centre, tweeted: ""Another Monday, another Russian attempt to throw us into darkness and cold. ""In the last hour Russia attacked infrastructure in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia & Cherkasy regions, two latter are partly cut off from electricity. ""In other cities attacks were stopped by air defence systems."" Security expert Maria Avdeeva tweeted: ""Russia is again massively attacking civilian infrastructure throughout Ukraine. ""Kyiv - partial blackout and water shortages. Kharkiv - metro stopped. Cherkasy region - partial blackout. Zaporizhzhia - power outages. New launches reported.""

Major General Kyrylo Budanov has claimed Putin, 70, is unlikely to last until the end of the war and that discussions are already taking place for him to be removed from power. The claim comes as Russian forces continue to suffer major setbacks with Ukrainian forces pushing them back into the east of the country. Major General Budanov even claimed that Ukraine is aiming to recapture Kherson by the end of November. In a claim which would have been unthinkable at the start of the war, he then told The War Zone that Ukraine would even attempt to take back the Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukrainian successes — or Russian failures — have since made this a possibility, though the war is far from over despite Ukraine's counteroffensive. Major General Budanov outlined what Ukraine could potentially consider to be an endgame to the war. He said that the restoration of Ukraine's borders in 1991, when it first became independent, could be a good position from which they would look to end the war. For Putin however things may not turn out quite so rosy, with 'active discussions' about his replacement now said to be in full swing. Major General Budanov said: ""It's unlikely that he survives it. And currently, there's active discussions happening in Russia about who'd be there to replace him."" Ukraine recently launched a counteroffensive eastwards which is now seeing Russian forces retreating as Ukraine looks to recapture the city of Kherson. With the Russian army in open retreat in many areas, Putin has already had to resort to conscripting male civilians, a move which has seen an exodus of men of fighting age attempting to flee the country. Putin has even made thinly veiled threats of nuclear retaliation if NATO escalates its involvement in the conflict.

The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK & world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis. You can sign up here. While any threat of this magnitude is grave, it could also be an act of desperation amid growing unrest within Russia, though Putin's media campaign within Russian-controlled territory remains relentless. However, the war is far from over and while Ukraine has made massive gains there is still no guarantee of victory. Putin's threats of nuclear escalation remain, as well as the question of who would replace him if he were toppled and how their approach to the war might differ.

Russia said on Friday it had finished calling up reservists to fight in Ukraine, having drafted hundreds of thousands in a month and sent more than a quarter of them already to the battlefield after a divisive mobilisation campaign that was its first since World War Two. But despite the conscription, Russian forces are still unable to make a notable breakthrough on military lines in the east of Ukraine. British intelligence has said that Russian troops have taken up a “defensive posture on most areas of the front line in Ukraine” with units being largely undermanned. And Zelensky has said that Russian forces are trying to turn the Kherson region into an uninhabited area with mass theft of medical equipment and ambulances. Ukrainian troops are gathered in force near Kherson, in the south of the country, prompting Russian-installed officials to evacuate many residents. Kherson is one of the four regions Moscow claims as part of Russia. ""The occupiers have decided to close down medical institutions in towns, take away medical equipment, ambulances, everything. They are putting pressure on doctors who still remain... to move to the territory of Russia,"" Zelensky said. ""Russia is trying to make the Kherson region a no man's land,"" he added, saying pro-Moscow forces realised they could not hold onto the city and were therefore taking what they could. Ukrainian officials have regularly accused retreating Russian troops of widespread looting. It comes as the Ministry of Defence has stated that Russian units are badly undermanned with as few as six men in some companies where there should be 100. It tweeted: ""Russia has likely augmented some of its units west of the Dnipro River with mobilised reservists. However, this is from an extremely low level of manning. ""In September 2022, Russian officers described companies in the Kherson sector as consisting of between six and eight men each. Companies should deploy with around 100 personnel. ""In the last six weeks there has been a clear move from Russian ground forces to transition to a long-term, defensive posture on most areas of the front line in Ukraine. This is likely due to a more realistic assessment that the severely undermanned, poorly trained force in Ukraine is currently only capable of defensive operations. ""Even if Russia succeeds in consolidating long-term defensive lines in Ukraine, its operational design will remain vulnerable. To regain the initiative, it will need to regenerate higher quality, mobile forces which are capable of dynamically countering Ukrainian breakthroughs and conducting their own large-scale offensive operations.""

The Ukrainian leader went on to add that in total, Moscow has carried out some 4,500 missile strikes and over 8,000 air raids on Ukraine. Pictured in Kyiv, the president stood next to a fallen Shahed-136 drone, which has reportedly been sent to Russia to by Iran be used against Ukrainian positions. Speaking from the Ukrainian capital city, Zelensky went on to pledge to ""clip the wings"" of Moscow's air power following a series of attacks on his land. He added: “Enemy planes will fall. Enemy helicopters will fall. ‘Shaheds’ will fall.” Western officials believe that Iran has supplied a number of drones to Russia - but Moscow and Tehran have continued to deny these claims. The Shahed-136 drones have become a key weapon in Russia's arsenal during the war, and have been employed more frequently recently; to destroy critical infrastructure, leaving millions of Ukrainians with limited power supplies and with low water supplies just as temperatures are beginning to drop. The president's comments come after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Russia's aggressive use of drones ""appalling"". Blinken, a top US diplomat, has accused Vladimir Putin' s war commanders of using the devices to ""kill Ukrainian civilians"" and completely destroy the infrastructure they rely on. At a joint press availaibility with Canadian Foreign Minister, Mélanie Joly, Secretary Blinken said in full: ""The Iranian regime has also provided the Kremlin with drones and assisted Russia in their use –drones that are being used to kill Ukrainian civilians and destroy the infrastructure they rely on for electricity, for water, for heat. ""It’s appalling, and Canada and the United States will keep working with our allies and partners to expose, to deter, and to counter Iran’s provision of these weapons."" Western countries have claimed that Iran is supplying its domestically developed drones to Moscow, with assertions that Iranian military experts are on the ground in Russian-occupied Crimea to provide technical support to pilots. However, Tehran has repeatedly denied that it has struck any arms deal with the Kremlin. Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Wednesday has called the accusations ""baseless"" and urged Ukraine to ""present any evidence supporting the accusations"". Amir-Abdollahian added: ""If... it becomes clear to us that Russia has used Iranian drones in the war against Ukraine, we will definitely not be indifferent about this issue."" The kamikaze Shahed-136 drones are said to have a range of around 2,500 kilometres and can carry warheads weighing between five to thirty kilograms. The a small aerial target flies mainly at low altitudes, and because it has a maximum speed of 185 kilometre per hour, it is seldom detectable on radars. And as reported by EurAsian Times, the Shahed-136 kamikaze drones have become a significant challenge for the Ukrainian Armed Forces as the Russian military have successfully conducted swarm attacks using these particular drones. They are known as ""kamikaze"" drones because they are destroyed in the attack - named after the Japanese fighter pilots who flew suicide missions in World War Two.",49,3.164967206993015,2.4137730784833007,0.7511941285097143,13

Hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up this weekend to the sound of artillery and power outages, as air defence shot down incoming Russian drones. Ukraine's air force command reported that 33 missiles pounded the country on Saturday morning and that 18 of those had been shot down by air defence systems. It said it was a ""massive missile attack” targeting “critical infrastructure."" Presidential advisor Kyrylo Tymoshenko said that as of Saturday afternoon, more than a million people across the country were without power, with 672,000 of those in the western region of Khmelnytskyi alone. The city council in Khmelnytskyi urged residents to store water ""in case it's also gone within an hour"". In the city of Lutsk in western Ukraine, a missile hit a power plant, causing a blackout in part of the city, the mayor, Ihor Polishchuk, said on Telegram. The blast wave damaged a private home and injured at least one person, he said. Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state grid operator, warned that the “scale of damage is comparable or may exceed the consequences of the attack on October 10 - 12”, which left 30 per cent of the country without power. It said it would begin to limit the supply of electricity to homes in the capital and four regions of the country due to the recent attacks, to lower the pressure on the grid and give workers time to repair the damage. With winter fast approaching, Russian forces have been targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in a bid to leave millions cold and in the dark in a country that can plunge to colds of -20. The United Nations has said that under international humanitarian law, attacks on civilian infrastructure are prohibited. ""Combined with soaring gas and coal prices, they expose millions of civilians to extreme hardship and even life-endangering conditions this winter"", it continued. Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to the Ukrainian president, has accused Moscow of trying to “provoke new refugees” to flee to Europe by targeting the energy supplies. While foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the attacks constituted genocide. ""Deliberate strikes on Ukraine's critical civilian infrastructure are part of Russia's genocide of Ukrainians,"" Kuleba wrote on Twitter. Secretary of State Antony J.

Footage, which was filmed by a Ukrainian drone, shows the two Russian soldiers carrying the washing machine out of the house and across the front lawn before pausing when they reach the gate to the property. They can then be seen taking the machine through the gate before they change sides and carry it down a dirt road for a short while. The pair then reach the Russian military vehicle with a large white 'Z' symbol on the back of it. The 'Z' is one of the symbols, as well as the letters 'V' and 'O' that can be seen painted on Russian military vehicles taking part in the invasion of Ukraine. Two soldiers can then be seen loading the washing machine into the Russian military vehicle. They can then be seen returning to the house, going back through the gate and across the lawn as the footage ends. The images were obtained from the Office of Strategic Communications (StratCom) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Friday, October 21, along with a statement. It said: ""The second army of the world - the first army of looters conducted a special operation to free a washing machine from its owners. Every criminal will inevitably be punished."" Images and statement were also relayed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The footage was also shared on Reddit where people joked that Russian soldiers had obviously never seen a washing machine before. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"". Today marks the 240th day of the war. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that between 24th February and 21st October, Russia had lost about 66,750 personnel, 2,573 tanks, 5,258 armoured combat vehicles, 1,648 artillery units. It also claims Putin's regime has lost 372 multiple launch rocket systems, 189 air defence systems, 269 warplanes, 243 helicopters, 1,325 drones, 329 cruise missiles, 16 warships, 4,006 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 147 units of special equipment. Russia has claimed that its casualties have been much lower but provides infrequent updates on its latest figures. The White House has said that Iran has increased its involvement in Russia's invasion of Ukraine by giving technical support to Russian forces operating Iranian-made drones to bomb civilian targets. John Kirby, of the White House's National Security Council, said on Thursday Iranian advisers were in Crimea to provide the Russian military with training and maintenance. The United Kingdom is applying new sanctions to three Iranian individuals and to a business for supplying Russia with drones to attack Ukraine. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement that by providing drones to Russia, Iran is ""actively warmongering, profiting off Russia's abhorrent attacks on Ukrainian citizens, and adding to the suffering of the people and the destruction of critical infrastructure."" The European Union agreed to apply sanctions against the same business and the three individuals shortly before the United Kingdom's announcement. Iran has denied supplying drones to Moscow and the Kremlin has accused the West of trying to put ""pressure"" on Iran. British intelligence has said Russia's recent admission a ""difficult situation has emerged"" in the Kherson region shows Russian authorities could be considering withdrawing their forces from the area west of the Dnipro River. Ukraine has begun restricting electricity supplies across the country, beginning at 7am on Thursday. Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said over 300 attacks by Russia had destroyed a third of all power plants across Ukraine. Zelensky said citizens need to prepare for ""rolling blackouts"". The UK Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, revealed a Russian aircraft released a missile near a British plane that was patrolling over the Black Sea, in international airspace, on 29th September. Wallace told the House of Commons that the Russians had attributed the incident to a ""technical malfunction"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday Russian President Vladimir Putin is using energy and hunger as weapons. But he added he has failed to break the West's unity and will not achieve his war aims through scorched earth tactics. Scholz told the German Parliament: ""We will not let Moscow's latest escalation go unanswered. Scorched earth tactics will not help Russia win the war. They will only strengthen the unity and resolve of Ukraine and its partners.""

Cities across Ukraine once again woke up to the sound of shelling as power and water supplies were knocked out in at least four cities on Tuesday. The 263,000 residents of Zhytomyr have been left without water and electricity after a series of missile strikes, the city's mayor said this morning and officials in Dnipro said a facility had been seriously damaged. Since October 10, Ukrainian officials estimate around 30 per cent of the country's energy infrastructure has been destroyed, causing mass blackouts. In the southern Ukrainian port of Mykolaiv, a missile slammed into an apartment building killing at least one man, a Reuters witness said, and blasts were heard and smoke seen rising in Kyiv, the capital. There were also reports of power facilities being targeted in the city of Kharkiv, a city with a pre-war population of 1.43 million people, close to the Russian border. Smoke was seen rising from the nation's capital of Kyiv as a building was hit in the north of the city, officials said. An advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks prove Russia's genocidal intentions for the Ukrainian people. In a Tweet, Mykhaïlo Podoliak wrote: ""Civilian infrastructure attacks, mass executions and raping, forced deportation, families separation, literature destruction in schools, 'dismantling of Ukraine ' official statements."" Tagging US lawmaker Steve Cohen he added: ""@RepCohen is right: Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine. This must be officially recognized."" Zelensky also accused Russia of terrorising and killing civilians with the aerial bombardment today. The fresh bombings came a day after drone strikes killed at least four people in cities including the capital, Kyiv. ""Ukraine is under fire by the occupiers. They continue to do what they do best - terrorise and kill civilians,"" Zelensky wrote on the Telegram messaging app. There was no immediate word on how many people had been killed in the strikes. Russia carried out its latest strikes on Tuesday after the United States warned it would hold Moscow accountable for any war crimes. Moscow denies targeting civilians. Its defence ministry has said it is carrying out attacks on military targets and energy infrastructure across Ukraine using high-precision weapons. In the port city of Mykolaiv, a Reuters witness said they had heard three explosions in the early hours of Tuesday. A missile had completely destroyed one wing of a building in the downtown area, leaving a massive crater, they said. A fire crew was seen pulling the dead body of a man from the rubble. ""In Mykolaiv, the enemy destroyed a residential building with S-300 missiles. A person died. There was also a strike at the flower market, the chestnut park. I wonder what the Russian terrorists were fighting against at these absolutely peaceful facilities?"" Zelensky said. The Russian strikes are said to be retaliation for a blast at the start of October on a bridge linking mainland Russia to Crimea - the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the explosion that damaged the Kerch Bridge, but Ukrainian officials celebrated the blast on social media.

Chechnya war veteran General Sergei Suvorikin’s troops have stepped up attacks on Ukraine’s power and war supplies whilst smashing missiles and kamikaze drones into residential areas. Suvorikin’s appetite for unleashing banned weapons on residential areas in war-zones has heightened fears he may carry out Putin’s threat of using weapons of mass destruction. An early morning blitz on a Kyiv power plant and water and energy supplies throughout Ukraine left hundreds of thousands stranded and huddled in air-raid shelters. Similar blasts in Dnipro, Mykolaiv and Zhytomyr left the threat of blackouts throughout Ukraine, lack of heating and water facing already terrified residents. One security source said: “There is a change in the type of attacks now as the Russian step up even further their attempt to dismantle infrastructure. “As winter sets in this will have serious consequences for the civilian population and Russia obviously feels Suvorikin is the man to carry out this campaign. “Strategically the aim is to terrorise the entire country as militarily Russia is failing in the east and southern frontlines.” Three people were killed in Kyiv and several others elsewhere in Ukraine amid fears of a mounting death toll from waves of Iran-supplied Kamikaze drones. It is believed Russian President Vladimir Putin installed violence-obsessed Suvorikin in a desperate bid to cower the country’s civilian population. The 55 year-old - who also served in Afghanistan and Syria- is also suspected of launching chemical attacks in Syria and is a Putin appointee. And it is believed he was recently installed as in charge of the Ukraine campaign because of his ruthless reputation for targeting civilians. Russian forces carried out fresh air strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities on Tuesday, causing several explosions in an area of northern Kyiv, possibly on a thermal power station. City mayor Vitali Klitschko said the attack was on ""critical infrastructure"" in northern Kyiv. President Zelensky said: ""Ukraine is under fire by the occupiers. They continue to do what they do best - terrorise and kill civilians. ""The terrorist state will not change anything for itself with such actions. “It will only confirm its destructive and murderous essence, for which it will certainly be held to account."" Two air strikes hit an energy facility in the southeastern city of Dnipro, leaving a raging fire. An air strike left the northern city of Zhytomyr without water and electricity supplies, its mayor said, and a Russian missile struck an apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv. The missile completely destroyed one wing of the building in the downtown area, leaving a large crater, killing one person so far. Zelensky added: ""In Mykolaiv, the enemy destroyed a residential building with C-300 missiles. “A person died.

""Currently, according to the energy ministry, 1,162 settlements remain without power."" Power and water have been cut off in the city of Zhytomyr. Meanwhile, a Russian missile sparked a fire at an energy facility in the city of Dnipro. Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said the body of an elderly woman had been found under the rubble of a building destroyed by a Russian ""Kamikaze"" drone yesterday. It is believed Moscow has ordered more than 2,000 of the Iranian-made Kamikaze drones. Fears are mounting that Russia will deploy them in “swarms” in a bid to beat Ukraine’s air defences. The Kremlin also took delivery of Fateh-100 and Zolfaghar ballistic missiles from Tehran, delivered in a heavy transport II-76 Iranian cargo plane. Explosive-tipped Shahed-136 drones smashed into Kyiv on Monday, setting buildings alight, killing three and sending residents dashing into shelters. The port of Mykolaiv was also attacked by drones as Russia launched airstrikes on Odesa and up to 16 cruise missiles were fired from the Black Sea. One drone that piled into Kyiv was marked “For Belgorod” - indicating it was in revenge for attacks on facilities in the town at the weekend It marked the second horror barrage in as many weeks - after months during which air attacks had become a rarity in central Kyiv. By midday a swarm of at least 28 drones had been sent against the capital, many of them shot down in what Kyiv's Mayor Mr Klitschko dubbed: “Terrorism.” Energy facilities were struck, and one drone slammed into a residential building, killing three people, authorities in Kyiv said. Intense, sustained bursts of gunfire rang out as the aircraft buzzed overhead, as soldiers tried to shoot them down. Five drones plunged into Kyiv itself, said Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. Three bodies were recovered from the rubble, including those of a woman who was six months pregnant and her husband, said Mr Klitschko. The other person killed there was an older woman. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “The whole night, and the whole morning, the enemy terrorises the civilian population. “Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine. The enemy can attack our cities, but it won’t be able to break us.” A photo of debris from one of Monday’s strikes, posted by Mr Klitschko, showed the word Geran-2 marked on a mangled tail-fin.

The United States warned last week that the Islamic Republic of Iran had ramped up arms deals with the Russians as Vladimir Putin's soldiers continue to burn up supplies. Weapons said to have been sold to Putin include so-called kamikaze attack drones, as well as the first reported Iranian-made surface-to-surface missiles. Russia is estimated to have lost 6,000 pieces of military equipment during the war and is ""expending munitions at an unsustainable rate"", US intelligence director Morgan Muir said. Reports of a deal have been denied by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who said his country “has not and will not” supply weapons for either side in the Ukraine conflict. Quoting the contents of his phone call with Portuguese Foreign Minister, the foreign ministry said: “We believe that the arming of each side of the crisis will prolong the war, so we have not considered and do not consider war to be the right way either in Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria or Yemen.” The denial comes after the Daily Mirror last week revealedIranian troops had secretly entered the Ukraine frontline after being signed up by Putin's army. Up to 50 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) specialists were reportedly sent to the southern and eastern front along with hundreds of Shahed-136 drones. Ukrainian artillery and drone teams have recently destroyed one Shahed-136 base in southern Ukraine, according to Kyiv sources. They have been based in Dzankoi in Crimea and Kherson in the south, where one IRGC team has already been destroyed. One Ukrainian military source told the Daily Mirror: “At least one of the Iranian training teams has been hit recently and they are actively being hunted down. “We have been concerned for some time that IRGC specialists are helping Russia in their terrible attacks on civilians and they are of course being targeted.” Shahed-136 drones are 11ft-long, can travel at 100mph and carry an explosive warhead in the nose which can be devastating when fired.

Writing on social media, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said several residential properties had been damaged in the blasts and rescue teams had been deployed. He wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “The explosion in the Shevchenkiv district - in the centre of the capital. All services follow in place. Details later. The air alert continues. Stay in shelters!” Officials in Kyiv say that by 9 am local time a total of four strikes had hit the city, with the potential for more strikes to hit. Power outages were reported in the surrounding area shortly after and a high-rise residential building was also reported to have suffered damage from a Shahed-136 drone hit. Ukraine's first deputy minister of foreign affairs, Emine Dzheppar, shared an image of the debris from one of the Shahed-136 drones that hit Kyiv today. The blasts were followed around an hour later by what was thought to be Ukrainian defence trying to shoot down more incoming drones or missiles with surface-to-air defences. “At the scene of the first attack. Could hear the incoming roar and then an explosion. Ukrainian air defence was firing on it. Incredibly tense moment, sending police scattering and people running for shelter,” Christopher Miller, a correspondent for the Financial Times, wrote on Twitter from Kyiv. The Shevchenkivskiy district, a popular student area, was also damaged last week in the most intense bombings of the Ukrainian capital since the early days of the war. Russia ordered a huge aerial offensive against cities across Ukraine in retaliation for a blast on a bridge linking mainland Russia to Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A total of 19 people were reported to have died following the explosions. Ukraine has reported a number of Russian attacks with Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks. The drones are 11ft-long, can travel at speeds of 100mph and carry an explosive warhead in the nose which can inflict devastating damage on settlements. Reports of a deal with Russia have been denied by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who said his country “has not and will not” supply weapons for either side in the Ukraine conflict. The topic is due to be discussed by European Union foreign ministers in a meeting in Luxembourg today. Elsewhere, Russian and Ukrainian forces continued to fight heavily around Ukraine's eastern Donbas region over the weekend. Donetsk and Luhansk, which are now claimed by Russia following their annexation claim last month, saw scenes of gunfire as enemy forces faced off.",47,2.2174203440300797,2.842915767281711,-0.6254954232516314,21
2022-10-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-threatens-equip-belarusian-warplanes-28254767,Russia threatens to equip Belarusian warplanes with nuclear missile capability,"Vladimir Putin will equip warplanes in Belarus with nuclear missile capability in his latest escalation of the war in Ukraine. The bold proposal comes as the Russian President hopes to respond to a string of military setbacks and a chaotic mobilisation programme with new 'defensive' measures aimed at projecting strength against the West. Belarus has moved closer into the war effort over recent days after President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, suggested without evidence that Ukraine had been planning military strikes against his nation. And on Saturday, the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed Belarusian Su-25 planes would soon be equipped with nuclear-capable missiles - although said this had not yet taken place. If delivered it would mark a major step for Belarus's air force and military, which is small by the standards of most nuclear powers. Belarus's defence ministry meanwhile confirmed on Sunday that around 9,000 Russian troops would be stationed in Belarus as part of a ""regional grouping"" of forces. Valeriy Revenko, head of the defence ministry's international military cooperation department, wrote on Twitter : ""The first troop trains with Russian servicemen who are part of the (regional grouping) began to arrive in Belarus. ""The relocation will take several days. The total number will be a little less than 9,000 people."" Lukashenko earlier confirmed he would be deploying troops from his own country to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and Western backers. It raises the prospect of a joint Russian-Belarus offensive in the north of Ukraine, with some in the country now fearing the imposition of a Russian-style draft of fighting-age men. The autocrat leader suggested Belarusian involvement was justified due to supposed threats from the Ukrainian military, saying: ""Strikes on the territory of Belarus are not just being discussed in Ukraine today, but are also being planned. ""Their owners are pushing them to start a war against Belarus to drag us there."" He added that Belarus had ""been preparing for this for decades"" and ""if necessary, we will respond"". Belarus's army contains approximately 60,000 people and earlier this year, Belarus deployed six battalion-tactical groups, totalling several thousand people, to the border areas.",7,4.959339923888119,3.731059901088893,1.2282800227992259,25
2022-10-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-has-now-lost-28254422,Vladimir Putin 'has lost more soldiers in Ukraine war than US did in Vietnam',"Russia has now lost more soldiers in Ukraine that the US did in the Vietnam war, it has been reported. About 65,000 of Putin 's soldiers have died so far according to estimates from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The latest estimate from Kyiv was shared on a Facebook post which included a tally of Russia's supposed casualties. As of today (October 16) ""about 65,000 (+300) persons liquidated"", said the statement. The sum is reported to be around 10,000 more than officials from Ukraine estimated last month on September 21, reports the Star. If the unverified figure is accurate, it means that Russia's death count after eight months would be beyond what the US's was during their battle in Vietnam. The shocking figure would equate to what was more than a decade of fighting, reports Newsweek. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund listed that, 58,281 Americans died while battling in the war. However, it is hard to know the exact number for sure as the Kremlin rarely addresses the figures in the public domain. Putin's country has before questioned Ukraine's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu about their supposed figures. It comes after it was alleged last month that 5,937 soldiers had been pronounced dead since Russia declared war on Ukraine. It has been reported that the US has made few observations on the number of casualties in Zelensky's country. At the start of August, the US approximated that 70,000 to 80,000 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded during the bloodshed. Professor Michael Clarke, from the Department of War Studies at King's College London, disputed Moscow and Kyiv's estimations. He explained: ""[The] Russian '5,000+' number is completely unrealistic. The Ukrainian number is probably too high, but may not be too far off the mark when all the evidence gets sifted."" He believed around 30,000 to 40,000 people had been killed under the Russian flag in Ukraine. The visiting professor stated that many of Russia's wounded die ""because they get no proper treatment and tend to be left to die on the battlefield unless the Ukrainians get to them early."" It has been reported that the amount of Ukrainian troops that are dead also remains unclear. According to the head of Ukraine's armed forces, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, almost 9,000 military personnel had died by August 22. Furthermore, the UN has confirmed 6,221 civilian deaths in Ukraine as of October 9.",7,4.299775303895392,4.533546242994121,-0.23377093909872926,5

Russian missiles smashed into more than 40 cities yesterday killing 13 civilians and injuring 37 in what one expert called “moronic” attacks. The Kremlin forces launched cruise missiles, air-to-surface bombs, drones and even anti-aircraft guided missiles. Now the UK is to rush the Advanced Medium Range Air To Air Missiles defence rockets, capable of blowing cruise missiles out of the sky. The AMRAAMs are part of a massive defence package – including artillery guns and drones – to be used as Putin seeks revenge for a blast Kerch Bridge linking Ukraine with annexed Crimea. Britain’s missiles will be fired using US-supplied NASAMS ground-to-air firing systems by Ukraine’s anti-missile teams. Defence secretary Ben Wallace, ahead of yesterday’s NATO meeting in Brussels, said: “ Russia ’s indiscriminate strikes on civilian areas in Ukraine warrant further support. “These weapons will help Ukraine defend its skies from attacks.” Use of anti-aircraft weapons on ground targets is a sign Russia is running out of missiles. A British security source said: “Putin’s generals must be becoming frustrated at this monstrous targeting of civilians. “Apart from the cruel nature of these attacks, there is no strategic value in killing non-combatants. “It’s just an attempt to bow Ukraine with terror. As a military strategy while losing a war,it is moronic.” NATO allies met to thrash out plans to beef up Europe’s air defences. Seven people died in overnight shelling of Mykolaiv as an S-300 missile hit a five-storey building. Ukraine has reported a spate of the Shahed-136 drones, some believed to have been fired from Belarus. And more horrifying evidence of Russian atrocities emerged with reports Moscow’s troops had planted land mines around civilian mass graves in Kharkiv. Alexander Venediktov, deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council, chillingly tried to warn Kyiv against trying to fast-track into NATO, claiming: “Such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to a World War Three.”",49,3.329438462040331,3.554726311265633,-0.22528784922530187,7

Heartbreaking images show the team rescuing injured 12-year-old Artem from the debris before he is put on a stretcher and carried to an ambulance. Ukrainian emergency services said that seven people could still be trapped in the debris almost 24 hours after the blast on Wednesday night. Footage shows the crew ushering others to safety while they worked to free little Artem who became trapped after his home was hit by a Russian missile. Workers inflated a device to ease the pressure from some of the debris on top of the boy and propping up a collapsed part of the building with various tools before the boy was freed. An aerial view of the building shows how the missile almost cut it in two. The images were obtained from the State Emergency Service (SES) of Ukraine for the Mykolaiv region on Thursday. A spokesperson said: ""Footage of the rescue of twelve-year-old Artem, who was buried under rubble as a result of an enemy rocket hitting a five-story residential building in one of the city's districts. ""The guy was under the rubble for more than 6 hours. All the time, he bravely held on, listened to all the advice of the rescuers, who tried in every way to support him, while carrying out emergency work. ""At 7.50am, units of the State Emergency Service unblocked Artem. He is currently hospitalised in a medical institution. ""Doctors are conducting examinations and providing assistance. We believe that everything will be fine with Artem."" In a separate statement, the SES of Ukraine told of enemy shelling in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine near the Black Sea. ""A five-story residential building was destroyed. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, a child was rescued,"" they said. ""On October 13, around 1.25am, the Russian occupiers once again launched rocket attacks on the city of Mykolaiv, previously with S300 air defence missiles. ""One of the rockets hit a five-story residential building in one of the districts of the city. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest - under rubble."" The 12-year-old boy was rescued and handed over to doctors by 8am, the organisation said. ""According to preliminary information, there may be seven residents of the five-storey building under the ruins of the building, with whom there is currently no communication,"" they added. ""Rescuers are searching for them and analysing the destroyed structures. ""To provide assistance to the local population, volunteers of the Red Cross Society of Ukraine are working on the spot, emergency medical teams, law enforcement officers and emergency teams of the city are involved."" Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"". Today marks the 232nd day of the war. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that between February 24 and October 13, Russia had lost around 63,800 personnel, 2,511 tanks, 5,167 armoured combat vehicles and 1,556 artillery units. Some 357 multiple launch rocket systems, 183 air defence systems, 268 warplanes, 240 helicopters, 1,182 drones, 316 cruise missiles, and 16 warships have also been reported lost. Russia has claimed that its casualties have been much lower but provides infrequent updates on its latest figures. The General Assembly of the United Nations has overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine, with 35 countries abstaining, including Pakistan, South Africa, India and China. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine” and Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s “attempted illegal annexation”, which he announced last month. Ukrainian military has announced that it has recaptured more territory near the southern city of Kherson. It is understood that five settlements in the Beryslav district of the north-eastern part of the Kherson region have been recaptured including Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, and Chervone. NATO allies have delivered new air defence systems to Ukraine after Russia launched a wave of missile attacks across the country, targeting civilian areas.

2022-10-13,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-ukraines-plan-use-crowdfunded-28231018,Ukraine's revenge plan using crowdfunded kamikaze drones after Russia bombings,"Ukraine has launched an ingenious campaign to get revenge after brutal Russian attacks across the country this week. Kyiv and a number of other cities were subject to devastating attacks this week that saw dozens left dead. But in response, one Ukrainian politician launched a crowdfunding campaign that has seen them raise almost £9million to buy up kamikaze drones to inflict damage on Russian forces. These drones are similar to Iranian-built drones that Russia used to bomb Ukraine ’s cities and inflict severe death and destruction just this week. The fundraiser raised a massive £8.7million, which meant they could buy an initial 50 Ram II drones which each carry a 3kg explosive payload. Serhiy Prytula, who organised the initiative, said further munitions would be bought over the coming days as well. He said: “They wanted to scare us but we united even more. Remember: never infuriate Ukrainians. Never. The people have donated for the revenge, so we will ensure the revenge happens.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, told G7 leaders on Tuesday that Russia had used a variety of munitions to strike Ukrainian cities over the previous two days, killing 20 people. He said: “The enemy has used more than 100 cruise missiles, dozens of different drones, including Iranian Shaheds. “And every 10 minutes I receive a message about the enemy’s use of Iranian Shaheds.” The Shahed-136 drones are similar to the Ram II in that they are not designed for a return trip. Whilst some have questioned their effectiveness, they have been deployed against Ukraine in recent days, causing particular damage in Zaporizhzhia . Regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said the drones had been used to target infrastructure within the city as a part of a wider strike that left 11 dead. The Ram II drones have already proven effective during Ukraine’s ongoing efforts to repel the brutal Russian invasion. Footage shared on social media shows one destroying a Russian 9k33 Osa surface-to-air missile system reportedly worth £634,000. Serhii Sternenko, an activist who co-founded the crowdfunding exercise, which was closed after 26 hours, said £24,507 had been donated in the first seven minutes of the appeal. He said: “Crowdfunding campaigns make our defence stronger; we, the people, help the Ukrainian army. But we still need more weapons from our allies to stop this terror and the crime of genocide Russia commits daily in this European country.” The news comes after a bloody week of fighting in Ukraine. The weekend first saw the bombing of a bridge in Crimea that linked it to Russia. The attack was considered a blow to Putin and in response Monday began with a number of Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, waking up to heavy bombings. More hellish footage emerged from the Ukrainian capital of wounded civilians and burning cars and buildings. Read more",49,3.7482186436232925,3.4842021795976077,0.2640164640256848,13

The country’s general staff said the helicopters, believed to be two-seat Soviet era Ka-52s, were attacked by missiles between 8.40am and 8.58am local time. The official page of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine tweeted: “Productive morning, Ukrainian style. “Today, in just 18 minutes, service members of #UAarmy shot down 4 Russian helicopters that were spoiling beautiful autumn skies in the south of Ukraine. No place for Alligators here. The local climate is hostile towards them.” Ukraine's Air Force said on Telegram that the aircrafts were likely ""providing fire support to the ground occupation troops in the southern direction."" The claims were partially confirmed by pro-Russian sources on the Telegram messaging app. The post also said that there is a high probability that the toll of confirmed downed helicopters could increase. According to the Ukrainian military's estimates, Kyiv's forces have destroyed around 235 enemy helicopters and 268 aeroplanes since the war broke out in February. The news came as Britain's Ministry of Defence announced it would supply air-to-air missiles to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian cruise missiles. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said: “ Russia ’s latest indiscriminate strikes on civilian areas in Ukraine warrant further support to those seeking to defend their nation. ""So today I have authorised the supply of Amraam anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine. These weapons will help Ukraine defend its skies from attacks and strengthen its overall missile defence alongside the US Nasams.” The first arrival of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany also came this week, as well as an “expedited” delivery of the advanced surface-to-air missile systems from the US. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov tweeted: ""A new era of air defence has begun in Ukraine. Iris-Ts from Germany are already here. Nasams are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more.” The influx of weaponry from western nations came in the wake of intense missile firing on cities across Ukraine on Monday. Russian President Putin launched a missile and drone barrage in some of the most brutal attacks since the start of the war. Out of 83 Russian (and Iranian imported) missiles fired, 45 were shot down but if Ukraine had more air defence systems then the 15 or so deaths may have been prevented. At least seven people died yesterday when Russia shelled a market in the town of Avdiivka, in Donetsk, officials said. “There is no military logic to such shelling,” Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regional governor, said.

The 'Z' is one of the symbols, as well as the letters 'V' and 'O' that can be seen painted on Russian military vehicles taking part in the invasion of Ukraine. Images then cut to a Russian soldier who appears to have been the one driving the vehicle, crouching in the road behind the remains of the armoured personnel carrier, apparently in shock.

Ukraine ’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said a wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities by Russian forces had targeted energy supplies in a move chosen to inflict cause as much damage to civilians as possible. Russia fiercely shelled central Kyiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Lviv in some of the most intense blasts to hit Ukraine since the early days of the war. Preliminary reports suggest that at least 19 people died and around 90 were injured, as children on their way to school were sent running for shelter. In a statement, Zelensky said: ""The morning is difficult. We are dealing with terrorists. Dozens of missiles, Iranian 'Shahids.' They have two targets. Energy facilities – throughout the country. Kyiv region and Khmelnytsky region, Lviv and Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Frankiv region, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy region, Kharkiv region, Zhytomyr region, Kirovohrad region, the south. They want to panic and chaos, they want to destroy our energy system."" Despite Russia’s claims it has attacked strategic military targets, blasts around four key cities left large parts of Ukraine with blackouts and water shortages. Authorities in Kyiv reported damage to facilities and power lines in 12 regions of the country, out of 27 in total. Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesman for the UN Human Rights Office, warned the recent strikes ""amount to a war crime."" She continued: ""Damage to key power stations and lines ahead of the upcoming winter raises further concerns for the protection of civilians and in particular the impact on vulnerable populations."" Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said: ""These are war crimes planned well in advance and aimed at creating unbearable conditions for civilians."" He said it was part of a ""deliberate strategy"" by Moscow as winter approaches. UK Security Minister Tom Tugendhat branded the strikes on Ukrainian cities ""war crimes"" while Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said they were ""unacceptable"". Shevchenko Park in central Kyiv, one of the city’s busiest parks usually packed with people and street musicians, was obliterated in the blasts.

World leaders continue to fear Vladimir Putin will unleash atomic warheads on the war-torn country as his “special operation” continues to flounder. It has been suggested Putin could launch tactical nuclear weapons which are smaller and designed for use on a battlefield. Despite that they are still incredibly destructive and can detonate with the force of between 1 and 100 kilotons, compared to strategic nukes which are even greater. To lessen the shock factor on the Russian people a number of experts have been wheeled out who have told newspapers and television studios the impact would be “minimal”. In actuality, thousands would potentially be killed within a radius of several kilometres should Putin decide to press the button. They have been told the explosion would be smaller than the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, with an expert saying they are “attempting to fool Russians into thinking this is a small step, not a giant leap towards Armageddon”. Nuclear weapons expert Igor Nikulin told Russia ’s biggest newspaper, pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda the chances of such use by Russia were now 50-50 in Ukraine. Nikulin, a former member of the UN Disarmament Commission and ex-adviser to the UN Secretary General, made it sound as if there would be nothing abnormal should Putin pull the nuclear trigger. He said: “If the West does not calm down and reason with its vassals, we will have to reason with them “If they decide to launch a large-scale offensive and we do not have the strength to repel it in some area, we will have to calm them by other means.” “A tactical nuclear charge gives a small shock wave and the radioactive contamination is also relatively small. “The main damage is from ionising radiation which burns out all electronics. “All this American equipment that was delivered to Kyiv will stop working and we will be able to …successfully attack.” “A simple example - if you blow up such a charge in Moscow's Southern Butovo, the windows in Northern Butovo won't even crack.” “On islands like Bikini, where the Americans and the French detonated an atomic bomb, rats reproduce perfectly there. “From the point of view of radiation contamination, the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant gave a greater negative effect than the likely impact of the use of the nuclear weapons now being discussed.” Nikulin was ALSO asked About the effectiveness of concrete shelters. “Quite effective. Even trenches in the ground are very effective. He explained: “They helped save many lives in Hiroshima. Any shelter reduces the risk of radiation and heat damage.” “When using tactical nuclear weapons, the radiation is not the same as, for example, when released from … Chernobyl. “According to Soviet standards, within an hour after a nuclear strike, our troops had the opportunity to go on the offensive in the zone of use of tactical nuclear weapons, because the main damaging factor there is not radiation nor shock wave, but ionising radiation.” He also advised nuclear winter would not follow such an attack. Military analyst Mikhail Tymoshenko, a retired Russian colonel, told the same newspaper that the radius of damage from such a Putin tactical nuclear missile would be little more than one kilometre. He added: “The civilian population should act on the principle of if you're warned, it's your responsibility to shelter.”",7,5.656735464964467,3.915091629010602,1.741643835953865,11

Repeated threats from within Russia that nuclear weapons could be used has stoked fears in the West. The number of NATO warships in the North Sea has been doubled to 30 with a focus around key infrastructure after recent suspected attacks on vital gas pipelines. It remains unclear who was behind explosions last month affecting gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea. Moscow has denied any involvement and pointed the finger at the United States. Thankfully NATO has not noticed any change in Russia's nuclear posture following the threats, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday. Stoltenberg also said NATO allies would meet any attacks on critical infrastructure with a ""united and determined response"". The alliance will proceed with its annual nuclear preparedness exercise ""Steadfast Noon"" next week - in which NATO air forces practise the use of US nuclear bombs based in Europe with training flights - without live weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to leaders of the Group of Seven nations for more air defence capabilities after a string of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. On Monday, dozens of strikes killed 19 people, wounded more than 100 and knocked out power supplies across the country in Moscow's biggest aerial offensive since the start of its invasion on February 24. The strikes came days the partial destruction of the Kerch bridge, which connects Crimea to mainland Russia. The bridge became a symbol of Russia's commitment to the annexed territory. Ruling out peace talks with Putin, Zelensjy told G7 leaders: ""When Ukraine receives a sufficient quantity of modern and effective air defence systems, the key element of Russia's terror, rocket strikes, will cease to work"". On Tuesday the first of four IRIS-T air defence systems sent by Germany arrived in Ukraine and the White House later said it was speeding up the shipment of sophisticated NASAMS air defenses. Washington has provided more than $16.8 billion worth of security aid to Ukraine during the war. The G7 nations, (the US, Germany, France, Japan, Britain, Italy and Canada) have pledged to Ukraine continued ""financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support...for as long as it takes"". It also condemned ""indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations"" as war crimes and said Putin would be held to account for them.",49,3.406899287618835,2.755535942622283,0.6513633449965521,7

The air strikes by cruise missiles and explosive drones also wounded over 100 people as the West accused Vladimir Putin of targeting civilians. In Lviv, 30% of the city was affected by power cuts and thousands were left with no water after three explosions. Ukraine ’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said today's bomb strikes on power and water infrastructure were “war crimes” which aimed to create “unbearable conditions for civilians”. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg accused Russia of “horrific and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and critical infrastructure”. Military expert Professor Michael Clarke told Sky News: “The Russians are condemning the Ukrainians to a pretty miserable existence in the winter.” The West is scrambling to supply more air defence systems to Ukraine with Germany and the US promising weapons within hours of the Lviv attack. Streets in Kyiv were largely deserted as air-raid sirens blared at the start of rush hour today, and thousands took shelter in underground bunkers. Kyiv resident Viktoriya Moshkivski, 35, and her family were among hundreds waiting for the all-clear in the Zoloti Vorota station, near a park bombed on Monday. She said: “Putin thinks if he scares the population, he can ask for concessions, but he is not scaring us. He is p***ing us off.” In Zaporizhzhia, missiles have struck apartment blocks overnight at least three times in the past week, killing civilians as they slept. A missile also hit Vinnytsia in central Ukraine, injuring three people and seriously damaging critical infrastructure. Ukraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Yevheniy Yenin said: “They’ve hit many [targets] yesterday and they hit the same and new ones today.” He said hundreds of settlements around Kyiv, Lviv and elsewhere were without power. But as many as 20 Russian cruise missiles and 13 explosive drones were blown out of the sky. Iranian-made Shahed drones have been sent from Russia to Belarus, which is forming a joint military brigade with Russia, but its 50,000 troops are badly trained and equipped. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine would fight on. He said: “We will make the battlefield more painful for the enemy.” The air strikes, seen as revenge for an explosion on Kerch Bridge linking Russia to Crimea, come as Russian troops are being beaten back in the east and south. Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of the UK’s listening station GCHQ, said his organisation was “very proud” of the role the UK had played in Ukraine’s defence. He told the BBC that Russia was running short of munitions and troops and GCHQ would expect to see indicators if Putin was considering deploying its nuclear arsenal in the war. Ukraine today called on Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi to take “all possible measures” to free the deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after he was kidnapped by Russian forces. Putin today met United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Saint Petersburg. The Sheikh said he had “affirmed” the UEA’s aim to “reduce tensions and find diplomatic solutions to crises” in situations such as the war in Ukraine. Russia faces a UN vote condemning its annexation of four Ukraine regions this week.

2022-10-11,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/poland-tells-citizens-flee-belarus-28207627,Poland urges citizens to flee Belarus now as bomb shelters checked for readiness,"Poland has advised its citizens to immediately flee Belarus after President Alexander Lukashenko announced a 'joint military task force' with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday fired 83 missiles at what he claimed were military, energy and communications networks in Ukraine for the first time in months. However, Kyiv said that the missiles actually hit civilian areas, large power plants, and tragically killed at least 19 - wounding many more. Blasts were also heard in the cities of Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and in the western city of Lviv, and the strikes in Kyiv were the most central to hit the capital. Putin's blitz on Ukraine comes as the largest barrage since the opening day of the war - the 24 February 2022. Now in a shock to his country, dictator Lukashenko, 68, has announced that his own units will combine with Russian forces and deploy to the Ukrainian border. The tyrant also accused Kyiv of planning to attack, with help from allies Poland and Lithuania. Warsaw then went on to urge its Polish citizens in Belarus - a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Ukraine to the south and Poland to the west - to flee the country as relations have become increasingly tense. The Polish government wrote on its website: ""We recommend that Polish citizens staying on the territory of the Republic of Belarus leave its territory with available commercial and private means."" In 2021, relations between Warsaw and Minsk deteriorated after Poland accused its eastern neighbour of orchestrating a migrant crisis on its border. Relations have become even more strained since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lukashenko's decision comes after one of Putin's staunchest allies warned that the huge missile barrage unleashed on Ukraine is only the 'first episode' of Russia's revenge for the Kerch Strait Bridge - also known as the Crimea Bridge - over the weekend. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, has warned that Ukraine poses 'a constant, direct and clear' threat. He went on to add that the Kremlin should aim to ""completely dismantle the political regime of Ukraine"" which he described as 'Nazi'-like. Despot Lukashenko now appears to be laying out the groundwork to join the war following yesterday's attacks, despite his country only acting as a staging ground for Russian attacks on Ukraine. He announced that Putin's troops would combine with his own, and would deploy to the Ukraine border. Reportedly, in June this year, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus announced that it is planning to increase its army to a stronghold of 80,000 people and will be equipped with military equipment that is 'currently in storage', according to Pravda. In fear over what this may mean to its citizens, Polish interior minister Maciej Wasik responded on Monday that his government is now checking the condition of its bomb shelters to make sure they are fit for purpose. Wasik went on to say that this move is merely 'routine' and is not a response to Russia's bombardment - although, according to Reuters, the process of checking the shelters will last for up to two months. The minister told private broadcaster Polsat News: ""We have 62,000 such facilities across the country. ""Firefighters are checking their condition, whether they are equipped, and whether they are fit for use. If not, we will take steps to adapt them."" However, he shockingly added that Warsaw is preparing for the 'darkest scenarios' - even if there is only a 'small probability that they will occur'. NATO member Poland has however reassured its citizens that its place in the alliance guarantees their safety from Russian attack, but they need to be prepared for the possibility of a missile strike. Meanwhile, US President Biden has condemned the widespread missile attacks in Ukraine in a statement. He said that the strikes targeted innocent civilians and served no military purpose, saying: ""The United States strongly condemns Russia's missile strikes today across Ukraine, including in Kyiv. These attacks killed and injured civilians and destroyed targets with no military purpose. ""They once again demonstrate the utter brutality of Mr. Putin's illegal war on the Ukrainian people."" Since the invasion of Ukraine began, the United States has provided more than $16.8 billion (£14 billion) worth of U.S. security assistance, with Biden stating that his country are committed to stand behind the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. In his statement, Biden continued to say: ""These attacks only further reinforce our commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. ""Alongside our allies and partners, we will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression, hold Putin and Russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes, and provide the support necessary for Ukrainian forces to defend their country and their freedom.""",4,3.204615664186099,2.5456637606181594,0.6589519035679396,7

Witnesses reported three explosions in the city shortly after noon local time (0900 GMT). The blasts left 30 per cent of the town temporarily without electricity, according to the city's mayor Andriy Sadovyi who announced the news on Telegram. He added that the water supply had also been disrupted in two of the city's districts. The head of the Lviv Regional Military Administration, Maksym Kozytsky, noted on Telegram that an attack was carried out on a power facility in the Lviv region. “Lviv and the Lviv region: possible power outages. Once the alarm is over, we will engage all services to quickly resume network operation. Stay in shelters, the threat is still ongoing,"" Kozytsky said. Similar strikes had hit the same electricity supply centre on Monday. City authorities said late on Monday that power had been largely restored in the region, but Ukrainian Deputy InteriorMinister Yevheniy Yenin said some settlements in the region were still without electricity on Tuesday morning. It comes as Russia stages a huge military response to the bombing of the Kerch Bridge on Saturday, when a truck bomb exploded taking with it a huge chunk of the 12-mile road and rail link between Russia and its annexed territory, Crimea. The bombings began at around 8 am yesterday, during the rush hour, as schoolchildren and other civilians dodged the raining missiles to find shelter. This morning Ukraine's emergency services annnounced at least 19 people were killed and another 105 wounded during yesterday's assault. One pro-Putin military expert warned Russia's bombing of Ukraine could go on all winter and plunge the country ""back into he 19th century"". Kyiv and other cities across the country are being fiercely shelled in the most intense blasts to hit the Ukrainian capital since the early days of the war. Britain's top cyber spy said today that Britain would expect to see indicators if Russia was starting to consider dyploying its nuclear arsenal in its war with Ukraine amid clears and claims the despot could press the button. After more than seven months of war, Jeremy Fleming, director of the GCHQ spy agency, told BBC Radio that Russia was running short of munitions, friends and troops. Putin has so far stayed within established military doctrine of not using nuclear weapons, Fleming said, but his agency would be looking out for signs that this could change. ""I would hope that we will see indicators if they started to go down that path,"" he said, without saying what those indicators could be. ""But let's be really clear about that, if they are considering that, that would be a catastrophe in the way that many people have talked about"". Fleming also said he was sure Putin was worried about the dangers of escalation and that might be a sign of why ""he hasnot reached for these other forms of waging war"". In a speech due to be delivered later on Tuesday, Fleming will also say that Russians were beginning to understand thedesperate situation Moscow is in over the conflict. ""They're seeing just how badly Putin has misjudged the situation,"" he will say, according to excerpts from his speech. ""They're fleeing the draft, realising they can no longer travel. They know their access to modern technologies andexternal influences will be drastically restricted. And they are feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war ofchoice."" But pro-Kremlin pundits have hit back at Western claims that Moscow is running low on missiles. Kindergartens in Russia's Maria El republic are reportedly open round the clock so parents can work night shifts at secret defence plants to supplying weapons' manufacturers. Speaking on state-owned Channel 1 TV, military expert Yuri Podolyaka said: ""We can certainly easily, without a particular strain on the stockpile, sustain [Monday's] level of intensity. ""Up to 100 launches have reportedly been made so far - but Kyiv will certainly not be able to cope with it."" Read more",47,2.3248712635483044,2.414082995429785,-0.08921173188148046,13
2022-10-10,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putins-brutal-new-right-28198454,Putin's 'brutal' new right-hand man with bloody past linked to Ukraine bombings,"Vladimir Putin ’s “brutal” new war commander Sergei Surovikin is believed to be responsible for today’s horrific bombing of Ukrainian cities. General Surovikin, 55, is a “totally ruthless” military commander with a history of indiscriminate bombing and little regard for civilian casualties, according to experts. The British Defence Ministry said the General's career “has been dogged with allegations of corruption and brutality."" Some say his appointment on Saturday is part of the reason why the attacks in Ukraine on Monday were so brutal. At least 10 people have died, but the true toll is believed to be higher, in the horrific attacks which were some of the worst in the seven months since the war began. In televised remarks, Russian President Putin said Moscow had launched long-range missile attacks against Ukraine's energy, military and communications infrastructure on Monday in retaliation for an attack on the bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula over the weekend. Mr Surovikin has previously been found guilty of stealing and selling weapons and was also sentenced to prison but then let off following allegations that he was framed. The general, born in 1966 in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, has twice been in jail after soldiers under his command killed three demonstrators in Moscow during the August 1991 coup that preceded the end of the Soviet Union and its repression. He was later released without trial. In 1995, he received a sentence – later overturned – for the illegal arms trade. Commanding troops in Chechnya say he was remembered for stating his intent to kill three insurgents for each of his soldiers who they killed “During his service in the Urals region Surovikin was involved in numerous scandals,” said a 2012 report in Nova Region. He also commanded Putin’s troops in Syria culminating in his award of the Kremlin’s highest medal - Hero of Russia. The general was accused of overseeing a brutal bombardment that destroyed much of the city of Aleppo in Syria and a report by Human Rights Watch listed him as one of the commanders “who may bear command responsibility for violations” during the 2019-2020 offensive in Syria’s Idlib. Surovikin’s command in Syria also coincided with the Khan Sheikhoun Sarin nerve agent attack, which killed 90 civilians and injured over 500 people. The appointment on Saturday came after two Russian senior military commanders were sacked as Kyiv has made impressive gains in clawing back territories lost to Russia in the northeast and south of Ukraine. “Surovikin knows how to fight with bombers and missiles — that’s what he does,” Gen. Kyrylo O. Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service, said in June. But one expert said the appointment will not solve the Russian army's problems. Frederick B. Hodges, a former top U.S. Army commander in Europe, told the New York Times: “All the problems are institutional, deeply rooted flaws — corruption, lack of readiness.” Read more",7,4.044433363277636,3.3585334834197043,0.6858998798579319,22

Through the night and into this morning, cities across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, were targeted by relentless bombings that lasted hours. So far eight people have died and 24 have been injured. The death toll is expected to rise. Videos and pictures emerged from capital city Kyiv showing widespread devastation and damage. Cars were pictured burning as debris was scattered across the city, and a playground - once popular with young children - was turned into a crater. But, even though this was the first attack on the capital in months, Ukrainians remained defiant in the face of the bombings. Social media was flooded with videos showing acts of resistance, small and large. Some groups of people were filmed sheltering in bomb shelters and Kyiv subway network singing the national anthem and other patriotic songs. Social media networks were flooded with videos of resistance in the wake of the attacks, as people in bomb shelters and in the Kyiv subway network sung the national anthem and other patriotic anthems - even as bombs fell. The country’s defence ministry also tweeted: “So, russkies, you really think you can compensate for your impotence on the battlefield with missile strikes on peaceful cities? “You just don’t get it do you - your terrorist strikes only make us stronger. We are coming after you.” Inna Sovsun, a member of Ukraine's parliament, shared a video on Monday morning from a Metro station in Kyiv showing defiant Ukrainians sitting on the steps, waiting out the attack. She wrote: “Metro station in Kyiv where I am with my son now. Very crowded, lots of kids. People are calm, no panic.” The camera showed crowds of people sheltering down the long tunnel and the same crowd was later shown singing in a second clip. Footage from another shelter showed children gathered around tables, doing their primary school work as they sung the Ukrainian national anthem. Other clips echoed the defiant spirit seen across the capital. The missiles hit Kyiv around 8am this morning, as the city commuted to work and school. Blasts were heard loudest in the Shevchenk district, in the centre of the city, and at least 83 rockets were fired at Ukraine, their military said. General Valeriy Zaluzhny said: “The terrorist country, Russia, has carried out massive missile and air strikes on the territory of Ukraine, also using attack drones. “In the morning, the aggressor launched 75 missiles. 41 of them were shot down by our air defence.” The brutal attack was seen as being in retaliation for the bombing of the Kerch bridge, a vital artery that links Crimea and Russia. Moscow pinned the blame on Kyiv, calling the incident a terrorist act. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Read more",47,3.5505242174039195,3.316894342749214,0.23362987465470564,21
2022-10-10,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-vladimir-putin-next-west-28201822,Putin's next move as threats to the West ramp up - all your questions answered,"Putin is once again fiercely shelling Ukraine's capital Kyiv and other cities across the country in the most intense blasts to hit the Ukrainian capital since the early days of the war. Preliminary reports suggest that at least ten people died and 60 were injured in the strike in Kyiv as of 8.45am local time, as children on their way to school were sent running for shelter. Further, potentially coordinated, explosions have also been heard across Ukraine from Lviv in the west to Dnipro in the east. There have been four explosions in Kharkiv, northeast Ukraine, locals say and two rockets were shot down over Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. Ukraine's Defence Ministry has vowed revenge for Monday's strikes on the country, as it said Russia used Iranian drones in missile strikes on Kyiv. Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces says Russia fired 75 missiles at Ukrainian cities today. It appears to be a tit for tat revenge attack responding to an explosion, probably caused by Ukraine, on the Kerch Bridge, a 12 mile link between Russia and Crimea. The bridge was a huge deal to Putin, finally finishing off his 2014 invasion of the peninsula, but also strategically it is crucial for supply lines to his troops in Ukraine. The missile attacks throughout Ukraine appear to have concentrated on dismantling the country’s infrastructure and striking terror in the hearts of civilians. Widespread electricity outages, damage, horrific woundings and death all point towards the Kremlin’s continued depravity in trying to subdue Ukraine’s defiance. Although strategically the missiles have done little to affect Ukraine’s military advances in south and east Ukraine they are likely to carry a message too - a warning of what is to come. There is no doubt this is an escalation in the Ukraine invasion, showing Moscow is still capable of deploying enormous there despite losing the ground war. But Ukrainian defiance is unlikely to bow to Russia’s continued campaign of atrocities throughout the country. Technically the bridge explosion was probably still in Ukrainian territory but Putin will not see it as that - as the structure was Russian-built and he says Crimea is Russian. He has vowed to “defend” Russia and even though the world knows pretty much all of the violence is taking place inside Ukraine, he feels he has to do something. Ukraine is also likely to do something in response to these missile attacks, probably against a Russian military target, that will help its counter-offensive strategically. But Ukraine may be slipping further towards a deadly tit-for-tat escalation, whilst Putin’s back is against the wall and he feels he has to keep escalating. Clearly he wants to dismantle Ukraine’s infrastructure, smashing its power networks and as winter approaches this could impose enormous misery upon civilians. Some of the missiles fired are thought to have flown through Moldovan airspace and this is significant as a sign of increasing recklessness and willingness of Russia to go beyond Ukraine. Ukraine is holding the line against the biggest security threat against Europe since World War Two and Washington has stated clearly NATO will not tolerate an attack against a member state. So the war is entering a dangerous phase with Putin desperately searching for new targets outside Ukraine without prodding NATO into going to war against him. This means increased cyber attacks and probably a heightened threat level against maritime western pipelines and communications such as those between the UK and America. These kind of attacks, such as the Nord1 pipeline breach, although fairly obviously done by Russia, may be unprovable and fall beneath the threshold for war. But UK chief of the defence staff Admiral Tony Radakin has already preempted this when he said that any attack on these cables, linking European communications to America, would be an “act of war.” If it cannot immediately be proved who did them they may still fall below the threshold - and asymmetrical war tactics such as this can be just as damaging if not more than a missile. The most obvious end would be if Putin’s rule were suddenly to end but despite the rumours of growing plots against him this appears not to be happening in the short term. Ukrainian and western intelligence believes there is growing discontent in the military for obvious reasons and Putin’s intelligence services are also under suspicion. There have been arrests of senior players in both in Moscow and Putin is desperate to pinpoint scapegoats to take the blame for his appalling, bungled and brutal war. In Kyiv, sources have told the Daily Mirror there are already whispers of a conflict between the FSB spooks and the army, with Putin watching carefully to see who will move first. But the truth is Putin’s spooks were bullied into wrongly telling him what he wanted to hear - that a weakened Ukraine was ripe for being invaded. And the military has repeatedly bungled tactically , whilst become increasingly keen to flee in the face of ferocious defiance from Ukraine’s troops.",7,2.5827605119321055,3.33267206048265,-0.7499115485505445,6

Widespread attacks on seven cities including Kyiv killed at least 11 and wounded at least 87 as parts of the capital were left in flames during one terrifying rush-hour salvo. Among those killed in Kyiv were the head of the police cyber force Colonel Yuri Zaskov as the death toll from attacks was expected to rise. The US embassy ordered all citizens to take to bunkers and then flee Ukraine as soon as the all-clear was issued but the Red Cross vowed to “remain in Ukraine.” Explosions were reported in Lviv, Ternopil and Zhytomyr in western Ukraine, Dnipro and Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia in the south and Kharkiv in the east. Missiles continued to fall on Ukraine late into the afternoon and swathes of the country were left without power as residents fled to bunkers throughout the day. Dozens of cruise missiles fired from air, land and sea marked the biggest wave of strikes to hit locations away from the front line, at least since the Feb. 24 invasion started. Suspected Iran-made explosive drones were also launched, with 13 of them shot down and more than 40 missiles hit by Ukraine’s ground-to-air defences. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested in a TV address it was a revenge attack for Kyiv blowing up his Kerch bridge, linking annexed Crimea to Russia. In a deluded rant he said: “The Kyiv regime, with its actions, has put itself on the same level as international terrorist organisations. With the most odious groups. “To leave such acts without a response is simply impossible.” He confirmed he had ordered “massive” long range strikes and warned of more strikes in future if Ukraine hits Russian territory. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the attacks were deliberately timed to kill people, as well as to knock out Ukraine’s power grid. His prime minister said 11 major infrastructure targets were hit in eight regions, leaving swaths of the country with no electricity, water or heat. Zelensky said: “They are trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth.” In Kyiv there were horrific scenes - the dead body of a man lying in the street, flaming cars and destruction and women lying bleeding nearby. The Kremlin was humiliated two days ago when a blast damaged Europe’s longest bridge, which it had built after it seized and annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014. But the escalation drew widespread condemnation with the UK Prime Minister calling for the “further isolation of Russia”. Downing Street condemned the “needless and senseless violence” in Ukraine. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss ”strongly condemned Putin’s appalling attacks on civilian area in Kyiv and elsewhere.” Her spokesman said: “We are keeping a close eye on these increasingly reckless tactics being used by Russia in response to Ukraine’s advance.” By mid-morning, Ukraine’s defence ministry said Russia had fired 81 cruise missiles, and Ukraine’s air defences had shot down 43 of them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky filmed a video message on a mobile phone on an empty central Kyiv street. He said the strikes had two main targets: energy infrastructure and people. “Such a time and such targets were specially chosen to cause as much damage as possible,” he said. Later he added: “The world once again saw the true face of a terrorist state that is killing our people.” His Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted: “Putin is a terrorist who talks with missiles.” Olena Somyk, 41, sheltered with her 6-year-old daughter, Daria, in an underground garage where hundreds of other people waited for the all-clear. She said: ““Really, I think they did this because they are b******s. “Putin is a small angry man, so we don’t know what more to expect.” British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly offered the UK’s “ongoing moral and practical support” to his counterpart in Kyiv, Kuleba. He said: “Russia’s firing of missiles into civilian areas of Ukraine is unacceptable. “This is a demonstration of weakness by Putin, not strength.” UK Security minister Tom Tugendhat added: “Targeting civilians is a vile act. “Russian war crimes start as a record of failure and disgrace.” The UK’s ambassador to Ukraine Melinda Simmons said British staff in Kyiv were safe and said her thoughts are with those hurt in the city. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has ordered troops to deploy jointly with Russian forces near Ukraine It was also claimed more than 1,000 Iranian-made drone missiles have been transported from Russia to Belarus. Russia has faced major setbacks on the battlefield since the start of September, with Ukrainian forces bursting through front lines and recapturing territory. Putin responded to the losses by ordering a mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists, proclaiming the annexation of occupied territory and threatening repeatedly to use nuclear weapons. But tens of thousands of Russians have fled the country to avoid the draft, fearing death in the Ukrainian killing fields. And there have been widespread protests against the threat of being press-ganged into war by Putin, with draft offices being torched and protest marches throughout Russian cities.",47,2.3028748940059196,3.1085257977257506,-0.805650903719831,13

Sunday night into this morning saw the country rocked by a series of relentless attacks across a number of cities. Kyiv was attacked for the first time in months and at least eight people died in the capital, with 24 known to be injured - but the death toll is expected to rise. In light of the escalation, the US embassy in Kyiv sent out an urgent email to all Americans in the country, The Financial Times reported. It read: ""The U.S. Embassy urges US citizens to shelter in place and depart Ukraine now using privately available ground transportation options when it is safe to do so."" The recent attack was said to pose a “direct threat” to US citizens in the country and in the communication they also listed a number of tips for people. This included warning that the security situation in Ukraine remains “highly volatile” and could worsen at any moment. It also advised people on how to act during missile attacks and how to seek safety. Today’s vicious attack came in retaliation after the Kerch Bridge, a vital artery connecting Crimea and Russia, was bombed over the weekend. UK Security Minister Tom Tugendhat branded the strikes on Ukrainian cities ""war crimes"" while Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said they were ""unacceptable"". The missiles launched overnight struck Kyiv, Dnipro, Lviv and a number of other cities in an hours-long attack. Videos and pictures captured the horrifying aftermath of the attacks with parts of Kyiv were left burning. BBC presenter Hugo Bachega was reporting on Ukraine’s latest counter-attack when he was interrupted by the bombing. The programme cut back to the studio as the journalist ducked off his chair and out of shot. CCTV images from across the city also captured the destructive impact of the attack and in the aftermath cars were pictured burning as sirens rang across the city. Officials confirmed that energy infrastructure was targeted in Lviv and Kharkiv in the attacks. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky posted on Telegram, he said: ""They are trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth...destroy our people who are sleeping at home in Zaporizhzhia. Kill people who go to work in Dnipro and Kyiv. ""The air raid sirens do not subside throughout Ukraine. There are missiles hitting. Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded."" This all comes as Russia scrambles to respond to Saturday’s bombing of the Kerch Bridge - an embarrassing blow to the Kremlin’s ongoing invasion. The bridge was a key artery linking Crimea and Russia, built since the illegal annexation in 2014. The last few months of the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine have been marked by a number of successful Ukraine counterattacks. But Putin’s forces have kept up the pressure in a number of hotspots, particularly in their efforts to break into Bakhmut. In fighting here, the Ministry of Defence said Russia was utilising members of the Wagner privacy military and criminals recently sprung from their own prisons.

2022-10-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-sends-nuclear-military-28146922,Fears as military convoy on Russian 'nuclear' train heads towards frontline,"Military equipment has been pictured in a convoy as it appears to be heading to the frontline by a train connected to a Russian defence division that handles nuclear weapons. Vladimir Putin has indicated that he is prepared to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia and the tension has been ramped up by his annexation of four regions of Ukraine where heavy fighting is taking place. The fear is that he could claim an attack on these areas in the east and south of Ukraine would be an assault on Russian territory and so pave the way to using nuclear weapons. And now a convoy of BPM-97 armoured personnel carriers and other military vehicles have been seen heading through central Russia which have been posted on Telegram by pro-Russian channel Rybar. The sophisticated machinery that includes mine proof armoury reportedly belongs to the Russian army’s 12th Main Directorate which runs central storage facilities for nuclear weapons. ""This is actually carrying kit belonging to the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian MoD,"" defence analyst Konrad Muzyka. “The directorate is responsible for nuclear munitions, their storage, maintenance, transport, and issuance to units."" It could mean that nuclear arms are being taken to the front or it could be an attempt by Putin to threaten and intimidate the West. Mr Muzyka tweeted about the train images: “Does that mean that this video shows preparations for a nuclear release? Not really. There are other more likely explanations.” He then went on to explain that it could be a message to the West or the military equipment could be used for training purposes. Following Russia’s withdrawal from a key city of Lyman in the east of Ukraine on Saturday, Chechen leader and Putin ally, Ramzan Kadyrov, suggested the use of low-yield nuclear weapons. But that was dismissed as a possibility on Monday by the Kremlin. Ukrainian forces have broken through Russia's defences in the south of the country while expanding their rapid offensive in the east, seizing back more territory in areas annexed by Moscow and threatening supply lines for Russian troops. Making their biggest breakthrough in the south since the war began, Ukrainian forces recaptured several villages in an advance along the strategic Dnipro River on Monday, Ukrainian officials and a Russian-installed leader in the area said.

Kyiv confirmed that it recently shot down a number of unmanned Shahed-136 drones after they were used in attacks over the weekend. Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for Odesa's regional administration said: ""The enemy is trying to save on missiles... these Shaheds are much cheaper, they can be used much more frequently and in pairs. ""We are seeing that the enemy can even launch several of these kamikaze drones for one attack."" These low-flying weapons, dubbed suicide drones, have been called ""evil’"" by Ukraine who has broken off diplomatic contact with Iran since they discovered the new weapons were being used. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky withdrew the Iranian ambassador's accreditation and cut its diplomatic staff in Kyiv. “Six of these Iranian drones were downed by our air defences of the East and South commands. One more was brought to the ground by air defences of the navy… And just now I am being told about the downing by air defences of the South command of another strike Iranian drone,” Zelensky said. Iran, which has denied supplying unmanned aerial vehicles, has said it will respond with ""proportional action."" Western intelligence suggests that the Kremlin has sourced 1,000 of the 200kg, delta wing-shaped unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from Tehran after Moscow. Scott Crino, founder and chief executive of Red Six Solutions LLC, a strategic consulting firm, told the Wall St Journal: “The presence of Shahed-136 in Ukraine war is undoubtedly changing the operational plans of Kyiv. ""The sheer size of Ukraine battlefield makes it hard to defend against the Shahed-136.” While they may have powerful capabilities, what it does show is Russia's continued weakness and losses, therefore, having to turn to other countries for assistance. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence said it was “highly likely” that Russia has deployed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) made by Iran in the nearly seven-month war in Ukraine. Andriana Arekhta, a junior sergeant with the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Politico that the drones flew from Crimea to attack her special forces unit fighting near the southern city of Kherson. They dropped bombs on their position, destroying two tanks with their crews inside and she said its near impossible to see the drones on radars. Ukraine will need Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar systems and 360-degree radar to fend off this latest threat. A Ukrainian foreign ministry statement said the envoy was told the supply of Iranian weapons to Russia “directly contradicts the position of neutrality, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine” and was “an unfriendly act that deals a serious blow to Ukraine-Iran relations”.

A Russian officer at an enlistment assembly point told the conscripts that they can be used to soak up the blood in bullet wounds. This is due to a dire shortage of medical supplies for the army recruits. The woman officer told the reservists in military fatigues: ""Guys, don't laugh. Ask your wives, girlfriends, and mothers for feminine pads. The cheapest ones, plus the cheapest tampons. “Do you know what tampons are for? You will insert them into bullet wounds and they will swell there. Guys, I know that from [the Chechen War].” The cheap pads are used in military boots as insoles. “Pads are necessary, cheap ones,” she tells them. “This is first-hand information from the front, from my friend,” the officer explained. She urged them: “Guys, please take care of yourselves.” They are also told to source their own sleeping bags and travel mats at their own expense, as well as diarrhoea medicine and tourniquets. “I don't have tourniquets for all of us,” she said. “Сheck your car first aid kit, and take out the tourniquets,” she told them. A soldier then asked: ""So no one's going to give us any of that?"" She replied: ""This must all be yours, boys! You were given a uniform, armour, and everything that is related to the military. Everything else, no. We were equipping our men ourselves."" The US estimated last month that 70,000 to 80,000 of that force had been killed or wounded since the beginning of the invasion on February 24. Russia has been rapidly losing ground to the Ukrainian counteroffensive in recent weeks, particularly in the Kharkiv area which has also cost Russia critical equipment that will be difficult to replace. Jakub Janovsky, a military analyst, says Russia lost 40 tanks, 50 infantry vehicles, 35 armoured vehicles and two jets. The Russian open-source military analysis group Conflict Intelligence Team, also says losses of equipment and personnel are so awful that it has downgraded the Russian military’s fighting ability in Ukraine from “capable of attacking” to “capable of limited defence.” Read more",7,4.303083199269781,4.057185060503687,0.24589813876609412,12

The MRI-eight attack chopper, capable of carrying eight troops or a massive 2,400kg payload, was flying low over fields in an attempt to avoid detection when the weapon was fired. The pilot attempts to keep it airborne before it eventually crashes in a field in Zaporizhzhya, located in the south east of the nation. The missile launcher, known as a man-portable air-defence system (MANPAD), is a Soviet-designed infrared homing surface-to-air missile system. The National Guard of Ukraine said of the incident: “On 22nd September, 2022, a serviceman of the National Guard of Ukraine shot down an enemy Mi-8 with an Igla MANPADS during a raid by enemy aircraft in the direction of Zaporizhzhya."" Since the outbreak of war in February the skies of the under siege nation have been fiercely contested, with scores of helicopters and jets destroyed from both sides. Both fleets have taken heavy personnel losses in the months of fighting with destroyed pieces of hardware littering the ruined cities and countryside. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has reported since the outbreak in February, Russia has so far lost about 56,060 personnel, 2,254 tanks, 4,796 armoured combat vehicles, 1,355 artillery units, 326 multiple launch rocket systems, 170 air defence systems, 254 warplanes, 219 helicopters, 950 drones, 240 cruise missiles, 15 warships, 3,659 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 126 units of special equipment. The destruction comes as hundreds of thousands of Russian reservist civilians have been conscripted to join the battle in Ukraine at warlord Vladimir Putin ’s orders. Tens of thousands of citizens, meanwhile, have tried to flee the country to avoid being sent to the frontline, with queues at borders to Finland, Georgia and Mongolia. Sinister queues were formed at the country’s airports and filtered to check whether those in them were fit to fight. Men deemed fit enough have been blocked from leaving, even if they had tickets or visas for another country. Women have been allowed to depart, under the new rules of Putin’s Iron Curtain. Videos showed men in the Russian Far East beginning a journey of thousands of miles after being summonsed and sent for military training before going to the front in the war with Ukraine. Earlier this week Putin claimed the West has engaged in nuclear blackmail against Russia and that he is unafraid to retaliate with ""lots of weapons."" In a major escalation, the Russian President appeared to threaten possible nuclear strikes in response to what he called attacks on his territory. The warmonger had been due to address the nation on Tuesday night but his speech was delayed without explanation. Speaking on Wednesday morning in a rare address, he said: ""The West has engaged in nuclear blackmail against us. ""If its territorial integrity is threatened Russia will use all the means at its disposal to protect our people.

2022-09-20,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-russian-torture-chamber-discovered-28036615,Russian torture chamber discovered as Ukrainians found with genitals hacked off,"Among the tortured victims recovered from a mass burial site in Izyum were Ukrainians who had their genitals hacked off by barbaric Russian troops, it has emerged. Ukraine ’s Ministry of Internal Affairs said the majority of the 440 victims discovered in makeshift graves after the liberation of Kharkiv last week were found with horrific signs of trauma and abuse. First Deputy Minister Yevheny Yenin said investigators found men with bound hands and “severed genitalia” after 146 corpses were unearthed from a single site on Monday. He added: “We continue to find bodies with signs of violent death - there are many of them. “These include broken ribs and cracked skulls, men with bound hands, broken jaws, and severed genitalia.” The full extent of the horrors of Russian occupation have been revealed in the days after thousands of Vladimir Putin's troops retreated from the Kharkiv region after Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive. At the local police station, investigators discovered makeshift electric chairs and other instruments of cruelty suggesting the site was turned into a torture centre where Ukrainians were interrogated and abused. A series of chilling images show dining room chairs rigged up to the mains with a crude wooden platform and a metal pole holding it all in place. The wooden stand was in place so interrogators could avoid electrocution while threatening their victims. Images of the torture device were shared by Taras Berezovets, a member of Ukraine's special forces. He said the enemy “used electric shocks to torture prisoners of war and civilians”. “The wires with which the prisoners were interrogated are visible on the left in the wall,” he added. Kharkiv Governor Oleg Synehubov wrote on Telegram that two of the bodies recovered were children. He said: “Some of the dead have signs of a violent death. There are bodies with tied hands and traces of torture. The deceased were also found to have explosive, shrapnel and stab wounds.” Izyum’s police chief Sergey Bolvinov shared images and clips of the eerie cells on social media. The alleged Russian war criminals kept meticulous records of the site, jotting down a list of those detained and “instruments of torture”. He added: “People were kept in dark basement cells from several weeks to months, not even always understanding what exactly the occupiers wanted from them.” The vast majority of the bodies found in the mass grave site were civilians, Bolvinov adds. The police station chamber was just one of 10 similar facilities found in the recently liberated area. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “More than 10 torture chambers have already been found in the Kharkiv region, in cities and towns. “Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territories. “That’s what the Nazis did – this is what the Russians do. They will answer in the same way – both on the battlefield and in courtrooms.” The European Union presidency, currently held by the Czech Republic, called yesterday for an international tribunal over Russia ’s invasion. “We stand for the punishment of all war criminals,” Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said. “In the 21st Century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent. “We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals.” At the mass grave near Izyum, Volodymyr Kolesnyk searched for remains of loved ones killed in an airstrike on an apartment block in April. He paused before a cross marked number 199 after checking the list a local funeral firm gave him. A small sign on it had the name Yurii Yakovenko – his cousin. Cross number 164 was his cousin’s wife.

Putin pledged a ""more serious"" response by his military if the Ukrainian counteroffensive continues and claimed the main aim of the campaign is ""the liberation of the entire territory of Donbas"". On Friday he added: ""We are really quite restrained in our response to this for the time being. If the situation continues to develop in this way, the response will be more serious."" In its intelligence update for September 18, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that over the last seven days, Russia ""has increased its targeting of civilian infrastructure even where it probably perceives no immediate military effect"". Overnight shelling is reported to have hit a hospital in the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv, according to regional governor Vitaliy Kim. In Kharkiv, where Ukraine made major gains last week, three are believed to have died in a rocket attack and one victim was an 11-year-old girl. The MoD added: ""As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government."" Putin's bombs have wreaked havoc on civilian life in Ukraine and The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has so far verified a total of 5,827 deaths as of September 11. Of that total, 349 were children. In liberated Izium, a mass grave was uncovered where the bodies of the dead show signs of torture and some have ropes tied around their necks and hands. An estimated 400 shallow graves were found. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), meanwhile, believes a total of 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes to escape the invading Russian troops and their artillery shells. Concerns remain that a continues Russian retreat could cause Putin to resort to even more vicious and irresponsible bombing tacts, even the possibility of tactical nuclear weapons. In a preview for an upcoming episode of 60 Minutes on CBS news, US President Joe Biden warned against Russia employing such tactics. Explaining that the US would be forced to act if nukes were used, Biden said: ""Don't. Don't. Don't. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II. ""It'll be consequential [ Russia ] will become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur."" It is unclear how likely the Ukrainian advance may continue in the coming days and the MoD report from September 17 expected a ""stubborn"" defence from Russia as they try to hold on to key areas. Explaining, the MoD said Ukraine is continuing offensive operations in the northeast of the country and Russian troops have established a line of defence in the Luhansk Oblast town of Svatove. ""Russia likely sees maintaining control of this zone as important because it is transited by one of the few main resupply routes Russia still controls from the Belgorod region of Russia,"" said the defence ministry. ""This line sits along the border of Luhansk Oblast, part of the Donbas, which Russia aims to ‘liberate’ as one of its immediate war aims. Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy. ""Russia will likely attempt to conduct a stubborn defence of this area, but it is unclear whether Russia’s front line forces have sufficient reserves or adequate morale to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault.""

At 174 lay his cousin’s mother. He said: “They buried the bodies in bags, without coffins, without anything. I was not allowed here at first. The Russians said it was mined. “There were a lot of them in the woods, so it was scary to come here.” The first body that was recovered had a rope around its neck and showed signs of having suffered a “violent death”. Regional prosecutor Olexander Ilyenkov said there was no doubt war crimes had been committed. “In the first grave, there is a civilian who has a rope over her neck. So we see the traces of torture,” he said. “Some were killed, some were tortured, and some died in Russian Federation air and ­artillery strikes.” Serhii Cherniak, 61, who lived close to the scene, said: “They didn’t even cover them with sacks. They were just dumped as if they were dogs. “It’s not even a grave, it was a ditch the Russians used to park one of their vehicles. They came up, threw them down and sprinkled sand.” Around 100 Ukrainian emergency service workers are digging up the makeshift graves, trying to establish the cause of death of hundreds of people buried in the forest at the edge of the city.

2022-09-16,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-soldiers-weaponised-rape-liberated-28006125,Russian soldiers weaponised rape in liberated town with 400 buried in mass grave,"Evidence of Russian soldiers carrying out torture and weaponising rape had been piling up for months before the town of Izyum was liberated last week. Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive reclaimed huge swathes of territory in the northeastern region of Kharkiv and freed around 150,000 Ukrainians living under Russian occupation. Vladimir Putin's forces took control of the city and its surrounds on March 27. One of those satellite towns was Izyum, where local officials today confirmed the 400 bodies found in makeshift graves in a mass burial site were mostly civilians. While some of the victims were killed in airstrikes or by landmines, others were shot dead. Some officials said the corpses showed signs of torture, The Guardian reported earlier this week. The hideous discovery comes after months of witness testimonies accusing Russian troops of horrific sexual violence and widespread killings which left families unable to bury their dead. One resident of the recently de-occupied town told The Guardian in April how the Russian forces drew up a list of ""dangerous"" residents to ""hunt"" down. Among those who became the soldier's targets were businessmen, soldiers and their families, and activists. The father, whose real name was not used due to fears of reprisals, recalled how he gave up his bed amid a months-long aerial bombardment - preferring instead to sleep in a corner of the room where he was better protected by the walls. Ukrainian officials at the time had already drawn up their own list, detailing alleged war crimes that mirror those seen in the tragic town of Bucha in April. Putin's troops were accused of ransacking the city and going on a rape and murder rampage through its streets. Witnesses claimed to see similar sites in Izyum, where the fatal victims couldn't even be buried due to the sheer number of corpses packing the morgue. The father explained: ""Some corpses are buried in the central park or near to the people’s houses and in gardens. ""The situation is like what it was in 1942. The morgue doesn’t work. Bodies were taken there at first but now it is too full."" Those killed included Russian soldiers, who were abandoned by their comrades, with the man claiming to have seen their bodies crammed into armoured vehicles as he passed them in the street. “I have seen three armed vehicles full of corpses. There were bodies even lying on the roofs,” he said. A month earlier in another part of Kharkiv, Olha, 31, told Human Rights Watch how she was repeatedly raped by a Russian soldier just upstairs from her young daughter. Olha, her five-year-old girl, mother, sister, 13, and brother, 24, and other terrified locals were taking shelter in the basement of an abandoned school in the village of Malaya Rohan, when a soldier forced himself into the building. After the other hostages bedded down for the night, the soldier dragged her away to a classroom on the second floor, where he made her undress before sexually assaulting her. She said: “He told me to give him [oral sex]. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. ""Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more ‘motivation.’” He raped her twice, once with a knife to her throat after she refused to collect her things and stay with him in the classroom. The vile soldier cut her neck, cheek and some of her hair before repeatedly hitting her in the face with a book. The following day, the soldier left. The burial site found today is just the tip of the iceberg of the horrors of Izyum, according to local chief police investigator Serhii Bolvinov, who has warned there are countless more graves. He said every single body is set to be exhumed and be taken for forensic examination. The discovery was all part of a major Ukrainian effort, with police working alongside prosecutors and other investigators to gather evidence of alleged Russian war crimes. They have come to light since the investigations into Russian war crimes began amid swathes of horror accusations in the Kharkiv region in the months it’s been under Russian control, Mr Bolvinov said. He said: ""I can say that there is one of the biggest burials in one liberated city, which contains more than 440 graves. ""Some 440 bodies were buried in one place.""

Russian soldiers have been driven out of strongholds in Ukraine after Kyiv's forces liberated an area seven times the size of London. In a swift and decisive counter-offensive, Vladimir Putin's troops were dislodged from 8,000 square km (3,088 miles) of Ukrainian territory in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. Addressing the country last night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared ""stabilisation measures"" have already been carried out in half of the territory as the same measures continue in the other section. Ukraine turned the tides of the war over the weekend when it recaptured Moscow's main military supply centre in the northeast, setting the stage for a series of pummelling victories in which they captured dozens of towns.

Sanctions on Russian industries including the defence sector may have impacted the Kremlin's decision to bring in technology from the rogue states. Ukraine is also on the advance. Reports emerged earlier this month that Putin had turned to them for help. The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that claims by Ukraine that they had shot down an Iranian-made drone as evidence that Moscow is ""increasingly sourcing weaponry from other heavily sanctioned states"". The device was supposed to detonate on impact but didn't. The MoD said: "" Russia is almost certainly increasingly sourcing weaponry from other heavily sanctioned states like Iran and North Korea as its own stocks dwindle."" In early September, a US official said that Russia buying from North Korea was a sure sign of ""severe supply shortages"". In August, Russia vowed to expand its relations with North Korea and hoped for ""strategic and tactical co-operation, support and solidarity"" between the two. Ukraine has gained significant ground in the fight for its survival over the past week and is estimated to have taken back well over 900 square miles of territory. Of the reports of the shot-down drone, the ministry said: ""Russia has highly likely deployed Iranian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) in Ukraine for the first time. ""On September 13 2022, Ukrainian officials reported that their forces had shot down a Shahed-136 UAV near Kupiansk, in the area of Ukraine's successful ongoing offensive. ""The Shahed-136 is a one-way attack UAV with a claimed range of 2,500 kilometres."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said of sanctions on Russia's defence industry: ""The Russian military is taking chips from dishwashers and refrigerators to fix their military hardware, because they ran out of semiconductors. ""Russia's industry is in tatters."" It is not known how many troops and how much equipment has been lost by Russia in its war in Ukraine, but the recent advance by defending troops and estimates of soldiers killed is not good news for the Kremlin. Ukraine believes - such claims are likely exaggerated - that Russia has lost over 50,000 troops since the February invasion. This also includes claims of 2,180 lost tanks and 215 helicopters. The Kremlin has not updated its death tally since March when it said it had seen 1,351 killed and 3,825 wounded. Read more",7,4.0663902977644675,3.1752112047180794,0.8911790930463881,6

Presenter Alexander Sladkov was on TV channel Rossiya 1 when he let slip that a ""huge number of people"" have died, following a swift and effective Ukrainian counteroffensive. Sladkov then corrected himself and said Vladimir Putin's forces were having ""great successes"". He said: ""People here [in the Donbas] are waiting for us to get started. For us to hit them so hard that they end up on their backsides. That's to say, a knockout! It's very difficult to win on points."" ""We're losing a huge number of people, we have wounded... we're having... great successes!"" Putin's Kremlin has kept things quiet regarding the number of casualties suffered since their barbaric invasion in February. What Russia deems as 'misinformation' about the war in the country is now punishable by up to 15 years behind bars. Russia has not published its own losses since March when it claimed it had seen 1,351 killed and 3,825 wounded, though independent Russian media outlet iStories verified the deaths of over 5,000. Ukraine claimed it has killed over 50,000 Russians since February, though its reports are likely to be inflated. In early August, CIA director William Burns said there were ""in the vicinity of 15,000 killed and maybe three times that wounded"". Sladkov added: ""We're having great successes but we're not... well now we've used long-range aviation, we've dealt serious damage to their energy system, but again we didn't finish it off. ""Again, what are the people saying? They're saying: 'We're winning on points. But we'd like a knockout'."" After a successful advance into previously Russia-held territory - around 965 square miles were estimated to have been recovered over the weekend - the Ukrainian advance continues on Tuesday. Ukraine claims around 150,000 people have been liberated so far and the goal is to press on to Kharkiv. US President Joe Biden said there was likely still a long fight ahead: ""It’s clear the Ukrainians have made significant progress. But I think it’s going to be a long haul."" Analysts believe Ukraine has a choice to try and press home its advantage with further advances, but doing so may risk the country overstretching and facing a counterattack.

Putin’s forces have suffered a crushing defeat in eastern Ukraine, losing vast swathes of the country to a surprise Ukrainian counter-offensive. The Russian president is thought to have relieved Lieutenant General Roman Berdnikov of his duties amid reports that panicked Russian troops have been abandoning tanks, weapons and supplies. Advancing Ukrainian soldiers report finding discarded military uniforms left by fleeing Russian soldiers attempting to disguise themselves as civilians as they flee the combat zone in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv oblast region. Ukrainian soldiers have taken more than 1,000 square miles of territory in a matter of days in a lightning offensive that has seen troops push to within 30 miles of the Russian border. The main advance began six days ago and followed a months-long disinformation campaign tricking Russia into deploying troops further to the south, leaving the Kharkiv oblast region lightly defended. Putin appointed Lt General Berdnikov as commander of the Western Armed Forces on August 26, 2022, according to the Ukrainian military intelligence service. But Ukrainian spooks now say that the ramshackle Russian retreat at Kharkiv has seen Berdnikov sacked by Putin. But it could have been worse, Berdnikov was declared dead back in June, with unconfirmed reports at the time saying he had been killed during fighting in the Donbas. But it seems he lived to be sacked another day. A Ukrainian unit fighting in the recent Kharkov offensive reported that the Russian chain of command in the region had completely collapsed, with soldiers throwing down their weapons and fleeing from the Ukrainian advance without offering any resistance. A source told the Telegraph : 'They were really afraid, their chain of command was in chaos. Officers left the area before the fighting began. 'There were a lot of uniforms lying around. We caught some of these guys trying to escape in civilian clothes, they were telling some incredible bull***t trying to save themselves.' The news comes as president Zelensky mocked the Russian retreat in a video address to the nation, saying that ‘the Russian army in these days is demonstrating the best that it can do – showing its back’. Yesterday he posted a video of Ukrainian soldiers hoisting the national flag once again over the town of Chkalovske. More crucially, they entered the Russian-held supply towns of Izyum, Kupiansk and Balakliya in what could be a turning point for the conflict. Ukraine’s military chief, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said yesterday his forces had liberated about 1,160 square miles since the beginning of September – triple the amount of regained territory claimed by Mr Zelensky just two days previously.",7,4.1092267798701485,4.013233343542301,0.09599343632784763,10

The unverified claims come from an update provided by The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine's Facebook page on Monday, September 5. The post read: ""In Donetsk, the Russian invaders found a 'new source' of replenishment of losses in manpower. ""So, recently, representatives of the Russian occupation army began to arrive at local hospitals in the city and forcefully 'discharge' patients. ""Men of military age with various diseases or injuries, including those wounded during hostilities who are undergoing treatment, fall under such an extract."" The unconfirmed statement comes amid further claims that Russia has lost around 50,000 troops in its war campaign in the country that escalated in February. Further reports say the country is struggling to expand the size of its military and replace those already killed in the war. A senior US defence official said at the end of August that the US government does not believe Russia can successfully increase the size of its military by 130,000, the number planned by Putin. The official told reported that Russia is “unlikely to succeed, as Russia has historically not met personnel end strength targets."" They added: ""Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill trained. ""So what this all suggests to us is that any additional personnel Russia is able to muster by the end of the year may not, in fact, increase overall Russian combat power."" Ukraine claims it has killed at least 50,150, along with 2,077 tanks and 4,484 armoured combat vehicles, though their estimates tend to be much higher than those released by Russia and Western countries. Estimates vary, but CIA Director William Burns put an estimate of 15,000 troops killed by the end of July and ""maybe three times that wounded."" Russia has not published its own losses since March when it claimed it had seen 1,351 killed and 3,825 wounded. Revealing the true number in Russia is considered a breach of state secrets and could see someone sentenced to up to seven years in prison. The UK Ministry of Defence's most recent update on the fighting in Ukraine said: ""In the face of combat losses, it is likely that Russia is struggling to maintain socks of [unmanned aerial vehicles] (UAVs), exacerbated by component shortages resulting from international sanctions. ""The limited availability of reconnaissance UAVs is likely degrading commanders' tactical situational awareness and increasingly hampering Russian operations.""

The ""Vostok"" exercises involve troops from China and India, although it was not clear if units from those countries were taking part in the portion observed by Putin. The Zvezda military news service showed a clip of Putin seated next to Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, exchanging a joke as they listened to a phone exchange between Shoigu's deputy and the head of the general staff. By proceeding with the four-yearly Vostok exercises, Putin appeared to be sending a signal that Russia's military is able to conduct business as usual despite the demands of the Ukraine war. His forces have suffered heavy losses in men and equipment while being fought to a virtual standstill after occupying around a fifth of the country. The defence ministry says the war games that began on September 1st involve only 50,000 troops, a fraction of the 300,000 they said took part in 2018. Western military analysts say they believe both figures are exaggerated. The defence ministry released video of the naval part of the exercise, showing Russia's Pacific Fleet practising launching Kalibr cruise missiles which it said had successfully struck a target more than 300 km away. On Monday, Russian and Chinese combat ships practised repelling an enemy air attack using air defence artillery systems. Last week warships from the two countries carried out anti-ship, anti-air and anti-submarine defence tasks in the Sea of Japan, the ministry said. Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared a ""no limits"" partnership in February, promising to collaborate more closely against the West. India has sent an army contingent to the drills which it says is taking part in ""joint field training exercises, combat discussions and firepower exercises"". Russia is the biggest supplier of military hardware to India, which went ahead with the exercise days after the United States said it had concerns about any country holding such manoeuvres with Russia now. Moscow says the war games also involve military contingents and observers from Algeria, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Syria and six former Soviet republics.",7,3.663101029690425,3.7890129327026307,-0.12591190301220578,20

Yandex Taxi, a Russian app that works in a similar way to Uber, had hundreds of its cars directed to Kutuzovsky Prospekt - a major road that runs east to west leading into the centre of the Russian capital. The major road is rarely jammed, with vehicles being able to drive in any of the eight to ten lanes. However, yesterday, drivers spent about 40 minutes in traffic due to the fake pick-up orders. Speaking out about the incident, the company said its security department 'immediately stopped attempts to artificially' order the taxis. However, their attempts were not enough to stop the gridlock. The company said: ""The security service promptly stopped attempts to artificially accumulate cars. Drivers spent about 40 minutes in traffic due to fake orders. The issue of compensation will be resolved in the very near future."" The company later confirmed the incident in a statement, and noted it had addressed the vulnerability that enabled the hack to happen, stressing that in order to exclude such incidents in the future, ""the algorithm for detecting and preventing such attacks has already been improved."" According to Forbes.ru, the statement read: ""On the morning of September 1, Yandex Taxi encountered an attempt by attackers to disrupt the service — several dozen drivers received bulk orders to the Fili region."" Footage of the gridlock was also shared plentifully on social media. One video from inside the cab shows dozens of other yellow cars barely moving - but all traveling in the same direction. The person who recorded the footage then shows the taxi drivers navigational system display an address on the Kutuzovsky Prospekt. Police were also recorded on the road, trying to control the vehicles. Sharing the clip on Twitter, they captioned it: ""Someone hacked #YandexTaxi and ordered all available taxis to Kutuzov Prospect in Moscow Now there is a huge traffic jam with taxis. It‘s like James Bond movie."" Currently, no one is taking responsibility for the hack. Vladimir Putin's invasion on Ukraine continues, both on the ground and online; engaged in cyber warfare. Furthermore, Russia has been behind a series of cyber attacks since the start of the renewed invasion of Ukraine. In the days leading up to the war, Mykhailo Fedorov - Ukraine's digital minister and President Volodymyr Zelensky's right hand man on tech - called on volunteers to create an 'IT Army' of hackers to help in his country's struggle against Russia.

Western sources today said that credible evidence is being uncovered by governments and NGOs of horrendous treatment meted out by Valdimir Putin 's forces, six months after the invasion started. Sources are understood to be ""particularly concerned"" about filtration camps amid chilling reports of torture and murder, with a report by Human Rights Watch highlighting sickening treatment of people in Donetsk. Russian occupiers are desperate to impose referendums on the population in an effort to convince the world that Ukrainians want to be assimilated into a larger Russia - but results should be viewed as having no credibility at all, sources said. Meanwhile, there is optimism that Ukraine is making progress in reclaiming territory around the port city of Kherson, with many Russian units lacking combat effectiveness due to depleted numbers. Putin, whose movements are limited due to fears around his security, has embarked on propaganda visits to try and tackle waning enthusiasm for his war in recent days, sources say. It comes as the British national security advisor, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, vowed that UK support for Ukraine would not waver. He said in a statement released today: ""It’s been more than six months since Putin launched his unprovoked, illegal war bringing untold suffering to the innocent people of Ukraine and there is increasing evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces. Putin's invasion has hurt people across the globe, causing price rises and food insecurity, including for many who were already vulnerable, as well as the desperate bloodshed. ""Ukraine’s resistance has inspired the world and shown huge courage in the face of brutality. Now that courageous resistance has stalled the Russian advance and demonstrated the determination of the Ukrainian people and Armed Forces to retake their sovereign territory.

Russia is continuing to develop advanced weapons as its stuttering invasion of Ukraine rumbles on beyond six months. Its navy lacks dependable aircraft carriers - but it makes up for that with a robust submarine force, with its latest offering being able to be equipped with the most modern missiles. The K-329 Belgorod is an Oscar II-class guided-missile fast attack vessel - the biggest built by Moscow in 30 years - and was first introduced to the public at an event in Severodvinsk on July 8. It is currently assigned to the Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research, with various testing still ongoing. The vessel is able to carry the planned Poseidon nuclear-armed torpedo, with six set to be put onboard. The torpedo is described by some experts as the weapon the US navy fears the most. While Russian propaganda news outlets have described the Poseidon as being able to ""wipe Britain off the map"" in a ""radioactive tsunami"", reports 19fortyfive. The weapon is 80ft long and can travel at a reported speed of 108 knots, reaching a depth of 3,200ft. It is also alleged to have an unlimited range and be able to cause an underwater two-megaton blast. However, it is said to be still some years away from deployment. Referring to the possible impact of the weapon, the news outlet adds: ""The real objective would be to coat wide swathes of the surrounding coastline with radioactive fallout – an enduring and difficult-to-remediate hazard of underwater nuclear detonations. ""The submersible delivery method would circumvent (American) missile-defence capabilities.” The Belgorod is also supposedly able to act as a carrier for underwater vehicles and act as support for a mini nuclear-powered spy sub for sabotaging undersea cables. Russia's attempts at developing mini-subs before have ended in tragedy and this may well be just propaganda to give its people the impression of an unstoppable military might. The Losharik (A-12) was deep diving manned submersible that suffered a battery explosion in 2019, killing 14 people on board, reports USNI News. The Belgorod is 549ft by 49ft in size and boasts two nuclear reactors, with trials having been ongoing for three years with reports suggesting it is ready to be dispatched on patrols.

Shot in the back, he struggled away from the scene, but died mere hours later in his own home in Borodianka, in the now infamous Bucha district. Ukrainian officials along with the International Criminal Court (ICC) are looking into war crimes since the invasion began. Over 14,000 separate alleged incidents were recorded in the country by the Ukrainian prosecutor's office as early as late May. Now, the estimated tally stands at around 25,000. Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Calllamard said: ""It is vital that all those responsible, including up the chain of command, are brought to justice."" Devastated mum Tasia said to Reuters: ""That's it. I've lost my child. They have to try them in court."" Her son was shot on March 17, less than a month into the war. In Bucha, authorities found mass graves and claimed them to be evidence of murder and torture. Roman's body was found to be in a grave containing around 250 people on April 30. Borodianka police chief Viacheslav Tsyliuryk said: ""We can establish an army unit, but at the moment it is not possible to hold a specific individual responsible."" Russia continues to deny incidents of war crimes in Ukraine despite the mounting allegations and evidence against them. The country insists they are only in Ukraine conducting a ""special operation"" to remove the threat of a Nazi government on their borders. A false claim that has no basis in reality, Putin's invasion is a war. British attorney Nigel Povoas works as the lead prosecutor for the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, based in the US. He told Reuters that areas of Borodianka with apartment blocks were allegedly destroyed by Russian warplanes ""On the face of it, and at this stage it's very early, this would seem to be an obvious war crime for priority investigation."" Elsewhere the NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Ukraine of torture, unlawful detentions and forced disappearances in the regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Senior Ukraine researcher at Human Rights Watch Yulia Gorbunova said: ""Russian forces have turned occupied areas of southern Ukraine into an abyss of fear and wild lawlessness. ""Torture, inhumane treatment, as well as arbitrary detention and unlawful confinement of civilians, are among the apparent war crimes we have documented, and Russian authorities need to end such abuses immediately and understand that they can, and will, be held accountable.""",45,4.599830279672126,4.771828805828629,-0.17199852615650268,14

The strange and alarming remarks were made by Andrey Gurulyov, a retired commander in the Russian military and current member of the Russian State Duma. On Russian TV, the lieutenant general who served as a Russian tank commander said: ""To serious things - London understands there is no defence against [Russian] hypersonic missiles. ""They understand, too, that the main target isn’t Germany or France - but the British Isles."" Hypersonic missiles are incredibly hard to stop as they fly five times faster than the speed of sound and on a different trajectory than other missiles. Capable of reaching the UK in three minutes, they are also deadly with the potential to deliver nuclear strikes. Around 50, he warned, would wipe out all of the UK's power stations and stop Western support for Ukraine, making it far easier for Vladimir Putin's regime to carry out its invasion plans, which are currently faltering as a counteroffensive is now underway in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson. Gurulyov continued: ""It is the closest target, it’s a nice target, which would allow [us] to change the outcome of this conflict [in Ukraine ]. ""So by completely wiping out the British Isles, I think we’ll finish this story."" The term ""British Isles"" is a geographical term referring to Great Britain and its surrounding islands including the island of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland has been neutral since the 1930s. The wild claims also said that Wales and Scotland would be moved to leave the UK, which would see the ""end of the British Crown."" An attack on the UK would likely cause a world war due to its position in NATO, where an attack on one member state is considered an attack on all of them. Gurulyov appeared to think the strike would stop the West from supporting Ukraine if such a devastating attack, in which millions could be killed, actually occurred. He said: ""The hypersonic weapon has an extraordinary destructive power, near-equivalent to a nuclear weapon - and is precise, too."" The UK made the ideal target, according to the member of the Russian parliament’s defence committee, due to its support for Ukraine since the war broke out in February and that it is preparing for war. ""They realise the number of currently deployed missiles allows destruction of the UK’s entire aviation grouping... Yes - they are preparing for the war with us. The whole situation is not about Ukraine. ""We are not fighting Ukraine, we are fighting our British ‘friends’ and [the US]."" Regular TV threats by Putin’s propagandists to strike Britain are seen as a sign of frustration, especially in military circles, over the Kremlin’s leader’s tactics which have seen an estimated 75,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded in six months, while making relatively small territorial gains. Moscow holds Britain responsible for galvanising the West to stand solidly with Ukraine, and also to provide arms to President Volodymyr Zelensky.",49,3.2658178618609743,4.237296400827285,-0.9714785389663105,12

The Russian despot's troops would then number 1.15million, 15 times the size of the British Army. The bloody invasion of Moscow's former Soviet ally is entering its seventh month and shows no signs of coming to an end. The Kremlin had previously tried to persuade volunteers, private military contractors and prisoners through amnesty agreements in an effort to swell its ranks. Commanders are now offering £4,000 signing-up bonuses, while the upper age limit has been raised. Former KGB intelligence officer Putin - who is widely reported to have seen his health decline in recent months - has always referred to the invasion as a “special operation” since beginning shell attacks in February. Dara Massicot, senior policy researcher at US think tank Rand Corporation, told the Daily Telegraph: “An expansion like this is a move you make when strategic forecasts for the future inside the General Staff are gloomy, or you have a longer term conflict or project in mind."" Putin has not publicly pinpointed which areas of his army he plans to strengthen but analysts suggest he needs to replace around 75,000 frontline soldiers that have been killed or injured. But because he refuses to identify the invasion as a war, many commanders say he cannot order the full mobilisation he needs. Moscow had expected to capture Ukrainian capital Kyiv within three days, but an unexpectedly resilient defence, bolstered by modern NATO weapons and intel left the invaders bogged down. They pulled out of the original plan to take the centre of the country, and shifted to the Donbas. However, Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said that the Kremlin’s plan was on track at a meeting in Uzbekistan of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

Six months since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, attacks on Crimea — the peninsula Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014 but still recognised as Ukrainian by western nations — have been ramping up. More than half of the Russian navy’s Black Sea Fleet combat jets were put out of action last week following a string of blasts at the Saky military airfield in western Crimea. On Saturday, Russian targets were reportedly attacked in Sebastopol, the home of Russia's Black Sea fleet and more drone attacks were reported overnight in Crimea, including one at an airbase. The attacks have also sabotaged Putin’s attempts to hide the true horrors of the conflict from the public because thousands of Russian tourists holidaying in Crimea fled the peninsula when they witnessed explosions. One official said: ""Ukraine is now consistently achieving kinetic effects deep behind Russia ’s lines. “We’ve seen this in at least three instances in occupied Crimea, an area which Russia has previously considered a secure base area with a major role in enabling the occupation. ""The incidents have been having a material effect on Russia’s logistics support, but as importantly, there’s a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership."" Russia always thought Crimea would be untouchable during the war and safe from Ukrainian attack, hence reams of people holidaying there. But the unnamed Western officials said that Russia's Black Sea fleet has now been diminished to little more than a coastal flotilla and satellite images from the aftermath of the Ukrainians hitting the Russian airbase revealed severe damage. Russia is facing an increasingly critical shortage of stocks, even of basic munition, as well as manpower issues, the Western official stressed. They said: ""There was a point when there was constant shelling, there was a real high point, particularly around the battle for the Donbas. ""We aren't at that high point anymore. ""The whole tempo of the campaign has slowed down, partly because both sides have become more conscious that this is a marathon, not a sprint and that expenditure rates and conserving their munitions is important."" In April, the fleet's flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine and in June the fleet suffered a huge blow when it was forced to abandon the strategic Snake Island after coming under sustained Ukrainian bombardment.",7,3.6953139511153137,4.450449256952564,-0.7551353058372503,6
2022-08-15,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/three-men-blown-up-others-27745739,Three men blown up and others injured after mine explodes on beach in Ukraine,"Three men have been blown up after a mine exploded beach in Ukraine - with one of them killed in front of his family. They were killed when an explosive detonated on the Zakota village beach in the region of Odesa, Ukraine. Taking a dip, CCTV footage revealed the unfortunate pair surrounded by other happy beachgoers on the picturesque sea front before a massive water plume shot into the sky. This comes as a similar incident took place back in June when a 50-year-old man was killed by a mine as he swam in the sea in Odesa. Police said the accident happened on Sunday when several people working on a construction site ignored barriers and warning signs on the beach and went swimming in the sea in the Belhorod-Dnistrovskyi district. ""In the water, as a result of an explosion of an unknown object, three men aged 25, 32 and 53 years old were killed,"" the police said in a written statement. It added that another man and a woman had been wounded. This summer Ukrainian authorities closed sea beaches because of mines or artillery shells because of the war with Russia and shelling by Russian forces. Ukraine's military also planted mines along the coast in case of a Russian amphibious assault after Moscow's February 24 invasion, cordoning off beach entrances with red and white tape to ensure civilians don't get hurt. ""We emphasise once again: that swimming in the reservoirs of the Odesa region is now dangerous and prohibited,"" the regional police said. ""The beaches and coasts of the region are protected and equipped with explosive devices."" Back in June, a spokesperson for the city council said a 50-year-old man had ""ignored the announced restrictions on visiting the coast and swimming in coastal waters"" when he was killed. The local authority said: ""Police urge residents and guests of Odesa region to strictly follow the rules of martial law. ""Do not go to the coastal protection zone of the Black Sea, do not swim in the mined sea. ""While swimming in the sea in one of the villages of Odesa district, an explosion of an unknown object killed a 50-year-old man in front of his wife, son and friend. ""The latter miraculously did not suffer, because he went swimming with the victim. ""Once again, a strict ban on visiting the coast and swimming in the sea are security measures that are life-threatening if neglected."" Russia has reportedly dotted the coast with mines in a ""brazen"" fashion and is the ""only party to the conflict known to have used banned antipersonnel mines"". Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch, said: ""Russia’s brazen use of antipersonnel mines in a country that has explicitly prohibited these weapons is unprecedented and deserves strong global condemnation. ""Antipersonnel landmines should never be used due to their inevitable and long-term threat to civilian life and livelihoods."" A report by the NGO said sick Russian weapons like the POM-3 antipersonnel mine have been used in combat in Ukraine. The killer weapon is said to launch to a height of between one to 1.5 metres before detonating midair and throwing fragments up to six metres away. Mine use by Russians is also reportedly affecting crop usage in the area when departing troops laid mines and did not clear them when they withdrew. Near the city of Kharkiv, a farmer is reported to have been injured when his tractor hit a TM-62 antivehicle mine in his own field. More than 150 countries have joined the treaty - the 1997 Mine Ban Convesion - banning the use of landmines as they do not distinguish between civilians and people. In March, fleeing Ukrainians were met with mines on their escape path and had to return home while bombs fell.",45,4.37484923664144,5.327873915119189,-0.9530246784777487,26

Recently emerged footage of the grief-stricken family of Lieutenant Colonel Vitaly Tsikul at his funeral. Tsikul, 36, is believed to have been the 100th colonel killed when serving as part of the Russian 90th Tank Division. A soldier at the funeral, named Viktor, said: “He was our commander. I did not hear a single bad word from him. He was an officer who rallied his troops."" His funeral passed with full military honours at an Orthodox Church in Chebarkul in the Urals. Tsikul's death comes as speculation on the true numbers of Russian troops killed since Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine continues. It appears the war has not gone as well as Putin expected and the UK Ministry of Defence said he is ""highly likely"" to have sacked six of his generals for poor performance. Other recent deaths include Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Gorban, 36, a senior commander in Russia's elite special forces. A US Pentagon official said on Monday that around 70,000 to 80,000 troops have been killed or wounded since the invasion began. Current Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl explained their assessment of the situation put 42,200 of those troops as killed. He said: ""After all, more than 40 million Ukrainians are fighting. The stakes are existential for them. ""They are fighting for the survival of their country. I'll also say the Russians are taking a tremendous number of casualties on the other side of the equation."" ""There's a lot of fog in war but, you know, I think it's safe to suggest that the Russians have probably taken 70 [thousand] or 80,000 casualties in less than six months."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in April that Russia was indeed suffering ""significant"" losses in the campaign. Kahl added: ""That [Russian casualty] number might be a little lower, a little higher, but I think that's kind of in the ballpark, which is pretty remarkable considering that the Russians have achieved none of Vladimir Putin's objectives at the beginning of the war."" Russian officials are believed to understate the number of troops killed and have cracked down on what they see as the reporting of 'misinformation' in the country. Putin signed into law legislation that means people can get up to 15 years in jail for spreading 'fake' information. Some believe that the true number of troops killed may cause unrest, though support for the war within Russia remains high as the Kremlin continues to brand it a 'special operation. It falsely claims Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is in charge of a 'Nazi' state and that Russia is simply protecting its own brders.",7,3.4333839327272835,5.28081184811839,-1.8474279153911062,5

He said western allies must prepare to keep sending arms to Ukraine ’s military for a long time and vowed they will go to war if Russia encroaches into NATO territory. Stoltenberg, speaking in Norway said: ""It's in our interest that this type of aggressive policy does not succeed. ""What happens in Ukraine is terrible but it would be much worse if there was a war between Russia and NATO.” He warned: ""This is the most dangerous situation in Europe since World War Two. ""If President Putin even thinks of doing something similar to a NATO country as he has done to Georgia, Moldova or Ukraine, then all of NATO will be involved immediately. “This is not just an attack on Ukraine, an independent democratic nation with more than 40 million people, it's also an attack on our values and the world order we want.” The war has led Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership, with the request so far ratified by 23 of the 30 member states, including the US. Stoltenberg added: ""This is not just an attack on Ukraine, an independent democratic nation with more than 40 million people, it's also an attack on our values and the world order we want.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the pressure his troops are under in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine as ""hell"". He spoke of fierce fighting around the town of Avdiivka and the fortified village of Pisky. Frontline Avdivka is the site of astonishing resistance by Ukrainian troops, as witnessed by the Daily Mirror in the months preceding the invasion. Kyiv’s troops there, many of them paratroopers, have held the line in the strategic village, fighting in horrific conditions for five months. Even before the invasion, they were coming under daily fire and mortar bombing daily. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that Russian forces had mounted at least two assaults on Pisky but that its troops repelled them. Ukraine has spent the last eight years fortifying defensive positions in Pisky, viewing it as a buffer zone against Russian-backed forces. Kyiv’s troops have been using western-supplied missile systems to attack Russian forces there in recent weeks. Footage on social media showed bodies, some blown apart, lying beside a road in central Donetsk. Blood stained the pavement close to a bus stop. Eight people were killed and four wounded by the Russian artillery shelling in the town of Toretsk in Donetsk. British sources claimed estimates of Russian deaths in five months of fighting were less than half those from Ukraine officials. They said up to 20,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war in Ukraine, whilst Kyiv’s official figures suggest Moscow has lost 41,170. UK intelligence assessments say over 50,000 Russian troops are thought to have been wounded since the February invasion. But one official said: “Because the battle has slowed down, the statistics have slowed down as well.” Experts still fear Putin is hellbent on taking over the whole of Ukraine - despite his troops “making slow, incremental gains”. An official said: “We think that Russia has not given up on its maximalist objectives for Ukraine. “Militarily we question how they can achieve those objectives in the near term. “But then what we need to understand better is that Russia is prepared to operate over a much longer time frame than we think in, typically.”",7,3.65747389829086,4.1840180772632305,-0.5265441789723706,6

Vitaly Aroshanov, 39, is alleged to be the fighter who committed the vile crime who serves with the pro-Vladimir Putin Luhansk armed group Bryanka-SSSR (Bryanka-USSR). A Russian soldier is seen in a video using a box-cutting knife to remove a captive’s genitals and hold them up to the camera. Ukrainian sources including Mirotvorets allege the castrator is from Kalmykia, a Russian region on the Caspian Sea. Seen wearing a trademark cowboy hat in the video, Aroshanov worked as a repairman in regional capital Elite. The Mirror has chosen not to show the disturbing footage. Aroshanov was recognised on a video filmed by RIA Novosti showing how Luhansk forces and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov's fighters at the ruins of Azot factory in Severodonetsk. His social media is now deleted. He is believed to have a criminal record in Russia related to overdue loans, say reports. Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun who tweeted the sickening footage said the war crime must be punished. ""Russia has to pay for it,"" she said. ""Give Ukraine the weapons we need to stop this nightmare once and for all. The world can't pretend like this isn't happening.""

The controversial tactic of a double-tap strike is when warplanes attack a site and then return to strike the same area again as people are being rescued from the rubble. A new report published on Thursday by the Syria Justice and Accountability Centre (SJAC) has identified 58 double-tap attacks targeting residential areas between 2013 and 2021. It says that Russian forces, the bomb-wielding ally of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, along with the Syrian regime were shelling sites where paramedics and civilians congregated to help the victims of an initial strike. The aim of the strikes is to kill or maim as many people as possible, as well as destroy civilian infrastructure and cause widespread fear among the civilians. The SJAC team trawled through hours of video footage and images, using open source intelligence to confirm the strikes and build a case of evidence. One attack on a camp in northern Idlib killed around 45 people and left 70 injured. Rescue workers were trying to extinguish a fire in the camp caused by an initial bombing when a second missile struck, killing the rescue workers and a classroom full of children. Then a third missile struck, killing more survivors and civil defence workers. “The civilians rescuing survivors had no time to run,” the report says. The specific locations and times have been uncovered in hope that one day the warmongers may be brought to trial. When Russia entered the conflict in 2015, double-tap strikes ""climbed in frequency and intensity, resulting in broadened destruction"", the report says. Laser-guided weapons, such as the Russian-made Krasnopol, caused even more devastation. The strikes are likely to have broken the Geneva Convention for targeting both medical and humanitarian workers. But Nessma Bashi, legal officer for the SJAC, told the New Arab that while Russia and Syria are state parties to the Geneva Conventions and there is strong evidence of their violations, ""international humanitarian law lacks an enforcement mechanism."" The same brutal tactics are now being used by the Kremlin army in Ukraine. The Red Cross responded to an attack in Kharkiv, administering first aid to two victims when ""several deafening roars signalled the second round of shelling"", The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Bashi told the Washington Post that Syria was the testing ground for it. She continued: “What Ukraine has shown is that double taps are being conducted on a regular basis.”",45,4.686360400837051,4.993453502218993,-0.307093101381942,2

The furious president said he had fired the pair after it emerged that many members of their agencies had collaborated with Russia - with other agencies also accused of treason. He said 651 cases of alleged treason and collaboration have been opened against prosecutorial and law enforcement official. More than 60 officials from Bakanov and Venediktova's agencies are now working against Ukraine in Russian-occupied territories, he added. Venediktova has played a key role in the prosecution of Russian war crimes. Zelensky, in his nightly address to the nation, said: ""Such an array of crimes against the foundations of the national security of the state ... pose very serious questions to the relevant leaders. ""Each of these questions will receive a proper answer."" Bakanov and Venediktova have not commented on the allegations. It comes as Vladimir Putin 's troops have captured swathes of Ukraine's south and east during an invasion that has killed thousands, displaced millions and destroyed cities.

Amid speculation Putin could be ousted from power as his war rages on, UK Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin says a regime change in Russia is unlikely. He told Sophie Raworth on BBC One's Sunday Morning show: ""I think some of the comments that he's not well or that actually surely somebody's going to assassinate him or take him out, I think they're wishful thinking. ""As military professionals we see a relatively stable regime in Russia, President Putin has been able to quash any opposition, we see a hierarchy that is invested in President Putin and so nobody at the top has got the motivation to challenge President Putin, and that is bleak."" He said the ""challenge of Russia is going to endure"" potentially for ""decades in terms of Russia as a threat"", and the next prime minister should know that Russia is ""the biggest threat"" to the UK. He added: ""So the biggest threat is Russia, and that's Russia in all its guises when you look at it militarily. ""Its land forces are probably less of a threat in the short term because of that degradation, that depletion that we're seeing with their struggle in Ukraine. ""But Russia continues to be a nuclear power, it's got cyber capabilities, it's got space capabilities, and it's got particular programmes under water so it can threaten the underwater cables that allow the world's information to transit around the whole globe."" On what Britain's armed forces would look like if defence spending increased to 3% of GDP, he said: ""I think they would be even more modern and they would have even more punch and they would have even more impact around the world, and that's clearly a choice for government."" Reflecting on a recent visit to Kyiv, he said Ukraine's army ""absolutely"" believed it will win the war. He added: ""They plan to restore the whole of their territory in terms of Ukraine, and they see a Russia that is struggling, a Russia that we assess has lost more than 30% of its land combat effectiveness. ""What that actually means is 50,000 Russian soldiers that have either died or been injured in this conflict, nearly 1,700 Russian tanks destroyed, nearly 4,000 armoured fighting vehicles that belong to Russia destroyed."" On how he will brief the next Prime Minister, he added: ""We will always give them a brief on the current situation so they are aware of where we have our armed forces. ""That's dominated by Ukraine and the support that we are providing to Ukraine but we also try to step back and give a wider threat picture.

2022-07-14,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-missile-strike-central-ukraine-27485400,Russian missile strike in central Ukraine kills 21 people including three kids,"Russian missiles slammed into a central Ukraine community today, killing at least 21 including three children and injuring 115, half of them seriously. A baby was also among those killed after three Kalibr cruise missiles smashed into Vinnytsia and several more were hit by Kyivs’ air defences. Rescuers are searching the rubble for survivors amid fears a further 46 people are missing and may also have been killed. At least 50 cars were set ablaze by the explosions, which left locals reeling in shock over Russia ’s latest missile strike. Missiles were fired from submarines in the Black Sea, escalating fears Russia is increasingly focusing on killing civilians. Vinnytsia is 430 miles from the east Ukraine frontline and the atrocity follows a string of mass casualty missile strikes. Moscow is thought to be frustrated over a lack of gains in month five of the war and their attacks in Donetsk are faltering under a wave of Ukrainian rocket salvos. Tonight Ukraine’s furious President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a brief statement: “What is this - if not an open act of terrorism?” He added: “Cruise missiles hit two community facilities, houses were destroyed, a medical centre was destroyed, cars and trams were on fire.” Footage revealed thick black smoke pouring out of a tall building, cars burnt-out and the twisted remains of vehicles and smouldering rubble. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter : “This is terrorism. Deliberate murder of civilians to spread fear. “Russia is a terrorist state and must be legally recognised as such.” The UK MoD said Russia is making little headway in Putin’s war wish-list of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It said: “They have achieved no significant territorial advances over the last 72 hours and are in danger of losing momentum built up.” There were also reports that Russian forces are so mired in the war that in the east they are importing concrete pills boxes to dig in and defend against Ukrainian attacks. Kyiv's forces have been bolstered by the supply of multiple launch rocket systems which are proving increasingly deadly against Russian troops. Western-supplied long-range weapons and 155mm “smart” shells are hitting Russian ammo dumps and supply lines. Ukrainian General Oleksiy Gromov said the new weapons were critical to Ukrainian strikes and singled out U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) that Kyiv began receiving last month. He said: “We are decreasing the enemy’s potential, hitting his logistics supply, hitting his ammunition... The enemy is being forced to change its system for supplying ammunition and fuel. “Right now the enemy is looking at placing brigade-level ammunition dumps no closer than 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the front line, and depots at corps-level at distances of over 150 km.” Russian military trucks were spotted delivering the blockhouses to invaded areas within Ukraine. Vladimir Putin ’s army has imposed an “operational pause” on exhausted troops. At least 14 Russian Colonels have died in five months of fighting as well as a dozen of Putin’s Generals, in a staggering blow to Putin’s military. Ukraine officials say the total troop losses for Russia are edging towards the bloody milestone of 40,000, at 37,870 and counting. Other Russian losses, which soar by the day, include 1667 tanks, 219 warplanes, 188 helicopters and 678 drones. And Kyiv’s SBU spy and counter-intelligence agency has revealed it is intercepting increasing mobile phone conversations between Russian troops complaining about the war. Most of the complaints relate to suffering a lack of equipment with which to fight Ukraine, whose troops are counter-attacking in the east.",49,3.433580886352299,3.086611214109613,0.34696967224268604,27

As well switching to using KH-22 anti-ship weapons to blast shopping malls they have now started redirecting ground-to-air-defence missiles. It has led to escalating fears more civilians will be hit and killed as inappropriate missiles are notoriously inaccurate. In Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, the city has been hammered with devastating blasts from Russian anti-air weapons. On Friday morning Kim Vitaly, head of Mykolaiv region, announced the new threat after investigating the new strikes. Using the term “Rashist” which Ukrainians use to reference Russia ’s ruthless expansionism he said: “As you know, the Rashists are increasingly shelling Mykolaiv and the region. “On the morning of July 8, the city was also shelled. “The rocket attacks became more frequent, we started trying to find out how it happened and why.” He said the Russians: “... are remaking S-300 missiles, there are a lot of them, they put GPS on them to shoot at the ground, it is not accurate because of that. “And they shoot 12 rockets each, they took on villages, in particular Berezneguvate.” He said that large buildings: “ . . .are being smashed, so be careful, listen to the air alarm.” It follows an attack last month on a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine’s Kremenchuk city which killed at least 20 people. That strike involved the firing of a KH-22 rocket from a Russian bomber, usually aimed at large maritime target like aircraft carriers. One UK source said: “Increasingly Russia seems to be falling back on inaccurate weaponry, simply to cause terror and mass damage. “Using redirected ground to air missiles to hit a ground target will be and is being very inacurate so there is little strategy except to kill indiscriminately. “It makes little strategic sense but does cause alarm. It seems this is a developing pattern that Russia is throwing everything it has to hand at Ukraine.” But on Friday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his troops remain strong and defiant. He said he had visited frontline troops in central Ukraine and added: “Spoke with our defenders, presented them with awards. “Their mood is determined, it’s in their eyes- confidence in our victory. “Thank you for fighting for the freedom of Ukraine.”",49,3.284489582842184,3.5618810865585218,-0.2773915037163377,26

While the video does not show immediate damage to aircraft, Ukrainian defences claim it was shot down in Zhytomyr, in the northwest of Ukraine. The aircraft is reportedly a Russian Kamov KA-52 helicopter and was attacked by soldiers from the Ukrainian 95th Air Assault Brigade, using a Martlet, known as Starstreak in the UK. Footage captures the moment the aircraft is intercepted and shot by enemy troops. The short clip has been shared widely, but there have been no details about when the missile struck or the number of deaths. The Russian single-seat attack helicopter has been dubbed the 'Black Shark' and was once described as Russia's 'deadliest helicopter' because of its battlefield management system which allows it to share data with other aircraft to coordinate attack operations. It has been reported that within 30 seconds of the Martlet being launched, it was hit. High-tech Starstreak missiles can hit targets the size of a tennis ball travelling at the speed of sound. The missiles are short-range, man-portable, air-defence systems and are optimised to provide defence against air threats. They can be configured to be used in man-portable and vehicle-mounted battlefield roles. Earlier this month, Britain vowed to join the US in sending further long-range missile systems to Ukraine to help in the fight against the Kremlin's forces. The British Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces continue to disrupt Russian command and control ""with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines."" This attack on the high-tech Russian helicopter comes after at least 18 civilians were killed when a Russian missile struck a crowded shopping mall in Ukraine's central city of Kremenchuk on Monday. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said as many as 1,000 people were shopping at the time of the attack and it is unlikely that many people will be found alive in the rubble. Firefighters and soldiers were seen in horrifying footage pulling out mangled pieces of metal and wading through rubble as they searched for survivors. Mr Zelensky said it was impossible to “expect decency and humanity” from Moscow and that the shopping mall presented “no threat to the Russian army."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the attack demonstrated “once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink.""",49,3.512791557918043,3.838637936874324,-0.3258463789562813,26

With around 1,000 people inside shopping at the time of the explosions President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was ""impossible to imagine"" how many victims there would be in the end. The entire mall in Kremenchuk erupted into flames following the blast caused by two rockets. Harrowing pictures shared on social media showed huge flames billowing from the building as teams launched a massive rescue operation for those trapped inside. Senior Ukrainian officials say 16 people were killed in the atrocity along with 59 more wounded. ""This is the sixth time the city has been bombed"" since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, said Oleksandr Kovalenko, deputy director of the surgery department at Kremenchuk's public hospital. ""But never before did it hit so many people."" The hospital is treating 25 people injured in the attack, six of them in critical condition, he said. The strike drew a global outcry, with leaders of the Group of Seven major democracies, gathered for a summit in Germany, condemning it as ""abominable"". ""This is not an accidental hit, this is a calculated Russian strike,"" President Zelensky said in an evening video address. He said the death count could rise. He estimated around 1,000 people were in the mall at the time of the strike. The city had a population of 217,000 before the invasion. People lined up at a hotel near the mall to register the names of those missing. More than 40 people had been reportedmissing, Ukraine's prosecutor general's office said. Rescue workers continued to sift through the rubble to look for survivors. One patient in the hospital's general ward, Ludmyla Mykhailets, 43, said she was shopping at an electronics store with her husband, Mykola, when the blast threw her into the air. ""I flew head first and splinters hit my body. The whole place was collapsing. Then I landed on the floor and I don't know if I was conscious or unconscious,"" she said, adding she had broken her arm and split her head open. ""It was hell,"" added Mykola, 45, blood seeping through a bandage wrapped around his head. Outside the hospital, a small group of mall workers were filled with worry and grief, but also relief. Meanwhile, Russian media dismissed the attacks as a ""fake"" operation, claiming those spotted running from the scene in terror were extras. State TV war reporter Andrey Rudenko said: “These freaks are back to provocations. “The shopping mall in Kremenchuk, with allegedly thousands of people inside it. Videos show an empty car park with just a couple of cars. Was this a working shopping centre, there would have been lots of cars. ""Were there people inside the centre, and were they to be wounded or killed, then there would be no way these cars would be cleared away. ""There is a feeling of a crowd of ‘extras’, similar to football fans or something like it. ""Conclusion: there is a sense they set it up themselves, or shot it for a strong pictures but they didn’t do it properly, again.” Similar claims have been dismissed out of hand by Russian media over a number of atrocities since the outbreak of war. Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned Vladimir Putin's ""cruelty and barbarism"" following the missile attack. He added: ""This appalling attack has shown once again the depths of cruelty and barbarism to which the Russian leader will sink. ""Once again our thoughts are with the families of innocent victims in Ukraine. Putin must realise his behaviour will do nothing but strengthen the resolve of the Ukraine and every other G7 country to stand by the Ukraine for as long as it takes."" It comes as it is was reported hundreds of thousands of NATO troops will be switched to high-readiness alert following Russia 's invasion of Ukraine. Alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg revealed more than 300,000 forces will be stood up to the category - a huge boost from the 40,000 in the coalition’s existing response force. The announcement came as NATO leaders prepare to descend on Madrid for a crunch summit tomorrow. Speaking at a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Mr Stoltenberg pledged a “fundamental shift in NATO’s deterrence and defence”. He said: ""We will transform the NATO response force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000.” The measure is designed at bolstering defences on the 30-member alliance’s eastern flank, where Baltic states border Russia.

Paratrooper commander Colonel Andrei Vasilyev, 49, was killed in an attack on Friday night. His death is one of the first from the new 43-mile-range weapons sent to Ukraine by President Joe Biden. He was in an advanced command post of the Russian army’s airborne assault troops, but the location was not specified. Vasilyev was commander of the 137th Guards Airborne Regiment of the 106th Guards Airborne Division, based in Ryazan. Married with a daughter, he had been awarded the Russian Order of Courage on other honours. Footage shows the launch of the first HIMARS missiles in Ukraine late last week. It is unclear whether this is the strike that killed Vasilyev in the Friday attack. A separate HIMARS attack on Izyum, Kharkiv region hit a Russian base, killing or wounding 40-plus, according to Ukraine. Russian military holed up in a school in Izyum were hit by the new missile which which has a range of around 43 miles. The blast wreaked havoc at the old school site which was said to be used as a Russian command post. Smoke was seen billowing from small fires surrounding the school where windows were smashed and debris covered the floor. It was the precision-guided weapon's first hit on Russian military command position. The 55th colonel to die was Lt-Col Sergey Gundorov, 51, whose helicopter was seen crashing in an inferno near Volnovakha in the Donbas, after being hit with a portable surface-to-air missile. His stricken Mi-35 touched the ground before cartwheeling over a narrow strip of woodland and crashing in a fireball in a field. Putin has also lost at least 11 generals. Overall Russian losses are believed to be in excess of 30,000, with some estimates of nearer to 50,000. Monday marked 124 days since Putin's troops invaded Ukraine on February 24. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has called for a more modern air defence system for his country after a string of deadly attacks on the capital of Kyiv. Other regions that have been severely hit include Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Lviv. Elsewhere in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol, more than 100 bodies were found in a house, according to the mayor’s adviser Piotr Andryushchenko.

Footage shows the havoc wrought at the school which was being used as a command post by Vladimir Putin 's forces, it is claimed. Ukraine believes at least 40 Russian military personnel were struck in the attack in Izyum, in the Kharkiv region. Small fires surrounded the site where windows were smashed and debris covered the ground. It is the first hit on Russian military command position by the weapon, which is precision guided with medium range. The strike, on Izyum Lyceum No 2, involved the HIMARS High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems which have a range of around 43 miles. They were from the 20th Army of the Russian Armed Forces’ Western Military District, unit 89425, originally based in Voronezh. ""All personnel stationed at the command post were demilitarised - over 40 people,"" a spokesperson for Ukraine said. Russia acknowledged the attack was by the US-supplied HIMARS. The Kremlin claimed the strike had hit a hospital, and that the Ukrainian claim was intended “to appease a panicking Ukrainian army with illusory victories”. However, Russian military vehicles seen outside the school suggest it was being used for military purposes by the invading army. Earlier footage had been released showing what was claimed to be the first deployment of HIMARS by the Ukrainians. Footage also emerged on Monday of the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu visiting frontlines in Ukraine for the first time. Shoigu, 67, made his first visit to an undisclosed Ukrainian location to speak with troops in the war zone and seek to reassert control over the war in Ukraine. Russia did not disclose the location but there is strong speculation he was in blitzkrieg Mariupol which his forces have captured from Ukraine. Russian state TV boasted that Shoigu would be making future visits to major cities including Kyiv, Odesa and Mykolaiv once Russia’s invasion has seized Ukraine’s major cities.

Mikhail Romanov, a 32-year-old Russian soldier, is accused of murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife in front of her child in the Kyiv capital region. The suspect will be tried in absentia as his whereabouts are unknown. Some say he could be still fighting in Ukraine, back in Russia or even dead. Iryna Venediktova, the prosecutor general, said: “We don’t know where he is – maybe he’s fighting still, maybe he’s on rotation in the Russian Federation, maybe he is dead. ""We don’t know but we want to prosecute him in absentia.” Romanov is believed to have been serving with the 239th regiment of the 90th Guards Tank Division at the time. After a preliminary hearing in Kyiv on Thursday, prosecutor Oksana Kalyus told reporters that the woman requested for the trial to be held behind closed doors because of concerns for her privacy. It is alleged that Romanov and another soldier shot dead the husband, named Oleksiy, at point-blank range in the village of Bohdanivka, northeast of the capital. They then raped Oleksiy's wife and then returned twice to rape her again, it is alleged. She told the Times: “[The younger soldier] told me to take my clothes off. Then they both raped me, one after the other."" “They didn’t care that my son was in the boiler room crying.” Kalyus said Ukraine would ask for his arrest if he was to leave Russia for a third country. “If he crosses the border, he will be arrested and delivered to Ukraine,” she said. The trial comes as the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission reports that allegations of conflict-related sexual violence by Russian troops in Ukraine are mounting. A prosecutor working on sexual violence cases told Reuters that up to 50 crimes were being investigated. However, the number of true cases since the invasion began on February 24 is likely to be much higher. One woman told BBC News her horrifying ordeal when she had been at home with her husband on March 7 when a foreign soldier barged in. ""At gunpoint, he took me to a house nearby. He ordered me: 'Take your clothes off or I'll shoot you.' He kept threatening to kill me if I didn't do as he said. Then he started raping me,"" she said. She continued: ""While he was raping me, four more soldiers entered. I thought that I was done for. But they took him [her husband] away. I never saw him again."" Venediktova told Reuters that even if Romanov was not in Ukrainian custody, it was important that the trial went ahead. The first war crimes trial was held last month in Ukraine and a 21-year-old Russian soldier was sentenced to life in jail for killing an unarmed civilian.",45,6.269345081720943,6.241962202095411,0.027382879625532652,14

Shoigu, 67, made his first visit to an undisclosed Ukrainian location to speak with troops in the war zone and seek to reassert control over the war in Ukraine. Russia did not disclose the location but there is strong speculation he was in blitzkrieg Mariupol which his forces have captured from Ukraine. Russian state TV boasted that Shoigu would be making future visits to major cities including Kyiv, Odesa and Mykolaiv once Russia’s invasion has seized Ukraine’s major cities. The defence minister is an army general seen as a likely successor to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his visit was seen as a way to send an ""I’m in control"" message on his first war zone visit. In March, Shoigu disappeared for several weeks amid claims he had suffered a heart attack or undergone surgery. But on his frontline visit, he was shown barking out orders to aides who obediently were writing down his instructions. He handed out medals for heroism and told troops: “I am confident in you. “You have many more glorious deeds ahead of you for the benefit of our fatherland, the armed forces and the airborne troops. “Congratulations. Take care of yourselves."" The defence ministry issued a statement following his visit, saying: ""At the command posts of Russian units, Army General Sergei Shoigu heard reports from the commanders on the current situation and actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the main operational areas."" The Russian warmonger Putin has not yet visited the war zone, unlike risky trips made by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Some analysts believe this is due to his own health problems which are limiting his public appearances. However, the 69-year-old was seen at a number of engagements last week and is due this week to travel to Central Asia for meetings with leaders of ex-Soviet states. The secret Shoigu mission came amid speculation that the defence minister has lost control of war tactics to a succession of generals as Putin rotates in his favourites and then tires of them. Colonel-General Sergei Surovikin is said to have replaced Alexandr Dvornikov who was earlier ordered by Putin to rescue his failing war effort. Speaking on the changes, the British Ministry of Defence said: ""For over thirty years, Surovikin’s career has been dogged with allegations of corruption and brutality."" Chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov also appears to have been sidelined. One Western observer said: “Shoigu is seen looking far more assertive and active than we have seen during the entirety of the war.” Russian state TV played up the Shoigu visit with ‘propagandist’ Vladimir Solovyov and said the Ukrainians had failed to notice his arrival or seek to strike him with a Tochka-U missile. Solovyov told viewers: “[Russian defence minister] Sergey Shoigu has arrived in the area of the special military operation. “Just look. Calmly arrived. Here is [Shoigu] - well done, looks good. They calmly talked - [no] Tochka-U missiles hit them. “Calmly in the deNazified, demilitarised, liberated from the Nazis territories, [Shoigu] talks to people. All is fine. He easily gets there. “That is, all is good. And I think we will calmly come soon to Kyiv, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.” Shoigu flew in on a military helicopter and paid special attention to the organisation of comprehensive support for hostilities, his ministry said. It continued that he also focused on the ""necessary living conditions for Russian military personnel at temporary deployment points."" Leading Putin foe Leonid Nevzlin warned that Western weakness risks disaster for the world. He said: “If in the very near future the West does not resolve the issue with Putin by military-political means, then he will win this war and establish his own rules of the game throughout the world.”",7,3.5327649624915067,3.4133881118628238,0.11937685062868297,24

Putin's cronies could already be lurking in the wings if Russia's invasion of Ukraine fails, with concerns and speculation mounting over the president's health. Sergei Shoigu, Russian Defence Minister and a close Putin-ally, may be central to a mutiny to overthrow the president, according to ex-CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman. He added that if anyone is going to overthrow Putin then it'll be done in secret so that he doesn't find them and kill them first. “Nobody’s gonna ask, ‘Hey Vladimir, would you like to leave?’ No. It’s a f***ing hammer to the head and he’s dead. Or it’s time to go to the sanatorium,” Hoffman told The Daily Beast. “They schwack him for it. That’s what they’ll do.” Hoffman has said there are three key players to keep an eye on if Putin is to be replaced, with Nikolai Patrushev, the chief of Putin's Security Council, potentially top of the list. Others include Alexander Bortnikov, the director of Russia's secretive intelligence agency FSB and Sergei Shoigu, considered by some as the most probable replacement. Putin's position could be under threat if the country's economy turns south, the country loses more soldiers or general unrest unravels. However, should Putin be toppled, then Ronald Marks, another ex-CIA agent, fears there could be a huge power struggle in Russia, with chaos ensuing in Moscow. “It wouldn’t go to hell right away. We’re not talking about tanks in the street right away. What you’re probably going to see though is among the guys around him, there will be a struggle to take that job,"" he warned the Daily Beast. Russia is believed to have lost up to 10 generals in the war in Ukraine and as many as 30 senior officers. Latest estimates also suggest that as many as 30,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in action and up to 100,000 have been injured, with the conflict rumbling on for four months. Russia has reportedly lost over 4,000 tanks and armoured vehicles, 216 combat aircraft, 183 attack helicopters and 620 drones. There has been speculation about Putin's health in Russia and, while there is "" no immediate threat "", there is more ""chatter"" about his future, according to Western officials. Officials believe the 2024 Presidential election is ""looking more interesting than it did six months ago"", with younger people more skeptical of the Kremlin's rhetoric around Ukraine than the older generations in remote areas, who are generally more supportive of the regime. Meanwhile, Ukrainian intelligence also feels Putin could be ousted as his inner-circle looks to take control, The Sun reports. Alexander Bortnikov could be the chosen successor should Putin be overthrown, especially if the Ukrainians can push Russian troops out and away from the Donbas region.",7,4.010794752668991,4.428964871635308,-0.41817011896631673,24

The warmongering Russian President said Russia's Iskander-M systems are able to use normal and more deadly weapons. In a chilling broadcast he said they ""can fire ballistic and cruise missiles, both conventional and nuclear types"". The Kremlin claims they are able to reach a distance of up to 500km (310 miles). Missiles have become a means of threatening the West since relations with Russia have worsened after Putin's invasion Ukraine by Russian forces on February 24. The Russian president has referenced nuclear weapons on several occasions which many have seen as a warning about getting involved in the war between Russia and Ukraine. He said Russia would assist in modifying Belarusian SU-25 warplanes to carry nuclear weapons in response Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. In a televised broadcast Putin said: ""We have made a decision: within the next few months we will hand over to Belarus the Iskander-M tactical missile systems."" Ukraine said enemy forces had ""fully occupied"" Severodonetsk, after weeks fighting between Ukraine and Russian troops. It means Russia controls most of the Luhansk region pus nearby Donetsk in the Donbas region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed to take back ""all our cities"" in a video address on Saturday night. He admitted the war had reached an emotionally difficult stage and was uncertain many more losses would be endured. A series of missiles targeted the north and west of Ukraine killing at least three, but local officials said there may be more people underneath debris in Sarny west of Kyiv. Ukraine claimed some missiles came from Belarus which has given logistical support to Russia but is not involved in the fighting, The strikes were part of Kremlin efforts to draw Belarus into the war, Ukraine claimed. Severodonetsk's capture comes ahead of a period of Western diplomacy which will see US President Joe Biden flying to Germany for a G7 summit before talks with Nato. It will involve a week of talks to try and prevent the war escalating further as it moves into a new period. Earlier today The Mirror told how one person died and five more were left injured as Kyiv came under fire from Russian troops for the first time in three weeks. The missile strikes, rained down on a kindergarten in the capital city early this morning before rescue crews pulled women and children, including a seven year old girl, from the rubble. It is the first attack by Vladimir Putin's forces on Kyiv since June 5. Several blasts rang through the city at around 6.30am as fire crews battled flames and rescued civilians from a nine-storey apartment building in the central Shevchenkivskiy district. Debris was strewn over parked cars outside a smouldering building with a crater in its roof while a private kindergarten had smashed windows and a large blast crater by a playground about 400 metres away, Reuters said.

Many Ukrainians have told on social media of heavy shelling with Kharkiv targeted on the east but also Lviv has been bombed on the west and the Ukrainian capital Kyiv has had some of its worst attacks since March. Air raid sirens have been ringing out throughout the night in major cities in Ukraine while there have also been claims that shelling has come from the direction of Russia's ally Belarus. One person said of bombings in Zhytomyr, to the west of Kyiv, that it has been the worst so far. ""Zhytomyr is being blown apart today, we have already had three or four attacks (and I am even quiet now about explosions, there are already so many of them that I don't take notice). You sit and think it has stopped and then it starts again. Never before has our city been sieged like this. I hope it is okay with you,"" she wrote on Twitter. One person in Kyiv said she had heard 11 explosions and another heard fighter jets over the Ukrainian capital. Similarly a Twitter user wrote: ""A series of powerful explosions in Kyiv, new blasts are rocking Zhytomyr. A massive missile attack was carried out on targets in the capital and we don't know what the results are. ""We can hear air defence missiles in the sky with missiles from aircraft probably from Belarus."" Some have also posted images from Kyiv which appear to show missiles in the sky. It comes as Ukraine is set to pull its troops from the ruined city of Sievierodonetsk after weeks of street fighting and bombardment, in what would be a significant gain for Russia as it grinds out its offensive in the east. Russian troops also occupied a town about six miles further south, both sides said on Friday, as Moscow closed in on the last slivers of Ukrainian-held territory in the industrial region of Luhansk. Moscow said it had encircled about 2,000 Ukrainian and what it called foreign troops in the area. At the same time Russian strikes this week on Kharkiv, near the Russian border, have been the worst for weeks in an area where normal life had been returning since Ukraine pushed Moscow's forces back last month. Volodymyr Zelensky had warned the fighting may escalate this week with the EU summit on Thursday where European leaders approved Ukraine's formal candidature to join the Union. The decision led Russia on Friday to say it would have negative consequences and amounted to the EU's ""enslaving"" neighbouring countries. Russia has long opposed closer links between Ukraine, a former Soviet state, and Western clubs like the EU and the NATO military alliance. ""There were massive air and artillery strikes in Donbas,"" Zelensky said in a video address released early Thursday, adding Russia wants ""to destroy the entire Donbas step by step.""",47,3.2179834981156232,3.8908781036289866,-0.6728946055133633,21

Images obtained from Pavlo Kirilenko, the Ukrainian Head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration, show School Number 6 in Avdiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk, on fire after being hit by Russian military. During the night of Monday, 20 June, the school was blasted by incendiary bombs as it became the third school in the area to be attacked. Mr Kirilenko said: ""Last night, the invaders fired at her with the shells of the RSZO 'Grad' with a magnesium charge."" Magnesium charges are typically used in incendiary bombs and missiles Incendiary weapons are only banned by international treaties if used against civilian populations. Kirilenko added: ""This is the third school destroyed by the Russians in Avdiivka. In total, the occupants [have] destroyed about two hundred schools in [the] Donetsk region. ""And not to tell their hellish, rashist propaganda about 'release' and 'denazification', the truth is that Russian Orcs have come to our land to destroy and kill. Civilians first and foremost."" Ukrainian forces regularly refer to the Russian troops as 'rashists', a combination of the words 'Russian' and 'racist', and as 'orcs'. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24th February in what the Kremlin is calling a ""special military operation"". The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that between 24th February and 21st June, Russia had lost about 34,100 personnel, 1,496 tanks. Along with 3,606 armoured combat vehicles, 752 artillery units, 239 multiple launch rocket systems, 98 air defence systems, 216 warplanes, 181 helicopters. And 611 drones, 137 cruise missiles, 14 warships, 2,537 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 59 units of special equipment. Russia has conducted an anti-ship missile exercise in the Baltic Sea amid escalating tensions with NATO member Lithuania after the country blocked the transit of goods to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Ukrainian forces have said that they have been successfully thwarting fresh Russian attempts to advance in the Kharkiv region of north-eastern Ukraine. And Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories, has urged locals in the Kherson region to evacuate the area so as to help Ukrainian forces ""deoccupy"" the area. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Ukraine's southern frontline as Ukrainian forces mount a counter attack in the region to push back Russian troops. The new head of the British Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, has told British forces that they need to be ready to face Russia on the battlefield and said the British Army now needs to be capable of defeating Russia. United States President Joe Biden has promised Kyiv another USD 1 billion in security assistance and weapons. And US General Mark Milley says Russia has lost around 20 to 30 per cent of its armoured force during the ongoing invasion. President Zelenskyy said that a ""historic week"" has begun as Kyiv awaits a decision from Brussels regarding its EU candidate status. Zelenskyy, speaking to the African Union on Monday, 20th June, also accused Russia of holding Africa ""hostage"" over grain and fertiliser shortages. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi held talks in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with President Zelenskyy on 16th June. Former Russian president and staunch Vladimir Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev has derided French, German and Italian leaders visiting the Ukrainian capital Kyiv as ""fans of frogs, liverwurst and spaghetti"".

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the West must increase the supply of weapons to liberate the Donbas region from Russian control. He said the costs of the conflict, including energy and food hikes, were high but the price of letting Moscow triumph was even greater. He said: “We must prepare for the fact that it could take years. We must not let up in supporting Ukraine.” On a trip to the heavily bombed Black Sea city of Mykolaiv, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said: “We will not give away the south to anyone, we will return everything that’s ours.” British defence chiefs say four months of brutal fighting in Ukraine seems to be straining troop morale on both sides.Russian soldiers are deserting and defying orders, even staging armed stand-offs with superior officers. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “Russian morale highly likely remains especially troubled”. He added that many Russian soldiers of all ranks “likely remain confused about the war’s objectives”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “Everything will depend on whether Ukraine can strengthen its ability to defend its soil faster than Russia can renew its capacity to attack.” There is growing concern for British combat medic John Harding, 59, not seen since being captured by pro-Russian forces last month in Mariupol.

Colonel-General Andrey Serdyukov, 60, has paid the price of devastating “mass casualties” among paratroopers, it was alleged. The speculation comes as one Russian source suggested the country’s overall losses in Ukraine are close to 50,000 - significantly higher than most other estimates. Unconfirmed Ukrainian sources cited by Odessa military-civilian spokesman Serhiy Bratchuk say that Putin has axed Serdyukov and replaced him with Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky, 53, current chief of staff of the Central Military District who was born in Donetsk region. Serdyukov was sanctioned by Britain as having Ukrainian blood on his hands in the wake of the Bucha horrors. If his axing is true this “would indicate that Serdyukov is being held responsible for the poor performance of, and high casualties, among Russian [airborne] units, particularly in early operations around Kyiv. “Continued dismissals and possible internal purges of senior Russian officers will likely further degrade poor Russian command and control capabilities and the confidence of Russian officers.” There has been no indication from Moscow that Serdyukov has been ousted. He is a ""Hero of Russia "" - the country’s highest honour - and is seen as one of the country’s ablest military minds. Izvestia said he commanded the operation to annex Crimea from Ukraine in the spring of 2014. Russia has announced very few of the myriad changes Putin has made among commanders during the war which started on 24 February. But several sources claim that Putin is personally micromanaging war decisions and wielding the axe on commanders he sees as under performing. Telegram channel General SVR alleged that the overall Russian army toll in the Ukraine conflict is now 37,592. Add to this were the alleged losses of 9,457 fighters from private military companies backing the Russian war effort, said the channel. Additionally, the Russian national guard - which reports directly to Putin - has suffered 1,788 losses, it claimed. The channel said that these figures had been reported directly to Putin, but provided no evidence of this. It was not possible to verify this claim. If correct, it would mean overall military losses of 48,837.

Defiant Kyiv ignored Moscow’s surrender demands as Russia continued to attack with rockets, mortars and machine guns. More than 500 civilians, including 40 children, are stranded at the Azot chemical plant. If the ruined city falls, President Vladimir Putin will celebrate the capture of Luhansk, one of two contested Donbas regions. Severodonetsk has for weeks been the main focal point of the war and more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops are defending the position. Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk said: “We are trying to push the enemy towards the city centre... this is an ongoing situation with partial successes and tactical retreats. The escape routes are dangerous, but there are some.” The Azot bombardment echoes the siege of the Azovstal steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, which fell to Putin’s forces last month. Moscow claims Donbas on behalf of separatists and re-focused its assault there after failing to take Ukraine 's capital. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told fellow NATO defence ministers in Brussels the invasion was at a “pivotal moment”. He added: “We can’t afford to let up and we can’t lose steam. The stakes are high.” Demanding more weapons from the ministers, President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “We have to hold strong.” Kyiv is losing 100 to 200 soldiers a day, while Russia is said to have lost 31,000 since the February 31 invasion. Moscow recently lost its 53rd and 54th colonels in the conflict, it was revealed.

The private, 46-year-old Sergei who wanted to be known only by his last name in line with military rules in the region, had left his bunker to smoke but had a breeze out his cigarette. “I took one step around the wall to get out of the wind exactly when there was an explosion,” he said. “If I hadn’t been trying to light my cigarette I’d be dead."" The dad-of-one, a Russian-born welder, was concussed by the 120mm artillery shell blast in Rubizhne, The Sun reports. The city is now under Kremlin control. Sergei signed up for his adopted homeland when the war began in February. According to Sergei, Chechen forces loyal to their leader along with Putin stooge Ramzan Kadyrov had fought his men in street-to-street battles. “They put their guns over compound walls and sprayed bullets,” he added. “We were a few metres away. We threw grenades.” The soldier was dismissive of how difficult life was on the front line, saying it was “just like dangerous camping”. “The hardest thing was the Russian bodies because they just left them,” he said. News of the hero’s survival comes amid reports of Russian forces swarming into the neary city of Severodonetsk on Monday, bombing an area sheltering hundreds of civilians and mirroring the horror Mariupol assault. Moscow’s troops now control about 70% of the key city, which sits northwest of Rubizhne. Troops are reportedly trying to cut off around 500 locals sheltering in an industrial complex - just like Mariupol. The assault on the ruined Luhanks city - whose toppling will mark a major Russian victory - underlined a desperate race for western weapons to get to Ukraine’s frontline. Pro-Moscow separatists claimed the last bridge out of Severodonetsk had been destroyed and Ukrainian defenders there must now surrender or die. Ukraine said there was still another way out via the city’s last remaining bridge although that route was severely damaged. Ukraine has issued increasingly urgent calls for more Western weapons to help defend Severodonetsk, which Kyiv says is a battle for control of the eastern Donbas region. Regional governor Sergei Gadai said:""The battles are so fierce that fighting for not just a street but for a single high-rise building can last for days.” He said: ""Russians continue to storm the city, having a significant advantage in artillery they have somewhat pushed back the Ukrainian soldiers.

2022-06-14,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/fears-vladimir-putin-restart-ussr-27231998,Fears Vladimir Putin will restart USSR nuclear base to launch new atomic weapons,"Suspicions have emerged over an old Soviet nuclear missile base in Belarus which is thought to be being readied to host Vladimir Putin ’s latest deadly atomic weapons. An “inspection” of the abandoned 369th missile regiment facility took place on Sunday, it has been claimed. In Soviet times, missiles that could cause “dozens of Hiroshimas” were based here. This might be the case again in coming times, though this would be even more devastating if Putin’s hypersonic nuclear missiles like Sarmat - Satan-2 - and Tsirkon (Zircon) are deployed. A referendum in Belarus in February permitted the country to host nuclear weapons once more, and permanently act as a base for Russian troops. The old nuclear weapons base, Zhitkovichi, is near Cheretyanka village, in the Gomel region of Belarus which borders Ukraine. Military unit 42691, call sign ‘Sad’, hosted nuclear weapons from 1959 until 1996, five years after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Belarus in 1996 gave up its inherited nuclear arsenal which was returned to Moscow. The revelation of a recent “inspection” at the base came from Belaruski Hajun Telegram channel, which monitors military activity. An Mi-8 helicopter of the Belarusian Armed Forces took off from an air base in Machyulishchi to former military unit 41738 near the village of Volma (Minsk region) where so-called 'Platform 400. Dome' is located, the command centre of Russia's Armed Forces in Belarus,” said the channel. “At 14:50 that same helicopter took off from 'Dome' to Cheretyanka village, where the abandoned 369th regiment of strategic missile forces (military unit 42691) is located, and at around 17:00 it returned from Cheretyanka to Machyulishchi.” The facility is around 1,195 miles from London, 165 miles from Kyiv, and 466 miles from Moscow. It could be the most westerly base, with direct train connections used by Russians for nuclear weapons if they are again stationed here. Kaliningrad exclave is closer to Western capitals but is wedged between Lithuania, Poland and the Baltic Sea. However, images show the base would need massive revamping to be equipped once more as a nuclear arsenal base. “At the moment it is unknown whether repair work has begun there or not,” said Belaruski Hajun Telegram channel, which surmised that it may be necessary to. In the past, the Topol strategic missile system was deployed here by the USSR. So was the RSD-10 Pioneer intermediate-range ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead. The channel noted that “over the past week several passenger aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces arrived in Belarus”. Among them were a Tu-134 (RF-66053), which flew in on June 11 at 10.10am and left on June 12 at 6.50pm, and a Tu-154B (RA-85554), which arrived on June 8 at 1.30pm and left on the same day at 5.55pm for Perm. A video from the site shows its rundown state some five years ago. Reserve Colonel Mikhail Yakimets, the last political officer of the 369th missile regiment before it was disbanded, said it was once capable of triggering Armageddon. “It comprised nine mobile-based ICBMs capable of launching missiles, both from stationary and field positions, equipped with nuclear charges of enormous destructive power. In other words, dozens of Hiroshimas,"" he said. ""'Almost 1,000 officers, warrant officers, soldiers [were based here]. “These were professionals, proficient in the most complex military equipment...""

Digital technology experts and an international team of academics have tracked down the thefts and have already detected patterns in the crimes, it is thought many of them have been traced back to the Kremlin. The main target for the Russian criminals appears to be Scythian gold, which heralds from a former region of central Eurasia around where around 2,000 years ago, nomadic tribes produced works of art and gold jewellery. Many treasures have been found at burial sites and some important ones remain in the countries where they were found, including in Kyiv, namely at the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, the Institute of Archaeology, and the State Historical Archaeological Preserve. ""The Russians have taken hold of our Scythian gold. This is one of the largest and most expensive collections in Ukraine, and today we don't know where they took it,"" said Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol during a national telethon, according to the news site Ukrinform. According to Leila Ibrahimova, the director of the Melitopol Museum of Local History, told the New York Times that she and other staff members secretly hid the gold and some other historic artefacts in cardboard boxes. She said they found still managed to find and steal artefacts including at least 198 gold items. Ibrahimova said that she was held captive for over two weeks by Russians. Another museum employee named Galina Andriivna Kucher was abducted on April 30 after she refused to give information about the rest of the museum's Scythian collection, Eskender Bariiev, a Ukrainian activist, wrote Facebook. Brian Daniels, an anthropologist working with archaeologists, historians and digital imaging specialists, told the Observer that there is very strong evidence this is a calculated Russian move, with specific paintings and ornaments targeted and taken out to Russia. He continued: ""These items are visually stunning, and there are now so many reports of thefts it is evident that it is a strategy. The Ukrainians, of course, are also very keen that we establish a list of stolen items.” Daniels said it was hard to know if the monetary value was the most important factor for the Russians, or whether the objects were chosen for their cultural significance.

Niinisto said during security policy talks at his summer residence in Naantali, Finland, that Russia has begun to use ""very powerful"" weapons, including illegal thermobaric bombs ""that are in fact weapons of mass destruction"". Ukraine and NATO countries have also accused Russia of using thermobaric bombs, which are also known as vacuum bombs and have much more brutal consequences than conventional explosives. A CIA report said thermobaric bombs can cause ""many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness.” The pressure wave from the explosive destroys delicate air sacs or can cause an embolism, as the wide area of the ignited particles makes people 'suck in' oxygen in the first stage of the blast. Niinisto's remarks come as new evidence shows scores of civilians have been killed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv by indiscriminate Russian shelling using widely banned cluster munitions. Amnesty International said in a new report that Russian forces caused widespread death and destruction by relentlessly bombarding residential neighbourhoods in the city. Amnesty found evidence of Russian forces repeatedly using 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions which are subject to international treaty bans because of their indiscriminate effects. They also used unguided rockets - such as Grads and Uragans - which have a margin of error of more than 100 metres, all of which are banned under international law. In residential areas where buildings are no more than a few metres apart, inaccuracies are much more likely to cost civilian lives and cause widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure. The human rights group said: ""The continued use of such inaccurate explosive weapons in populated civilian areas, in the knowledge that they are repeatedly causing large numbers of civilian casualties, may even amount to directing attacks against the civilian population."" Veronica Cherevychko, a 30-year-old logistics manager, lost her right leg when a Grad rocket struck a playground in front of her home in the Saltivka neighbourhood, in the northeastern region of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine. She told Amnesty: “I was sitting on this bench when the explosion happened. I remember hearing a whistling sound just before the explosion. ""Then I woke up in hospital, without a leg; my right leg was gone. Now my life is divided into before 12 March and after 12 March. I will get used to this.

Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces.” Amnesty has accused Putin and his army of committing war crimes in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, as they use banned cluster bombs and carry out indiscriminate attacks, killing hundreds of civilians. The human rights group found evidence of Russian forces repeatedly using international banned weaponry such as 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions and scatterable mines. The report said: “The people of Kharkiv have faced a relentless barrage of indiscriminate attacks in recent months, which killed and injured hundreds of civilians. “The repeated use of widely banned cluster munitions is shocking, and a further indication of utter disregard for civilian lives. The Russian forces responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable for their actions, and victims and their families must receive full reparations.""",49,3.9345013071946364,3.8038478950798056,0.13065341211483084,26

According to the Ministry of Defence, the five-and-a-half-ton missiles, designed to target aircraft carriers, are causing ""significant collateral damage and civilian casualties"" to Ukraine's forces in the Donbas region. “When employed in a ground-attack role with a conventional warhead they are highly inaccurate and can, therefore, cause significant collateral damage and civilian casualties,” said the MoD. It comes as the Russian army concentrates its efforts on capturing the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Ukraine remains in control of the Azot chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, which makes up half of Donbas, where hundreds of civilians are sheltering amid bitter fighting, the region's governor said. Russian shelling has ignited a fire at the plant after a leak of tonnes of oil, according to the governor, Serhiy Haidai. Ukraine has around 800 people hiding in bomb shelters underneath the plant, including about 200 employees and 600 local residents, with fears Azot could become another Azovstal – in reference to the siege in the Mariupol steelworks that lasted weeks. The MoD said that there was now “intense street-to-street fighting” and that “both sides are likely suffering high numbers of casualties”, reports the Telegraph. Ukraine has appealed for swifter deliveries of heavy weapons from the West to turn the tide of the war, saying Russian forces have at least 10 times more artillery pieces. The news comes on the back of a Ukrainian artillery strike reportedly killing hundreds of soldiers on June 11. Footage emerged showing a large ammo store on fire after it was allegedly hit – leaving just one survivor. Private soldiers from Russia's infamous Wagner Group were reportedly using the sports arena as a base in Kadiivka, eastern Ukraine. The Wagner Group are considered Putin's private army and have operated across the world. The Russian president is claimed to have used the group to give himself plausible deniability as they are not explicitly tied to the Kremlin. The 8,000 strong group have been accused of killing children, raping and torturing women and carrying out executions. It is reported up to 300 mercenaries were killed in the attack in what would be one of the biggest losses of life since the war in Ukraine commenced in in February.",47,3.5619312948526827,3.749850064876631,-0.1879187700239484,9

A Russian company commander showed off the captured tents and other war ""trophies"" as he guided a pro-Kremlin journalist around his base in the Kherson region of Ukraine. However, the Kremlin commander bitterly complained about equipment shortages, claiming he lacked gun sights, drones, night vision devices and radios. Some of his troops were even using using antique Mosin-Nagant sniper rifles, with one of them dating back to 1943. It comes after multiple reports of supply and equipment shortages within the Russian army. The Kherson commander, who was not named, told pro-Kremlin journalist Patrick Lancaster: ""The tents belonged to the escaped Ukrainian army. ""They left them, so now the tents are our trophies, where people live. The cars are also trophies. ""We even have a field sauna. Also a trophy!"" However, the commander admitted his troops were lacking in certain equipment. ""You've see we've gotten some trophies. What we are lacking is drones... we are lacking gunsights. We are lacking night vision devices. And certainly we really need communication tools,"" he said. The journalist also interviewed a Russian sniper platoon at the base. The men were using antiquated Mosin-Nagant rifles from World War Two. One of the snipers said: ""It is (made in) 1943. Our grandparents fought with it."" Another member of the platoon held up his rifle and showed the serial number, proving it was manufactured in 1944. Mr Lancaster is an American ""journalist"" who has been embedded with pro-Russian forces over the last few years. His YouTube video comes after numerous reports exposed how Russian troops were woefully unprepared when they invaded Ukraine. Military observers noticed that Kremlin convoys appeared to only move during daylight hours, probably because the crew did not have adequate night vision devices. Many Russian soldiers have been using analogue radios to communicate on the battlefield. It has allowed a community of online sleuths to monitor their communications and share them publicly, often exposing their plans and locations. Meanwhile, the Russian army also appeared to have failed to invest in satellite mapping and GPS technology, with their soldiers struggling to navigate across the country using out-of-date Soviet-era paper maps.

A military vehicle is pictured on a road in a forested area before it is hit, with explosions causing it to catch fire. It is currently unclear exactly where the footage was filmed, but the video was obtained from the 30th Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Ground Forces on Wednesday. Its publication comes as the war in Ukraine continues to rage in the eastern part of the country. The 30th Mechanised Brigade said: ""Our tankers are aware of how important it is to save the country and people's lives, so without thinking, they just do their job. “A matter that is very effective and fruitful is the destruction of the enemy. The enemy BMP burns."" 'BMP' refers to an amphibious (suited for both land and water) infantry fighting vehicle, first developed by the Soviet Union and currently used primarily by the Russian Armed Forces. Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24th February, in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"". Thursday marks the 106th day of the campaign. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has reported that between 24th February and 8th June, Russia had lost 31,500 personnel, 1,393 tanks, 3,429 armoured fighting vehicles, 703 artillery pieces, 213 multiple launch rocket systems, 96 anti-aircraft systems, 212 warplanes, 178 helicopters, 559 tactical unmanned aerial vehicles, 125 cruise missiles, 13 warships, 2,406 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, and 53 units of special equipment. Over 1,000 Ukrainian troops captured in Mariupol have been transferred to Russia, according to Russian media. Satellite imagery has shown significant damage in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, where heavy fighting is ongoing. The Ukrainian military said that Ukrainian positions had come under ""intense fire"" around Avdiivka, Novopavlivska and Zaporizhzhia. It added that storming operations were underway around Slovyansk and that Russia had also intensified its aircraft use around Bakhmut. The Ukrainian Centre for Strategic Communications (StratCom) said on 6th June that Russian Major General Roman Kutuzov was killed in a battle near Popasna in the Luhansk region. This has now been confirmed by Russian state media. The United Kingdom and the United States are sending long-range missile systems to Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned of more attacks in Ukraine if the West sends long-range weapons. Russian missiles struck Kyiv on Sunday in the first assault on the Ukrainian capital in weeks. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Russian attacks on the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk have turned them into ""dead cities"".

Early fears Ukraine would fall quickly to the Russian onslaught were quickly put to bed as stiff resistance bogged down the invading army forcing the Kremlin to reassess the strategy. The latest two colonels to be killed including one of Russia’s youngest to reach such a high rank, takes the Russian toll to at least 52 colonels killed during the bloody conflict. Lt-Col Vadim Gerasimov, aged only 36, a battalion from Leningrad region, was posthumously awarded a Hero of Russia - the country’s highest honour - on Putin’s orders. His funeral was being held today in Leningrad region, with his widow also expected to receive his posthumous Order of Courage. A graduate of the prestigious Frunze military academy, he was the father of a daughter. The second high-ranked officer whose death was revealed today is Colonel Ruslan Shirin, a brigade commander, who “heroically died in battle”. The chief of staff of the 336th Separate Guards Marine Brigade, part of the Baltic Fleet, was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. It was not clear how and where in the Ukrainian war zone the colonels were killed. The deaths were revealed two days after the 50th colonel - artillery commander Lt Col Vladimir Nigmatullin, 46, a father of three, from Yekaterinburg. Russia recently lost its 11th general of the conflict, Major-General Roman Kutuzov was the chief of staff of the 29th Combined Arms Army. He was awarded a posthumous promotion to Lieutenant-General. Some sources have claimed that Russia lost a second and more senior general in the same incident in Donetsk region. They say there is evidence that Lieutenant-General Roman Berdnikov, 47, was killed, too. There have been claims that Ukraine has received Western intelligence assistance to target Putin’s commanders in the field, in an attempt to weaken the morale of Russian forces. Whether or not this is the case, a large number of high ranking officers have been killed, with almost one colonel every two days in the war. This comes as a former CIA agent claims the West is moving towards direct war with “unhinged” Vladimir Putin which may well turn nuclear. Robert Baer believes the situation is “likely to get a lot worse” with Putin pursuing “Russian fascism” and that no one predicted the extent to which he would go. The ex-CIA case officer, who discusses the threat from Putin in his new book “The Fourth Man”, said that the US was left flat-footed with Russia ’s invasion of Crimea and then the attack on Ukraine that began on February 24. He told the Express : “What we have today is worse than anything during the Cold War. “There’s no question the West had to support Ukraine but at the same time we’re inching towards a direct conflict between NATO and Russia. ""Whether or not it goes nuclear is anyone’s guess.”",7,5.0704146041781195,3.3654941699755265,1.704920434202593,22

A train loaded with “Hurricanes” and other military firepower was seen in Irkutsk region, some five time zones east of the conflict zone. The movement comes after the US and Britain announced they were sending long-range weapons systems to bolster Ukraine’s defences. The Russian BM-27 Uragans, first deployed by the Red Army more than four decades ago, are already being used by Vladimir Putin ’s forces in the war, but the video evidently shows reinforcements. A salvo of 16 rockets can be fired in 20 seconds, engaging targets up to 22 miles away. The train also includes other artillery including the Soviet-era 2S5 Giatsint-S, a self-propelled gun capable of firing nuclear projectiles with a range of up to 25 miles. The movement was spotted by the Ukrainian media. The British-supplied M270 rocket systems come with munitions capable of striking targets at a distance of up to 50 miles. US supplied M142 HIMARS systems can hit targets to around 43 miles. The Russian ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, claimed the more powerful Western weapons would not make any difference on the ground. ""There has been lots of talk about long-range hardware that Kyiv wants so badly,” he said. “But no Western systems can change the situation on the ground.” Vladimir Putin has threatened to hit new targets if the West supplies longer-range missiles to Ukraine. The warning came hours before the Ministry of Defence announced it would help Ukrainian fighters defend their country by sending rocket launchers that can hit targets 50 miles away. Explosions rocked Kyiv in the first assault on the capital in weeks as Russian strategic bombers fired missiles from as far away as the Caspian Sea. Putin said the “fuss” around Western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed to drag out the conflict, as Russian troops struggle against dug-in defenders in the eastern Donbas region. He warned that if the US dispatched longer-range missiles to the war zone, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”. The MoD said it will send the M270 multiple-launch rocket system in “a significant boost in capability for the Ukrainian forces”. The move was “coordinated closely with the US decision to gift the high mobility artillery rocket system” to Ukraine. It followed pleas from Ukraine for “longer-range precision weapons in order to defend themselves from Russian heavy artillery used to devastating effect in the eastern Donbas region”, said the MoD.",49,3.6919606593107797,3.8870940311925266,-0.19513337188174695,26

Local officials reported at the end of May that Vladimir Putin's forces had loosened the ""Togliatti-Odessa"" ammonia pipeline during a military operation. The fighting lead to the gas being released into the skies near Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donetsk region, the site of the war's new front line. The branch of the pipeline affected had been out of use since 2014 and the valves were closed at the time - but the corrosive element still slipped out, officials said. The gas - which is mainly used as fertiliser - is corrosive and exposure can cause the eyes, nose and throat to burn. Higher amounts can lead to blindness, lung damage and even death. Writing on Telegram, the Chairman of the Donetsy Oblast Military Administration Pavlo Kyrylenko said: ""Due to the actions of the Russian army, another natural disaster occurred in Ukraine. ""Donetsk RMA warns that in the Bakhmut district of Donetsk region, as a result of combat operations, damaged the tightness of the branch of the ammonia pipeline. ""A cloud of ammonia is moving over from the village of Maiske towards Bakhmut. Bakhmut, Hladosovo, Dacha, Mykolayivka Druha, Odradivka and Opitne may also be affected. ""Local authorities have informed the public about the necessary security measures. Rescuers are ready to eliminate the consequences of the accident."" Russia's bombing of the Azovstal steelworks could cause a major environmental crisis as thousands of tons of toxic chemicals risk being dumped into the sea. Mariupol City Council reported today how the shelling of the Azovstal iron and steel plant could have dire consequences for local wildlife and cause a ""world-class environmental catastrophe"". The council fears the bombs could have damages a facility holding back tens of thousands of tons of concentrated hydrogen sulfide solution, reports EspresoTV. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said: ""The leak of this liquid will completely kill the flora and fauna of the Sea of Azov. Then dangerous substances can get into the Black and Mediterranean Seas."" The mayor called for United Nations experts to be granted immediate admission to prevent the climate threat. He added that Russia is trying to create a ghetto in Mariupol and that the chemical-tainted water supply could cause another crisis. Russian troops stormed the plant on April 19 and destroyed large areas, however, pockets of organised resistance fighters battled on at the plant for weeks - refusing to surrender. Members of the Azov Battalion, a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine in Mariupol, were based in the plant.

One soldier who had fought near Kyiv, Kharkiv and is now in eastern Ukraine, complained to the Guardian of his desperate exhaustion. Andrei, who serves with the 37th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade headquartered in Buryatia in Siberia, said he had even contacted a lawyer to find out whether his deployment to the front is even legal. He also complained that he had not seen his wife for months. “I have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the war, it has been over three months now,"" Andrei said. ""It is exhausting, my whole unit wants a break, but our leadership said they can’t replace us right now."" Unconfirmed Ukrainian reports place Russia's losses after three months of the war at 1300 tanks, over 3000 armoured vehicles, 600 artillery pieces and close to 30,000 troops. There have been reports that Russia is finding it difficult to rotate out its exhausted troops and in another sign of defeat, the maximum conscription age has been scrapped. Michael Kofman and Rob Lee wrote in their new analysis of Russia’s armed capabilities that the Kremlin's army is poorly designed for a ""sustained occupation, or a grinding war of attrition, that would require a large share of Russia’s ground forces, which is exactly the conflict it has found itself in."" They continued: ""The Russian military doesn’t have the numbers available to easily adjust or to rotate forces if a substantial amount of combat power gets tied down in a war.” Fighters from Russian-controlled east Ukraine also went public with their complaints about poor conditions “Our personnel have faced hunger and cold,” said fighters from the Russian-controlled 113th regiment from Donetsk in one video posted online. They continued: “For a significant period, we were without any material, medical or food support. Given our continuous presence and the fact that amongst our personnel there are people with chronic medical issues, people with mental issues, many questions arise that are ignored by the higher-ups at headquarters.” Andrei said that the three months of fighting feel longer than the four years he spent serving in the army during peacetime. He said: “I have already contacted a lawyer online who told me that by law the general can keep us here until our contract runs out so there isn’t much we can do.” Another soldier loyal to President Vladimir Putin's government said he believes their mobilisation was done unlawfully, without medical certification. He claimed to be serving in Donetsk’s 107th regiment and said: ""Over 90% have never fought before and saw a Kalashnikov for the first time. We were thrown onto the frontlines.” Russian deaths are mounting as the battle for Donbas rages on, with Ukraine killing one colonel of war every two days. The British Ministry of Defence said in the first three months of the war, Russia has likely suffered ""a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan.""",7,3.4964783747854864,3.3147850778180916,0.18169329696739478,17

Lieutenant Colonel Mezhid Utsmigov was hit during a brutal battle just after Kadyrov used Russian President Vladimir Putin’s absence from Moscow to gain promises from Kremlin chiefs in Moscow that the war would proceed at a “faster pace”. Colonel Utsmigov is deputy commander of a special forces regiment named after Kadyrov’s father and is close to Putin. Kadyrov is a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin and has used his power to deploy troops to support the warmonger in his war in Ukraine. Colonel Utsmigov and his forces were retreating from Ukrainian shelling in the Luhansk Region when he was hit in the leg and concussed, according to Ukrainian sources. The soldier's defeat came soon after Kadyrov was boasting about winning a “faster pace” for the war following meetings in Moscow with Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu and FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov. “We’ll make Russia ’s real patriots happy and may our enemies die,” he promised. He continued: ""The measures adopted will allow for increasing the efficacy of the offensive manoeuvres, which facilitates conducting the special operation at a faster pace."" Around 49 Russian colonels are known to have died in Ukraine during the war and the 11th General, Major-General Roman Kutuzov, died on Sunday.

Major-General Roman Kutuzov was the chief of staff of the 29th Combined Arms Army, according to reports. His vehicle was ambushed by Ukrainians and he died in a fight in Donbas, say sources. His death is the 11th general, but the first such high ranking army officer in more than a month. In addition, at least 49 colonels have been killed in the war with Ukraine. The latest was Lt-Col Zaur Dimayev, deputy commander of the 4th battalion of the Akhmat Kadyrov special forces regiment. He was a close associate of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. In 2020, Kutuzov was head of the headquarters of the combined arms formation of Russia’s sprawling Eastern Military District. The previous general to be killed was Kanamat ’Flop Gun’ Botashev, 63. He was a “pensioner pilot” who was hit in his Su-25 after coming out of retirement to fly in Putin’s forces. He was reportedly shot down by a Ukrainian Stinger missile. There have been unconfirmed claims that Western countries are assisting Ukraine to target high-ranking Russian officers. Russian sources say Kutuzov was killed in the area of Nikolaevka settlement, in the Popasnyansky district of the Luhansk People’s Republic, close to the frontline. Last month it was claimed Putin could be 'running out of missiles' as his generals are turning on each other to avoid being purged, it has been reported. Just 10 weeks into the invasion and Putin's forces are said to be firing more missiles than they expected to because of how the war has dragged on. Britain's Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told TalkTV : ""He potentially has a problem because the rate of expenditure and the toughness of the fight is totally different to the one that he perceived on February 24.

Life for the city’s remaining residents has been relatively calm in recent weeks as the invading forces focus the majority of its attacks on the east of the nation. The war loomed back into focus this morning as attacks resumed on the capital- Vladimir Putin’s original target at the start of the conflict before being humiliatingly defeated by local forces. Mayor and former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram: ""Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital. ""Services are already working on site."" At least one person was hospitalised as a result of the attack, with no fatalities yet reported. This morning's cowardly attack was said to have been on the war-torn nation's rail network, possibly to disrupt Ukraine's ability to send urgent supplies such as munition, food and water to areas of fierce fighting. In recent days the Kremlin's soldiers have been focused on areas in the south and east of the country, with an intense battle reported in Sievierodonetsk which nearly fell to the Russians before Ukraine's forces fought back. The factory city is now practically ""split in two"", according to Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region which includes Sievierodonetsk. He added: ""It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back. ""The city is now, more or less, divided in half.""

Putin said the “fuss” around Western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed to drag out the conflict, as Russian troops struggle against dug-in defenders in the eastern Donbas region, He warned that if the US dispatched longer-range missiles to the war zone, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”. The MoD said it will send the M270 multiple-launch rocket system in “a significant boost in capability for the Ukrainian forces”. The move was “coordinated closely with the US decision to gift the high mobility artillery rocket system” to Ukraine. It followed pleas from Ukraine for “longer-range precision weapons in order to defend themselves from Russian heavy artillery used to devastating effect in the eastern Donbas region”, said the MoD. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace added: “The UK stands with Ukraine in this fight and is taking a leading role in supplying its heroic troops with the vital weapons they need to defend their country from unprovoked invasion. “If the international community continues its support, I believe Ukraine can win. As Russia ’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine. “These highly capable multiple-launch rocket systems will enable our Ukrainian friends to better protect themselves against the brutal use of long-range artillery, which Putin’s forces have used indiscriminately to flatten cities.” Yesterday’s attacks on Kyiv shook two of the capital’s eastern districts, Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi, according to Ukraine’s air force and the city’s mayor. Ukrainian officials said the missiles were launched from nuclear-capable Tu-95 Bear bombers. One flew “critically low” over a nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region and was probably destined for Kyiv, said state nuclear power operator Energoatom. Serhiy Leshchenko, an aide to President Volodomyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, said the missile volley targeted railway infrastructure. Russia’s defence ministry said it had fired rockets from long distance and destroyed T-72 tanks and armoured vehicles supplied to Ukraine by eastern European countries and held in a rail car repair building. Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called for more Western sanctions on Russia over the strikes, adding: “ Today’s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal – kill as many as possible.”",49,3.76767298826165,2.810443840245276,0.9572291480163742,7

It is not 100 days since Russian troops crossed the borders into Ukraine on February 24 for what the government was branding as a 'special military operation'. Since then, Russia has faced crippling military losses as Ukraine's forces defended their homeland gallantly, aided by state-of-the-art military equipment provided by Western nations who actively opposed the Russian aggression. Putin has also faced huge international backlash and lethal economic sanctions as a result of his decision to invade. With the war now focused predominantly in eastern Ukraine following a Russian pullback in April, experts say that Putin's miscalculations continue, with the Russian forces now perilously low on personnel and equipment. The conflict has reached a ""state of attrition"", said Swedish economist and Russia expert Anders Aslund. Aslund told the Sun : ""At the 100-day mark, the war is at a stalemate. Ukraine has all the soldiers it can possibly need, it can mobilise up to one million men. ""Russia, on the other hand, has a shortage of soldiers. Because this is not technically a war, Putin cannot legally send in conscripts."" Ukraine's military says more than 30,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far - more than double the number killed in the almost decade-long Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s. Aslund says Putin's position has been made ""weak"" in his own country, as grim details of the war emerge vast death tolls, low morale amongst troops due to poor supply chains, and dreadful living conditions on the ground. In addition, the corpses of at least 6,000 Russian soldiers abandoned by their comrades are thought to be in storage in Ukrainian morgues. Aslund warned of huge revolts in Russia as a result of Putin's decision to invade Ukraine and said the widespread opposition could result in a revolution. Russia currently controls roughly 20% of Ukraine's territory, according to President Vlodomyr Zelensky, who made an address to lawmakers in Luxembourg on Thursday (June 2). “As of today, about 20% of our territory is under the control of the occupiers,” Zelensky said. “The Russian army has already destroyed almost the entire Donbas. This, once one of the most powerful industrial centers in Europe, is simply devastated. The occupiers are destroying it city by city.” On Wednesday (June 1), Ukrainian forces commenced their retreat from Severdonestsk, which is the final Ukrainian holdout in the Luhansk oblast, one of two states that comprise the besieged Donbas region. In its latest bid to arm the Ukrainian resistance, the UK announced it would be sending precision rocket launches to the Ukrainian military and providing the appropriate training to troops. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “The UK stands with Ukraine and has taken a leading role in supplying its heroic troops with the vital weapons they need to defend their country. ""As Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine. ""These highly capable multiple-launch rocket systems will enable our Ukrainian friends to better protect themselves against Russia’s brutal use of long-range artillery, which Putin’s forces have used indiscriminately to flatten cities.” The announcement came as President Joe Biden said the US would be sending a small number of medium-range M142 artillery rocket systems to Ukraine. The Kremlin responded by announcing that they were holding nuclear weapons drills in Ivanovo province near Moscow. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the West of “pumping up the Ukrainian nationalists with weapons” and said that any weapons headed for Ukraine would become a legitimate military target.",7,3.1367303141645935,2.7251598426567565,0.411570471507837,12

A screenshot on social media shows the anti-tank weapon being sold by a user in Kyiv – and it comes as Interpol, the cross-border police force, warned many of the weapons sent to Ukraine will eventually wind up in criminal hands in Europe. The photos, shared by pro-Russian ASB Military News on the Telegram messaging app, cannot be independently verified. They may be fake and part of a Russian propaganda campaign to halt the West ­funnelling arms to Ukraine’s defenders. The Javelin rocket launcher is a “ fire and forget” design, which uses heat-seeking technology to hit its target. The US has promised 5,000 Javelin missiles, many of which are already being used to blitz Russian tanks. The hand-held weapons were used with British NLAW missiles to help Ukrainian troops stall Russian ­convoys threatening Kyiv in March. Yesterday was the 100th day since the February 24 invasion – which has killed over 20,000 civilian so far, say Ukraine. The conflict is causing food shortages in Africa, South America and the Middle East. Some 40% of Africa’s grain imports are from Russia and Ukraine. The head of the African Union told President Vladimir Putin yesterday that “Africans are victims of this economic crisis”. Russian invaders continued to batter the eastern city of Severodonetsk yesterday as Ukrainian soldiers cling on in bloody street fighting. UK intelligence said Russia has increased air strikes in the Donbas region in a bid to speed up its faltering assault. US President Joe Biden agreed to send Kyiv HIMAR medium-range missile systems on Tuesday to help stall Russia’s advance and hit artillery targets deep inside Kremlin-held territory. An additional 1,000 Javelin missiles were also included in the new $700million military aid package.",49,3.3844323230287796,2.9491490569836376,0.435283266045142,27

Ferocious fighting is now concentrated on a 600-mile eastern front, leaving the capital of Kyiv safe for the time being. Thousands of Russian troops were pushed back, leaving behind a trail of shattered, brutalised and murdered civilians. More than 10,000 war crimes have been alleged, including rape, murder, torture and abduction. Russia is tightening its grip on Severodonetsk in Donbas, whilst throughout Ukraine 100 die daily and 500 are wounded. But Ukraine’s ferocious defence has destroyed the Kremlin’s prediction of a quick victory. Security sources believe it highly likely that the Russian President, 69, is seriously ill and needs regular medical attention. His puffy face and frequent disappear-ance from public view have sparked cancer rumours. He spends much of his time in his huge mansion outside Moscow and is accompanied by doctors wherever he goes. It is possible the embittered ex-KGB man’s obsession with recreating the strength of the old Soviet Union has been influenced by illness. His unhinged assertion that Ukraine is full of Nazis who are threatening Russia defies belief. One security expert said: “Putin’s absences and appearance point towards illness and paranoia. “This would likely have a serious effect on his decisions.” The invasion began with widespread strikes followed by a massive armoured push towards Kyiv. Ukraine fought a brilliant defence, smashing Moscow’s tanks with western-supplied missiles and bombing them from drones. Hundreds of tanks were blown up, forcing Moscow to withdraw. But their retreat revealed Russian atrocities with hundreds of dead civilians piled into mass graves. Almost 1,200 Russian tanks have now been destroyed together with 200 planes. Around 30,000 Russian soldiers are dead. Tens of thousands of civilians have died – 20,000 in Mariupol. The fight has now switched east and Ukraine is struggling to hold a slow Russian advance. America is sending rockets that may outrange Russian artillery. But it’s a race against time. If Russia’s attack on Severodonestk succeeds it will control all Luhansk, the smaller of two regions in Donbas. Total control of industrial Donbas and the southern coast would be devastating to Ukraine. The former comic’s calm defiance on TV, dressed in a green military teeshirt has become an emblem of Ukrainian strength. In the days following the invasion he looked exhausted, his voice cracking with emotion. But within a week he morphed into a warrior, refusing to flee as Russian hit squads moved in on him. He answered a US rescue offer with: “I don’t need a ride - I need ammunition.” Fake Russian news about him fleeing was met with selfie footage of him in Kyiv saying: “The president is here, our troops are here, the citizens are here. We are all here to protect the independence of our country. Glory to Ukraine!” His standing up to Putin has bolstered Ukrainians in the face of grotesque violence. Born into a Jewish family, the 44-year-old grew up speaking Russian and Ukrainian and graduated in law before becoming an actor. Clever use of social media launched his political career in 2018 and he became the country’s sixth president. Six million fled at the beginning of the war although two million have since returned. A further eight million have been displaced within Ukraine. The Pew Centre research organisation said at the outset: “Russia’s invasion has created one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times. “There are now almost as many Ukrainian refugees as there were Afghan refugees fleeing the Taliban in 2001.” The UK is processing tens of thousands of applications for resettlement under the Homes for Ukraine campaign. More than 100,000 people have offered rooms. More than 26,000 Ukrainians have arrived here to take up the offer and a further 34,000 have arrived via family visas.= But the Government scheme has hit problems and there have been painfully slow delays in processing applications. Russia has become the world’s most-sanctioned country with 5,000 sweeping bans slapped on it and its key figures. The US has launched more than 1,000 restrictions, hitting Moscow’s ability to trade and the finances of its leaders and lawmakers. Companies refusing to do business in Russia including McDonalds, Coca Cola, KFC , BP and Shell. Russian transport has been crippled with flight bans. But the sanctions which will eventually cripple Putin are flooding his short- term war coffers through increased oil and gas prices. It is thought an extra £76 billion has been pumped in. But more than half of Russians gave suffered a lowering in earnings and unemployment is rising. Experts believe sanctions will eventually affect Moscow’s ability to buy weapons. What began as a disorganised invasion harassed by well-trained guerilla defenders has become a more conventional conflict. Russia has suffered huge losses but Putin believes this is unimportant. War, which began in the east in 2014, could rage for years more at a much more bloodier cost. Missile strikes against western Ukraine are likely to increase as Moscow tries to stop military supplies. Western naval support to escort merchant ships from Ukraine would be extremely risky. And if Russia cuts off Ukraine from the sea that will be devastating. NATO would have to rethink its policy of not having hands-on involvement. A former UK military intelligence officer said: “Only one man knows Russia’s next move. Those around him who know he is deluded are either not listened to or are too intimidated to speak.”",7,3.113804202116326,3.486332202720588,-0.37252800060426194,20

The shocking video captures the Russian military commander of the Donetsk Republic's 113th regiment reading off a notepad of some kind as he makes the speech. His revelations paint a grim picture about the state of some of Vladimir Putin's troops fighting in the east of Ukraine. In the video, released by a pro-Russian telegram channel, he stands in front of his battle weary soldiers, who are armed. He reveals how they have been fighting on the front in the Kherson region “in hunger and cold” with no medicine or proper weapons. The video pans to some of the soldiers as a number seemingly run through injuries. Some of the soldiers are dressed in vests, wearing running shoes despite being on the frontline. The commander says that they were sent to the slaughter without proper weapons and asks to return to Donetsk and stop the mobilisation there. He adds that they have no proper weapons, food or equipment and the unit suffered from ""chronic illness"". The shocking revelation comes on the 100th day of conflict during Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine amid ongoing reports of Russian brutality aimed at its own troops. On the online channel where the video was shared they talk about “another video of our illegally mobilised guys”. It continues: “Since February, the guys have been at the forefront in the Kherson region in hunger and cold. “No one passed a medical examination, they mobilised children who have mental illness, fathers of many children, guardians. “Also, our fighters report that the command throws them to the slaughter without proper weapons.” The Telegram channel goes on to complain about how Russia has mobilised fighters and brands it “illegal”. It seems to represent fighters from the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine and has regularly posted other videos complaining about how Russia has treated the region it claimed to be liberating and fighting for. However, the regions that Russia has claimed are now republics, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, have found themselves suffering on Russia’s behalf some have argued. Kamil Galeev, a fellow at The Wilson Centre, highlighted online how troops from these regions were often bearing the brunt of the conflict. Two regiments from the DPR had reportedly recently refused to fight, and made almost identical complaints to the 113th regiment commander. This included that they were being used as ""cannon fodder"" or treated like mercenaries. It comes as in recent months Russia has sought to relaunch its campaign against Ukraine. The fighting has so far taken almost 50,000 lives according to Reuters, with the majority of dead having been suffered by Russia. Millions have been displaced from their homes and forced to flee the Russian invasion. Despite an initial push for the capital, Russia quickly found its forces floundering and unable to take Ukraine’s urban centres. After regrouping in the east of the country, Putin’s forces have since had more success seizing cities and territories and has been advancing gradually. Speaking of the 100 days of fighting so far, the Ministry of Defence tweeted: “Russia’s assault into northern Ukraine ended in a costly failure. “Russia failed to implement its own principles of war. With the limited combat readiness of many units, it spread its forces too thinly without enough support from artillery and combat aircraft. “Above all, it was based on wildly optimistic assessments about the welcome Russian troops would receive in Ukraine. Russia has now adopted a “strategy of attrition” and is achieving slow and costly gains in the Donbas.”",7,3.706284596731066,4.323811297875476,-0.6175267011444103,6

Legal experts say “forcibly transferring children” may be genocide as it plays a part in trying to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Ukraine ’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said: “From the first days of the war, we started this case about genocide. That’s why this forcible transfer of children is very important.” Ukraine human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova has said Moscow had relocated over 210,000 kids to Russia during the conflict, among 1.2 million deportees. The Genocide Convention – adopted by the UN after the Holocaust – specifies five acts of genocide: killing members of a group, causing serious bodily or mental harm, imposing destructive conditions, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children. Ms Venediktova said investigations are focused on the regions of Mykolaiv and Kherson on the southern coast but war is hindering evidence collection. Other alleged Russian war crimes are being probed in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Sumy and Zhytomyr, including the targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, rape, torture, and extra-judicial killings. Ms Venediktova said Ukraine has identified more than 600 Russian suspects and launched prosecutions against about 80, some prisoners of war. Genocide has only been proven in international courts for conflicts in Bosnia, Rwanda and Cambodia. But experts say there is mounting evidence to support a case in Ukraine, including a pattern of atrocities that meet rigorous tests to prove genocidal intent. Melanie O’Brien, president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, said: “They should absolutely focus on the forcible transfer of children. “We definitely see a risk of genocide.” Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said the Kremlin is trying to move the war into a “protracted phase” by building layered defences in the south of the country, instead of advancing. It is feared Russia has almost taken the entire key city of Severodonetsk marking a victory in the region of Luhansk. The Donetsk region will not fall soon, but needs the world to supply more weapons, its governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Russian troops are just nine miles north of Sloviansk, the second biggest Ukrainian-controlled city in Donetsk. Seizing the regions of Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk is a key Russian objective. ust under half of Donetsk is still in Ukrainian hands. He said: “I am sure that they will not advance quickly. In the longer term, it all depends on the concentration of our forces. The world must do even more.”",45,4.29097036159754,5.485323142182833,-1.1943527805852927,14

Kalibr cruise missiles hit the Beskydy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains, it is reported. A family, with notable fear in their voices, recorded the strike in the Lviv region, and said that two missiles had struck the area. Ukrainian official Anton Gerashchenko and Lviv governor Maksym Kozytskyy confirmed the late evening attack. “The goal is to try to disrupt the railway communication and stop the supply of fuel and weapons from our allies,” he said. Russia was also targeting a second tunnel, he said. Russian sources also said the attacks had involved Kalibr missiles. This type of strategic missile has been previously used in the war in Ukraine aimed at destroying vital infrastructure. In April, images showed Kalibr missiles being loaded onto a submarine in Sevastopol naval port in annexed Crimea. The extent of any damage to the Beskydy tunnel was unclear with the route connecting Ukraine to NATO state Slovakia - a rail connection between Lviv and the EU. The first tunnel was built in 1886, with a second inaugurated in 2018 as a gateway to Europe. On the video, a voice is heard saying: that the strike was in the direction of Stryi. “Damn…,” says one voice in Ukrainian. “Look! F***ing hell!” “Dad, lie down!” Then someone says: ""Look, look!"" and “Switch the light off!” When another asks: “What?” there is a reply of: “Look there! Two bombs….” It comes as the Ukraine, locked in a grinding struggle against Russia's invading army, received a boost with the United States announced a $700 million weapons package for Kyiv that will include advanced rocket systems with a range of up to 50 miles.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the supply of the rocket launchers raised the risk of a ""third country"" being dragged into the conflict.

Footage shared by the Russian Ministry of Defence yesterday shows the Russian S-300PM2 striking drones in the sky. The Russian MoD said: ""Combat operation of S-300PM2 Favorit anti-aircraft missile system during the special military operation. ""S-300PM2 Favorit is designed to destroy modern and advanced aircraft, strategic cruise missiles, tactical and operational ballistic missiles and other means of air attack. ""While combat duty, aerial targets identified as Bayraktar TB2 attack drones were detected. ""As a result of competent actions, AFU strike drones were escorted and destroyed."" The S-300PM2 has a range of 200km (125 miles) and can engage 36 targets simultaneously. S-300 missile systems are operated by the militaries of several countries, including Ukraine, as well as Russia. Bayraktar TB2 and TB2S combat drones have been wreaking havoc on Russian military equipment over the course of the invasion of Ukraine. It could be a show of force after Joe Biden announced a multi-million weapons package to Ukraine. The Oryx Blog says the drones have taken out six armoured fighting vehicles, five pieces of towed artillery, one multiple rocket launcher, two anti-aircraft guns, 13 surface-to-air missile systems, 10 helicopters, five naval ships, two logistics trains, 24 trucks, vehicles and jeeps, three command posts, one communication station, one vehicle storage building and one ammunition dump. The Oryx Blog is run by ""Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans, two military analysts devoted to investigating and sharing the ins and outs of conflict research, open-source intelligence and the occasional obscure piece of military history"". Bayraktar TB2 and TB2S combat drones are manufactured in Turkey and made their first flight seven years ago. They are monitored and controlled by an aircrew in a ground control station. The Russian MoD video may be a response to US President Joe Biden's recent announcement that he would supply Kyiv with a new weapons package. The package will include four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, which can launch multiple precision-guided missiles at targets as far as 45 miles away. The German government also recently promised to send the IRIS-T air defence system to Ukraine, enabling it to defend an entire city against Russian air attacks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""Such supplies do not contribute to the Ukrainian leadership's willingness to resume peace negotiations."" Yesterday, Russian officials have warned Biden he is adding fuel to the fire by giving Ukraine long-range rockets. The US President has agreed to give Volodymyr Zelensky advanced rockets that can target Russian targets as part of a £550million weapons package. Washington is already supplying Ukraine with high mobility artillery rocket systems that can accurately hit targets up to 50 miles away after Ukraine gave ""assurances"" they will not use the missiles to strike inside Russia, senior administration officials said. Peskov today said he doesn't believe Ukraine won't use them to shoot them into Russia. He told reporters today: ""We believe that the US is deliberately pouring oil on the fire.

US President Joe Biden announced that the US will send the rocket systems to the invaded which will advance Ukraine's capabilities. The weapon can simultaneously launch multiple precision-guided missiles and has a huge range with extreme precision. Leading Kremlin propagandist has also claimed the move raises the chances of Russian President Vladimir Putin launching a nuclear strategic strike at the US. Retired Lieutenant-General Evgeny Buzhinsky, 72, a former senior officer in the Soviet and Russian armies, said they should not downplay the severity of the US move. He told state-run Rossiya 1 channel: “It means the Americans are at war with us, and we will be striking decision-making centres. “When Putin was talking about decision-making centres, it was about nuclear weapons, not about multiple rocket launchers. “However, if these systems do appear, it will already be a different level… “It will no longer be a special operation, but a normal war. “Then it should be necessary to act like in a normal war and strike decision-making centres.” The weapons will allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian troops from a very far distance outside the range of Russia ’s artillery. HIMAR units carry one preloaded pod of six 227mm guided missiles or one large pod loaded with an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) tactical missile. The units can be reloaded in about a minute with only a small crew, bolstering their reliability. Writing in the New York Times, President Biden said the weapons are meant to help Ukraine “fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table”. Lieutenant-General Buzhinsky urged the Kremlin to target key government and industrial sites in Ukraine. He said: ""[We should] strike large industrial centres, yes, civilian infrastructure will be damaged, that up to now, [we] are still trying to somehow preserve. “If such weapons appear, [we should] lift the restrictions we imposed on ourselves.” Television anchorman Vladimir Solovyov, who has won the moniker ""Putin’s Voice"", warned that US president Joe Biden is downplaying the likelihood of Putin pulling the trigger on nuclear weapons. Mocking Biden’s alleged certainty that Putin would not deploy his atomic arsenal, Solovyov told viewers: “Joe, we are not planning to strike Ukraine with tactical weapons. If things go not well…if we do strike, that will be with strategic [nuclear] ones. “And not Ukraine at all” - implying a strike at the US.",49,2.9067389013787945,2.2437457308588398,0.6629931705199548,12

But President Zelensky's estimate that 60 to 100 Ukrainian troops a day are being killed is ""pretty credible"", they admitted today. It came as Russian forces pressed closer to the centre of the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk in a drive to grab a swathe of eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile the United States said it would supply advanced rockets to Kyiv to help force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war. A Western official said Russia is ""starting to learn from its mistakes and make advances in the Donbas"". But over the last month Putin's forces have advanced just 500 metres to one kilometre per day, the official said. And there are ""a lot more challenge to come"" before Russian troops can reach the city of Kramatorsk, including rivers that would be difficult to cross while under fire. The ""long"" conflict will last at least until the end of 2022 as Russia still wants to take “at least the large part of Ukraine”, the senior official predicted. The Western official said: ""My estimate would be that the number killed in action for Russia is more than 15,000 now, but I think not necessarily significantly more. ""The fact they've narrowed the nature of their advance has meant they're still taking casualties, but they're taking them in smaller numbers than they were previously. ""I think the number wounded in action is probably north of 40,000."" This does not include the number captured by Ukrainian forces. It comes after the US announced it is sending the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to Ukrainian forces. Russia criticised the decision to supply advanced rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine, warning of an increased risk of direct confrontation with Washington. Russia's nuclear forces are holding drills in the Ivanovo province, northeast of Moscow, the Interfax news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying. A Western official said the rockets will be a ""real complication for Russian forces"" but are ""not going to turn the tide"" on their own. The official said: ""The M142 gives a range of about 80km. ""It’s a weapons system which is highly mobile, and is particularly effective in terms of being able to engage targets and move, or engage multiple targets in very quick succession. “In that, it outperforms the other systems Russia is fielding in the battle space. “That weapons system will enable counter-battery fire to go after Russian artillery in a deeper, more effective way. “By having that reach of 80km, you can get into those Russian supply lines”. The official said it is ""difficult at the moment to see any path to a negotiated settlement any time soon”. “We’re looking at a conflict that’s got the potential to run at least to the end of this year” and “possibly longer”, they added.

Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said the explosion was caused by a Russian airstrike while the Kremlin said it was Ukrainian forces that hit the nitric acid tank, The footage was captured by a Ukrainian soldier. A Russian source said: “Footage has emerged of an explosion of a chemical tanker, presumably containing nitric acid, set off by the Ukrainian armed forces at the Azot plant in Severodonetsk. “The relaxed behaviour of Ukrainian soldiers confirms that Russian artillery was not shelling the plant at the time of the explosion.” The Russian Investigative Committee announced a criminal investigation into the nitric acid release. Mr Haidai said an aerial attack from a Russian warplane led to the chemical release. He said thousands of residents were exposed to toxic fumes. It is unclear how many residents of the city's 106,000 population are still there as many have fled since the start of the invasion in February. Haidai told the BBC : ""Our troops still remain in the city and for the time being are still resisting the Russian army. ""But if they need to withdraw to the other side of the river, closer to Lysychansk, in order to preserve troops then they will probably do so.” It comes one day after a Kremlin TV propagandist has claimed World War 3 has already begun and claims Russia ’s task is now to “demilitarise” NATO. Rossiya-1 anchor Olga Skabeyeva is seen on a video claiming that the much-vaunted Russian special military operation in Ukraine “is now over”. The West’s provision of arms to Ukraine meant it was now a global conflict, she said, as Russia's enemy showcased new British Wolfhound heavy tactical support vehicles. “It's time to admit, perhaps, that Russia's special operation in Ukraine is now over,” said Skabeyeva. “In the sense that a real war has started, World War 3. We are being forced to demilitarise, not just Ukraine but NATO as a whole. ""Why am I talking about this?

The US President has agreed to give Volodymyr Zelensky advanced rockets that can target Russian targets as part of a £550million weapons package. Washington is already supplying Ukraine with high mobility artillery rocket systems that can accurately hit targets up to 50 miles away after Ukraine gave ""assurances"" they will not use the missiles to strike inside Russia, senior administration officials said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov today said he doesn't believe Ukraine won't use them to shoot them into Russia. He told reporters today: ""We believe that the US is deliberately pouring oil on the fire. The US is obviously holding the line that it will fight Russia to the last Ukrainian."" Biden on Tuesday told reporters that ""we're not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that strike into Russia."" He has said he believes the war will end through diplomacy but he's supplying the weapons to give Ukraine a strong hand at the negotiating table. In a New York Times op-ed published yesterday, he wrote: ""That’s why I’ve decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine."" The package also includes ammunition, counterfire radars, several air surveillance radars, additional Javelin anti-tank missiles, as well as anti-armour weapons, officials said. Ukrainian officials have been asking for longer-range missile systems in the hopes of turning the tide of the war. It comes as a top Russian security official made a chilling promise that the Kremlin will ""fulfil threats"" of a missile attack. Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said Washington's decision not to send Ukraine rocket systems capable of striking Russian targets was ""reasonable"". Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel that Russia would have returned fire against Biden's ""criminal decisions"" at targets ""not in Kiev at all"". He said: ""Biden said that the US will not supply Ukraine with missile systems capable of attacking Russia. Reasonable!

2022-06-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-already-sacked-second-27117951,Vladimir Putin's general mysteriously vanishes just a month after being hired,"Vladimir Putin may have sacked his new general just weeks after he was shipped in to save the faltering Ukraine invasion, it has been claimed. The Russian President appointed General Aleksandr Dvornikov in April in a move considered by experts to be an acknowledgement that his war was failing. However, the new commander has not been seen for a fortnight leading some US officials to speculate whether he has kept his job. It comes as a Pentagon official said Moscow's military is making the same mistakes on its new eastern frontline as it did when trying to capture the whole country. When Dvornikov was brought in it's understood he tried to form bridges between the disjointed air and land units to better coordinate their attacks. In the early weeks of the ""special military operation"" the Kremlin's campaign was run from Moscow, lacking a central war commander on the ground, reports the New York Times. This changed with the appointment of Dvorikov in early April, as he worked to streamline the war effort. The general cut a foreboding figure on his arrival into the hot seat. He fought in Russia's savage second Chechnya war as a commander, while forces under him in Syria were accused of targeting civilians. In the current conflict his methods appeared to be working, with pilots and ground troops having better co-ordination in Donbas. But US intelligence reportedly shows that despite capturing territory in the Donbas region, Moscow troops' ""plodding and incremental"" pace is continuing to damage morale. Officials say the Russian air force's risk-averse mentality is the same as in February, in which pilots are still darting across the border to launch strikes then retreating back home. By refusing to remain in Ukrainian air space they are failing to cut off usage by its foes. However, its military has made some progress on its new front, getting the upper-hand in multiple ground battles in recent days. And having taken southern port city Mariupol last month it could now look to forging a corridor into Crimea. Troops are now advancing on the centre of eastern city Sievierodonetsk, but Russia's haphazard approach means anywhere it does seize is often quickly contested again. A prime example of this is Ukrainian second city Kharkiv. “The Russians took Kharkiv for a short period of time; the Ukrainians counterattacked and took Kharkiv back,” US Defence Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said last week. “We’ve seen them really proceed at a very slow and unsuccessful pace on the battlefield.” It is also reported Ukraine is looking to cut off Russian supply lines east of Kharkiv, which would put the invading troops in the same predicament as earlier in the war when it had to abandon its advance on capital Kyiv. Frederick W. Kagan, a senior fellow and director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, told the NY Times the new front is not going to plan because those in charge ""haven't been able to change the character of the Russian army"". And retired Gen. Philip Breedlove told the newspaper Dvorikov's ideas on streamlining the forces was correct but the brief break in between the Kyiv campaign ending and the new one starting was not long enough. “The force was thrust back into the battle too quickly. That decision had to have come from Moscow,” he added.",7,3.9972919713795396,3.772408931249821,0.22488304012971883,6

Russia failed to make the quick gains that was anticipated following the invasion of its neighbour that began on February 24 - and it has turned into a war of attrition. Ukrainian fighters have battled for every inch and it led to a change of strategy from the Russians who withdrew from the north and an assault on the capital Kyiv, to instead concentrate in the more pro-Russian eastern regions close to the border. Now they are pummeling the city of Sievierodonetsk as they aim to take full control of the province of Luhansk. And two top Russian military officials Colonel Maksin Vlasov and Colonel Vitaly Kovtun have blasted the failure to take Kyiv in an alleged bugged call by Ukrainian intelligence services. “A f***ing rocket should fly into (Ukraine’s Parliament) in Kyiv. That’s it f*** it. Why didn’t (a rocket) f***ing fly? I don’t f***ing get it, you’re f***ed, Putin motherf*****,” Kovtun said, reported the Daily Beast. “Why didn’t a rocket fly into Kyiv…. Something hasn’t been done the right way.” The alleged call was broadcast by Radio Free Europe’s Ukrainian service and is believed to have taken place on April 14. The two military men also attacked the Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu who Vlasov called “incompetent” and he said that their army had made “horrible losses”. Russian forces have lost thousands of soldiers and many top brass in the fighting with claims that there has been poor strategy and a lack of organisation. While Ukrainian fighters have shown determination and willingness to die for the cause, Russian soldiers have appeared to have low morale. In the recorded message Vlasov and Kovtun were heard to agree that the war is being led by “bootlickers” and they criticised the poor salaries of the soldiers. They are reported to be given 30,000 rubles (£381) a month. “(There are) no contracted forces. Of course not! Why would there f***ing be? They paid them 30,000 rubles (£381), where are they going to get contractors?” Kovtun reportedly said. Meanwhile, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War has said Putin ""is now hurling men and munitions"" at Sievierodonetsk, ""as if taking it would win the war for the Kremlin. He is wrong."" Thousands of residents remain trapped in the city and Russian forces are advancing towards its centre, but slowly, regional governor Gaidai said. Russia's advance could force Ukrainian troops to retreat across the river to Lysychansk, he added. Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council aid agency which had long operated out of Sievierodonetsk, said he was ""horrified"" by its destruction. Up to 12,000 civilians remain caught in crossfire, without sufficient access to water, food, medicine or electricity, Egeland said. ""The near-constant bombardment is forcing civilians to seek refuge in bomb shelters and basements, with only few precious opportunities for those trying to escape,"" he said. There were few reports of major shifts elsewhere on the battlefield. In the south, Ukraine claimed to have pushed back Russian forces to the border of Russian-held Kherson province. Moscow took control of Kherson in March and residents there have staged protests against Russian occupation. Mobile and internet access in Kherson were shut down on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said, blaming Russia for disconnecting cables. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said troops there were fighting on ""despite the fact the Russian army has a significant advantage in terms of equipment and numbers.""",7,4.529087395157748,4.084136625111082,0.44495077004666594,6

Defence Minister Jeremy Quin has previously highlighted the delivery of Wolfhounds, which help to protect troops while they carry out patrols in high-risk areas, alongside Stormer vehicles fitted with Starstreak launchers. He told MPs earlier this month: ""So far, we've delivered in excess of 6,500 anti-tank missiles, many of which have been used successfully to repel columns of tanks, as well as eight air defence systems - including Brimstone and Starstreak missiles, the fastest in the world at some 2,000 miles an hour.""

The footage opens with a row of trucks and warplanes parked on the runway and daubed with the notorious white 'Z' symbol. A number of fighter jets can then seen being loaded with missiles before a pair take off. They fly in close formation over fields and sparsely-populated settlements in Ukraine. The jets are then seen performing dramatic manoeuvres and firing several missiles at ground targets before returning to base. The footage was obtained from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) of the Russian Federation on Monday. The Russian MoD said: ""Russian Aerospace Forces' Su-25 assault aircraft in action. ""Assault aircraft pilots, operating at extremely low altitudes, carried out missile air strikes against fortified positions, equipment and weapons of AFU units. ""Missile launches were carried out in pairs. To counter enemy air defences, the pilots fired thermal traps and performed anti-missile manoeuvres.

Bodies have been strewn across the city, causing the soil to get poisoned, eventually getting into underground water and into rivers and the sea. Russian forces have since washed the corpses above ground in an attempt to restore running water to the ruined city, according to Petro Andryushchenko, the Mariupol mayor’s adviser. He said the volume of bodies being washed out of the ground was too large, and forces were unable to bury them. Mr Andryushchenko wrote on his Telegram social media channel: ""The Russians are bringing the bodies of the dead here [in the supermarket], bodies which were washed out of graves and partially exhumed in an attempt to restore water supply. ""They are just dumping them like garbage.” Photographs from the Shchyryikum supermarket show decomposing and discoloured bodies in civilian clothes littered across the floor. Andryushchenko said there is a ""catastrophic"" shortage of people to bury the corpses and dig makeshift graves, so there has been a ""separate recruitment campaign for pathologists"" launched in Moscow. Ukrainian authorities said on Tuesday that while digging through the rubble they found more than 200 bodies in Mariupol, which faced some of the worst aggression from Putin's forces in the last few months. Before the war, Mariupol had a population of around 500,000 people and was a cosmopolitan city famed for its beaches. The estimated 100,000 remaining residents of Mariupol are living among rubble and dead bodies without medicine, running water or electricity. Little remains following months of siege and Ukrainian officials have said the city has been reduced to “ashes of a dead land."" Russian forces destroyed almost ""80% of the city’s infrastructure in 22 days, of which 30% can no longer be rebuilt"", they continued. Mariupol Mayor Vadim Boychenko estimated more than 20,000 civilians had been killed during the final weeks of the aggressive fighting. He said this was twice the number of deaths recorded in the entire two-year Nazi occupation of the city during World War Two. He said: “Putin is a bigger evil than Hitler and we must stop him."" Putin's forces were unabashed with their violence in the port city. They struck maternity wards and bombed a theatre, clearly marked as a refuge for hundreds of civilians. Officials claim their actions amount to war crimes. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or targeting of civilians. Many of those killed were buried in shallow graves by whoever was available to aid and it is these bodies that Mr Andryushchenko said are now being washed out of the ground and thrown in supermarkets.",47,6.688861845514729,6.176584786666587,0.5122770588481416,18

Kyrylo Budanov believes that Russia only has enough fuel, ammunition and military equipment to sustain another seven months of full effort. Despite Russian forces having recently captured most of the town of Lyman, in the north of Donetsk Oblast, pictures on social media show ancient T-62 tanks on trains heading to the frontline in Ukraine. The tanks are believed to be around 60 years old and were seen pulled out of storage. Some say this is a huge indicator of Moscow's fighting stock as its arsenal has been decimated. Budanov predicts that by the new year, Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces will be depleted. He told Sky News : ""The breaking point will be in the second part of August. ""Most of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year. As a result, we will renew Ukrainian power in all our territories that we have lost including Donbas and the Crimea."" The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) intelligence assessment says Russia’s Southern Grouping of Forces will receive the T-62 tanks and their presence ""highlights Russia’s shortage of modern, combat-ready equipment.” Ukrainian forces will likely wipe out the tanks with basic rocket-propelled grenades and they will not have to use their sophisticated weaponry to wipe out the decrepit vehicles. Unconfirmed Ukrainian claims place Russia's losses after three months of the war at 1300 tanks, over 3000 armoured vehicles, 600 artillery pieces and close to 30,000 troops. Despite Bundanov's predictions that Putin's forces will be gone by the end of the year, Kremlin Senator Andrei Turchak said: ""I wanted to say once again, that Russia is here forever. There should be no doubt about that. There will be no return to the past."" But in another sign of weakness and indicator of a high Russian death rate, the maximum conscription age has been scrapped. The Russian Duma voted to remove the upper age limit for military conscription so that any male over the age of 18 can serve. Before, anyone over 40 was disallowed. The MoD said in the first three months of the war, Russia has likely suffered ""a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan."" It said a combination of ""poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility, and a command approach which is prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes"" has led to this high casualty rate. The T-62 tanks, which were first used in 1962, were spotted being carried by train into the city of Melitopol in southern Ukraine. A Ukrainian army post on Facebook wrote that as a result of losses during hostilities, the Russian enemy ""was forced to withdraw"" T-62 tanks from storage ""to recruit reserve battalion tactical groups that are being formed to be sent to Ukraine"" In just one week, 70 Russian tanks were reported destroyed by Ukrainian artillery as they attempted to cross a river.

Ukrainian officials have been asking allies for longer-range systems including the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS, that can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of miles away. ""We're not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that strike into Russia,"" Biden told reporters after arriving back at the White House after a weekend in Delaware. Biden did not rule out providing any specific weapons system, but instead appeared to be placing conditions on how they could be used. Biden and his team are working on a new package of military equipment and it is expected to be announced in coming days. The MLRS was under consideration, but nothing with long-range strike capabilities outside of battlefield use, a senior administration official said. The Ukrainian government has urged the West to provide it with more longer-range weapons in order to turn the tide in the war, now in its fourth month. Biden wants to help Ukraine defend itself but has been opposed to providing weapons that Ukraine could use to attack Russia. CNN and The Washington Post reported on Friday the Biden administration was leaning towards sending the MLRS and another system, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, as part of an upcoming military aid package. Thousands of people have been killed in Ukraine and millions more displaced since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation."" Biden's administration and U.S. allies have been increasingly willing to give Ukraine longer-range weaponry, including M777 howitzers, as Kyiv battles Russian forces with more success than intelligence officials had predicted.

A statement from the Russian defence ministry said: “According to objective control data, the Zircon hypersonic cruise missile successfully hit a sea target located at a distance of about 1,000 km. “The flight of the hypersonic missile corresponded to the specified parameters.” In December, Putin announced a “flawless” salvo launch involving the Zircon. In January, deputy defence minister Alexey Kryvoruchko said: “The state tests of the Zircon sea-based hypersonic cruise missile are nearing completion. “From 2022, serial deliveries will begin.” The Zircon will be deployed on Russian frigates and, later, on submarines. Earlier it was identified by Moscow’s state-controlled TV as Putin’s weapon of choice to wipe out American cities in the event of an atomic conflict. In December Putin hailed “our newest [Zircon] missiles fired from the sea at sea targets, and land targets. “The tests were carried out successfully, flawlessly. “This is a big event for our country, a significant step in improving Russia’s security, in increasing (our) defence capability.” It is now in “serial production”, he said, previously calling the weapon “truly unparalleled … in the world”. TV Zvezda - a channel owned by the Russian defence ministry - said of the footage: “The Russian Zircon hypersonic missile's stealth features have been disclosed… “The speed of the Zircon hypersonic missile is so high that it prevents the opponent's air defence system from detecting its impact in time. “In fact, its launch will be known only after the target has been hit.” The missile also has a “variable trajectory” to avoid detection, viewers were told. The frigate’s captain Igor Krokhmal has said previously: “No one will see the missile launch or its flight. They will only see when the missile hits the target,” said the frigate’s commander, first rank captain Igor Krokhmal. “A surface target, a coastal target. I don't think there will be anything to counter this in the next few years.”",49,5.499892325175168,5.362369790092309,0.1375225350828586,26

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the Russians used a TOS-1 multiple rocket launcher to strike at Ukrainian targets near Novomykhailivka in the eastern region of Donetsk Oblast. The horrendous 30-barrel or 24-barrel multiple rocket launcher is capable of firing thermobaric warheads, a type of explosive that uses oxygen in the surrounding area to generate a high-temperature blast. Ukraine has described Moscow's invasion the ""largest and most horrific war of the 21st century"" and appealed to NATO to supply its forces with similar Multiple Launch Rocket Systems as a matter of urgency. Speaking on Friday, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said: ""Russian TOS-1s shelling Ukrainian positions near Novomykhailivka, Donetsk region. ""This is what the largest and most horrific war of the 21st century looks like. Ukraine is ready to strike back. To do this, we need NATO-style MLRS [Multiple Launch Rocket Systems]. Immediately!"" Dr Marcus Hellyer, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the thermobaric weapons were effective at their ""specific purpose"" of ""primarily destroying defensive positions"". Speaking to the Guardian, he added: ""They are not illegal even though their effects can be pretty horrific, because of that effect of creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders."" As his barbarism heats up, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that makes it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become citizens of Russia. The Kremlin has also done away with the upper age limit for contractual service in its military in a bid to sign more of its citizens up to fight in Ukraine. Since February 24 the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at around 29,600 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 1,315 tanks, 3,235 armoured fighting vehicles, 617 artillery systems, 201 multiple launch rocket systems, 93 anti-aircraft systems, 206 warplanes, 170 helicopters, 2,225 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, 13 vessels, 502 unmanned aerial vehicles, 47 units of special equipment, and 114 cruise missiles. In other developments, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces have attacked over 40 towns in the eastern Donbas region.

The sickening examples are from a 24-hour catalogue of sexual torture as a weapon of war by Vladimir Putin ’s forces, it is claimed. They are from one town, Oleksandrivka, in Kherson region, now under Russian occupation, with one-third of homes reportedly destroyed. The harrowing cases were highlighted by Lyudmila Denisova, the Kyiv parliament’s human rights commissioner. “ Russia uses rape and sexual violence in other forms as tactics of warfare, systematically, everywhere and with striking brutality,” she said. “During the last 24 hours, the commissioner's psychological helpline was contacted by persons from Oleksandrivka, Kherson region, who gave permission to publish information on the facts of sexual violence. “Two girls aged 12 and 15 were raped by the Rashists [a term combining “Russian,” “racist” and “fascist”]. “A six-month-old girl was raped by a Russian with a teaspoon.” In another alleged case a mother was at home with her twin boys aged two. Ms Denisova said: “Five Rashists broke in, one held the mother, the other two raped the children orally and anally. “The children died from ruptures and blood loss. “A three-year-old boy was raped in front of his mother by two Rashists, and the child died of his injuries.” She added: “Sexual violence is strictly prohibited by Article 27 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949. ""Rape as a war crime is the most serious crime and one of the components of genocide. “I ask the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, to initiate an investigation into these facts and bring the perpetrators to justice.” Ms Denisova has also called on international action taking “measures to prevent sexual violence by Russian troops”. The Ukrainian human rights commissioner said: “I call on the world community to ensure the imposition of personal sanctions against political leaders, Russian military commanders and perpetrators of these terrible crimes.”",45,7.342220142198397,5.226240173064057,2.11597996913434,14

European intelligence officers told the Guardian that more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from Putin’s army to potentially prepare for a similar brutal campaign in the Ukraine war. Barrel bombs are deadly weapons fashioned out of oil barrels, fuel tanks or gas cylinders which are packed with explosives, fuel, and metal fragments and dropped from helicopters and planes. The Syrian Network for Human Rights revealed that the Syrian regime dropped nearly 82,000 barrel bombs in nine years, killing 11,087 civilians, including 1,821 children. The regime was also accused of filling canisters with chlorine and dropping them on civilians. Barrel bombs can destroy everything in an 800ft radius. State Department Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland described the brutal explosives to NBC News as ""vicious things indiscriminately launched ... at targets without any concern about civilians."" It is believed that the specialists' arrival is a big factor behind both the United States and European nations warning that chemical weapons are likely to be used in Ukraine. ""Barrel bombs are the most horrible and hurtful weapon… We deal with multi-trauma, many amputations and intestines out of the body, it’s too horrible"", a surgeon from Aleppo, Syria's capital, told Amnesty. Despite this, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has denied ever using barrel bombs. Putin, a staunch ally of al-Assad, has already used brutal tactics to kill thousands of civilians in his bloody war. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 7,964 civilian casualties in the country with 3,778 killed and 4,186 injured. However, the true toll is thought to be much higher with the Kremlin's forces using tactics to cover up deaths. It has been reported that around 800 Russian-trained Syrian fighters have signed up to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine. Some say the Kremlin has promised salaries of between $1,500-$4,000 – up to 20 times the amount they would receive in Syria. Videos purporting to show Syrian fighters brandishing posters of President Putin have been circulating but a senior US defence official told reports that evidence of fighters on the frontline has yet to materialise. They said: ""We haven't seen indications that their recruiting efforts have borne fruit and resulted in the actual arrival of foreign fighters from that part of the world."" Recruits are reportedly deployed under contract with the Wagner Group, the Russian private military organisation which has been accused of war crimes in Ukraine's Bucha — where up to 1,000 people were massacred over a few days in early April. This comes as Putin recently named General Alexander Dvornikov as the new war commander in Ukraine. General Dvornikov earnt the moniker ""Butcher of Syria"" as he played a prominent role in the Syrian war and forces under his order were frequently accused of committing crimes against humanity.",45,4.74473526836377,4.464911088414454,0.2798241799493155,13

Fresh footage shared by Ukraine 's Railway Chief Alexander Kamyshin shows Ukraine collecting hundreds of dead Russian soldiers and storing their bodies inside a refrigerated train to then send them back to their families. Mr Kamyshin wrote on Twitter : ""We treat dead Russians better than they treat live Ukrainians. Just another thing that makes us different."" The clip declares that Ukraine preserves the bodies, according to humanitarian law, to then release them to ""mothers and wives."" The video shows people dressed in head-to-toe protective suits and lifting body bags into the trains. The railway network, it says in the video, is prepared to deliver ""cargo 200"" back to Russia and in a message to Putin it says ""Your 'cargo of 200' is waiting on demand."" ""Cargo 200"" is a Soviet military code word for the transportation of military fatalities. The video continually makes references to Russia's unwillingness to repatriate the corpses of their dead soldiers and last week, Anton Gerashchenko, Adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, tweeted: ""Russia is still not picking up the bodies of its dead soldiers, which are in refrigerated cars near Kyiv. There are more than 250 of them."" The video continues: ""Russia hides real losses from families to avoid panic and to avoid payment of compensations."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in March that Putin has more respect for dead pets than those killed in the war and criticized Russia's refusal to repatriate its fallen soldiers. Meanwhile, according to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Putin's bloody war has cost the lives of almost 30,000 soldiers. This comes as Putin's losses continue to pile up with the Armed Forces of Ukraine reporting that 30,000 Russian soldiers have died. British Ministry of Defence also reported that in the first three months of its ‘special military operation’, Russia has likely suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan. Its situation report update continued: ""A combination of poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility, and a command approach which is prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes has led to this high casualty rate, which continues to rise in the Donbas offensive. ""As casualties suffered in Ukraine continue to rise they will become more apparent, and public dissatisfaction with the war and a willingness to voice it may grow."" Ukraine's official statistics say that Putin has also lost over 1,200 tanks, 204 planes and 13 boats.

Russian forces struck a barracks that housed troops at a training base in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not specify whether the casualties from the attack in Desna were military persons or civilians, it is likely linked to the May 17 attack on a military training centre. ""Today we have finished works in Desna. Unfortunately, the statistics are as follows: 87 victims under the rubble in Desna,"" President Zelensky said during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""Eighty-seven corpses, victims killed. The future of Ukraine will lack these people."" On May 17, a Russian military spokesman said high-precision, long-range missiles had hit Ukrainian reserves forces at a training centre near Desna, in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, and at one other site. In March, Russian forces carried out a similar attack on a military base in Yaraviv, in the west of Ukraine, but the attack on Desna had more than double the number of victims. The second-largest toll was following an attack on Kramatorsk's train station where around 52 people were killed. Ukrainian authorities have also said they believe hundreds were trapped under the rubble of a theatre in Mariupol following a bombing in March, but they were unable to confirm the number of deaths. Chernihiv's governor said on Tuesday that the war is not over and has not left the region. He urged residents to “be careful” and listen for air raid sirens. A city of around 300,000 people, Chernihiv is less than 60 miles from both the Russian and Belarusian borders and has been subject to some of the most brutal bombings from Putin's forces. For over a month, the Russian military made it their objective to besiege the city and rained bombs on residents. In March, images showed trenches being dug in an unused field at the edge of the Yalovshchina cemetery, in the city of Chernihiv, to make space for hundreds of dead bodies. As many as fifty people were killed every day during the peak of the campaign in March, with civilians flagrantly targetted while queueing up for food. Human Rights Watch said in a report that Russian forces controlling the Chernihiv region subjected civilians to summary executions, torture and other abuses. A siege of the city lasted thirty-nine days and the city’s mayor said countless civilians died as a result of freezing temperatures, lack of medical care, and shortages of food and medicines.",47,3.7638451670743494,5.3082497968030475,-1.5444046297286982,9

Russian serviceman Vadim Shishimarin - who was captured by Ukrainian troops - has been handed the life term during Ukraine's first war crimes trial held since the start of the invasion in February. Shishimarin, a 21-year-old tank commander, had pleaded guilty to killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the northeastern Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on Feb. 28 after being ordered to shoot him. Judge Serhiy Agafonov said Shishimarin, carrying out a ""criminal order"" by a soldier of higher rank, had fired severalshots at the victim's head from an automatic weapon. Shishimarin, wearing a blue and grey hooded sweatshirt, watched proceedings silently from a reinforced glass box in the courtroom and showed no emotion as the verdict was read out. The trial has huge symbolic significance for Ukraine, which has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civiliansduring the invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes. The Kremlin did not immediately comment on the verdict. It has previously said that it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide assistance. ""Of course we are concerned about the fate of our citizen, but, I repeat, we do not have the capacity to protect hisinterests in person,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Shishimarin, 21, testified last Thursday that he shot a civilian on orders from two officers and pleaded for his victim's widow to forgive him following her heartbreaking statement. ""I acknowledge my guilt... I ask you to forgive me,"" he told the widow Kateryna Shelipova. Ms Shelipova, 62, described to the court the anguish at hearing shots from the garden and calling for her husband, only to find Shishimarin with a gun and her husband’s dead body. She said her husband was a tractor driver who did not possess weapons. Ms Shelipova said the loss of her husband is ""everything for me, he was my protector."" She told the court that Shishimarin deserves a life sentence for killing her husband but voiced she wouldn’t mind if he was exchanged as part of a prisoner swap with Russia for the surrendered Ukrainian defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. She asked Shishimarin what he felt when he killed her husband. ""Do you repent of this crime?"" she asked. He responded: "" I admit my guilt. I understand you can't forgive me. I ask forgiveness."" Shishimarin told the court he first disobeyed his immediate commanding officer’s order to shoot the unarmed civilian but then had no other choice but to follow the order when it was forcefully repeated by another officer. The captured member of a Russian tank unit is being prosecuted under a section of the Ukrainian criminal code that addresses the laws and customs of war.

Putin's forces has suffered heavy losses during the 86 days of fighting since the invasion began. It is widely believed that tens of thousands of Russians have died fighting in Ukraine. Advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Vadym Denysenko, says Russian families haven’t collected the bodies of dead loved ones out of “fear” of the authorities. He said Putin’s government was “intimidating relatives of the dead and missing”. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here They had allegedly told grieving families that they would not receive state compensation for the deaths of their loved ones if they retrieved the bodies from the Ukrainian authorities. This “stops mothers, wives, children from going to the territory of Ukraine and to take the bodies of their dead”, said Denysenko. “This is probably also the first case in the history of mankind when wives, mothers and children of Russian servicemen, choosing between possible compensation and fear of the Russian authorities and the opportunity to bury their child or husband, choose the former.” Alongside that, he claimed that Russia was refusing to take back any of its dead, with bodies piling up in Ukraine. Vadym added: “We can only say that this is probably the first war in the history of mankind when one country refuses to take the bodies of its dead.” The Russian corpses that Ukraine has retrieved from the battlefield are kept in refrigerated train carriages. But it is suspected that Putin is in no rush for them to return home because a flood of dead bodies would highlight the true death toll of the war. “We appeal to the mothers, relatives, and friends of those soldiers who died on Ukrainian territory to come, identify and collect the bodies of their relatives,” Vadym said. Ukraine also highlighted how it had search teams which collected the bodies of Russian invaders and, where possible, identified and tagged them. In a report, Army Inform, the information agency of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, said: ""We receive information about such burials and simply abandoned bodies in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region primarily from our military.” Information about the dead Russian soldiers left behind by their commanders often came from the local residents who survived the occupation. The report said: “Having discovered a number of graves of destroyed Russian servicemen, we deliver their remains to refrigerated wagons only after a certain period.” There have been reports of Russian commanders shooting dead their wounded, rather than retrieving them for medical help. This comes as the Russian invasion of Ukraine comes towards the end of its third month of fighting, since beginning on February 24. Estimate vary, with Ukraine claiming Moscow has lost in excess of 24,000 troops, but most calculations but the upper end of the Kremlin's losses around 20,000 dead.",45,4.867317678086099,4.844322815385694,0.022994862700405072,18

Eventually parts of the building begin to be visible as the smoke clears and the damage and destruction can be seen. It's unclear how many casualties there are. Further footage shared on Telegram shows more Russian air attacks that have taken place recently. This includes a Russian Iskander-M strike on a Ukrainian position near Petrovsk, in Kharkiv. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said in a social media post early on Saturday that Russia was trying to destroy the city of Sievierodonetsk. In a video posted on Telegram, he said: “Shelling continues from morning to the evening and also throughout the night”. In the early hours of this morning air raid sirens could be heard over much of Ukraine, including in the region around the capital Kyiv, and the southern port of Odessa. After an initial failed push for the capital, Russia withdrew and reorganised its forces to focus on the east of the country. Last month, Moscow announced its new intention to capture the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, much of Ukraine’s industrial Donbas region. Amongst losses suffered elsewhere, Russian forces have successfully been advancing into the Luhansk region. And recently, in a sign that politicians in Moscow might be ramping up the war effort, they said they would consider letting Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 join the military. The last remaining Ukrainian-held territories in the Donbas region are expected to become central in Putin’s ongoing war efforts. The cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, both in Luhansk, are crucial Ukrainian controlled cities in a pocket that Russia has been trying, and failing, to take since April. However, amid the ongoing fighting, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said today that the war could only be resolved through “diplomacy”. His comments come amidst a deadlock in negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Speaking to a Ukrainian TV channel, he said: “The end will be through diplomacy” and he added that the war “will be bloody, there will be fighting, but it will only definitively end through diplomacy”. Recent weeks have seen Russia forced from the outskirts of Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv. However, they have re-taken some of the lost ground and combined with the end of fighting in Mariupol this means Russia now controls a large portion of the south and east of Ukraine.",47,5.233432173375985,6.2083629210807665,-0.9749307477047813,6

Footage and pictures from the scene show destroyed military vehicles- with a Ukrainian soldier claiming the Russians looked like ""some sort of suicide club"".

Two disabled men in the Donbas region - close to the Russian border - were mobilised by Russian militants despite being physically unable to fight, a Ukrainian Telegram channel claims. One man, who told Ukrainian security services of his ordeal after being arrested, said Vladimir Putin's troops found him at his workplace and gave him ""call-up papers"" forcing him onto the battlefield. Another soldier was also arrested and told Kyiv intelligence agents he saw ""people with cerebral spastic infantile paralysis and without arms"" sent into battle, according to Ukraine NOW. A man with a ""severe head injury"" at the time of his recruitment also told officials soldiers were being mobilised with ""no bulletproof vests"". He added the recruiters ""gave out only a helmet and a cross"" and that bulletproof vests had to be bought for 10,000 rubles (£130). It comes as reports emerge of Russia sustaining heavy losses of around 28,000 men, according to Ukrainian officials, which amounts for almost 20 per cent of the total force Moscow sent across the border on February 24. The Kremlin has also lost as much as 60 per cent of its equipment, including tanks, artillery launchers and other costly military hardware. It's believed that some Russian squads - now focusing on the Donbas region - are depleted to as little as 20 per cent of their former full strength. This void has left the Kremlin vying for assistance from private military companies and mercenaries, Aljazeera reports. There are several reasons for the Russian army's shocking performance during the war. They have been badly neglected over the years. Poorly trained, badly fed and sent into battle with insufficient supplies, which even included rations that were five years out of date. Some had so little fuel they broke down. Top down corruption in Russia has led to funding being diverted into the wrong hands, leading to a cynical and under-performing force. Discipline is a huge issue and senior officers have been sent to the frontline to try to control troops, before getting killed. The backbone of any army is its non-commissioned officers and Russia’s are badly trained. Many recruits are complete novice conscripts. Russian troops fled the outskirts of Kyiv weeks ago to concentrate on the mission in the east, where the two sides have been battling since 2014. They tried repeatedly to take the north-eastern city of Kharkiv and reports indicate they have lost this crucial area. Despite grandiose Russian claims of a huge victory in the key city of Mariupol, Ukraine ’s troops are still holding out in the steel works and their struggle is now a symbol of Ukrainian defiance and bravery. Russia is barely able to claim having taken any major cities in Ukraine and is failing to keep hold of ground it had once dominated. The Ukrainian counter seems to be gaining ground and momentum. In the short term it appears Russia will continue to take heavy losses while claiming the lives of Ukrainian civilians with brutal bombardments. Ukrainian troops are rallying but this next stage in their defence is crucial. Until now they have been constantly flanking Russian forces, ambushing them and cutting off supply lines.",7,3.5744034672116114,5.916747445601767,-2.3423439783901556,6

At the start of May, Russian tech terrorists threatened to shut down ventilators in British hospitals, it was claimed. It came a few days after an alleged cyber criminal and supporter of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin was arrested in the UK on May 1. The accused, who is said to be London-based, was detained after a police raid in the aftermath of a cyber assault on government and media websites in Romania, according to reports. He was reportedly a member of hacking group Killnet, which has since warned it will disable NHS ventilators, as well as those in Romania and Moldova if he is not released. The 'gang' has claimed responsibility for the attacks, committed in retaliation for the country's support for Ukraine. The official government webpage and defence ministry were targeted, as well as political parties and other companies. A source told The Sun : ""The UK has robust cyber security measures in place and, working with partners, the NCA would lead an appropriate response to any cyber crime incident having a significant impact on the UK."" It comes after the world’s top intelligence alliance warned last month Russian hackers are plotting cyber attacks on the NHS, nuclear power plants and Whitehall ministries. The Five Eyes security network - involving the UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand - issued an alert accusing the Russian government of exploring options for potential web assaults against critical organisations. The spy coalition urged them to bolster cyber defences as they face a heightened risk of Kremlin-sponsored attacks. According to the alert, ""evolving intelligence"" suggests hackers within the Russian government are seeking to engage in ""malicious cyber activity"" in response to the ""unprecedented economic sanctions"" imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

The horrific report comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Defence logged 10 incidence of rape, including offences against eight children. In a tweet the ministry wrote: ""Today, in just one hour, 10 reports of rape by the [Russian] occupiers, including 8 children, were received from newly liberated villages in the Kharkiv region. Yesterday - 56 reports. ""Among the children: two 10-year-old boys and a 1-year-old boy who died of his injuries."" Ukrainian journalist Iryna Matviyishyn supported the claims with a list of children allegedly abused by Russian soldiers. Ms Matviyishyn also alleged that Kremlin troops had raped a nine-year-old triplet while their mother was forced to watch. A two-year-old girl was also assaulted by two soldiers, the journalist claims. The reporter cited Ukraine’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Lyudmyla Denisova as the source of the allegations. She added: ""According to Denisova, Russians also raped two men aged 67 and 78. “And, reportedly, the Commissioner's Psychological Assistance Line receives calls about such war crimes every day now. ""This is a very small part of territory that was liberated from Russians, compared to those towns, villages and cities that are still under the occupation. ""We can only imagine the number of such atrocities in Kherson, Melitopol, Mariupol, Berdyansk, and others."" Cruel Russian troops also gunned down a teen playing football and held hundreds of people - including babies - hostage underground in the brutal early days of the invasion, a new report has revealed. Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused the Kremlin’s troops of an “abhorrent and cruel” campaign against civilians in late February to early March. Researchers from the humanitarian group visited 17 villages and small towns in Kyiv and Chernihiv regions and discovered 22 executions, six disappearances and seven cases of torture. Among the war crimes uncovered from talking to survivors, they found Dmytro Solovei, 14, was shot dead as he kicked a ball about on a playground in the village of Nova Basan. His older brother was killed as he attempted to retrieve Dmytro’s body. Shockingly, in Yahidne, survivors said Russian soldiers held more than 350 people hostage in a school basement for a month, with 70 of the captives children. Five were babies. The captives had little air or room to even lay down and were forced to use buckets if they needed the toilet. One said of the time underground: “After a week, everyone was coughing violently. “Almost all the children had high fevers, spasms from coughing, and would throw up.” Ten of the adults died during the ordeal. Giorgi Gogia, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said: “The numerous atrocities by Russian forces occupying parts of northeastern Ukraine early in the war are abhorrent, unlawful, and cruel. “These abuses against civilians are evident war crimes that should be promptly and impartially investigated and appropriately prosecuted.” Other appalling acts of cruelty uncovered by teams include Russians holding dozens of people in a 40 meter room in Dymer, where the men were blindfolded and handcuffed for several weeks.

Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, 21, testified on Thursday that he shot a civilian on orders from two officers and pleaded for his victim's widow to forgive him following her heartbreaking statement. ""I acknowledge my guilt... I ask you to forgive me,"" he told the widow Kateryna Shelipova. Ms Shelipova, 62, described to the court the anguish at hearing shots from the garden and calling for her husband, only to find Shishimarin with a gun and her husband’s dead body. She said her husband was a tractor driver who did not possess weapons. Ms Shelipova said the loss of her husband is ""everything for me, he was my protector."" She told the court that Shishimarin deserves a life sentence for killing her husband but voiced she wouldn’t mind if he was exchanged as part of a prisoner swap with Russia for the surrendered Ukrainian defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. She asked Shishimarin what he felt when he killed her husband. ""Do you repent of this crime?"" she asked. He responded: "" I admit my guilt. I understand you can't forgive me. I ask forgiveness."" The young sergeant is convicted of shooting the Ukrainian man in the head through an open car window in a village in the northeastern Sumy region on February 28, just four days into the Russian invasion. If sentenced he will likely get life imprisonment. Shishimarin told the court he first disobeyed his immediate commanding officer’s order to shoot the unarmed civilian but then had no other choice but to follow the order when it was forcefully repeated by another officer. The captured member of a Russian tank unit is being prosecuted under a section of the Ukrainian criminal code that addresses the laws and customs of war. Another trial of two Russians in Ukraine started on Tuesday in the Kharkiv region. Alexander Bobykin and Alexander Ivanov are accused of violating the laws or customs of war from their shelling in Kharkiv. The duo have already pleaded guilty to violating the customs of war. These three trials are the start of justice for Ukrainians, as Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova previously said they are readying war crimes cases against 41 Russian soldiers for offences that included bombing civilian infrastructure, killing civilians, rape and looting.

Yury Borisov, deputy premier in charge of military development, said new mobile system Peresvet was already deployed with Moscow’s forces. “It can ‘blind’ all satellite reconnaissance systems of an ‘enemy’ up to an orbit of 1,500km [932 miles], thanks to laser radiation,” he said. Reports have said Western satellites have been used to hand intelligence to Ukraine on Russian military movements. Borisov said Russian weapon designers demonstrated a separate new laser system to knock down enemy drones with a burst of intense heat. “Today our physicists developed, and are almost serially producing, laser systems causing heat damage,” he said. “This was shown yesterday from a 5km [3 miles] distance… “A drone was burned in five seconds and simply stopped existing. “Weapon systems on the way will be based on new physical principles. “And will define our Armed Forces’ combat readiness in the future.” Borisov said that “laser weapons, electromagnetic broadband weapons, will replace [conventional weapons] in the coming decades. “This is no longer exotic but reality already.” Vladimir Putin had unveiled the Peresvet - after medieval Orthodox warrior monk Alexander Peresvet - in 2018. It comes after terrifying footage showed the moment a Russian ‘Orlan-10’ drone took to the sky and dropped bombs on a target in the Donbas region. The Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) claims the Orlan-10 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used to assist civilians allegedly being used as a human shield, as well as carry out reconnaissance operations to find Ukrainian ammo depots and military bases. The footage shows Russian troops loading one Orlan-10 UAV with missiles before it takes to the sky and bombs targets in a field. Days ago Ukraine showed off its devastating Brit-made Brimstone missiles in action. The weapon has been adapted to be fired from small vehicles on the Ukrainian battlefield rather than their usual launchpads - warplanes or as drones of naval ships. Video footage released by the Ukrainian defence ministry is said to show the Brimstone and also the NLAW new generation portable anti-tank weapon. A statement from Ukrainian forces said: “From the first days of the open invasion of Russia, the support of our foreign partners has played an important role in countering enemy forces. “Weapons, material and technical means that give us fellow countries are our strength on the way to victory. We are learning fast and learning new weapons. “And foreign instructors help us master them without delay. After all, we are fighting not only for the land. “We fight for our principles, history, senses, for the very existence of the Ukrainian people, their values and freedom. “And we are grateful that along this way, the titanic support is given to us by the partner states of the free world. “Together for the Victory.” The Brimstone came into service in 2005 with an updated version supplied to the RAF six years ago. It can strike using laser-seeking guidance or autonomous targeting. In another video, said to have been released by Ukrainian forces, it claims to show the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol hit with incendiary of phosphorus bombs by Putin ’s forces.",49,7.532415034681233,5.455373160191152,2.0770418744900816,4

Colonel Denis Kozlov, 40, was the second commander of the 12th Separate Guards Engineers of Keningsbersko-Gorodok Red Banner Brigade to die in the conflict. He was buried in Murom, Vladimir Region, on Tuesday, BBC News Russia reported. Col Kozlov had replaced Colonel Sergei Porokhnya, 45, who was killed in Ukraine on March 14. Kozlov died while building a pontoon crossing for the further advance of the troops, on May 11. According to local Russian news outlet Murom24 he ""heroically died when guiding a pontoon ferry to make a further advance of the troops."" On Friday, Putin's army suffered heavy losses while trying to establish a pontoon crossing across the Seversky Donets River near the village of Belogorovka in the Luhansk region. Ukrainian military claimed to have destroyed a pontoon bridge and part of a Russian armoured column, according to footage published by the Ukrainian military on Friday. The number of deaths is unknown but the video shows multiple burnt-out military vehicles and parts of the pontoon bridge submerged. Reuters reports that images also show damaged vehicles, including tanks, in the forest and on the road leading to the river. It is thought Col Kozlov was among the Russian troops who perished in the failed advance across the Seversky Donets River when he and his men were ambushed by a Ukrainian attack. This is the third unsuccessful attempt from Putin's forces to build bridges across the Seversky Donets River in eastern Ukraine, Sergei Gaidai, head of the military administration of the Lugansk region, told the BBC. ""We destroyed Russian boats and helicopters that they used to cover their attempts [to build bridges]"", Gaidai claims that the Russian military tried to disguise their operations. Col Kozlov was posthumously decorated with the Russian Order of Courage and laid to rest in his hometown Murom, in Vladimir Oblast. His death now makes him the 42nd known Colonel to perish in the war, indicating the huge toll suffered by Putin’s army. With the attrition rate now standing at around one colonel every two days.

Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US was providing “Ukraine with information and intelligence that they can use to defend themselves”, but Adrienne Watson, a national security council spokesperson, said intelligence was not provided “with the intent to kill Russian generals”.

If convicted Shishimarin faces up to life imprisonment. The Kyiv government has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during the invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes and accused Kyiv of staging them to smear its forces. The SBU Security Service of Ukraine conducted the investigation into the case, it said. State prosecutor Andriy Synyuk told reporters after his first hearing last week: ""This is the first case today. But soon there will be a lot of these cases."" Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said on May 12 there were many examples of possible war crimes since the Russian invasion and that 1,000 bodies had been recovered so far in the Kyiv region. Last month, the International Criminal Court (ICC) said on April 25 that it would take part in a joint team with Ukrainian, Polish and Lithuanian prosecutors investigating war crimes allegations against Russian forces.

2022-05-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/putin-make-war-decisions-russian-26994059,'Micromanaging' Putin interfering in Russian war tactics despite health rumours,"The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine seems to be leaning in favour of Ukraine recently, with Russian forces suffering several setbacks in the past week after multiple failed attempts to cross the strategic Siverskyi Donets river. With the conflict being described as Vladimir Putin's war, as well as speculations of the Kremlin leader's health - including recent claims of him suffering from blood cancer - it raises the question of how involved Putin is in making war decisions. Here's what you need to know about Putin's involvement in war strategies and decisions, as revealed by Western military sources this week. Western official sources have claimed that Vladimir Putin has become increasingly involved in low-level military strategy in Ukraine. In particular, Putin is said to be playing a significant role in determining troop movements in the Donbas region, after Ukrainian forces successfully prevented Russians from crossing the river. The officials also said that Putin is working closely with General Valery Gerasimov, the top commander of the Russian armed forces, despite rumours that the senior general had been suspended after multiple defeats. According to The Times, military sources believe that Putin's heavy hand in military operations may be contributing to Russia's failures in Ukraine. Putin ""micromanaging"" Russia's war efforts is a tactic that's often used in Russian military fights, according to Simon Miles, an assistant professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy. Most Western armies are trained to spot opportunities to carry out their orders based on shifts in an enemy's position or readiness. Meanwhile, major decisions in the Russian military have to be run up the chain of command, often to a high-ranking officer, before they can be implemented Miles, who is a historian of the Soviet Union and US-Soviet relations, believes that this common practice of sending top-level officials to the front line is a major reason Russia has lost so many generals since the war began. He explained: ""It's not the most combat-effective military culture by a long shot, but it helps us understand the Russians' poor battlefield performance."" Speaking of Putin's involvement in war decisions, he said: ""The president's low-level decision-making is probably contributing to tactical failures now, but more importantly, it is the cause of the massive strategic failure in week one."" He added: ""I think it is inevitable that [Putin] is getting into micromanagement because this is so very much his war. We know more and more that this whole thing was planned by a very small group, with Putin at its centre.""",7,5.616149169690774,3.8247121965765554,1.791436973114219,12

Videos show the much-feared urban warfare armoured vehicles reportedly in the Donbas, where fighting in Ukraine is now centred. The deployment comes after Russia has suffered significant losses of its tanks at the hands of Ukrainian forces so far. The capture of Russian tanks was so common that the Ukrainian government had to issue instructions on how to hand them over to the authorities to make sure ordinary Ukrainians weren't driving them round. This comes as Ukraine has said it destroyed Russian tanks using British-made Brimstone missiles for the first time. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In the days leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the terminator tanks were seen amassing near the Ukrainian border . The move came shortly after Russia had said it would pull troops back from the border, and before Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine three days later. Newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta confirmed “a platoon of Terminator tank support vehicles was used for the first time in battle in the Donbas”. The BMPTs - or tank support combat vehicles as they are designated - were seen near Severodonetsk in Luhansk region. “They are involved in the fire destruction of Ukrainian positions, armoured vehicles, and crews of anti-tank missile systems,” a defence source told state news agency RIA Novosti. The vehicles are equipped with grenade launchers, anti-tank systems and small arms, and were nicknamed Terminator by its manufacturers Uralvagonzavod. They saw action in Syria and it is unclear why Putin’s generals have delayed its deployment until now. One theory is that his beleaguered commanders do not trust it to be as all-conquering as its name suggests. Pro-Russian war reporter Alexander Sladkov posted: “Thank God we are starting to use Terminators. “There might be issues and mistakes, but practice is everything.” In the videos, a steady stream of the tanks can be seen rolling by along the residential street in Ukraine. This all comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues into its 83rd day. After Russia's initial push to seize Ukraine's cities and urban centres, Russia quickly found its progress stalling in the face of tougher than expected resistance. After weeks of their forces stalling outside of Kyiv, but unable to penetrate the Ukrainian capital, Russia pulled back and regrouped in the Donbas in the east of the country, where fighting is now focused. Mariupol has been one of the flashpoints of fighting, and the city where Russia has made the most progress. Ukrainian forces made their last stand in the Azovstal steel and iron works in the city. However, in the last 24 hours reports emerging from the city seem to suggest that the fighters have surrendered but their fate is unknown.",7,5.14666406821365,4.1796002508560735,0.9670638173575767,6

Human Rights Watch has documented that Russian soldiers requested civilians to become execution “volunteers”, and there are also numerous cases of civilians being held in “dirty and suffocating conditions” thus developing bedsores. One woman from the Chernihiv region said she witnessed soldiers suggesting to a 63-year-old man with cancer that he could “hang himself” to alleviate the pain he was experiencing from sitting for days in a school basement. “The numerous atrocities by Russian forces occupying parts of northeastern Ukraine early in the war are abhorrent, unlawful, and cruel,” said Giorgi Gogia, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Gogia urged that these war crimes should be ""promptly and impartially"" investigated and appropriately prosecuted. To chronicle the horrors, the organisation visited 17 villages and small towns in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions where they investigated 22 apparent summary executions, nine other unlawful killings, six possible enforced disappearances, and seven cases of torture. They encountered 21 civilians who all described unlawful confinement in inhuman and degrading conditions. Since Putin invaded Ukraine at the end of February, his forces have been implicated in numerous atrocities that likely amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. In one of the newly documented killings by Human Rights Watch, Anastasia Andriivna said that she was at home when soldiers detained her son after they found his old military coat. A few weeks later, on March 31, the day after Russian forces withdrew, Andriivna found her son’s body 100 metres from her house after recognising his trainers poking out a barn door. She said: ""He was lying there in a foetal position, with his hands tucked under his head, and his jacket draped over his shoulders. He had been shot in the ear, with blood covering his face. ""His best friend was lying next to him; he had also been shot. His legs were bent in an unnatural position."" The organisation has credible evidence which shows troops forcing civilians, for days or weeks, into dirty and suffocating conditions at sites such as school basements, a room in a window manufacturing plant, and a pit in a boiler room. In Yahidne, over 350 villagers, including at least 70 children were held in a school basement for 28 days with little air or room to lie down. One of the women held in the basement and who sat close to the door, which had cracks in it, described seeing an armoured vehicle bringing a man, covered in a blanket, to the schoolyard. She saw Russian soldiers put him on his knees and question him, and then throw him into the boiler room on the other side of the schoolyard. The British government says it is considering supporting a special international tribunal to try Putin for the war in Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that ministers were looking at the “most effective way” of holding Russia ’s leaders to account for “appalling war crimes”.",45,5.572921984884535,4.593872612283463,0.9790493726010716,14
2022-05-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-could-swap-ukrainian-steel-26991177,Russia 'could swap Ukrainian steel plant siege heroes with imprisoned officers',"Hundreds of besieged Ukrainian soldiers have emerged from their Mariupol bunker hell and handed themselves over to Russian forces. Their evacuation into Russian custody triggered prisoner swap talks with Moscow expected to demand Ukraine releases imprisoned officers. Even as they evacuated Russian forces continued to pound Ukraine with missiles, killing ten civilians and injuring three in a strike on Chernihiv. And in Lviv officials were investigating Monday night’s air strikes on the western region which were aimed at crippling a military storage area. Many of the Mariupol troops have horrific injuries and are being treated at medical facilities in Russian-held territory in east Ukraine. It comes amid fears Russian forces will appoint Chechen soldiers to “control” the citizens of Mariupol and have been given a free pass to “loot and intimidate” locals. More than 260 Ukrainian fighters freed themselves from a labyrinth of underground tunnels beneath Azovstal steelworks having held off Russian attacks for more than 80 days. Civilians and Ukrainian fighters, many from the Azov Regiment, hid in the Soviet-era steel complex which was designed to withstand nuclear attack. There are fears for the welfare of the soldiers after “death penalty” calls from Russian lawmakers and politicians branding them “Nazis.” Ukraine’s military command had said in the early hours of Tuesday that the mission to defend the steel plant was over and President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive.” A convoy of buses took the soldiers from the plant to Russian-occupied Novoazovsk, although it is not known if and how many Ukrainians are left in the complex. Moscow has depicted the Azov Regiment as one of the main inspirations behind Moscow’s ridiculed narrative that Ukraine is being governed by “Nazis.” The Azov Regiment was formed in 2014 as an extreme right-wing volunteer militia to fight Russian-backed separatists but the troops deny being fascist, racist or Nazis. Ukraine says it has been reformed away from its radical nationalist origins to be integrated into the National Guard and commanders call them:”Heroes of our time.” A Russian Supreme Court hearing will rule on whether the Azov regiment should be designated a terrorist organisation on May 26, according to the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy said in his address that “the work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy - and time”. But Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, Russia ’s lower house, said: “Nazi criminals should not be exchanged.” Lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, one of Russia’s negotiators in talks with Ukraine, called the evacuated combatants “animals in human form” and said they should receive the death penalty. He said: “They do not deserve to live after the monstrous crimes against humanity that they have committed and that are committed continuously against our prisoners.” Pavlo Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Mariupol Mayor, accused Russia of planning to hand Mariupol to Chechen troops, explaining: “It becomes a little clear what the occupiers plan to do with Mariupol and who will be the recovery curator.” Referring to Ramzan Kadrov, the Chechen leader, he added: “In order to intimidate and suppress the resistance it is planned to give the city to the Kadyrovites.” He indicated that the Chechens will be given freedom of the port trade and will be at liberty to steal anything they like, explaining the deal came : “. . . . With port and looting rights.”",47,4.73938087676282,4.394409268508981,0.34497160825383943,9

Mikhail Khodaryonok, a retired Soviet colonel, has given a damning assessment on Russian state TV of Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine ⁠— indicating the Kremlin leader is failing with the whole world against them. In an astonishing tirade that lasts nearly five minutes, Khodaryonok told Russian state TV to stop taking ""information tranquillisers"" and rejected the idea that the Ukrainian army is becoming demoralised. BBC reporter Francis Scarr called it a moment of ""extremely rare candour"" in which the former air defence commander said Russia 's position on the world stage was in ""full geopolitical isolation"". He said that as much as Russia would hate to admit it, virtually the whole world is against them. Khodaryonok spoke about Russia saying it will not ""put up with"" Finland and Sweden’s bid to join the western NATO alliance. He said to look at the situation as ""a whole from the overall strategic position"" and sabre-rattling with sending missiles towards Finland is not threatening it is, in fact, ""very amusing"". Khodaryonok said the Ukrainian troops are bolstered by reams of foreign help and that they will be even more equipped in the ""near future"", massively expanding the abilities of Kyiv's forces. The anchor, Skabeyeva, repeatedly tries to interrupt the ex-colonel by saying the army will be made up largely of conscripts. Khodaryonok says that is irrelevant, but what is noteworthy is the Ukrainian desire to ""protect one's homeland"". He thinks the troops intend to fight ""to the last man"". Speaking with the show's host Olga Skabeyeva, he said: ""They're saying it themselves, that 'for us, there’s no difficulty in mobilising a million people'. The whole issue is to what extent they're able to supply this army of modern weapons and military hardware."" Skabeyeva has earned the moniker of Putin's ""iron doll"" and Russian media coverage of the war has been framed and censored so heavily that many Russians fail to believe the scale of loss to life and infrastructure in Ukraine. Skabeyeva insisted that it is just the West against Russia. To which Khodaryonok replied: ""You will agree that this is not a normal situation. ""As for India and China, which you spoke about, their support for our country is not so unconditional."" Khodaryonok's scathing remarks come as the British Ministry of Defence estimated that Russia has likely lost ""one third"" of its ground forces. NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also said this week that Ukraine could win the conflict. At a meeting of foreign ministers, he said: ""Russia's war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned. ""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, and their major offensive in Donbas has stalled. Russia is not achieving its strategic objectives."" Khodaryonok reminded Russian viewers that ""European aid will fully come into effect, so a million armed Ukrainian soldiers need to be viewed as a reality of the very near future."" He surmised that the situation for Russians will ""frankly get worse"" and he warned that sooner or later the reality of history will hit Russians ""so hard"" that they will regret it.",7,4.808272725785792,4.218731562515632,0.5895411632701597,7
2022-05-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-failing-ukraine-war-due-26988117,"Russia failing in Ukraine war due to Putin meddling in decisions, sources say","Vladimir Putin has been meddling in everyday battlefield decisions which has lead to Russia 's failures in the Ukraine war, sources say. The tyrant has been making tactical decisions usually reserved for officers in charge of as few as 700 troops - rather than a national armed force of over 150,000 soldiers. Putin and his war-tactician crony General Valery Gerasimov are micromanaging battle decisions - which are unfitting for men of their position, a military source said. The source said: “We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision-making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier."" The source compared the situation to Amazon businessman Jeff Bezos, who ""doesn't deliver your parcels"" but ""makes strategy decisions"". Last week rumours swirled that the chief of staff had been axed for failing to capture Ukraine as quickly as Putin wanted. But the general is still ""up and running"" and helping Putin's meddling, the source told The Times. They said Putin and Gerasimov are making orders usually made by a ""colonel or brigadier"" - who generally command two battalions at a time. Each battalion would contain roughly 900 servicemen or women, they add. But these battalions - dubbed BTGs - are being blasted back by Ukrainian forces, and the military source predicts Russian forces may have dwindled to as little as 700 soldiers, a second military source revealed. Putin's meddling may be the root of failures in the Donbas region, which the Kremlin expected to capture quickly due to pro-Russian support in the area. Confidence in Moscow has turned to despair after Russian troops failed to capture cities in the Russian speaking West. Western sources have pondered why Ukraine - which is outgunned and outmanned - continues to beat Russia on the battlefield. The head of the British Army, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, told Parliament yesterday it was because Ukraine is involved in an ""existential fight for its nation"". This will guarantee the survival of the Kyiv government, he said. Former FSB agent Igor Girkin - who orchestrated the annexation of Crimea - wrote on social media that Russia's attempts to capture Donbas had failed. He wrote: ""In more than two weeks of fierce hostilities, only tactical successes have been reached. But trouncing Moscow may have dire consequences for the rest of the world, with some experts saying Putin might press the button and unleash a nuclear war if his ""special operation"" fails. Sir Antony Beevor says the Russian President believes NATO's 'advance' on his own country's borders is the equivalent to the Nazis moving through Europe 80 years ago. And the push for Finland and Sweden to join the alliance in recent days amid the despot's catastrophic invasion of Ukraine will have done little to ease his misplaced suspicions. Sir Antony, who has published several books on the Second World War, said Putin genuinely thinks the Red Army fought off Adolf Hitler's Wehrmacht ""single-handed"" while the western allies wanted to ""stab the Soviet Union in the back"". Moscow's current invasion, which it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists, has jolted European security.",7,3.7860160033073673,4.4867177247878685,-0.7007017214805011,12

In a grave warning to western allies, Mayor Vadym Boychenko said that the number will only increase if more pressure is not piled on the Russian President. Boychenko is firefighting a crisis of a huge scale, with 82 days of bombardment and decomposing bodies infiltrating the water supply, thus triggering a deadly epidemic. After months of bombardment, Ukraine ’s military said on Monday it was ending its combat mission as evacuations at the embattled Azovstal steel plant commenced. Around 260 Ukrainian fighters were taken to Russian-held territory and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said they will exchange them for Russian prisoners of war. Speaking with the i Newspaper, Boychenko said that the evil created by Russia in Mariupol is ""even worse than Nazi Germany"". He continued: ""In the Second World War, 10,000 people were killed in Mariupol in a two-year occupation. In two months of this blood-shedding war, Russia has killed more than 20,000. Putin is a bigger evil than Hitler and we must stop him. “He will not stop at Ukraine. It is not enough for Russia. That is why we need to stop him as soon as possible so Russia cannot continue to spread its influence in Europe. We need to have our territories back.” Putin's forces tried to take the port city before, in 2014. As a huge industrial centre and port on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol would be a huge economic coup for Russia and is also a main supply route from Rostov into southern Ukraine. Boychenko spoke of the fear civilians face daily, along with no electricity or gas, nor food. But the biggest problem now, he says, ""is with the drinking water."" Bodies are littered across the city, causing the soil to get poisoned, eventually getting into underground water and into rivers and the sea. He continued by saying weather is getting warmer and, according to the estimates of doctors, the city can expect contagious diseases that will take thousands of lives. The Russians wheeled out similar tactics in Mariupol to those used in Syria. Troops repeatedly hit hospitals and bullied civilians into evacuating after targeting shelters and evacuation corridors. Once the city was mostly cleared the Russians could then focus all efforts against the defenders and pushing them into a last stronghold. The situation in Mariupol is bleak — Boychenko saying there are also no medical facilities and the council has warned that cholera, dysentery and E.coli could spread as temperatures creep up and thousands of bodies lie slain among the rubble. He said the occupiers claim they are a competent authority but they don’t understand what they are doing. And he added that it will take up to two years to restore the gas and water.",47,4.772006522629076,4.172299152895552,0.5997073697335242,29
2022-05-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-tank-destroyed-bungling-drivers-26982718,Bungling Russian tank drivers ignore wreckage and drive through minefield,"Dramatic video is claimed to show a Russian tank being destroyed after bungling troops drove it through a minefield - even though there was another wrecked tank there. The clip is claimed to show two BMP-2 IFV tanks put out of action during Vladimir Putin's assault on Donbas in Ukraine. In the 13 second footage, two large plumes of smoke are seen as the Russian tank steers into mines, which send mud flying into the air. Ukraine's military estimates that Russia has lost more than 1,200 tanks since the invasion began in February, while intelligence chiefs believe that more than a third of its ground forces have been obliterated. Latest estimates claim that more than 27,000 of Putin's troops have died during the assault on Ukraine. It is also claimed to have lost 200 planes, 165 helicopters, and almost 3,000 armoured personnel carriers. A British intelligence assessment released on Sunday said: ""Russia has now likely suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed in February. ""Russia's Donbas offensive has lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule. ""Despite small-scale initial advances, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains over the past month whilst sustaining consistently high level of attrition."" Russia has previously been accused of using banned anti-personnel landmines during its invasion. In March Ukrainian explosives technicians discovered the mines, which can indiscriminately kill and maim people within an apparent 16-meter range. Human Rights Watch said that Ukraine does not possess this type of landmine, with arms director Steve Goose stating: “Countries around the world should forcefully condemn Russia’s use of banned antipersonnel landmines in Ukraine. “These weapons do not differentiate between combatants and civilians and leave a deadly legacy for years to come.” Anti-vehicle mines are not banned, but the UN has warned about their deadly legacy. This morning Ukraine admitted defeat in the battle of Mariupol, saying it was working to evacuate all remaining troops from the stronghold. The evacuation of hundreds of fighters, many wounded, to Russian-held towns, likely marked the end of the longest and bloodiest battle of the Ukraine war. Mariupol is now in ruins after a Russian siege that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of people in the city. With the rest of Mariupol firmly in Russian hands, hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians had holed up beneath the city's Azovstal steelworks. ""The 'Mariupol' garrison has fulfilled its combat mission,"" the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said in a statement. ""The supreme military command ordered the commanders of the units stationed at Azovstal to save the lives of the personnel...

Fassakhov Bulat Lenarovych, a 21-year-old soldier from the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, stands accused of being part of a gang of invaders who committed war crimes in the region around Kyiv. A press release published by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) today detailed his alleged crimes, as well as featuring a series of photos of the accused rapist. The release states that Lenarovych broke into the house of a Ukrainian family and locked them all in the basement - aside from one young girl. The occupier raped the girl after threatening to kill her family, then repeated the atrocity along with three accomplices. “Under the supervision of Kyiv Region Prosecutor’s Office, the SSU has notified him, in absentia, of suspicion of violating laws and customs of war,” the release went on. “He is a native of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, and serves in the 30th separate motorized rifle brigade of the 2nd guards combined army of the central military district of Russia.” “The SSU established that during the temporary occupation of one of the towns in the Kyiv region this individual committed a number of war crimes against civilian population. Witnesses have identified him and confirmed the facts of crimes committed by him.” Several images of the accused rapist show him in full regalia; one a front-on mug shot presumably shot for the military, and another of Lenarovych in an army beret, taken by someone sitting beside him. Another shows a serious and unsmiling Lenarovych posing in full regalia with a woman holding his arm, presumed to be his mother. The last image of Lenarovich shows him standing with two people his own age, presumably friends. While his companions are smiling, he shows no emotion. Late last month The Mirror reported on a 14-year-old girl who reportedly fell pregnant after being raped by five Russian soldiers in Ukraine. The teenager, from Bucha, plans to keep the child after doctors warned if she had an abortion now she may not be able to have children again, the report said. Her story has been told by psychologist Oleksandra Kvitko, who works on the ombudsman's hotline for psychological assistance, with the consent of the victim's parents. The psychologist is said to be working with the young girl to learn how to accept her child. Kvitko now works with five girls between the ages 14-18 who allegedly became pregnant after being raped by Russian soldiers. The youngest victim she works with is only 10. Kvitko told Radio Svoboda : ""Girls aged 14, 15, 16 are often raped. After the war, there will be many pregnant teenagers in Ukraine"". Victims include women, men and young children.",45,5.7823920241724265,7.884818418584733,-2.1024263944123067,14

The Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) claims the Orlan-10 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used to assist civilians allegedly being used as a human shield, as well as carry out reconnaissance operations to find Ukrainian ammo depots and military bases. The footage shows Russian troops loading one Orlan-10 UAV with missiles before it takes to the sky and bombs targets in a field. UAV operator Yevgeny said: “We are carrying out aerial reconnaissance operations, finding targets. We then pass on the coordinates to our artillerymen. They in turn prepare the artillery fire.” Earlier today, the Russian MoD claimed that 265 Ukrainian fighters of the Azov Battalion surrendered at the Azovstal iron and steel plant in the under-siege city of Mariupol on Monday. In a statement, the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on 17th May: “The surrender of militants of the nationalist ‘Azov’ unit began yesterday at the ‘Azovstal’ plant in Mariupol. “Over the past day, 265 militants laid down their arms and surrendered, including 51 seriously wounded. All those in need of medical care were sent for treatment to a hospital in the city of Novoazovsk, Donetsk People's Republic.” However, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine claim the invasion is not going as well as the Kremlin may have hoped. From 24th February to 17th May, the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at around 27,900 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 1,235 tanks, 3,009 armoured fighting vehicles, 578 artillery systems, 198 multiple launch rocket systems, 90 anti-aircraft systems, 201 warplanes, 167 helicopters, 2,109 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, 13 vessels, 436 unmanned aerial vehicles, 43 units of special equipment and 97 cruise missiles. The Ukrainian military added that the Russian Armed Forces' greatest losses yesterday were sustained in the Lyman and Zaporizhzhia directions. Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has suggested that he may block Finland's and Sweden's applications to join NATO after he accused the Nordic nations of harbouring Kurdish militants who he regards as ""terrorists"". Today marks the 83rd day of the Russian ‘special military operation’. Days ago Ukraine showed off its devastating Brit-made Brimstone missiles in action. The weapon has been adapted to be fired from small vehicles on the Ukrainian battlefield rather than their usual launchpads - warplanes or as drones of naval ships. Video footage released by the Ukrainian defence ministry is said to show the Brimstone and also the NLAW new generation portable anti-tank weapon. A statement from Ukrainian forces said: “From the first days of the open invasion of Russia, the support of our foreign partners has played an important role in countering enemy forces. “Weapons, material and technical means that give us fellow countries are our strength on the way to victory. We are learning fast and learning new weapons. “And foreign instructors help us master them without delay. After all, we are fighting not only for the land. “We fight for our principles, history, senses, for the very existence of the Ukrainian people, their values and freedom. “And we are grateful that along this way, the titanic support is given to us by the partner states of the free world. “Together for the Victory.” The Brimstone came into service in 2005 with an updated version supplied to the RAF six years ago. It can strike using laser-seeking guidance or autonomous targeting.

But Russia has not seen the quick successes it may have expected faced with fierce resistance from its neighbour. Below Chris Hughes answers all the key questions on the invasion and why Russia has failed to secure victory so far. It was over-ambitious and launched using a badly funded, ill-disciplined and poorly trained military against a courageous, highly motivated defending force that has performed to great effect. Putin’s commanders led attacks on several fronts, from the east, where they have been fighting for years, north from Belarus and the south. In the east they are bogged down, up against well-trained, battle hardened, disciplined Ukrainian troops fighting an existential battle. The Russians seem not to be invested in the fight and suffer poor morale. Many Russians entered the battle unaware of where they were, their commanders arrogantly hoping they would take Kyiv within days. It takes roughly four to one in numbers to take a city and Putin’s plan to overrun Kyiv and other cities was based on shockingly poor intelligence of Ukrainian resolve and capability. They have been badly neglected over the years. Poorly trained, badly fed and sent into battle with insufficient supplies, which even included rations that were five years out of date. Some had so little fuel they broke down. Top down corruption in Russia has led to funding being diverted into the wrong hands, leading to a cynical and under-performing force. Discipline is a huge issue and senior officers have been sent to the frontline to try to control troops, before getting killed. The backbone of any army is its non-commissioned officers and Russia’s are badly trained. Many recruits are complete novice conscripts. Russian troops fled the outskirts of Kyiv weeks ago to concentrate on the mission in the east, where the two sides have been battling since 2014. They tried repeatedly to take the north-eastern city of Kharkiv and reports indicate they have lost this crucial area. Despite grandiose Russian claims of a huge victory in the key city of Mariupol, Ukraine ’s troops are still holding out in the steel works and their struggle is now a symbol of Ukrainian defiance and bravery. Russia is barely able to claim having taken any major cities in Ukraine and is failing to keep hold of ground it had once dominated. The Ukrainian counter seems to be gaining ground and momentum. In the short term it appears Russia will continue to take heavy losses while claiming the lives of Ukrainian civilians with brutal bombardments. Ukrainian troops are rallying but this next stage in their defence is crucial. Until now they have been constantly flanking Russian forces, ambushing them and cutting off supply lines. From 2014, Ukraine and pro-Russian forces fought running battles in an everchanging theatre of war but then settled into battlefronts with long-term positions. It is possible this will happen again. This is unlikely as Putin has backed himself into a corner and has to save face, even with a small victory in the Donbas region, which he may have to settle for. But Ukraine has shown no sign that it is ready to settle on such a victory for Putin. Western diplomats are returning to Kyiv, a further indication the war is settling and is likely to rumble on for a few years. It is thought it will be concentrated in Donbas with long-range Russian missile attacks on Western supply lines as Putin tries to halt the stream of support that Ukraine’s troops are getting. There are indictments in Kyiv against named Russian troops for crimes but major international court war crimes cases are unlikely for years. The weight of proof needed is enormous and not just a case of proving civilians were killed. There is an avalanche of anecdotal evidence against thousands of Russian troops but it has to be nailed down.",7,3.6230260541842636,3.540065041778661,0.08296101240560239,6

""The object is completely destroyed. According to preliminary information, there are no casualties. No one sought medical help."" The regional ""West"" Air Command of Ukraine's Air Force said in a social media post that several missiles were fired from the Black Sea at the Lviv region. Two of the missiles were destroyed before hitting targets, it said. Up until now the Russian invasion has concentrated in the east of Ukraine with occasional shelling of cities on the western side of the country. Many Ukrainians have fleed their towns and cities for Lviv for its relatively safer location. The latest attack on Lviv comes after Ukrainian fighters appeared to cede control of the besieged port of Mariupol after months of bombardment. Troops have been evacuated with Ukraine's deputy defence minister saying 53 injured troops from the Azovstal steelworks were taken to a hospital in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk, 20 miles to the east. Another 211 people were taken to the town of Olenivka, in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatists, Deputy Defence Minister Anna Malyar said. All of the evacuees will be subject to a potential prisoner exchange with Russia, she added. Reuters saw five buses carrying troops from Azovstal arrive in Novoazovsk late on Monday.

They have also repelled incursion by a Russian sabotage and reconnaissance group in the northeastern region of Sumy, in another major blow to Moscow. Defending troops are driving Russian forces back in a new counter-offensive as it emerged that Moscow has lost a third of its ground forces in just 82 days since the invasion started. Latest official Ukraine battle loss figures suggest Russia ’s death toll and destroyed military hardware is far worse than has been reported by western intelligence figures. Ukraine estimates revealed Russia has now lost 27, 400 soldiers, 1200 tanks, 200 warplanes, 164 helicopters, and 13 warships in a stunning blow to Vladimir Putin ’s faltering attack. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia’s new offensive in Donbas had stalled and Ukraine could win the war, adding “Russia’s war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned.” Kyiv’s commanders have now deployed many new U.S. M-777 howitzers to the front lines, and Washington has delivered all but one of the 90 artillery pieces it promised to send. The grinding down of Russia’s advance suggests the new Ukraine counter-offensive is having increasing success in pushing back Russian forces in the northeast and the Donbas assault is also ailing. Ukraine’s defence ministry said in a Facebook post that the 227th Battalion of the 127th Brigade of Ukraine’s Territorial Defence Forces had reached the border with Russia after driving them out of Kharkiv, adding: “Together to victory!” The ministry published a video on Facebook purportedly showing Ukrainian troops by a border post in the colours of the Ukrainian flag. Kharkiv region governor Oleh Sinegubov wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the troops had restored the post on the border, adding: “We thank everyone who, risking their lives, liberates Ukraine from Russian invaders.” Ukraine has scored a series of successes since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, forcing Russia’s commanders to abandon an advance on the capital Kyiv before making rapid gains around Kharkiv. On the Sumy failure a Russian reconnaissance group entered Ukrainian territory under the cover of mortar shells, grenades and machine gun fire. But they were forced to retreat after Ukraine’s border guards fought back. But in Mariupol Russian ground troops were believed to be blocking exit routes out of the besieged Azovstal steel works complex where hundreds of Ukrainian troops, many of them wounded, are holed up. Ukraine also believes Russia is preparing another false narrative that Mariupol was destroyed by the defending troops. Petro Andryushchenko, who is adviser to Mariupol’s Mayor, said residents were being invited to apply for compensation. He said first they must claim their property “was destroyed by the Ukrainian military” and that their relatives were “killed by the Ukrainian Army.” And people across the world in more than 100 cities have recorded video appeals to support the Mariupol defenders. Within two days of the global appeal #World4Mariupol, thousands of Ukrainians and others globally have expressed their gratitude and support to the Ukrainian heroes.

On the initiative’s website you can watch all the appeals and a video in support of the defenders: #World4Mariupol | Save Mariupol News of Ukraine's successes comes as McDonald's has said it will permanently leave Russia after 30 years and has started to sell off its restaurants there. The move comes after it temporarily closed its 850 outlets in March following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The fast-food giant said it made the decision because of the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the ongoing war. The chain opened in Moscow in 1990 as the Soviet Union was opening its economy to Western brands, and its departure carries similar symbolic weight. The move places pressure on other western brands to consider their future in Putin's Russia. Once the sale of the company is finalised - possibly to a local buyer - the Russian restaurants will be ""de-Arched,"" meaning they will no longer be allowed to use the McDonald's name, logo or menu. The company yesterday (MON) said its 62,000 staff will still be paid until the transaction closes and that ""employees have future employment with any potential buyer.” CEO Chris Kempczinski said: “We have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values.

The weapon has been adapted to be fired from small vehicles on the Ukrainian battlefield rather than used as normal from warplanes, drones of naval ships. Video footage released by the Ukrainian defence ministry is said to shown the Brimstone and also the NLAW new generation portable anti-tank weapon. A statement from forces said: “From the first days of the open invasion of Russia, the support of our foreign partners has played an important role in countering enemy forces. “Weapons, material and technical means that give us fellow countries are our strength on the way to victory. “We are learning fast and learning new weapons. “And foreign instructors help us master them without delay. “After all, we are fighting not only for the land. “We fight for our principles, history, senses, for the very existence of the Ukrainian people, their values and freedom. “And we are grateful that along this way, the titanic support is given to us by the partner states of the free world. “Together for the Victory.” The Brimstone came into service in 2005 with an updated version supplied to the RAF six years ago. It can strike using laser-seeking guidance or autonomous targeting. In another video, said to have been released by Ukrainian forces, it claims to show the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol hit with incendiary of phosphorus bombs by Vladimir Putin’s forces. Ukranian forces are believed to be sheltering there from Russian bombardment. “The Russian military themselves claim that 9M22S incendiary shells with thermite layers were used,” said the Ukrainians. “The combustion temperature is about 2-2.5 thousand degrees Celsius. “It is almost impossible to stop the burning,"" said Petr Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol. The Mirror told yesterday how Russia made new threats to use its Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile which it claims strike Britain in just 200 seconds. Finland, which is poised to join NATO, would be totally wiped out in as little as 10 seconds, Aleksey Zhuravlyov deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defence committee claimed.. His wild threats came as senior Russian officials appear frustrated at Vladimir Putin ’s lack of military progress in Ukraine, and enraged at the show of Western unity against them. Zhuravlyov, 59, claimed in an interview: “If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate - to question the existence of this state. This is logical. ""If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA.

Since Russia's invasion on February 24, Ukraine's military has forced Russia's commanders to abandon an advance on the capital Kyiv. This was before they made rapid gains in the northeast and drove them away from the second biggest city of Kharkiv. A Ukrainian counteroffensive has been underway near the Russian-held town of Izium, though Ukraine's military reported on Sunday that Russian forces were advancing elsewhere in the Donbas region, the main theatre of war over the past month. ""Despite small-scale initial advances, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains over the past month whilst sustaining consistently high levels of attrition,"" the British defence ministry said on Twitter. ""Russia has now likely suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed in February."" It said it was unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days. The Ministry of Defence concluded: “Russian forces are increasingly constrained by degraded enabling capabilities, continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness. “Many of these capabilities cannot be quickly replaced or reconstituted, and are likely to continue to hinder Russian operations in Ukraine. “Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days.” In his usual nightly address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sung the praises of those defending the Donbas. Russian forces were withdrawing from the city of Kharkiv, he said, the second-largest in Ukraine. Troops had now begun to reclaim areas, Mr Zelensky added, and had moved back into six towns over the past day. Ukraine's military has notched a string of successes, since Russia's invasion, first forcing Russia's commanders to abandon an advance on the capital Kyiv, and then making rapid gains in the northeast in recent weeks. Since mid-April, Russian forces have focussed much of their firepower on the east for what has become known as the ""Battle of the Donbas"". Keeping up pressure on Izium and Russian supply lines will make it harder for Moscow to encircle battle-hardened Ukrainian troops on the eastern front in the Donbas. Meanwhile, Russia 's deputy foreign minister has warned the country will take precautionary measures if NATO deploys nuclear forces closer to its borders. Alexander Grushko added that Moscow has no hostile intentions towards Finland and Sweden who have moved to join the western alliance. But he said he doesn't see ""real"" reasons for the two countries to make such a decision. ""It will be necessary to respond ... by taking adequate precautionary measures that would ensure the viability of deterrence,"" Interfax agency quoted Grushko as saying. Kremlin forces invaded Ukraine in February because the Russian President wanted to push the Western military alliance back from his country’s borders. He has demanded the former-Soviet allies never be allowed to become a member of the alliance. But the war has instead led to its neighbour Finland, with which it shares an 810-mile border, saying it wants the protection of the 30-member, nuclear-armed coalition. In a joint statement, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said: ""Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. “We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days."" A formal application is expected within days and NATO leaders are expected to discuss the bid at their summit in Madrid next month.",7,4.164225542291643,3.555323017028314,0.6089025252633289,6

Sir Antony Beevor says the Russian President believes NATO's 'advance' on his own country's borders is the equivalent to the Nazis moving through Europe 80 years ago. And the push for Finland and Sweden to join the alliance in recent days amid the despot's catastrophic invasion of Ukraine will have done little to ease his misplaced suspicions. Sir Antony, who has published several books on the Second World War, said Putin genuinely thinks the Red Army fought off Adolf Hitler's Wehrmacht ""single-handed"" while the western allies wanted to ""stab the Soviet Union in the back"". Moscow's current invasion, which it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists, has jolted European security. Kyiv and its Western allies say the fascism assertion is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression. Writing in the Daily Mail, Sir Antony said: ""Ultimately, he has trapped himself in a past that he fails to understand. ""He refuses to acknowledge that it is his own aggressive actions which have achieved that. ""So, combined with his bitter resentment that the West never showed proper 'respect' – that gangster euphemism for 'fear' – Putin wants to terrify us."" Sir Antony, whose latest book Russia : Revolution And Civil War 1917-1921 is released later this month, went on to say Putin's ""own disastrous mistakes have backed him into a corner"". He believes the former KGB intelligence officer is prepared to use nuclear weapons if ""his own regime"" is defeated in Ukraine. He added: ""This has created far greater dangers for the world than at any moment since 1945."" The southeastern region of Donbas has become the main theatre of war over the past month. Ukraine's counteroffensive there is underway near the Russian-held town of Izium, but its military has reported that Moscow forces are advancing elsewhere. Having resisted fiercely since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, Ukraine's military has notched a string of successes, first forcing Russia's commanders to abandon an advance on the capital Kyiv, and then making rapid gains in the northeast in recent week to drive the enemy away from the second biggest city of Kharkiv. Since mid-April, Russian forces have focussed much of their firepower on the east for what has become known as the ""Battle of the Donbas"". British military intelligence delivered a damning assessment on Sunday of Russia's campaign in the region. It reckoned that Russia had lost about a third of the ground combat force deployed in February, and its offensive in the Donbas had fallen ""significantly behind schedule"" and was unlikely to make rapid advances during the coming 30 days. Keeping up pressure on Izium and Russian supply lines will make it harder for Moscow to encircle battle-hardened Ukrainian troops on the eastern front in the Donbas. One of the aims of Russia's action in Ukraine was to prevent the former Soviet republic ever joining NATO. But in a telephone call, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto told Russian President Vladimir Putin that his country, which shares a 1,300-km (800-mile) border with Russia, wanted to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to bolster its own security. Putin told Niinisto it would be a mistake for Helsinki to abandon its neutrality, the Kremlin said, adding that the move could harm bilateral relations.",7,3.292058072394033,3.6753023287846442,-0.3832442563906113,12

The hellish scenes have reportedly been uncovered in four sites in the town of Borodyanka which compare to some of the worst atrocities carried out in Bucha, that shocked the world. Borodyanka, which had a population of 25,000 people, began to be pummelled from Russian shelling when the Russian invasion began on February 24. As the Russian forces bore down on Kyiv it tried to bomb towns on the outskirts like Borodyanka and Bucha into submission. There is now evidence that at the same time it unleashed unthinkable horrors on the population with civilians tortured and murdered. Police chief Vyacheslav Tsilyurik told how the town centre was shelled which included the smashing of a statue of Ukraine poet Taras Shevchenko, reported The Sun. The Ukrainians fought back, said Mr Tsilyurik: “We knew we had to fight back and so ambushed a column of them in the middle of town. We killed eight of them but they took their revenge the next day.” Large apartment blocks were reduced to rubble with countless people buried in the ruins, while those who ventured out were indiscriminately shot in the street, he said. The police chief said that people were tortured and women were raped in the barbarity which has seen 150 people die and 50 more are missing. The death toll in nearby Bucha now stands at 412 people. Borodyanka mayor Georgi Yerko, 60, arranged for evacuations with his daughter Galyna, 36, saying the scenes were even worse than that in Bucha. She said: “It’s even worse than Bucha. It was more concentrated evil in a smaller town. The Russians knew my father’s email addresses and constantly emailed and texted death threats but we avoided them until liberation came. My father led us. He is a modest man but he is a hero.” Police officer Ivan Symarov lost all his family in the bombings. His wife Lena, 26, father Vasile, 54, mother Natalia, 47, brother Petro, 21, and grandmother Nina, 82, all died immediately and his two-year-old daughter Polina later passed away in hospital. “Putin’s animals had dropped a bomb on my home for no reason and I pulled at the rubble knowing I’d lost everything I loved,"" he said. “I am alone in the world now thanks to Putin and the barbarians he sent to kill us. I’ve no idea if they targeted my home because I’m a policeman but it had no military value. It was cold-blooded murder."" Ukraine has claimed that more than 10,000 possible war crimes have taken place and the country's prosecutor general has now said that her office was readying 41 cases against Russian soldiers. ""We have 41 suspects in cases with which we will be ready to go to court. All of them concern Article 438 of the (Ukrainian) criminal code on war crimes, but different types of war crimes. There is the bombing of civilian infrastructure, the killing of civilians, rape and looting,"" Iryna Venediktova said in a live briefing on Ukrainian TV on Friday evening. Friday marked the first war crime prosecution of a member of the Russian military in Kyiv, as a 21-year-old Russian soldier went on trial for the killing of an unarmed Ukrainian civilian in the early days of the war. Ms Venediktova said that two more of the suspects, who are physically in Ukraine, are likely to face preliminary hearings next week. Ukraine has accused Russia of forcibly deporting more than 210,000 children since its invasion, saying they were among 1.2 million Ukrainians transferred against their will.

Samuel Cranny-Evans, a research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, said both sides are making advances but are also suffering heavy losses. He said there's ""nothing to immediately say that is about to shift or change"", adding: ""It's approaching a stalemate."" ""It's approaching a point where neither side can push much more, I would say."" He went on to say the conflict is ""approaching a peak point where perhaps they no longer really have fresh things to give that might change the way the fighting is going"". Speaking to Sky News on Saturday morning, he was asked about claims made by Kyiv's Defence Intelligence Chief, Major-General Kyrylo Budanov, that an end is near and he is ""optimistic"". The top spy also claimed there was evidence Russian President Vladimir Putin is very sick and there could soon be a coup against him. Mr Cranny-Evans said ""it's difficult to say"" how accurate such claims are. ""I suppose he would know more about the military situation in Ukraine and so if he feels that the war is perhaps drawing to a close in a couple of months that maybe an honest assessment based on the intelligence that they've gathered,"" he explained. ""What I would say is he didn't really say how the war would end. ""He said he was optimistic about Ukraine's prospects but it might be that the war ends with Russia in possession of Luhansk and Donetsk."" Russia initially sent in troops to the two breakaway states in Ukraine's Donbas border region in February before a full-scale invasion was launched. Luhansk and Donetsk have seen fierce fighting since 2014 when they were first declared People's Republics. Armed Russian-backed separatist groups seized government buildings throughout the Donbas three months ago leading to the current ongoing armed conflict across Ukraine. Speaking of Maj Gen Budanov's claims about Putin's health and a possible coup, Mr Cranny-Evans said: ""That could depend on a number of things...there is, obviously, a lot to be gained from undermining Putin as a leader right now."" He was then asked if the Russian President will likely be happy to now focus on consolidating gains made in the east, including Donbas, and skip over the failures elsewhere, including attempts to take the capital. Mr Cranny-Evans said: ""I think at present, the most we can really say is that Russia is not winning and Ukraine is not losing. ""They are definitely at war. They are fighting a very vicious and bloody war. ""Both sides are likely suffering heavy losses on a daily basis and we can see that the Ukrainians are advancing in some places and Russians are advancing in some places. He continued: ""And there's nothing to immediately say or indicate that is about to shift or change. ""It's approaching a stalemate. It's approaching a point where neither side can push much more, I would say."" Asked if it will now be difficult to make further gains due to entrenched positions, he said: ""The Russians are putting on an exhausted force. ""Without some kind of reach further into their reserves and reserve materiel - a declaration of war - it becomes difficult for them to keep feeding personnel into the conflict."" However, he said the Ukrainian forces are ""facing a similar situation"". ""We've seen reports of the territorial defence force being pushed into the frontlines and some of them are okay with that and some of them are not okay with that. ""Because they are actually supposed to just protect a certain area, a certain region of Ukraine. ""And if they're not from Donbas areas they are not supposed to be there. ""So there are signs of...not desperation but signs of the impact of this conflict to both militaries. ""They are far from unscathed at the moment and I would say that that is approaching a peak point where perhaps they no longer really have fresh things to give that might change the way the fighting is going."" He said he was a ""little"" surprised that Putin didn't use his Victory Day speech last Monday to make a declaration of war or some kind of mobilisation which could open up more forces. He said he had seen evidence that he might and said authorities in Belgrade ""have been instructed to prepare"" for such a move. ""We did actually have evidence leading up to it that something of that ilk was going to happen. I'm a little surprised,"" he added. Mr Cranny-Evans was asked if a partial mobilisation would be enough to shift the balance, as bringing in more new conscripts may result in a lag as they got up to speed. The expert said: ""It depends a lot on what the Russians are lacking because their force is really artillery focused and artillery seems to be of higher quality than the infantry and the armour. ""If they need infantry to just push forward and protect the armour's flanks and things like that then throwing conscripts in is not the best for the conscripts...but they might get the job done so it really depends on the level of specialisation that the Russian's are lacking and what they need.""",7,3.882555478755197,3.466214216608906,0.41634126214629097,17

The Ukrainian court held a preliminary hearing on Friday after charging a 21-year-old soldier with the murder of a 62-year-old civilian. During the short hearing, the defendant said his name was Vadim Shishimarin and confirmed that he was a Russian serviceman. Shishimarin was accused of ""violations of the laws and norms of war"". The defendant did not enter a plea at today's hearing and will do so at a later date, his lawyer Viktor Ovsyannikov said. Shishimarin wore a casual blue and grey hoodie and was led into the courtroom by police to a glass booth for defendants. The Ukrainian prosecutor told the court the defendant was a tank commander in the Kantemirovskaya tank division from the Moscow region. If convicted he faces up to life imprisonment over the killing in a village in the east of Kyiv on February 28. Shishimarin is alleged to have stolen a privately-owned car to escape with four other Russian servicemen after their column was targeted by Ukrainian forces. The Russian soldiers then drove into a village where they saw an unarmed man riding a bicycle and talking on his phone, the court heard. Shishimarin was allegedly told to kill the civilian to prevent him from reporting on the Russians' presence and is accused of firing several shots through the open window of the car with an assault rifle at the civilian's head, and he died on the spot. The SBU Security Service of Ukraine conducted the investigation into the case, it said. State prosecutor Andriy Synyuk told reporters after the hearing: ""This is the first case today. But soon there will be a lot of these cases."" It comes as the Ukrainian government has accused the Russian military of carrying out horrific crimes against its citizens including rape and murder. It says it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes and the Kremlin told reporters on Friday that it had no information about a war crimes trial. Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said yesterday there were many examples of possible war crimes since the Russian invasion and that 1,000 bodies had been recovered so far in the Kyiv region. Last month, the International Criminal Court (ICC) said on April 25 that it would take part in a joint team with Ukrainian, Polish and Lithuanian prosecutors investigating war crimes allegations against Russian forces. The court will reconvene on May 18, the judge said.",45,7.374835428200246,7.055051564043705,0.31978386415654114,14

New satellite images have shown a tomb of Russian armoured vehicles lying destroyed near the River Donets in Ukraine and it's believed all the tanks were obliterated in the same battle. According to reports the doomed unit made up of around 52 tanks was trying to cross the river to fortify Russia's position near Bilohorivka, west of Lysychansk. Russian forces have redeployed to the south and east of Ukraine in a desperate attempt to turn the tide of the war following set back after set back. The photos also show a destroyed pontoon bridge that it's thought was targeted by Ukrainian defenders as a means to trap the armoured convoy in a crossfire. The staunch resistance was praised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who has proclaimed that Putin's forces are being ""pushed away"". He tweeted: ""The occupiers are gradually being pushed away ""I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders."" According to a Twitter user, Maxim, who claims to be a Ukrainian military engineer, the exact spot Russia was most likely to cross on May 7 was identified and troops ordered to be on the look-out for sounds of tugboat engines pushing a pontoon bridge. On May 8, Russian troops tried to cover their advance by burning nearby fields and letting off smoke grenades, the military engineer said. Drones were used to spot the battalion before a devastating artillery strike ordered in. ""Roughly 20 minutes after recon unit confirmed the Russian bridge was being mounted, heavy artillery engaged against Russian forces, and then aviation chipped in as well,"" Maxim said. ""I was still in the area, and I have never seen or heard such heavy combat in my life. ""After one day of combat, 9th May morning the bridge was down. ""Some Russian forces - roughly 30 to 50 vehicles and infantry - were stuck on the Ukrainian side of the river with no way back. ""They tried to run away using the broken bridge. Then they tried to arrange a new bridge. ""Aviation started heavy bombing of the area and it destroyed all the remains of Russians there, and the other bridge they tried to make. ""Rumors say it's 1,500 Russian dead. Their strategic objective was to cross the river and then encircle Lysychansk. They miserably failed."" According to Forbes, the attack destroyed more than 50 vehicles and up to 1000 Russian soldiers.

Vladimir Putin's barbaric invasion started almost three months ago. A miscalculated plan saw the Kremlin chief expect to take capital city Kyiv within 48 hours of sending his troops in on February 24. But over 11 weeks later, with that objective abandoned, the invaders are haemorrhaging soldiers, weapons and equipment. And now they're losing much of the geographical gains made in the early weeks. Nathan Ruser, a researcher for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), an independent think tank, shared maps showing the situation as of Tuesday (May 10). On his Twitter account, he posted multiple maps showing the receding line of Moscow's territorial control. Ukraine expert Michael MacKay said: ""The Russians are retreating north of Kharkiv, shifted to the defensive around Izyum, and suffered a resounding defeat attempting to cross the Siverskyi Donetsk River at Bilohorivka. ""The Ukrainians have gone on the offensive in Kharkiv region west of the Siverskyi Donets River."" Putin's battle plan pivoted away from Kyiv last month and began focusing on the eastern and southern regions - but his men have struggled to gain any foothold. John Spencer, a retired US Army major, told Salon the Russian military was considered second or third in the world before the war. But its performance during what the Kremlin still insists is a 'special military operation' has shown it to be actually around 30th, he said. ""On paper, the Russian military should have been able to dominate the Ukrainian military and win in three days, based just on the size of the Ukraine military,"" he explained. However, he said there's been a failure to properly predict the ""fierce resistance"" from within Ukraine, as well as the impact of weapons, supplies and support from the likes of NATO - not to mention superior intelligence information. Mr Spencer added: ""The Russian plan of attack in the beginning was not ridiculous. It was actually a solid plan, but they didn't have the military strength they thought they had to follow through on it. ""This conflict, in a larger sense, won't end for years. Russia will always contest the borders of Ukraine as a sovereign nation. But this war, the battle for Ukraine, will end within weeks or months. That is my opinion. ""We will see the Russian military in Ukraine reach its culmination point soon,"" he added. Meanwhile, intelligence also suggests propaganda within Russia has changed to reflect things not going to plan, reports Yahoo News.

Lt Col Albert Karimov, 39, was a highly-decorated special forces officer in the GRU military intelligence. His funeral is being held today in the village of Tirlyansky in his native Bashkortostan region. Russia has not disclosed the circumstances of his death during Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine which has seen tens of thousands of his forces killed. Nine Russian generals are also known to have died with reports that the US has assisted Ukraine with intelligence to allow them to target Putin’s top brass. Karimov is the 41st known colonel to have died in the war which has devastated Russia’s senior ranks. This is a rate of around one colonel every two days. The GRU is seen as Russia's most secretive and - until recently - most effective intelligence service. Britain says a GRU hit squad was behind the poisoning with Novichok of its ex agent Sergei Skripal - who had defected to Britain - and his daughter Yulia in 2018. Major-General Andrei Simonov, 56, became the ninth Russian general killed in Ukraine when he died in battle in Izyum near Kharkov. He was Russia's most respected electronics warfare commander, serving with the 2nd Combined Arms Army, and died in a devastating fightback by the Ukrainians against a Russian offensive. More than 30 Russian armoured vehicles were destroyed in the attack along with around 100 Russians troops, unconfirmed reports suggest. Losing senior military members can be a sign that an army is suffering from ill discipline as generals and colonels are required to take control of their forces on the front lines. Putin has now sent his chief of defence staff General Valery Gerasimov to take personal command of the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Simonov is far from the only high profile military man to lose their life in the course of the invasion. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, one of Putin’s most senior commanders and in charge of the 8th All-Military Army of the Kremlin’s vast Southern Military District, was killed at the beginning of March. While the exact number of people killed during the war is difficult to determine, it is clear that Russia has endured far greater losses than it initially expected. Last week UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace said that 15,000 Russian troops had died so far. The rate of fatalities among the invading army's number is now decreasing as the scope of the offensive is narrowed, a Western official told Reuters. Having failed in an assault on Kyiv in the north of Ukraine last month, Russia is now trying to fully capture two eastern provinces known as the Donbas.

""But the level of casualties that we're seeing in terms of those areas where they are engaging Ukrainian forces are still remaining quite high.""",7,4.659820769105129,5.3857185908592555,-0.7258978217541268,22

The brief clip, shared on its defence channels, shows the fearsome T-90M moments before it explodes in a fireball in the east of the nation. Pieces of debris are sent flying as a result of the rocket strike by Ukrainian soldiers. It was reportedly filmed during the fighting for Stary Saltiv, north of Kharkiv. The T-90M tank is believed to be Vladimir Putin’s most advanced weapon and was brought into his army two years ago. His arsenal is believed to include around 100 of the tanks. Along with the video, the tweet read: “Near Stary Saltiv, Kharkiv Territorial Defence fighters eliminated another new T-90M ""Breakthrough"" tank. “The pride of the Russian tank industry was destroyed by the Swedish hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher Carl Gustaf. “We thank the Swedish people and the King for their help.” Last month it was reported Sweden has so far provided the under siege nation with around 10,000 anti-tank weapons, as well as other weaponry including body shields, helmets and rations. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said: “Europe, and even Sweden, now finds itself in an exceptional situation, which means that exceptional decisions must be taken. “It is not Swedish practice to send military equipment to conflict zones. “The last time Sweden did so to any great extent was when the Soviet Union attacked Finland in 1939. “While we focus on the acute humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, we also need to manage the long-term economic impact of the war. “The rest of the world must support early recovery and, in the long-term, reconstruction.” T-90s have advanced armour protection as well as built-in explosives and smoke grenade launchers. Despite its weaponry, last month an expert claimed they have serious design flaws which have been targeted by Ukraine’s forces. Sam Bendett, an adviser with the Russian Studies Program at the Center for a New American Security, told CNN : ""What we are witnessing with Russian tanks is a design flaw. “Any successful hit...quickly ignites the ammo causing a massive explosion, and the turret is literally blown off."" In the Gulf Wars of 1991 and 2003, the flaw came to the attention of the West, when Iraq's Russian-made T-72 tanks were exposed. The design has its perks - for example, allowing for extra space inside, and giving tanks a lower profile, ensuring they're harder to hit. Subsequent models including the T-90 and T-80 had the same vulnerability due to the missile loading system. But Western militaries have learned from the flaw and their tanks now have compartmentalised ammunition.",49,3.5834879402452593,4.179725113383793,-0.5962371731385341,27

On a visit to the Vatican, Kateryna Prokopenko, 27, and Yuliya Fedosiuk, 29, asked Pope Francis to demand clemency for their husbands from Vladimir Putin. Mrs Propopenko told the Pope: “You are our last hope, I hope you can save their lives. Please don’t let them die.” Officials described the underground bolthole as a disease-ridden “medieval ghetto” containing rotting flesh and unburied bodies. The women said soldiers at the Azovstal plant lack food, water and medicine. Mrs Prokopenko said Russian captivity “is not an option” for the soldiers as they face almost certain execution. The Pope said he would do everything possible for Lt Col Denis Prokopenko and Sgt Arseniy Fedosiuk, and pray for them. Mariupol mayoral aide Petro Andryushchenko today claimed that “at least 100 civilians” remain in the “hell on earth” Azovstal shelters, which were still under attack. It was previously claimed that all civilians had been evacuated. Human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova urged the UN and Red Cross to help evacuate wounded fighters, with amputations taking place on even minor injuries to prevent infections. War crime investigations against Russians are gathering pace, with an indictment accusing army commander Vaidm Shishimarin, 21, of murdering an unarmed cyclist in the Sumy region. A captured Russian conscript, Alexander Martynenko, 18, accused Putin of forcing “children” to the front line. Wounded Martynenko, who was sent 6,000 miles to fight, said in a video: “It is not only contract officers who fight here, but also children like myself, conscripts.” Putin promised in March: “Conscripts will not be engaged in military actions.”",47,5.338852924604669,4.403452145219479,0.9354007793851906,9

The sweeping move has seen the Kremlin boss oust five regional heads. Some suggested the drastic move could be an effort to open up positions to oust out-of-favour officials from Moscow. It comes after a number of reports Putin was increasingly angry at some of the military and security personnel for failures during the ongoing invasion. Speculation suggests he is ready to fire those he feels has let him down on the ongoing invasion. The worst offenders in Putin’s eyes are reportedly already under arrest. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The shock of the simultaneous resignations of five governors was reportedly indicative of pressure put on them by the Kremlin to go. Valery Radayev, 61, quit as governor of Saratov region to ""focus on another area of work”. Tomsk region governor Sergey Zhvachkin, 65, said it was time “to give way to youth”. Ryazan region governor 50-year-old Nikolay Lyubimov announced he would not seek another term in September. Igor Vasilyev, 60, Kirov region governor, also quit, as did Alexander Yevstifeyev, 64, head of the Mari El Republic. In the past, Putin has parachuted ex-bodyguards or other favourites into such governships This all comes as Putin’s invasion of Ukraine comes into its third month, after beginning on February 24. In the 75 days since Russia ’s “special operation” began tens of thousands have died and nearly ten million people have been displaced. Whilst official death tolls are hard to come by for both sides, it is widely believed that Russia has suffered considerably worse losses than Ukraine has. Over the weekend, Ukraine’s official death toll stood at 3,381 however, Matilda Bogner, head of the human rights monitoring mission for the United Nations in Ukraine said the actual toll may be “thousands” higher. This was largely because of cities like Mariupol, which has seen some of the worst Russian air raids and bombings, is like a “black hole” for gathering information. In Russia, Moscow quickly stopped releasing its own official death count early on in the war. Since then, the Kremlin has remained silent on the losses it has suffered during the war but Ukraine recently said that it has lost 25,000 troops, and other estimates come in around 20,000 dead as well. Alongside that, reports suggest that Vladimir Putin has grown frustrated with some of the military and security personnel close to him. This includes parts of the infamous security service, the FSB, who reportedly provided faulty intelligence in the early periods of the war. In the last few days, Putin used his speech at his country’s Victory Day parade to brazenly claim that the West was preparing to invade Russia. He claimed his invasion was a “preventative” strike and hypocritically went on to claim the “horror” of World War Two should never be repeated as his troops massacred innocent civilians.",7,3.962724306479352,3.329866029056204,0.6328582774231477,5

Moscow’s deputy foreign minister said yesterday that a pre-emptive nuclear strike would be justified under Russia ’s military doctrine. Alexandre Grushko was quoted by state news agency RIA as saying that under Russia’s official military doctrine the country was justified in using its nukes. He said: ""We have a military doctrine - everything is written there."" Under Russia’s official military deployment principles the country states it can use nuclear weapons if they, or other weapons of mass destruction, are used against the country. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It adds that if the Russian state faces any other type of existential threat then it can use its nukes. The decision rests with the country’s president Vladimir Putin, who since the invasion began has been seen carrying the country’s nuclear briefcase on one occasion. There have been concerns that Russia would resort to using its nuclear arsenal as its invasion of Ukraine continues. A decree signed by Putin in 2020 explained Russia’s belief when it would be able to use its nuclear weapons as “exclusively a means of deterrence”. It goes on to lay out four circumstances under which a nuclear strike could be ordered. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. This included reliable information of a ballistic missile attack on Russia and an attack on “critical state or military installations”. US CIA Director William Burns said last Saturday that Putin believes he cannot afford to lose the war in Ukraine. He cautioned that the West could not ignore the risk that Russia and its president would use nuclear weapons. Burns said: ""We don't see, as an intelligence community, practical evidence at this point of Russian planning for a deployment or even use of tactical nuclear weapons,"" Burns said. He cautioned that ""the stakes are very high for Putin's Russia."" This comes as Russia’s invasion into Ukraine continues well into its third month after it began on February 24. During the initial phase of the invasion, Moscow’s forces pushed towards the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. However, after weeks of failing to take the capital or any of the other major cities, Russia’s forces pulled back and regrouped in the east of the country, in the Donbas. So far, tens of thousands have died as a result of the war and nearly ten million people have been displaced. There are also fears the conflict might spill beyond the border into a wider conflict between Russia and the west.",47,4.222721380071451,5.155257222624697,-0.9325358425532464,8

Sladkov's negative comments are rare as it aligns with a US official's statement that Putin's military has made much progress in the Donbas as they continue to face fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. A senior US official has also claimed that some Russian officers are disobeying military orders. Sladkov's video was filmed in Donestk, in eastern Ukraine and started with him saying the ""scumbags from the Ukrainian armed forces"" were behind the shelling in the area that killed a woman and teenage boy. He said: ""You know why [these attacks] are happening? ""We can't push out Ukrainian forces from the city. We can't push them out. Because... I don't know.

Yuri Borisov was quoted by the Interfax news agency on Monday as saying the weapons were being developed to compete with the United States' own stockpiles. “Work is underway to create a new generation of ground, air and sea-based hypersonic missiles. In terms of their characteristics, they will surpass the existing and prospective developments of the leading states,” he said. He added that Russia plans to equip modern aviation systems with new missiles, saying: “Tests are already underway on Tu-22M3M missile carriers."" The development of a new generation of hypersonic weapons by Russia was announced by its defence minister Sergei Shoigu in August 2021. “In the future, we have an increase in the range of hypersonic weapons,"" he said.

It comes as Vladimir Putin ’s regime was accused of “mirroring” the actions of the Nazis. The British defence secretary Ben Wallace will use a major speech to say that Putin and his inner circle should share the same fate as the Nazis, who ended up defeated and facing the Nuremberg trials for their atrocities. In Moscow, Mr Putin will watch the Victory Day parade of military hardware, marking the defeat of the Nazis in 1945. But according to extracts briefed to the Telegraph and Times, Mr Wallace will say: “Through their invasion of Ukraine, Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 70 years ago, repeating the errors of last century’s totalitarian regimes.” He will add: “Their fate must also, surely, eventually be the same.” Russia ’s sacrifices in the past should not be forgotten, “but nor must the lessons about what lies in store for the perpetrators of such unprovoked brutality”. In a message to Mr Putin, he will say: “In going to such extremes to justify this war of choice he and his generals are now ripping up both Russia’s past and its future. “Their unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine, attacks against innocent citizens and their homes, and the widespread atrocities – including deliberately against women and children – corrupts the memory of past sacrifices and Russia’s once-proud global reputation.”",49,4.019886411594318,4.455630095707976,-0.4357436841136577,12

Bato Basanov was in a record-breaking tank biathlon team that performed last year in war games in front of defence minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of the army general staff Valery Gerasimov. But his luck ran out on the battlefield when his tank was hit in Ukraine, killing him. The 25-year-old is the latest of dozens of men from the impoverished region of Buryatia some 3,500 miles east of Moscow to be killed in Putin’s war. As two bereft mothers in grief-stricken Buryatia spoke about collecting the bodies of their sons, one reportedly said to the other: ""You’re lucky because your son’s body arrived intact. Mine came back as a head and two hands."" Basanov, a corporal, had been hailed last year for ""glorifying Russia by becoming a world champion in tank biathlon as part of his team"". He shot without missing a single target at speeds of up to 50mph at the Alabino training ground in Moscow region. Yet as a report from Volya Media said: ""The death of Bato Basanov is grim confirmation that tank biathlon and real war are completely different things."" Russian commanders Shoigu and Gerasimov saw regular tank biathlon competitions as key military prestige events, yet the huge death toll of Russian forces shows they were not ready for real war. Basanov — whose Russian T-72B3 team beat soldiers from 19 countries in combat games including China — was shown being presented to Gerasimov, now in charge of Putin's crumbling war effort. Yet an anonymous Russian military expert has blamed Putin’s government for botched modernisation of tanks, leaving them worse in optics and targeting technology than Ukraine’s older tanks which were upgraded with Western equipment. ""Combat training in [Russian] tank units is disgusting,"" he added. The ""shortcomings"" have led to Russia’s dismal performance in the war, he said. Basanov was a gunner of the first company of the tank battalion of the 37th separate guards motorised rifle brigade of the Russian Air Defence Forces. The body of the ‘hero’ took seven weeks to be retrieved and returned to his family for a funeral on Friday.

Her escape comes as Ukraine continues its bid to push back the Russian invaders in the eastern Donetsk region where shattered Mariupol lies under siege.

Their very presence is raining on Vladimir Putin ’s “victory parade”. Ukrainian officials said Moscow was planning one in the scorched city to coincide with tomorrow’s annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, marking the Soviet Union’s part in the defeat of Hitler in 1945. And Ukraine is expecting the Russians to celebrate with an increase in attacks. Reports say surviving Mariupol civilians are being forced to clear the bodies of dead neighbours before the “military show” to get food, water and medicine. Ukraine’s first deputy interior minister Yevhen Yenin said Russia was “preparing to dance over bones in Mariupol” to back the Kremlin state media lie that “peaceful life is being established”. The ruins of the city’s bombed theatre, where 600 people died, were also being cleaned up in preparation for the parade. Officials also believe Russia plans to disguise 2,000 civilians in Ukrainian army kit to parade “prisoners of war” on TV. Mariupol mayoral advisor Petro Andryushchenko said: “These men are told that they will be dressed in Ukrainian uniforms and involved in the so-called parade of prisoners in Mariupol because there are not enough real prisoners.” Meanwhile Russia faced fresh claims of war crimes yesterday amid reports 500 civilians were being held in torture chambers in Kherson in the occupied south.

As much as they respect the former KGB man [Putin] for being a strong leader, the Russian general staff are going to be made scapegoats for his mess. “He [Putin] would be foolish, potentially, to blame Gerasimov and the other generals for what is predominantly a politically, emotive-driven invasion defying all logic. It’s a political decision he took, not a military one, and he needs to wear that decision.” Wallace added that Putin had no one close to him who has told him to abandon their plans to seize Ukraine. He added that the war could “very quickly turn from a quagmire to a rout” if the Russian forces collapsed like they in the north of Ukraine around Kyiv. However, with Russia ’s ‘Victory Day’ only days away on May 9, the defence secretary previously warned that Putin might use it as an opportunity to cal up more troops or declare all-out-war.",7,3.2462709623383916,4.179449285140592,-0.9331783228022004,17

Amnesty International said innocent civilians also suffered from “reckless shootings and torture” from rampaging Russian troops during attacks throughout February and March. Donatella Rovera, Amnesty’s senior crisis response officer, said: ""These are not isolated incidents. These are very much part of a pattern wherever Russian forces were in control of a town or a village.” She was speaking at a news conference in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv as Amnesty launched a major new report into Russia ’s orgy of violence as its troops attacked Kyiv. Ukrainian authorities are investigating over 9,000 potential war crimes by Russian troops and the International Criminal Court is also looking into alleged war crimes. Amnesty’s report is the latest to document alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces when they occupied an area northwest of Kyiv, including the town of Bucha, where more than 400 civilians were killed. Armour piercing rounds or bullets, with black tips and a 9x39mm calibre were fired at civilians and these are only used by some elite Russian airborne units more commonly known as paratroopers. Moscow withdrew its troops in early April as the invasion faltered, driven back by a ferocious Ukrainian counter-attack. The report concludes Russian troops committed a ""host of apparent war crimes"" in Bucha, including ""numerous unlawful killings.” Evidence has been uncovered leading to the identities of individual Russian soldiers and military units present in Bucha, amongst them the troops of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division, Rovera said she collected in Bucha armour-piercing bullets and shell casings produced at a plant in Tula, south of Moscow, for rifles used only by elite Russian airborne units. It adds enormous weight to earlier revelations this week linking war crimes to Russian airborne troops. She added: “We also found and were able to view some military documents that indicate the presence of these special units in these places where these crimes were committed.” Amnesty has documented 22 cases of unlawful killing by Russian forces - ""most of which were apparent extrajudicial executions"" - in Bucha and nearby areas. The devastating report was revealed amid fears for more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops and hundreds of civilians holed up in a steel works in Mariupol which Russian forces are trying to overrun.",45,5.179747014278843,4.733580632993596,0.44616638128524677,2

Just 10 weeks into the invasion and Putin's forces are said to be firing more missiles than they expected to because of how the war has dragged on. Britain's Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told TalkTV : ""He potentially has a problem because the rate of expenditure and the toughness of the fight is totally different to the one that he perceived on the 24th of February. ""I think there are several wars going on. There's a tactical, geographical war going on in Ukraine. There's a logistics war going on, in terms of how you maintain that rate of expenditure. ""We're talking severe impact on their armed forces. We’ve had 25% of their forces effectively being taken out - either through people being killed or through the damage to their battalion tactical groups.” He added that Putin is under ""incredible pressure"" to deliver a victory for Russia. He said: “I think what we're now seeing is incredible pressure - political pressure and military pressure - for a victory. “I think there are several wars going on. There's a tactical, geographical war going on in Ukraine. There's a logistics war going on, in terms of how you maintain that rate of expenditure. “We're talking severe impact on their armed forces. We’ve had 25% of their forces effectively being taken out - either through people being killed or through the damage to their battalion tactical groups.” The admiral's comments come as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Putin's generals are ""turning on themselves"" to avoid becoming the scapegoat amid the failed operation. During a visit to Poland, Mr Wallace said Putin's top men are blaming each other for the ""disaster"" and fear being purged in the event of a retreat, The Times reports. Mr Wallace said: ""They're all in fall guy territory. Be careful if you're out in sole command of something in the Russian system, because it may not be for long. ""There is a point of tension in the system. As much as they respect the former KGB man [Putin] for being a strong leader, the Russian general staff are going to be made scapegoats for his mess."" Putin has suffered heavy blows as he's lost at last nine generals so far. Major-General Andrei Simonov, 55, was the ninth killed in battle in Izyum near Kharkiv, the country’s second city, according to Ukrainian sources. He was Russia’s most respected electronics warfare commander, serving with the 2nd Combined Arms Army, and died in a devastating fightback by the Ukrainians against a Russian offensive. More than 30 Russian armoured vehicles were destroyed in the attack along with around 100 Russian troops, unconfirmed reports suggest. As well as losing nine generals, Putin's army has seen 36 colonels slain in little over two months of fighting in what military experts say is an astonishing rate of attrition.",7,3.7923064744199593,5.091271982560441,-1.2989655081404816,17

Railway tankers containing solvents caught fire by a huge factory in Dzerzhinsk, which has made chemical weapons. A fire train was deployed to fight the raging inferno in the industrial city which is 250 miles east of Moscow and more than 150 emergency service workers spent nine hours battling the fire covering over 2,500 square metres, on Wednesday. It is one of many attacks that have been taking place on strategic sites with military links on Russian soil since the Ukraine invasion. And as Vladimir Putin is rumoured to be considering mass army mobilisation, a video has been shared showing a Russian military enlistment office hit by multiple Molotov cocktails. Another blaze that officially killed 22 at a defence ministry missile design research institute, and an attack that saw three die at an explosive plant, are also seen as possible arson with the Russian authorities also being accused of playing down incidents. There remains suspicion over the cause of a fire which killed 22 at the top secret missile-designing defence plant in Tver and saw some of the country’s top missile designers die and their work destroyed. Some military scientists jumped for their lives from windows at the burning plant which develops new space and weapons systems. And in a gigantic fire on Monday three women died at explosives manufacturer Perm Gunpowder Plant, which supplies the army. The plant makes Grad and Smerch multiple launch rocket systems, used by Russian forces in Ukraine, and air defence systems as well as tank rounds, while also supplying gunpowder for small arms. The dead explosives workers were named as Svetlana Bardakova, 59, Olga Savishchenko, 43, and Ulyana Frants, 36. An eyewitness told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: ""The building just flew into the air” and the facility at the plant “just doesn't exist anymore”. One of the dead Svetlana Bardakova “couldn't even run out, but the other girls fled - they were all burned. Olga (Savishchenko) had 100 per cent body burns. She was not even taken to the hospital. “But Ulyana (Frants) was alive, she had 99% burns, and her son in the second grade is waiting for her at home. I don’t know how to go to work any more. I cried all night.” In another case, blame has been put on faulty wiring and a criminal case is under way into a fire which razed the Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence causing untold damage to Russian weapons research. Suspicions have been voiced that the fire was sabotage. The institute is central to the design of Iskander missiles, which have been unleashed in the war in Ukraine, as well as Russia ’s S-400 missile defence system. And human rights group gulagu.net viewed this week’s attack on the military enlistment office in Nizhnevartovsk, that caused a fire and no reported injuries, as an “anti-war protest”. Pro-government sources said that two Molotov cocktails were thrown and a third failed to catch fire.",49,4.193577780313258,4.062679425481783,0.1308983548314746,21

It comes after an alleged cyber criminal and supporter of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin was arrested in the UK on Monday. The accused, who is said to be London-based, was detained after a police raid in the aftermath of a cyber assault on government and media websites in Romania, according to reports. He is said to be part of group Killnet, which has since warned it will disable NHS ventilators, as well as those in Romania and Moldova if he is not released. The 'gang' has claimed responsibility for the attacks, committed in retaliation for the country's support for Ukraine. The official government webpage and defence ministry were targeted, as well as political parties and other companies. The arrested man has previously declared his support for Moscow's barbaric invasion in Facebook posts, say reports. Investigators from Romania teamed up with National Crime Agency officers for the raid earlier this week. Killnet has said the suspect was not involved in the attacks, but warned it would retaliate within 48 hours if demands weren't met. The threat was reportedly posted on Telegram on Thursday evening and said: ""If he is not released within 48 hours I will destroy your Romania, Great Britain and Moldova. ""I will destroy your entire information structure and even your Ministry of Health. ""All ventilators will be attacked. Only then will you begin to realise the mistake you have made."" The suspect had been released under investigation prior to the warning. A source told The Sun : ""The UK has robust cyber security measures in place and, working with partners, the NCA would lead an appropriate response to any cyber crime incident having a significant impact on the UK."" It comes after the world’s top intelligence alliance warned last month Russian hackers are plotting cyber attacks on the NHS, nuclear power plants and Whitehall ministries. The Five Eyes security network - involving the UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand - issued an alert accusing the Russian government of exploring options for potential web assaults against critical organisations. The spy coalition urged them to bolster cyber defences as they face a heightened risk of Kremlin-sponsored attacks. According to the alert, ""evolving intelligence"" suggests hackers within the Russian government are seeking to engage in ""malicious cyber activity"" in response to the ""unprecedented economic sanctions"" imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.",20,5.519957883192871,4.842062724221477,0.6778951589713937,13

A total of 25 national guards “refuseniks”, who report directly to Putin, are demanding their job back after they were fired for defying commanders’ orders to send them to a foreign war zone. The Vladikavkaz garrison military court is due to start considering their lawsuit on Thursday said lawyer and human rights campaigner Pavel Chikov. They aim to prove that their dismissal was “illegal” since it was based on their refusal to enter Ukraine. The “refuseniks” were ordered to enter Ukraine early on in the war to keep order in Ukrainian cities. At the time, the Kremlin believed that victory would be swift and locals would surrender to Russian troops but many died, with the true figure not yet public. The case comes at a time when reports of open dissent in Russia are increasing, even among those in uniform. Hundred of guards from at least 17 cities have sought legal advice and aim to follow in the footsteps of the 25 national guards who have already launched their case. The servicemen are challenging Putin’s commander to the North Caucasian District to the National Guard Troops, Lt-Gen Sergey Zakharov. Lawyers from a number of other cities and regions are working on more cases, including Krasnodar, Nalchik, Cherkessk, Samara, Moscow region, Veliky Novgorod, Simferopol, Novocherkassk, Vladivostok, Stavropol, Abakan, Pskov, Orenburg, Ulan-Ude, Petersburg, and Smolensk. There's been a number of reports of Putin facing dissent from supporters including hardline senior figures in the military who have been left furious saying he has not gone far enough in the ongoing war.

Moscow’s troops have allegedly discussed the sick dress-up ruse to falsify their May 9 Victory Day celebrations - a key date in Russian military tradition. Petro Andryushchenko, advisor to the mayor of Mariupol, confirmed he had heard reports that Russians intend to put Ukrainian Army uniforms on civilians for a twisted “parade of prisoners"". It comes amid soaring fears for hundreds of civilians and more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops desperately making a last stand at the besieged Azovstal steel works in Mariupol. Andryushchenko said many of Mariupol’s men had been forcibly removed and separated from women and children after fleeing the strategic city. He also hinted that he had heard of Russian plans to disguise Ukrainian civilians as prisoners of war for the May 9 parade, which marks a 1945 Soviet victory against Nazi Germany. He said: “Men have been forcibly detained without being allowed to leave without a convoy of Russian troops. “The conditions are terrible - people are forced to sleep on the floor in the corridors. Medical care is not provided. “As for the future the occupiers emphasise that they have not yet decided whether to use people as labour or mobilise them to the Army as prisoners. “Why should they be disguised as Ukrainian soldiers?” Russian forces have stepped up brutal shelling of trapped troops and civilians in the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol as the defenders are in underground tunnel complexes. They have defended the vast industrial site for weeks, despite coming under heavy attack and being driven back by Ukraine ’s forces repeatedly. Ukraine’s President Zelensky warned that women and children sheltering underground now need to be dug out from the rubble under which they are buried alive. He said: “It takes time to just lift people out of these basements, out of underground shelters. “In the current conditions we cannot use special equipment to clear the debris. “Everything is done manually but we believe everything will work out.” Russian forces have promised to allow a ceasefire to allow a rescue bid for the rest of Mariupol’s trapped civilians. But Ukraines’ attempts to evacuate stricken civilians have been repeatedly thwarted by Russia going back on its ceasefire promises. According to Kyiv figures 221 Ukrainian children have been killed during the invasion and 408 injured.",47,5.456220524621454,3.7179646688657475,1.7382558557557064,9

The country's defence ministry said war monger Putin's invaders were attempting to increase the tempo of its offensive, with around 20 bombs launched from airspace above the Caspian Sea. Officials said the weapons were fired “with the aim of damaging our country's transport infrastructure."" Lviv was among those targeted for the first time in around a month as Russia targeted railway stations and other supply-lines bringing urgent essentials from allies in the West. Some of the weapons struck electrical substations, leaving terrified people waiting in the dark as the attacks intensified. Six rockets were fired on the west of Ukraine, with two being shot down by the nation before they could hit their targets. One 24-year-old victim was nearly killed when a bomb landed outside his home in Lviv. The Mail Online reported him saying: “‘When I took off my helmet, I saw a rocket flying in my face. It fell behind a concrete wall, about ten metres from me. The garage I was standing near exploded. “Only when I ran home did I notice that there were fragments in my leg.” The flurry of attacks comes as Russia prepares to celebrate Victory Day on Monday, marking the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany. There are fears President Vladimir Putin will use the occasion to declare victory in Ukraine or expand what he calls the ""special military operation"". A declaration of all-out war would allow him to introduce martial law and mobilise reservists to make up for significant troop losses. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu justified the latest attacks by saying Lviv had been a gateway weaponry being sent around the country by Nato. In the under siege nation’s latest update, they reported heavy fighting continues to rage at the Azovstal steel mill in Mariupol- the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in the ruined southern port city. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: ""All of these crimes will be answered, legally and quite practically - on the battlefield."" A Kyiv official said: “With the support of aircraft, the enemy resumed the offensive in order to take control of the plant.” He added the Russians were ""trying to destroy Ukrainian units"". Ukrainian fighters earlier claimed enemy forces had begun storming the plant, but the Kremlin denied it. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the latest in Mariupol: ""The order was publicly given by the supreme commander (Russian President Vladimir Putin) to cancel the storming (of the plant). There is no storming. ""We see that there are escalations associated with the fact that fighters are taking up firing positions. “These attempts are being suppressed very quickly, there is nothing else to say at the moment.” The United Nations announced that more than 300 civilians were evacuated on Wednesday from Mariupol and other nearby communities.

Russian troops practised the simulated ""electronic launches"" of nuclear-capable Iskander mobile ballistic missile systems in the western enclave of Kaliningrad, in the Baltic Sea between Poland and Lithuania, the defence ministry said in a statement. Forces practised single and multiple strikes at targets imitating launchers of missile systems, airfields, protected infrastructure, military equipment and command posts of a mock enemy, the statement said. Personnel then carried out a manoeuvre to change their position in order to avoid ""a possible retaliatory strike"", the defence ministry added. However, no actual missiles were fired during the simulator tests. During the tests, military units, which involved over 100 troops, are also said to have practised ""actions in conditions of radiation and chemical contamination"". Vladimir Putin's cronies' brazen threats of razing Britain to the ground with nuclear missiles show how unrestrained Russian state pundits feel while the Kremlin continues with its aggression towards the West. It comes as Putin's war rolls on in Ukraine, with Kremlin-controlled TV presenters repeatedly threatening Britain and simulating the absolute destruction a nuke would cause to the UK. Presenters on one of the country's most widely watched programmes, Russia One, drew up maps showing the resulting blast radius if atomic weapons hit three European cities, including London. And more recently Putin stooge Dmitry Kiselyov - also known as the president's ""mouthpiece"" - warned an underwater torpedo nuke hitting the UK would produce a 500m-high tsunami and leave the isles a ""radioactive desert"". Retired army officer and security analyst, Tom Clonan, told Newstalk Breakfast these ""horrific threats"" are a clear sign of just how ""disinhibited"" Putin's cronies feel as the Kremlin continues to uphold its aggressive stance against the West. In one report Kiselyov boasted of the destructive power of his country's nuclear arsenal in front of a graphic simulation of an underwater missile being detonated along the coast of northwest Ireland. Kiselyov bragged: ""It approaches its target at a depth of 1km at a speed of 200km/h. “There's no way of stopping this underwater drone. The warhead on it has a yield of up to 100 megatonnes. ""The explosion of this thermonuclear torpedo by Britain's coastline will cause a gigantic tsunami wave up to 500m high. ""Such a barrage alone also carries extreme doses of radiation.

This is the moment Russian troops bomb the Azovstal plant to “suppress” Ukrainian soldiers who resumed fighting after civilians were allowed to evacuate. The video was filmed at the Azovstal iron and steel works plant, in the city of Mariupol. Russian troops stormed the plant on April 19 and destroyed large areas, however, pockets of organised resistance fighters remain at the plant. Those remaining are refusing to surrender to the Russian demands. Members of the Azov Battalion, a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine in Mariupol, are said to be based in the plant. The footage was shared by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) on May 4. Contact was lost with the Azonstal Steelworks defenders as Russian forces pounded them with missiles and stormed their redoubt with tanks and infantry. The Mayor of the city Vadym Boichenko confirmed he has “lost contact” with those inside the vast complex and added he no longer knew if “they are safe or not.” According to the ministry, Ukrainian fighters based in the plant resumed fighting after civilians were allowed to leave. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works was the last stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the southern port city. It had been under siege from Russian forces for weeks, and stood even as the rest of the city fell to Putin's troops. Hundreds of civilians and wounded were said to be trapped down there as well as the troops fighting Russian occupation and there were growing fears of starvation as they began to run low on supplies. Russia’s Mariupol onslaught came amid fears Russian forces are desperate to wipe out the resistance in advance of a big military parade on May 9. It marks Victory day and the 1945 defeat of Germany and Russia is considering staging a “sick” parade in the ruined city, cleaning up corpses and faking welcomes from locals. Fears are growing for around 1,000 remaining Ukrainian troops - many of them wounded - and a few hundred civilians believed to still be there. It is believed the planned parade was leaked by Ukrainian intelligence which had intercepted Russian phone calls in which the May 9 project was mentioned. Russia has continued to pound targets across Ukraine, targeting supply lines for foreign weapons in the west and intensifying attacks in the east. Moscow confirmed on Wednesday it used sea- and air-launched precision guided missiles to destroy electric power facilities at five railway stations across Ukraine. Artillery and aircraft also struck troop strongholds and fuel and ammunition depots. The flurry of attacks happened as Russia prepares for its Victory Day on May 9, when President Vladimir Putin may use the occasion to declare a limited victory. Explosions hit the western city of Lviv on Tuesday evening, close to the Polish border. The strikes damaged three power substations, knocking out electricity in parts of the city and disrupting the water supply and two people were hurt. Kremlin war planners are desperate to stop western weaponry - much of it from the UK -pouring into Ukraine and helping to blunt Russia's offensive. In the eastern Donetsk region, which lies in the Donbas, Russian attacks left 21 dead on Tuesday, the highest number of known fatalities since the April 8 missile attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk killed at least 59 people. The US believes Ukrainians in recent days pushed Russian forces about 25 miles east of Kharkiv, a northeastern city that lies outside the Donbas but is key to the offensive there. Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said authorities on Wednesday plan to continue efforts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol. Thanks to the evacuation effort over the weekend, 101 people - including women, the elderly, and 17 children, the youngest six months old - emerged from the bunkers under the Azovstal steelworks to ""see the daylight after two months"", said Osnat Lubrani, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Ukraine. A few hundred civilians also remained there, Ms Vereshchuk, the deputy prime minister, said. In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that by storming the steel mill, Russian forces violated agreements for safe evacuations. He said the prior evacuations are ""not a victory yet, but it's already a result. I believe there's still a chance to save other people.” However on Tuesday, the UN, in corodination with The International Committee of the Red Cross, confirmed 101 people were successfully evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant. The DPR claimed the “militants” took up firing positions straight after the civilians left the plant and opened fire on Russian troops and DPR fighters. The footage shows Ukrainian soldiers moving around the plant in tanks and armoured vehicles before Russian bombs rain down, sending large plumes of smoke into the sky. The DPR said they used aerial bombs and artillery ammunition to “suppress enemy activity at Azovstal”. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin called a ""special military operation"". Today marks the 70th day of the campaign. From February 24 to May 4, the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at around 24,500 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 1,077 battle tanks, 2,610 combat armoured vehicles, 491 artillery systems, 163 MLR systems, 81 anti-aircraft systems, 194 warplanes, 155 helicopters, 1,867 vehicles, 10 vessels, 76 fuel tank trucks, 303 operational-tactical level UAVs, 38 units of special equipment, and 87 cruise missiles have been shot down.

The E-4B Nightwatch, an airborne command centre for the US President in times of war, has today pictured being refuelled over southern California. Test pilots and personnel from the 418th Flight Test Squadron, out of Edwards Air Force Base, California, conducted the aerial refuelling testing with a KC-46 Pegasus tanker in April. The Boeing E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post, the current ‘Nightwatch’ aircraft, is a strategic command and control military aircraft operated by the United States Air Force. It comes following chilling video showing war lord Putin's Ilyushin Il-80 passing low amid tension that he will resort to atomic weapons over the conflict in Ukraine. Russian officials have confirmed the aircraft will be showcased with a low flypast at Monday’s annual Victory Day parade on Red Square, and is involved in ""rehearsals"" for the display. Last month, the American ‘doomsday’ aircraft was seen in the skies over the UK. The plane accompanied American President Joe Biden during a trip to Europe in April. The E-4B serves as the National Airborne Operations Center and is a key component of the National Military Command System for the President, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In case of national emergency or destruction of ground command and control centres, the aircraft provides a highly survivable command, control and communications centre to direct US forces, execute emergency war orders and coordinate actions by civil authorities. The E-4B is said to be protected against the effects of electromagnetic pulse. It has an electrical system designed to support advanced electronics and a wide variety of communications equipment. An advanced satellite communications system provides worldwide communication for senior leaders through the airborne operations centre. Other improvements include nuclear and thermal effects shielding, acoustic control, an improved technical control facility and an upgraded air-conditioning system for cooling electrical components. It comes after the Russian Defence Ministry confirmed that eight MiG-29SMTs will fly in the form of the letter ‘Z’ in support of Russian servicemen participating in a special military operation in Ukraine. The Maxdome is designed to act as a Kremlin-in-the-sky in the event of nuclear attack, and can be refuelled in mid-air.

In Mariupol, Ukraine says that Russian troops are rounding up the dead and burning them in a massive “cleaning” effort. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said that Russian troops in the city had been undertaking the macabre task since April 15. It added that they had been using three mobile crematoriums in their 'clean up’ as they rounded up the bodies of the Ukrainians that they had killed.

The city has been hit by relentless Russia shelling and air strikes, including targeting a maternity and children’s hospital and a shelter. Officials said that more than 90 per cent of the city’s infrastructure had been hit by shelling. Now, most of the city is under Russian control, with Ukrainian troops holed up in a steelworks plant. Mariupol’s city council previously accused Russia of sending out “special brigades” to round up the dead the dead bodies and burn them. The council quoted eyewitnesses who said they had seen “special brigades” collect “the bodies of Mariupol residents murdered and killed as a result of the Russian invasion"". On top of that, they said that because of the destruction of evidence it would be difficult to accurately assess the true number of dead and it could run into “tens of thousands civilians”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also said that Russia was “cleaning up” before anyone could see what had happened in the city. If the port city were to fall to Russia, it would give Moscow a continuous land bridge connecting its territories from the east of Ukraine to the Crimean Peninsula.

Major-General Kyrylo Budanov has said that the Russian leader has effectively signed his death warrant by ordering his troops into Ukraine. Boldly predicting a Ukrainian victory at the same time as warning that mass-mobilisation in Russia was near, Major-General Budanov issued this veiled threat on Monday evening. “Leaving him a way to retreat is one of the strategies, but it is almost unrealistic,” he told The New Voice of Ukraine when asked if Putin would survive the war. “He is a war criminal for the whole world. This is his end, he drove himself into a dead end. Don't worry, Ukraine will win."" The Head of the Chief Intelligence Directorate would not be drawn on how the despot would be ousted or assassinated, but did predict that the future of Russia could unfold in one of two ways. He said that Russia could be divided into multiple parts following its failure in the invasion, or it could be kept whole, but under new leadership. Major-General Budanov went on to suggest that Russia was less than a week away from mass mobilisation, which would see its non-military citizens required to have a direct involvement in the war. ""Russia has already been enacting covert mobilisation and is preparing to announce a mass mobilisation in the near future,"" he told NV. When asked whether Putin planned to announce the mobilisation on May 9, he said: ""Yes, they are preparing."" In recent weeks Russia watchers have turned their attention to May 9, which is the day the country celebrates its victory over Nazi Germany. While the invasion has not gone as planned - the Ukrainian forces having not only slowed the Russian advance, but forced it to focus on the eastern section of the country - Putin is expected to make some kind of declaration of victory. Many military analysts have warned it could also be a key date for escalation in the war, which the Russian leader has claimed is an effort to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. “They had the main deadline—to have time to finish by April 24… they completely failed him. The second date is to complete the operation at least in Donbas by May 9,” Major-General Budanov said. “Putin cannot admit that he is losing to Ukraine."" The one clear victory the Russians can now claim is in Mariupol, which effectively fell into their hands last week despite the presence of Ukrainian troops in a besieged steelworks. Otherwise the invasion has been far slower and much more costly in terms of lives lost than planned. According to the UK Ministry of Defence, Russia has lost a quarter of its combat forces deployed in Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. According to intelligence experts, Russia committed more than 120 battalion tactical groups - some 65 per cent of their entire ground combat strength - and now had around 30 completely out of action. ""At the start of the conflict, Russia committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65 per cent of its entire ground combat strength,"" an update from the Defence Intelligence agency reads. ""It is likely that more than a quarter of these units have now been rendered combat ineffective.

Russia threw ""approximately 65 per cent of its entire ground combat strength"" at Ukraine during its ongoing invasion. This equalled around 120 battalion tactical groups and despite this the Kremlin forces have found themselves struggling, and in recent weeks they regrouped in the east to refocus their efforts. The Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update yesterday that it believed over a quarter of Moscow’s units had been rendered useless in the war. This would reflect reports on the ground that have highlighted poorly equipped Russian soldiers whose vehicles have run out of fuel, as well as claims of low morale and desertion.

It will probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces.” Since the early days of the war, the Ministry of Defence has been offering regular intelligence updates on its Twitter account. This is seemingly a part of a wider Western strategy whereby officials and governments are publicising intelligence unlike ever before in an effort to stay one step ahead of Vladimir Putin. That comes as today’s intelligence update further highlighted issues amongst Russia’s military and more failings of its invasion. This included in reporting its belief that the invasion would have a “lasting impact on Russia’s ability to deploy conventional military force”. The MoD wrote that despite Russia’s push to appear like it was undertaking an expansive military modernisation over the past few decades, significant failures meant it was unable to translate this into any meaningful advantage on the battlefield. They wrote: “Russia’s defence budget approximately doubled between 2005 and 2018, with investment in several high-end air, land and sea capabilities. “From 2008 this underpinned the expansive military modernisation programme New Look. “However, the modernisation of its physical equipment has not enabled Russia to dominate Ukraine. “Failures both in strategic planning and operational execution have left it unable to translate numerical strength into decisive advantage. “Russia’s military is now significantly weaker, both materially and conceptually, as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. “Recovery from this will be exacerbated by sanctions.

Kyiv intelligence officers believe the killer disease could spark an epidemic in the region whilst Moscow would accuse Ukraine of launching a bio-attack. The Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate says Russian officials are already preparing for a Cholera outbreak by restricting mass gatherings.

It said: “...the Russian Federation may be involved in provocations in border areas with Ukraine. “Responsibility for this traditionally will attempt to translate to Ukraine, accusing of 'the use of biological weapons'."" Russia has been repeatedly accused of launching and planning “false flag” operations - self-inflicted incidents used to a pretext to attack Ukraine.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It immediately explodes upon impact, sending smoke spewing out the car as it keeps reversing with its doors hang open. The only Russian not to get in the car keeps running towards the ruined building, without even seemingly looking back as the car trundles into a tree. It is not known where the attack took place, but the footage was originally posted on Telegram. It was then shared on Twitter by Ukrainian government advisor Anton Gerashchenko who said the attack was executed by soldiers of Ukraine ’s 92nd Brigade. Throughout Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv’s forces have utilised drone attacks to wreak havoc on the Kremlin’s forces. Only last week, footage showed another drone strike from what was thought to be Ukraine’s 503rd Naval Infantry Battalion which left two Russian tanks destroyed. Back in March, a group of amateur drone users claimed they were able to destroy Russia’s infamous 40-mile convoy of tanks and armoured vehicles in a number of ambushes. The group’s commander Lieutenant Colonel Yaroslav Honchar said that they staged an ambush near the town of Ivankiv. This helped to halt the massive Russian operation and the force approached on quad bikes at night, before attacking the column's supply depot to stop their advance. This comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues well into its third month of fighting. Vladimir Putin ’s forces found their original attempts to seize the capital of Kyiv unsuccessful and eventually pulled back from the city. They retreated and regrouped their forces in the east of Ukraine in an effort to take the east of the country in what Volodymyr Zelensky dubbed the “Battle for the Donbas”. When Russian troops retreated from the Kyiv Oblast in their wake they left evidence of atrocities their forces committed in Bucha where the bodies of civilians littered the streets. However, now the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence has said that Putin’s forces are now trying to carry out a “big cleaning” to hide evidence of its atrocities.

The Russian President has reportedly left his military officers in ""shock"" with impossible demands as he attempts to get the faltering invasion back on track. The despot is said to have lost patience with his generals as Victory Day celebrations on May 9 quickly approach. It marks the day Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945 at the end of World War II, with Putin having been using the holiday to glorify Russia and himself. It is understood the 69-year-old leader has ordered his battle-weary generals to capture the city of Kryvyi Rih, the birthplace of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. Such a symbolic success could be fed into the Kremlin's propaganda machine, papering over the stuttering military campaign. The Russian army has struggled with poor co-ordination, as well as out-dated equipment and severe dips in morale while facing a driven Ukrainian defence with a clear shared goal - and modern weapons from NATO. It has seen Moscow troops fail to take capital Kyiv before retreating to focus on the east - though now that front is failing to make much headway. A senior EU source told Mujtaba Rahman, a managing director at the Eurasia Group, that Putin had ""now taken day-to day-control of the conflict"", reports the Daily Express. His new key target - Kryvyi Rih - is Ukraine's second largest city by area with a population of around one million. Social media user ""UOI"", a frequent commentator on events in Ukraine, wrote: ""Putin is demanding that Dvornikov take Kryvyi Rih, Zelensky's homeland, by May 9. ""We are told from communication interceptions that Russian officers are simply in shock. ""They have losses of 400 soldiers a day killed and wounded, and their equipment keeps breaking down."" It comes after General Aleksandr Dvornikov was put in charge of the invasion last month, charged with taking the entire Donbas region in the east. But the Ukrainians are refusing to back down, despite having vastly inferior numbers. Through tactical retreats, counterstrikes and guerrilla warfare, they have been able to inflict heavy casualties on the invading troops. The head of Moscow's army narrowly escaped with his life over the weekend after being caught in artillery fire near Izyum. General Valery Gerasimov had only taken over command of the Izyum axis days earlier. Russian forces are seeking to push south towards Slovyansk. Defending forces, however, targeted the Russian HQ in the area, killing multiple officers, including General Andrey Simonov, a commander of electronic warfare forces of the West district. Gerasimov managed to escape the attack with minor legs injuries, according to former Internal Affairs minister Arsen Avakov. Veteran officer Victor Kovalenko tweeted: ""Yesterday's Ukraine attack on the Rus. HQ in Izium was designed to liquidate the high-value target - chief of Gen. Staff of RAF Gen. Valeriy Gerasimov.

The agent also indicated that losing the ""Battle for Donbas"" would add to instability in Russia and could lead to a coup or even further territorial loss. The Kremlin has launched its latest attack in the eastern territories of Ukraine with Vladimir Putin battling to take control of the entire Donbas region. But Ukraine continues to put up fierce resistance and is currently slowing down Russian troops as they advance from the east. In a letter to a Russian human rights campaigner Vladimir Osechkin, the agent predicted that Putin's army will fail in achieving its objectives in Donbas. “The current reality leaves the country with two options,"" he wrote. “The first is a total collapse due to the full set of all wrong actions taken together. The second is a civil war.” Ukrainian forces carrying out tactical retreats and launching counterattacks in the Kharkiv region, leading to heavy losses on Russian invaders.

The insider predicts that the Chechen leader is patiently waiting for the chance to exploit the ensuing political turmoil and carry out his long cherished ambition of creating an ""Emirate of the Caucasus."" He said: ""There is reason to believe that Kadyrov is not only aware of the inevitability of a civil war in Russia, but is actively playing along the lines of a potential split.

He also predicted that Kadyrov will become ""the main beneficiary of the military failure of the Russian Armed Forces"". Describing the upcoming conflict as a ""Donbas meat grinder"", the FSB insider said that Kadyrov is ""guaranteed to keep his forces intact"". While the rest of Russian forces will be ""heavily drained and exhausted"" in any outcome of the battle.

Major-General Andrei Simonov, 55, was killed in battle in Izyum near Kharkov, the country’s second city, according to Ukrainian sources. He was Russia ’s most respected electronics warfare commander, serving with the 2nd Combined Arms Army, and died in a devastating fightback by the Ukrainians against a Russian offensive. More than 30 Russian armoured vehicles were destroyed in the attack along with around 100 Russians troops, unconfirmed reports suggest. As well as losing nine generals, Putin's army has seen 36 colonels slain in little over two months fighting in what military experts say this is an astonishing rate of attrition. Losing senior military members can be a sign that an army is suffering from ill discipline as generals and colonels are required to take control of their forces on the front lines. Putin has now sent his chief of defence staff General Valery Gerasimov to take personal command of the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Sinonov’s death alongside 100 Russian troops - and the reported loss of armoured vehicles - indicates another setback for the Kremlin leader who aimed to declare the success of his mission on 9 May, Victory Day in Russia, marking the anniversary of the end of the Second World War. He is far from the only high profile military man to lose their life in the course of the invasion. Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, one of Putin’s most senior commanders and in charge of the 8th All-Military Army of the Kremlin’s vast Southern Military District, was killed at the beginning of March. So was Colonel Sergei Sukharev, one of Russia's top paratroop commanders and part of the country's most elite fighting squads. While the exact number of people killed during the war is difficult to determine, it is clear that Russia has endured far greater losses than it initially expected. Last week UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace said that 15,000 Russian troops had died so far. The rate of fatalities among the invading army's number is now decreasing as the scope of the offensive is narrowed, a Western official told Reuters. Having failed in an assault on Kyiv in the north of Ukraine last month, Russia is now trying to fully capture two eastern provinces known as the Donbas. ""The nature of the operations have been reduced in terms of geographic spread so the overall numbers are reducing,"" one of the officials said on Russian casualties. ""But the level of casualties that we're seeing in terms of those areas where they are engaging Ukrainian forces are still remaining quite high."" Asked about Ukrainian casualties, he said there had been Ukrainian losses in the Donbas. ""They are taking some losses (but) certainly not at the sort of scale that Russian forces are taking,"" the official said. He added: ""Those losses on Russian forces, we assessed to be having a significant impact on the will to fight of wider Russian forces, but the Ukrainian losses are not affecting the morale of the Ukrainian forces."" Russia, which says it launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, has not updated its official casualty figures in several weeks.

Until now the Kremlin despot has called the invasion a “special military operation” but General Sir Richard Barrons, an ex-Commander of Joint Forces Command, said Putin would use Monday’s (May 9) annual Victory Day parade in Moscow to “shift the narrative for the Russian people from a ‘special military operation’. Something that was intended to be short, sharp and decisive, to what is becoming a long, drawn-out, attritional war - and he will probably use the word ‘war’. The Victory Day celebrations mark the Soviets’ triumph over the Nazis in the Second World War. Putin has increasingly used the Red Square occasion to unveil new weapons or equipment. This year, the focus is expected to be on the war in Ukraine. General Sir Richard believed rebranding the conflict would allow Putin to make greater use of young conscripts. “That provides a different legal basis in Russia for hanging onto the current cycle of conscripts and deploying other reserves and taking other measures,” he said. “Essentially, it’s bracing Russia for what will become a long, drawn-out war in Ukraine, which will become more about annexation than anything else.” General Sir Richard predicted a stalemate in the Donbas as Ukrainian and Russian forces do battle. “The most likely outcome is it grinds down into a stalemate and that may cause Russia to stop or if it’s still got plenty of resources I think it will then turn its attention to taking more territory in the south,” he told the BBC. “There is a very stiff fight and it’s inconclusive. ""The Russians have made some progress but the Ukrainian military have counter-attacked and taken back territory in other places. “This is really now a race between the Russian ability to be able to concentrate force in ways in which they have just not managed so far. ""And on the other hand the Ukrainian military’s ability to get these heavy weapons, particularly the artillery from the US and Germany, in order to break up these attacks and deal with the Russian artillery. “It’s very hard to call how that is going to turn out.” The deputy head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Ihor Zhovka, insisted Ukraine would “definitely win the Battle of the Donbas”.",7,4.665857051050872,4.901385983165124,-0.23552893211425197,12

Around 100 civilians were successfully evacuated during a brief ceasefire before Vladimir Putin ’s troops again blocked escape routes out of the ruined city with more shelling. Ukraine ’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said: “The situation has become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe.” National Guard commander Denys Shlega said several hundred civilians remain trapped alongside nearly 500 wounded soldiers and “numerous” dead bodies. He added: “Several dozen small children are still in the bunkers underneath the plant.” There are fears the troops may not be allowed to surrender. During the ceasefire, old women and mums with small children climbed over rubble at the plant before boarding buses. The civilians were driven to Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia, 140 miles north of Mariupol. People who fled Russian-occupied areas say their vehicles were fired at. An escapee at a UN-backed centre in Zaporizhzhia said: “Those without cars can’t leave. They’re desperate.” As many as 100,000 people may still be in Mariupol. Thousands have been killed in the port city which is running out of water, food and medicine. Kyiv claims Russia is guilty of 9,000 war crimes including executions, rapes and abductions. Ukraine’s SBU security service has traced the names of 900 Russian servicemen linked to war crimes against civilians in the Kyiv region. While 100 locals have been identified as “collaborators”. As many as 219 Ukrainian children have been killed and 405 injured during the invasion which began in February, officials say. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky says Moscow is waging “a war of extermination”, adding Russian shelling has hit food and grain warehouses, as well as residential areas in Kharkiv, the Donbas and other regions. A rocket strike in the Black Sea port city of Odesa killed a number of people last night, officials say. Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne quoted military bosses saying the strike had damaged a religious building. Phone calls involving Putin’s soldiers in Kharkiv have been intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence staff, and show troops have been forced at gunpoint to fight against their will. Russia has lost close to 24,000 troops so far. Putin has suffered another major blow as his top man in Ukraine, Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia’s General Staff, has been sent home wounded. Western officials say Russia is advancing slowly in its effort to gain complete control of the Donbas region in the east. Boris Johnson is today set to become the first world leader to give a speech to Ukraine’s parliament since the invasion. Echoing Winston Churchill, he is expected to say via video link: “This is Ukraine’s finest hour.” He is set to announce £300million of defensive military aid for Ukraine. Britain will also send drones that can airlift gear to troops. There are increasing concerns Moscow now has its sights on Moldova, where controlling separatist Transnistria would forge a supply point for the invasion of southern Ukraine.",47,3.7510850422816904,3.339782940761637,0.4113021015200533,9

However, 1,000 civilians are still trapped beneath with some suffering from rotting wounds, as gangrene sets in. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant became the last Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged southern port city. Ukrainian forces defended the site against Russian forces and Putin declared it should be surrounded so “not even a fly comes through”. Russian state media outlets claimed that 25 civilians have been evacuated from the plant yesterday. But the deputy commander of the Ukrainian forces holding out inside, disputed the number, saying it was only 20. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Russia's RIA Novosti news agency said that 19 adults and six children were brought out but gave no further details. About 100,000 civilians remains in the bombed city which has seen some of the worst Russian air attacks during this war. A church, serving as a shelter for at least a 1,000 people, was bombed, killing hundreds, even though they had written ‘children’ in Russian outside it. Similarly, a maternity and children’s hospital was bombed in the city. At least 1,000 people are still trapped beneath the Soviet-era steel plant according to Ukrainian officials. United Nations workers have continued to try and broker an evacuation from the area. Footage from filmed inside the steel works showed the defiant fighters inside, but also the wounded they were protecting. Unidentified men were covered in stained bandages whilst others had open wounds or amputated limbs. The videos were shared by two Ukrainian women who said their husbands were among the fighters holding fast there. They said there was a skeleton medical staff who were treating at least 600 wounded people and said that some of the wounds were rotting with gangrene. In the video the soldiers said they eat just once a day and share as little as a litre and a half of water among four people as supplies run low. The video also revealed the warren of underground pathways beneath the facility where the Ukrainians are hiding. One wounded man described the injuries he had suffered including two broken ribs, a punctured lung and a dislocated arm that ""was hanging on the flesh"". He added: ""I want to tell everyone who sees this: If you will not stop this here, in Ukraine, it will go further, to Europe."" The fighters are still holding fast as Russian seeks to conquer Mariupol. If Moscow were to take the southern city, it would give it a land bridge between Russian controlled territories in the east of Ukraine and the conquered Crimea peninsula. This would allow it to better resupply troops as Vladimir Putin has recently launched the next stage of his invasion of Ukraine, focusing his troops and resources on the east of the country. This comes after the Kremlin failed to take any of the cities of major urban centres, including the capital Kyiv. Russian troops pulled back from areas in the Kyiv oblast, leaving behind evidence of the atrocities it committed such as in Bucha, where civilians were butchered in the street. Moscow forces then regrouped in the east, in an ongoing effort to fully seize the Donbas.",47,4.2627126764368795,3.6642528360339175,0.598459840402962,29

They attacked the soldiers in a field hospital northwest of Bucha, reports state as the barbaric action in Ukraine continue. The fighters, known as Kadyrovtsy, allegedly killed their own comrades and have turned a glass factory into a chilling 'torture chamber'. The deputy commander in Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces spoke to local witnesses on his recent visit to Borodyanka. Artem Hurin reportedly said Kadyrovtsy would 'shoot dead' wounded Russian soldiers on the spot. He was first to visit the town after Vladimir Putin's soldiers retreated last month. Mr Hurin said: ""They would bring heavily wounded Russian soldiers to a big hospital they had there, and those who were very heavily wounded, they would just shoot them. No one other than the Kadyrovtsy did this. ""They didn't allow them to do anything. There they just killed people through binoculars for example. They just shot them."" They had executed people as early as March 5, residents said. The Daily Beast reports that he said he saw evidence of horrifying stories. He claims residents were tortured and raped by lawless Russian troops. The commander says they also 'executed civilians' who were found lifeless on the street. One woman also recalled how she endured four days of torture by one Kadyrovtsy soldier and another from Belarus. They brutally shot her husband in the head, she said. Autopsies have been carried out on mutilated corpses from Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka, The Guardian reports. Many showed signs of torture, with some having bullet holes in the back. Some of the bodies were so badly disfigured investigators have been unable to identify the victim. Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor who carried out the autopsies, told The Guardian : ""We already have a few cases which suggest that these women had been raped before being shot to death. ""We can't give more details as my colleagues are still collecting the data and we still have hundreds of bodies to examine."" He added: ""There are many burnt bodies, and heavily disfigured bodies that are just impossible to identify - the face could be smashed into pieces, you can't put it back together, sometimes there's no head at all.""",45,5.005668708645057,5.601341901148146,-0.5956731925030887,18

The lethal PTKM-1R can launch itself up to 100ft in the air when its target rolls within 100 metres, scan the ground and then fire an explosive at it from above. Believed to have been introduced to the Russian military in 2020, the mine has been compared to the US Army's M-93 ""Hornet"" wide-area munition, which uses seismic and acoustic sensors to identify potential targets in the vicinity. A PTKM-1R was discovered in Ukraine on April 26 in a harrowing new development as the conflict rages on, The Telegraph reports. One photo posted to Twitter, reportedly taken earlier in the week, shows the mine placed on the ground in a field with its eight legs folded outwards. The mines can theoretically distinguish between tanks and non-military cars, but their presence in Ukraine has raised concerns for the safety of civilians who might come across one. Four directional acoustic sensors and seismic sensors are set off when a target vehicle comes within 100m of the mine, at which point a projectile flight path will be calculated. The mine will then tilt down at a 30-degree angle towards the tank. When it's within range a 6.2lb explosive warhead is launched up to 100ft into the air, as the mine's infrared censors scan the ground below for the target. An explosive metal projectile is then fired with enough speed to penetrate almost three inches into steel armour - and the whole terrifying process takes just a matter of seconds. The Ukrainian military has been relying on armoured tanks to defend the nation from invading Russian forces. Modern tanks tend to be made from lightweight ceramic alternatives to steel, which make them easier to manoeuvre but are now vulnerable to a targeted attack from above as the turrets atop the tank are weaker. In November the Russian military posted a YouTube video capturing the slow-motion moment a PTKM-1R struck an unmanned tank. It remains unknown if the mines have successfully taken out any Ukrainian tanks at this point. Russia's use of land mines in the occupied country has become notorious since the invasion began in February. Evacuation routes for Ukrainian civilians have been covered with the explosives in an attempt to drive them to Russia or Belarus instead, in a move described as ""cynical beyond belief"" by Europe Minister James Cleverly. President Volodymyr Zelensky has also accused Russian soldiers of leaving active mines on the bodies of the dead.",49,5.287413907688252,3.977750812433417,1.3096630952548347,26

Each year Russia celebrates its triumph over Nazi Germany in 1945 at the end of the Second World War on May 9, and this year it has extra significance. Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what he called a “special operation to de-Nazify” the country and it was widely expected that he wanted to use this year’s celebrations in May to announce a success in that mission. But with Russia having faced stiff resistance from Ukrainians the invasion has not gone to plan and they have been forced to concentrate their attacks on the east of Ukraine having failed to topple Kyiv. This year considerable effort has been put into the victory parade with regular rehearsals using heavy military being taken through the streets of Moscow and St Petersburg in an intended show of strength. State media has been showing the military convoys and on Thursday night there were vast numbers of soldiers marching through Palace Square. It comes as UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said that he would not be surprised if Putin now instead uses the May Day parade to declare a war on the West. Russia’s defence ministry published an interactive map on Friday of the parade which showed 33 marching columns of Russian troops, cadets and members of security agencies, reported the Moscow Times. Armaments on display included T-14 tanks, S-400 air defence systems, rocket launchers and infantry fighting vehicles. The air division showed off 77 aircraft including Tu-22M3 long-range bombers, Su-57 stealth fighters as well as attack and transport helicopters. There are expected to be further rehearsals on May 4 and 7 before the big day for Putin’s regime. This year with Russia facing global isolation, there have been no foreign dignitaries invited. Mr Wallace has said that Putin may declare a war on the West and start “mass” mobilisation of Russians to fight in Ukraine, during the May Day celebrations. He told LBC : “I would not be surprised . . . that he is probably going to declare on May Day that ‘we are now at war with the world’s Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people’.” He continued: “Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he's got . . . and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country.

""Russia hopes to rectify issues that have previously constrained its invasion by geographically concentrating combat power, shortening supply lines and simplifying command and control,"" it said.

The team will arrive in Poland next month and support the Ukrainian government as the West builds a case to prosecute Vladimir Putin and his generals in the International Criminal Court. They will include experts in conflict-related sexual violence, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who travelled to the court in The Hague for talks today with its President, said the west must “call out rape as a weapon in war - it’s done to subjugate women, to destroy communities, and we want to see it stopped.” She added: ""We’ve seen appalling war crimes committed, the use of rape and sexual violence. ""We will be sending in a British evidence-collecting team working with Ukrainian authorities, working with the ICC.” It’s understood only four to six experts will be sent at first but more could follow. Officials could not say when or whether they would move on from Poland to Ukraine, for security reasons. Ms Truss rebuffed calls for an additional Nuremberg-style tribunal as called for by many campaigners, saying it might distract from core work. It comes two weeks after Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine were declared war crimes in an interim report ordered by 45 countries. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) said Russia’s attack that killed 300 people sheltering in the Mariupol Theatre was “most likely… an egregious violation” of humanitarian law and “those who ordered or executed it committed a war crime”. It also dismissed Russia 's claims that its attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol was “fake news”, saying the attack “must have been deliberate”. The Foreign Office today said the report “found credible evidence of torture, rape, the killing of civilians and the forced deportation of more than half a million people in Ukraine.” The report only covered up to April 1 so excluded the mass graves discovered in Bucha, an atrocity Boris Johnson said “doesn’t look far short of genocide”. Yesterday Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence issued photos of the ‘despicable ten’ Russian soldiers it accused of taking part in the Bucha massacre. Ukraine today accepted it was taking heavy losses in Russia’s attack on the east of the country - but insisted Russia’s losses were worse. US President Joe Biden called on Congress to send as much as $33bn to help Kyiv withstand the attack. Russia fired two missiles at the capital Kyiv during a visit on Thursday by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres - which Ukraine called an attack on the United Nations itself. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace yesterday warned Putin could declare a new ""war"" on the western world as part of a May 9 Victory Day next week. Mr Wallace told LBC Radio: “I would not be surprised and I don't have any information about this, that he is probably going to declare on this May day that we're now at war with the world's Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people. “Which is actually a pathetic attempt to cover the fact that actually his generals have sent thousands of men to their deaths because of their incompetence and arrogance and his ego.” The Russian President has described his enemies as the West as Nazis. Mr Wallace insisted he was not “rattled” and the “deluded” Russian leader was “outgunned and outnumbered” by Nato forces. He added Britain was doing everything it could to avert a third world war, saying: “I mean, the sabre-rattling is actually quite consistent. “He might use different words, but he's been banging on like that for a good few weeks now. “I think that's what he's teeing up because actually, to mass mobilise the Russian reserves is an admission of failure, you know, from a man who thought he'd get Ukraine in a couple of days. “So he's going to try and link it, I think, with the Second World War.”",45,4.730354692164938,4.111801309055692,0.618553383109246,14

A desperate battle has been raging for weeks in the strategic southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol where fighters are refusing to surrender and Russian shells have reduced it to ruins. While Russia has claimed most of the city, Ukrainians are still holding onto the massive Azovstal steelworks. Now a video has been shared by the far-right Azov Brigade believed to be from a military field hospital inside the steel plant after a further Russian bombardment. Haunting images show scared people sheltering in darkness following the blast with the room lit up by a red light. Someone attempts to pour water on an injured person while another can be seen digging through rubble. There are believed to have been 600 people injured from the attack including children and elderly people while medical supplies have run out. Major Serhiy Volyna, commander of the 36th Brigade of the Ukrainian Army, said that the hospital had received a direct hit. The Ukraine marines commander told Sky News : ""The situation is difficult. About 600 people have wounds of different degrees of gravity. We have wounded civilians, 100 of them .... more than 50 children and elderly people. As for medical support, it is absent. Last night, there was a direct hit by an aerial bomb on the shelter of the military hospital. ""I can say that the city is beyond the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe. It has been totally erased from the face of the earth. The Ukrainian garrison of Mariupol is holding defence lines at the Azovstal works and on the approaches to it. The rest of the territory is controlled by Russian troops."" He said that there had been continual strikes on the steel works and that tanks and other firearms have been hitting residential buildings from point blank range. Major Volyna said: ""The operation room was completely destroyed, just field conditions, we can no longer operate on the wounded. The situation is critical. Medical support is absent. The conditions in which servicemen and civilians, children and the elderly are trying to survive are simply horrible."" It comes as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres met with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv where they focused in part on evacuating Ukrainian fighters and civilians holed up inside the steel plant. Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed in principle to UN and Red Cross involvement in evacuating the plant during separate talks in Moscow with Guterres on Tuesday. Ukrainian officials worry Russia wants to capture those trapped inside, an allegation Moscow denies. The West believes battles for Mariupol and other eastern and southern areas may determine the war's outcome. Russian forces are now entrenched in the east, where Moscow-backed separatists have held some territory since 2014, and also hold a swathe of the south they seized in March.

Mr Wallace said the ""show of solidarity and strength"" will see UK service personnel joining with NATO allies and those from the Joint Expeditionary Force alliance, which includes Finland and Sweden, for the exercises. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the action had been long planned, but that it had been enhanced since Russia invaded its neighbour in late February. Aircraft, tanks, artillery and armoured assault vehicles will join the exercises across Europe, with the UK deployment expected to build to a peak of around 8,000 personnel operating between April and June. Commander Field Army Lieutenant General Ralph Wooddisse said: ""The UK makes a significant contribution to the defence of Europe and the deterrence of Russian aggression.

Troops from the Queen's Royal Hussars have been deployed for embedding in an armoured brigade in Finland, which shares an 830 mile land border with Russia. Exercises alongside American troops are also taking place in Poland. Mr Wallace said: ""The security of Europe has never been more important.

Figures from the Russian army and FSB security service have reportedly been strongly critical of the way Putin has handled the invasion so far, amid a vicious “blame game” in Moscow. The hardliners however, don’t think Putin has gone too far, but have been left furious he has not gone far enough in the ongoing war. The powerful ‘soloviki’, the security bloc comprised of often conservative and ex-KGB individuals, were previously described by Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of political analysts R.Politik as people who ""dominate the agenda, fuel Putin’s anxieties and provoke and escalate tension"". And now, according to a new report, they blame Putin for the “serious error” of retreating from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, instead of storming it. As well as that, they are reportedly enraged by his decision to concentrate on a more limited war, focusing on the Donbas, instead of the entirety of Ukraine. The internal challenges and divisions over demands for “all-out war” are significant according to Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov because they are the first time the ‘strongmen’ of Russia are putting distance between themselves and the President. In an article with investigative journalist Irina Borogan for The Center for European Policy Analysis, he said: “Does it matter? It matters a lot. This is the very first time the soloviki are putting distance between themselves and the president. Which opens up all sorts of possibilities”. The Soldatov and Borogan report added: ""Russia’s military believes that limiting the war’s initial goals is a serious error. They now argue that Russia is not fighting Ukraine, but NATO. ""Senior officers have therefore concluded that the Western alliance is fighting all out - through the supply of increasingly sophisticated weaponry - while its own forces operate under peacetime constraints like a bar on airstrikes against some key areas of Ukraine’s infrastructure. ""In short, the military now demands all-out war, including mobilisation” and they claimed that this “frustration” with Putin was “becoming so intense” it was spilling out. The report also said that the FSB is united with the hardliners within the military. This is despite the fact that the head of the Fifth service of the counterintelligence service, Sergei Beseda, is behind bars in a Lefortovo prison in Moscow, under a false name, blamed for faulty intelligence on Ukraine. This comes as veteran Russian Spetsnaz officer turned blogger, Alexander Arutyunov, went viral on pro-military groups with a video demanding a massive escalation of Moscow's forces. He said: ""Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich, please decide, are we fighting a war - or are we pleasuring ourselves?” “Strike them all over, completely destroy all their aerodromes.

This is beyond me.” Major General Rustam Minnekayev, the deputy commander of the Russian central military district, publicly demanded that Russia go further with its war efforts and seize the entire Ukrainian coastline in the Aral and Black seas. “What is absent in all these discussions within the military, public or private, is any criticism of Sergei Shoigu, the Minister of Defence and the public face of the war,” added Soldatov and Borogan. “Somehow Shoigu has succeeded in keeping the respect of the military and redirecting all the anger away from the military. “Privately, the army, and even the secret services, have been heard to blame not only the Fifth Service of the FSB for misinforming the president, but also the president himself for making a bad call on changing the military strategy. “In 2014, when the Russian army swiftly occupied Crimea, the military and the security services were on the same page with Putin – they fully supported his decision to annex Crimea and were enthusiastic about the way it was done. “It is very significantly different in 2022.”",7,4.311469755336181,4.44676115496396,-0.13529139962777936,24
2022-04-28,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-running-out-morning-after-26818211,Ukraine running out of morning-after pill as reports of rape rise amid invasion,"Desperate attempts to get more morning-after pills into Ukraine are underway as reports of rape are on the rise. Around 25,000 packets of the emergency contraception medication have already been shipped into the war-torn country by International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). But volunteers are scrambling to gather more. The Russian invasion has seen local supply chains destroyed, amid an increase in sexual assaults. A hotline for rape and sexual assault victims of Russian troops - set up by Unicef - has received 400 calls in just two weeks between April 1 and April 14. Lyudmyla Denisova, the Ombudsman for Human Rights in Ukraine, said the five psychologists who man the phones ""cannot cope with the load"". Children are among those attacked, while in some cases terrified relatives have been forced to watch as their loved ones are assaulted by armed soldiers. As invading troops withdrew from the areas around Kyiv last month - having failed to take the capital - they left a trail of devastation. This included alleged evidence of mass atrocities in towns and villages under siege. Piles of murdered civilians are said to have been found in graves or strewn in the streets, while others have spoken of sex attacks. In Bucha, 25 victims aged 14 to 25 were ‘systematically’ raped while being held captive in a basement. Nine are now pregnant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there had been hundreds of rapes recorded, including of a baby. Russia has denied using rape as a weapon of war. Julie Taft, of IPPF, told the Guardian : ""The timeframe for treating victims of sexual violence is really essential. ""If a woman is seen within five days of an event, then that medication should automatically be given to her."" Taft said the IPPF was also sending medical abortion pills, which can be used up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Joel Mitchell from Paracrew, a humanitarian aid organisation delivering food and medical equipment to Ukraine, told the newspaper the issue mostly affects hospitals in the east, such as Kharkiv and Mariupol. He said: ""As soon as we made contact with hospitals in those regions, we had standing orders for that medication."" It's not clear how many of those receiving such medications are victims of sexual assaults. However, Paracrew volunteer told the Guardian while delivering to a hospital in a town north of Kyiv staff told him there were several rape victims being treated. Meanwhile, postmortem examinations on bodies in mass graves also around Kyiv showed evidence that some women had been raped before being killed by Russian forces, according to reports. Referring to the rape helpline, Ms Denisova told the Daily Mail : ""I asked Unicef to almost double the number of psychologists, to ensure that the care is of good quality and that there is no burnout, including those psychologists who receive such appeals day and night. ""And these cases are very terrible.""",45,5.1618266302626425,4.901675210413527,0.26015141984911594,14

Today the Ukrainian Government has published photos and named soldiers they have described as the ""despicable ten"". The Ministry claims that they are part of the 64th brigade, which was honoured by Vladimir Putin for the part it played in Bucha. After Russian troops pulled out of Bucha more than 410 corpses were discovered of civilians, many of them with their hands tied and executed with a bullet to the head. Torture chambers, where men were brutally beaten before being killed, were also discovered, along with the bodies of women and children. The remains have been removed from the town and are being examined by forensic experts preparing to present evidence in future war crimes trials. ""The despicable 10,"" the Ministry of Defence tweeted this afternoon. ""Ten Russian butchers from the 64th brigade have been identified and named suspects responsible for committing Bucha Massacre. ""This unit had been awarded for its atrocities, and returned to the battlefield. Justice for war criminals is inevitable."" Earlier this month Putin awarded an honorary title to the brigade widely thought to be responsible for war crimes and mass killings in Ukraine. Citing “mass heroism and valour” but making no mention of Russia's war in Ukraine, Putin signed a decree honouring the 64th Motorised Infantry Brigade. He did so as a mass funeral for those slaughtered in the Kyiv Oblast town was held by Andrii Holovine, priest of the Church of St. Andrew Pervozvannoho. He had previously said the bodies had been moved to a burial site out of town after reports that the rotten corpses were being feasted upon by dogs in apocalyptic scenes. Last week the Government announced new sanctions against Putin's ""war leaders"", as the Foreign Secretary vowed to crack down on those with ""Ukrainian blood on their hands"". The move will target those ""commanding the front line"" to commit ""heinous"" acts in Ukraine, according to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). The UK is also taking action against individuals outside Putin's military, who are ""actively supporting his illegal invasion"". Meanwhile, the Department for International Trade said the Government has banned imports of caviar and other high-end products from Russia. The import ban is being extended to cover silver and wood products while tariffs on imports of diamonds and rubber from Russia and Belarus are being increased by 35 percentage points. The ""key leaders in Russia's army"" targeted as part of the new wave of sanctions include Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, a commanding officer with involvement in the Bucha massacre, the FCDO said. Also sanctioned by the UK are Colonel General Andrey Serdyukov, commander of airborne forces; Major General Valery Flyustikov, commander of special operations forces; and Colonel General Nikolay Bogdanovsky, first deputy chief of the general staff. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted: ""Today I announce new sanctions on those with Ukrainian blood on their hands including the commander of the unit which occupied Bucha and other individuals and businesses supporting Putin's military. ""We are relentless in support of Ukraine."" The Foreign Secretary accused Russia of deliberately going after civilian targets as she condemned the invasion. ""The depravity of Russia's assault on the people of Ukraine is plain for all to see,"" Ms Truss said. ""They are deliberately targeting hospitals, schools and transport hubs in Mariupol and beyond - just as they did in Chechnya and Syria."" In a statement the FCDO said: ""Since March 10, 2022, Russian bombers have repeatedly dropped munitions on civilian infrastructure, including civil government buildings, hospitals, schools and transportation nodes. ""The UK Government conclusion is that this is intentional targeting based on the types of civilian targets struck, frequency of strikes, volume of munitions and the repeated targeting of the same locations on consecutive days.""",45,4.332560600562097,4.982229918507838,-0.6496693179457411,19

One of the missiles struck the lower floors of a residential building, injuring at least three people, Ukrainian officials said. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said the blasts had hit a central part of the city and three people were taken to hospital. Svetlana Vodolaga, press secretary of the State Emergency Service, said the other missile had hit an unnamed facility near the residential building. Both Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said these were Russian missiles. Eyewitnesses had earlier reported the sound of two blasts. Today, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in Kyiv visiting sites that had been destroyed in the conflict. He later gave a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior aide to Zelensky, tweeted: ""Missile strikes in the downtown of Kyiv during the official visit of @antonioguterres. ""The day before he was sitting at a long table in the Kremlin, and today explosions are above his head."" Speaking today, Mr Guterres said it was imperative to save those from the ""apocalypse"" in Mariupol. He said: ""As we keep pushing for a full-scale ceasefire, we will also keep striving for immediate practical steps to save lives and reduce human suffering. ""Effective humanitarian corridors. Local cessations of hostilities. Safe passage for civilian and supply routes. ""Today, the people of Mariupol are in desperate need for just such an approach. Mariupol is a crisis within a crisis. ""Thousands of civilians need life-saving assistance. Many are elderly, in need of medical care or have limited mobility. ""They need an escape route out of the apocalypse."" Earlier today, Mr Guterres was seen walking around Kyiv and later shared an image on Twitter with the caption: ""War is evil"". Mr Guterres' visit to Kyiv comes after he sat face to face with Putin in Moscow. Mr Guterres said they discussed ways to provide humanitarian assistance and evacuation of civilians from conflict zones, specifically Mariupol. Mr Guterres also spoke with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about finding ways to come to a ceasefire. He later told reporters it was ""clear that there are two different positions on what is happening in Ukraine"".",47,4.656327458325912,5.3909927242955105,-0.734665265969598,21

The teenager, from Bucha, plans to keep the child after doctors warned if she had an abortion now she may not be able to have children again, the report said. Her story has been told by psychologist Oleksandra Kvitko, who workson the ombudswoman's hotline for psychological assistance, with the consent of the victim's parents. The psychologist is said to be working with the young girl to learn how to accept her child. Kvitko now works with five girls between the ages 14-18 who allegedly became pregnant after being raped by Russian soldiers. The youngest victim she works with is only 10. Kvitko told Radio Svoboda : ""Girls aged 14, 15, 16 are often raped. After the war, there will be many pregnant teenagers in Ukraine"". Victims include women, men and young children. The ombudswoman's hotline had allegedly received reports of 101 cases of sexual crimes in the Ukrainian territories recently liberated from Russian aggressors, in figures given as of April 25. Ombudswoman Lyudmila Denisova told Radio Svoboda that 12 cases of forced pregnancy have been reported so far but she believes there are more unreported. Oleksandra Matviychuk, chairwoman of the Civil Liberties Center, tweeted on April 13: ""Ukrainian women who were raped by Russians and left to Poland cannot have abortions there. ""Under Polish law, abortion is allowed in case of rape, but there is no criminal case yet Psychologists in Poland are convincing her that a new life is wonderful. They destroys lives of both."" She added: ""We talked to our colleagues in Poland.

Vladimir Putin's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said strikes could be authorised against NATO member countries' military targets. She said: ""Do we understand correctly that for the sake of disrupting the logistics of military supplies, Russia can strike military targets on the territory of those Nato countries that supply arms to the Kyiv regime?"" ""After all, this directly leads to deaths and bloodshed on Ukrainian territory. As far as I understand, Britain is one of those countries.” On Wednesday Putin also seemed to hint at a possible nuclear attack, telling assembled Russian lawmakers: ""If someone intends to interfere in what is going on from the outside they must know that constitutes an unacceptable strategic threat to Russia. ""They must know that our response to counter strikes will be lightning fast. Fast."" He went on: ""We have all the weapons we need for this. No one else can brag about these weapons, and we won't brag about them. But we will use them."" It comes after Russia also warned NATO weapons were a ""legitimate"" target in Ukraine - and that British diplomats in Kyiv could be targeted. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said ""nuclear"" action was a ""real"" danger, adding the risk of World War 3 was now ""considerable"". In a wide-ranging interview broadcast on state television, Lavrov also said that the core of any agreement to end the conflict in Ukraine would depend largely on the military situation on the ground. The Putin loyalist had been asked about the importance of avoiding World War Three and whether the current situation was comparable to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, a low point in U.S-Soviet relations. Lavrov said, was doing a lot to uphold the principle of striving to prevent nuclear war at all costs. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that."" “Everyone is reciting incantations that in no case can we allow World War Three,” said the"" the hardline foreign minister added on Bolshaya Igra (Big Game) programme on state-run Channel 1 television. “The threat is serious, it is real, and it should not be underestimated.” It comes after 'Putin's voice' on Russian state TV threatened to 'wipe Britain off the map' with President Vladimir Putin’s new 'big beast' hypersonic 208-ton 15,880mph 'Satan-2' intercontinental ballistic missile. The first regiment to deploy the new 'unstoppable' missile will be in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia and they are to go into use this year. ""As it turned out, one Sarmat means minus one Great Britain,"" said pro-Putin TV anchor Vladimir Solovyov, threatening the UK in a crude remark to viewers. The threat was because the British had got ""totally boorish,"" the popular host - known as 'Putin's voice' - said, seemingly referring to the UK's ongoing support for Ukraine. Russia's two-month-old invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble and forced over 5 million people to flee abroad. Moscow calls its actions a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists - a claim that has been widely and consistently refuted by the Ukraine and its allies. Lavrov, defending Moscow's actions, also blamed Washington for the lack of dialogue. ""The United States has practically ceased all contacts simply because we were obliged to defend Russians in Ukraine,"" Lavrov said, repeating the rationale for Moscow's invasion of its southern neighbour. But he said Western supplies of sophisticated weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles and advanced drones were provocative measures calculated to prolong the conflict rather than bring it to an end. ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia's military acting within the context of the special operation,"" Lavrov said. ""Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?"" he added. ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.""",49,3.9147579731563233,2.9840511136435395,0.9307068595127839,12

It has dealt a huge blow to Vladimir Putin who lost his 35th colonel in Moscow last week during the Ukraine war. Col Mikhail Nagamov, 41, from the sixth engineer-sapper regiment from the Yaroslavl region, died on April 13 ""while performing a combat mission"" in Ukraine. American officials said the US helped Ukraine target Russian forces by sharing intelligence on when missiles and bombs were intended to strike. ""From the get-go, we leaned pretty heavily forward in sharing both strategic and actionable intelligence with Ukraine. ""It’s been impactful both at a tactical and strategic level. There are examples where you could tell a pretty clear story that this made a major difference,"" one official told NBC News. The agreement was part of a huge, unprecedented intelligence sharing operation with a non-NATO partner. US officials say it has played a crucial role in Ukraine's success so far against a larger and better-equipped Russian military. More than 20,000 troops have already lost their lives to Putin's invasion, according to estimates. Major General Vladimir Frolov, deputy commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army, became the latest general to be laid to rest earlier in another major blow to his war effort. “There has been a lot of real-time intelligence shared in terms of things that could be used for specific targeting of Russian forces,” an ex senior intelligence official told NBC. This includes commercial satellite images and other intelligence such as where certain types of Russian units are active, they added. The publication has agreed to hold back some details about the operation at the request of the US military amid concerns it could help Russia close down important sources of information. Officials said fighters in Ukraine were able to hit a Russian transport plane near Kyiv thanks to coordinates supplied by the US. The strike proved crucial in the battle for the capital as it weakened Putin's troops who were forced to use the road instead of the airfield. Another official told of certain instances where Ukraine was able to move aircraft and air defences just in time. ""The Russian military has literally been cratering empty fields where air defences were once set up,"" they said adding that this has had an ""enormous"" effect on Russia's ground troops. While another claimed that the CIA aims to help protect Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky and is in communication with the country on ""how best to move him around."" The intelligence gathering mission also aims to consult with Ukraine in order to make sure Zelensky is ""not co-located with his entire chain of command, things like that"", the source added.",7,3.783091977100584,3.155966520667292,0.627125456433292,12

Kyiv was heavily pumelled by Russian shellings during the early stages of the invasion with images showing people huddled in metro systems, while millions of people have fled the country. But ferocious defending of the capital by Ukrainians prevented a quick victory for Vladimir Putin ’s forces as they tried to encircle Kyiv. And at the start of April, Russian troops began to withdraw from northern areas of Ukraine, in what appears to have been a regrouping, before their new attack on the east of the country. With the intensity of bombing having eased on Kyiv, people have been heading back outside to enjoy the spring weather. Parents could be seen in parks and play areas with children in very different scenes to only just a few weeks ago. At the same time foreign leaders have also been to Kyiv to show their support for the country and the relatively reduced threat of shelling. Ukrainian authorities on Tuesday dismantled a huge Soviet-era monument in the centre of Kyiv meant to symbolise friendship between Russia and Ukraine, a response to Moscow's invasion, according to the city's mayor. The eight-metre (27-ft) bronze statue depicted a Ukrainian and Russian worker on a plinth, holding aloft together a Soviet order of friendship. The statue was located underneath a giant titanium 'People's Friendship Arch', erected in 1982 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Soviet Union. ""We now see what this ""friendship"" is - destruction of Ukrainian cities ... killing tens of thousands of peaceful people. I am convinced such a monument has an entirely different meaning now,"" Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said. Workmen started by removing one of the two bronze heads, which fell to the ground with a hollow clang. As a crane lifted the monument off its moorings and gradually lowered it to the ground, a crowd of around 100 people cheered and shouted ""Glory to Ukraine"" and other slogans. ""Russia invaded Ukraine ... Can we be friends with Russia? What do you think? This is our worst enemy, that is why the monument to Russian-Ukrainian friendship doesn't make sense any more,"" said Serhiy Myrhorodsky, one of the designers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, launched on Feb. 24, has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced more than 5 million people to flee abroad.

2022-04-26,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/uk-backs-ukraine-striking-targets-26798787,UK backs Ukraine striking targets on Russian soil - using British weapons,"Britain today backed Ukraine if it wants to attack targets on Russian soil. Defence minister James Heappey said it is “entirely legitimate” for Kyiv’s forces to use western-supplied weapons to launch strikes over the border. It comes after a large fire erupted in the early hours yesterday at an oil storage facility in the city of Bryansk, 100 miles into Russia over the Ukrainian border. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed the risk of a third world war was “considerable”, saying according to his ministry: “I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it. ""NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" Mr Heappey told the BBC that claim was “nonsense and Lavrov knows it”, as weapons have been donated directly by western countries and not by NATO itself. Yesterday Britain announced it will send Stormer armoured vehicles equipped with anti-aircraft rocket launchers to Ukraine . To date the UK has provided more than 5,000 anti tank missiles, five air defence systems with more than 100 missiles, 1,360 anti-structural munitions, and 4.5 tonnes of plastic explosives. Britain has also sent over 90,000 ration packs, 10 pallets of medical equipment, 3,000 pieces of body armour, 77,000 helmets and 3,000 pairs of boots. Asked if the UK would support Ukraine striking targets on Russian soil, Mr Heappey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The question is, is it acceptable for our weapons systems to be used against legitimate Russian military targets by the Ukrainians… “It is entirely legitimate to go after military targets in the depth of your opponents to disrupt their logistics and supply lines. “Just as, to be frank, providing the Russians don’t target civilians which unfortunately they’ve not taken too much regard for thus far, it’s perfectly legitimate for them to be striking targets in Western Ukraine to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines. “That is very much a part of war and the Russians and Ukrainians are quite legitimate in going after those targets.” He also told Times Radio “of course” Britain supports Ukraine hitting targets on Russian soil. He said: “The fact is that Ukraine was a sovereign country that was living peacefully within its owner borders and then another country decided to violate those borders and bring 130,000 troops across into their country. ""That started a war between Ukraine and Russia, and in war Ukraine needs to strike into its opponents depth to attack its logistics lines, its fuel supplies, its ammunition depots, and that's part of it."" He added that it is ""completely legitimate for Ukraine to be targeting in Russia's depth in order to disrupt the logistics that if they weren't disrupted would directly contribute to death and carnage on Ukrainian soil"". He said it is ""not necessarily a problem"" if British-donated weapons are used to hit sites on Russian soil after accepting that weapons now being supplied by allies to Ukraine have the range to be used over borders. ""There are lots of countries around the world that operate kit that they have imported from other countries, when those bits of kit are used we tend not to blame (the country) that manufactured it, you blame the country that fired it.""",49,3.885952567674179,3.2773086801933697,0.6086438874808091,7

Despite relentless ground and air assaults from the Russian forces, the Ukrainian troops stuck inside the Azovstal steel plant are refusing to surrender. With many of the fearsome Azov Battalion among their number, what's left of the Ukrainian army in the southern port city has managed to launch counteroffensives against the Russians and hold their defensive line despite the overwhelming odds against them. It is unclear how many civilians and soldiers remain alive and within the steel plant, which is owned by the country's richest man Rinat Akhmetov. According to Major Serhiy Volyna of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, who is in Azovstal, 500 soldiers are wounded. He said the situation inside had quickly become ""critical"" and ""tragic"", and many of the wounded were being left to ""rot"" in the basement as supplies of medicine run out. Another army officer, speaking to the New York Times, painted a similarly bleak picture. ""They're taking colossal losses. they won't say how many people are left alive, but they do have more than 500 wounded,"" reporter Michael Shwirtz said. ""One of the troops took a short video of their clinic. It's a gruesome scene with a lot of troops in there with absolutely ghastly injuries. ""They don't have medicines, they're running low on anaesthesia. ""They're having to conduct amputations in really disastrous conditions. It is pretty grim inside. ""They say they want the outside world to help, but there is an acknowledgement there is very little that can be done."" Russian forces attempted to storm the steel plant on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite President Vladimir Putin claiming the complex did not need to be taken last week. Ukraine's armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russians were firing and performing ""offensive operations"" in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting air strikes on civilian infrastructure. Konstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognised as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet TASS on Sunday. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych wrote on Facebook that ""Russian troops are trying to finish off the defenders of Azovstal and more than 1,000 civilians who are hiding at the plant"". Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, with many pro-Russian supporters of the war claiming that troops stuck inside the plant are using human shields. Ukrainian officials have denied Russian claims that a safe route out of the steelworks has been provided. If the defending forces were to surrender, they would be taken as prisoners of war, Russia has claimed. It is unclear what would happen to the civilians stuck inside. Video taken from inside the factory by the Azov Battalion shows a number of children hidden several stories underground. The basement room is filled with the belongings of those living there, who are wrapped in several layers of clothes to keep the cold out. The steel plant has been under constant bombardment for weeks, with Russian ships hammering it with shells from the Azov Sea. Drone footage released at the end of last week shows how badly damaged the vast complex has become. Smoke can be seen rising from the metal work's towers while the shells of gutted out buildings stand in ruin and rubble. Russia’s defence ministry had said on Monday that it would open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the huge Azovstal steel plant where they are holed up with Ukrainian fighters and are under Russian attack. In response on Monday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “Today, the Russian side once again announced the existence of a corridor for civilians to leave Azovstal. This could be believed if the Russians had not destroyed humanitarian corridors many times before. “It is important to understand that a humanitarian corridor opens by the agreement of both sides. A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor.” Separately, Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian forces were continuing to attack the steelworks on Monday. “The enemy continues to attack our defences in the area of the Azovstal plant, using aircraft, artillery … firing with tanks and trying to advance with assault groups, violating the order of their own supreme commander,” Arestovych said in a video address.",47,4.769231295990292,3.528186988056102,1.2410443079341902,9

He does not want to preserve. He must not be allowed to prevail."" No10 earlier stressed Britain's objective was not regime change in Russia. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey criticised the standard of weapons offered so far. The Labour opposition member said: “What is needed now is no longer old spare weapons from the Soviet era, but new Nato weapons that Ukraine will need for Putin’s next offensive against Odesa or Kyiv.” Mr Wallace said to date more than 2,000 Russian armoured vehicles have been destroyed or captured in Putin's botched initial invasion. This includes at least 530 tanks, 530 armoured personnel carriers and 560 infantry fighter vehicles, as well as more than 60 helicopters and fighter jets, he said. ""The offensive that was supposed to take a maximum of a week has now taken weeks,"" he added. He confirmed British Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles have now been used in the field for three weeks. Mr Wallace reiterated Russia has so far ""failed in nearly every one of its objectives”. He said: ""In recognition of this failure the Russian high command has regrouped, reinforced and changed focus to securing Donetsk and Luhansk oblast."" He added: ""At the start of this conflict Russia had committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65% of its entire ground combat strength. ""As of now we assess around over 25% of these have been rendered not combat effective. ""Ukraine is an inspiration to us all. Their brave people have never stopped fighting for their lands. They have endured indiscriminate bombardment, war crimes and overwhelming military aggression but they have stood firm, galvanised the international community and beaten back the army of Russia in the north and the north east. ""We anticipate this next phase of the invasion will be an attempt by Russia to occupy further the Donbas and connect via Mariupol the Crimea so it's urgent that we in the international community ensure Ukraine gets the aid and weapons it so much needs.""",49,3.309453164396539,3.422167517161412,-0.11271435276487285,27
2022-04-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-shells-five-ukraine-train-26790413,Russia shells five train stations in one hour as Putin launches new offensive,"Vladimir Putin has launched a new attack on Ukraine after shelling five train stations in the space of an hour. According to the head of Ukrainian Railways, Alexander Kamyshin, the targets in central and western Ukraine were attacked on Monday morning which had caused 16 passenger trains to be delayed. Mr Kamyshin also added the attacks were all coming within an hour of each other, with footage posted to social media showing black smoke rising from the site. He believes Ukrainian railways are being targeted. “ Russians keep destroying Ukrainian railway infrastructure,” he said. According to Maksym Kozytskyi, head of the Lviv region, a missile hit an electrical substation at around 8.30am local time, he posted on the Telegram messaging app. He said: “There is no information about casualties yet."" A station in Krasne, east of Lviv, is said to be among those hit as further details are to be released. However, the regional Governor of Vinnytsia, in west-central Ukraine, believes an unspecified people had been killed and wounded after strikes at stations in the towns of Zhmerynka and Kozyatyn. Serhiy Borzov said in a video released on Telegram “the enemy is attempting to hit critical infrastructure”. Meanwhile, it is not known yet which towns were targeted with Russia not immediately commenting on the claims. Previously, train stations have been targets during the conflict with a Russian missile strike at a station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk earlier this month killing at least 50 people, including children. The attack happened as women, children and older people were trying to flee the conflict - as a defence expert said the intention may have been to block the movement of military infrastructure. Editor of military news site the UK Defence Journal , George Allison, said in the i : “If the Russians can’t currently muster enough force to capture the city, then it’s in their best interests to prevent the movement of heavy equipment into the city and to prevent a build-up of forces by Ukraine while Russia builds up their own forces in the area.” This comes as Putin on Monday said his main spy agency had foiled what he cast as a Western plot to kill a prominent Russian journalist. ""This morning, the Federal Security Service stopped the activities of a terrorist group that planned to attack and kill one famous Russian TV journalist,"" Putin told prosecutors. ""They have moved to terror - to preparing the murder of our journalists,"" Putin said. He did not provide evidence to support his claims.",47,4.077422363108518,3.4541797900289715,0.6232425730795463,21

Images of the KA-52, also known as the ""Alligator"", as a burnt-out wreck show a dead mouse inside a control module. It has raised questions about sloppy Russian maintenance standards, as Moscow continues to suffer substantial losses to its military hardware. Vladimir Putin's military has reportedly lost roughly 150 helicopters, as well as 171 planes and over 800 tanks. Ukraine’s staunch defence against the invasion has resulted in the deaths of 21,800 Russian fighters, it was claimed last night. As the scale of Russia ’s military losses were laid bare in new figures released by the Ukrainian Land Forces, it emerged that more children were killed in indiscriminate shelling by Putin’s army. Two girls, aged five and 14, died when a residential building in Ocheretynsk, in the Donetsk region, was hit. Their tragic deaths mean 213 children have lost their lives in the conflict, the day after a three-month-old baby died with her young mother and grandmother when their home was hit in a rocket attack in Odesa. A further 389 children have been seriously injured since Putin launched his offensive on February 24. Military incompetence and poor preparation are thought to be hampering Russia’s plans. Troop losses have been put down to poor tactical decisions by Russian leaders and a considerable underestimation of the capabilities of Ukraine ’s armed forces.

The fires come after huge explosions at the Druzhba oil depot in Bryansk city - where a Kremlin military unit is located. The Druzhba pipeline, operated by Transneft, is the world's longest oil pipeline and one of the biggest oil pipeline networks in the world. While just one fire was initially reported, later reports said two Transneft oil facilities were ablaze. One was near a school in the city of Bryansk and the flames can be seen over the entire city. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The Bryansk region borders Ukraine and the city is some 240 miles from Moscow. The oil storage depot is likely to be vital for supplying Russia’s troops in their surge to take control of the Donbas. Residents were being evacuated from homes in the vicinity of the burning oil depot. A fire was also reported at the military site, but was not confirmed by the Russian authorities. Russia’s Emergencies Ministry initially posted details of a fire in the areas of the military facility on Moskovsky Ave - then withdrew it. But Telegram channel Voenny Osvedomitel reported that the second fire was presumably at the 120th arsenal of the Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate. Oil storage tanks caught fire at the oil depot in Bryansk, TASS reported early today. ""The Emergency Situations Ministry has confirmed there’s a fire,"" the government’s press office said. ""There’s also a confirmation that it’s the fuel tanks."" First responders were at the scene. The cause of the fire or fires was not initially confirmed. Reports of the blaze come just days after another huge fire at the Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation in Tver. Footage showed the fire at the building on April 21 as a death toll of up to seven was declared. But more recently it has been claimed at least 25 died, believed to include some of Russia ’s leading missile scientists. Two days after the fire, a search was still underway amid the rubble, it was reported. At least five people were rushed to hospital and administered into intensive care. The huge blaze was at the secret Second Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation in Tver. Some military scientists jumped from upper floors to escape the intense heat and flames. Reports at the time told of “poisonous bluish-black smoke”. The institute is central to the design of Iskander missiles, which have been unleashed in the war in Ukraine, as well as Russia’s S-400 missile defence system. It is involved in other “secret projects”.",47,3.7967041407015536,4.716932278913355,-0.9202281382118018,21

On February 24, Russia’s land army consisted of 280,000 full-time active soldiers compared with Ukraine’s 125,600. But the amount of Russian soldiers needed to seize the whole country and control the entire population would be close to one million, according to Michael Clarke, a visiting professor in King’s College London’s department of war studies. Ahead of an expected visit to the capital Kyiv by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the Department of State spokesperson Ned Price told the BBC : “This is going to be a victory for Ukraine; it is going to be a strategic defeat for Russia.” Despite a hoped-for truce over the weekend for Orthodox Easter celebrations, Russian planes continued to drop bombs on the Azovstal steelworks plant in besiegd Mariupol - where the city’s last Ukrainian defenders are holed-up Although Putin’s forces have been strategically moved away from Mariupol for the new focus on the Donbas, units hunkered down inside tunnels underneath the vast plant are still being targeted. Hundreds of civilians are also trapped inside, and will be starved to death, in a plan announced directly by Putin last week. “Naval artillery and cannons are being used, tanks are firing, and there are infantry attempts to storm,” said Svyatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of the Azov regiment, in a video address sent out from the tunnels. While many Ukrainians across the country were celebrating Easter, in Mariupol “the enemy is dropping bombs on the heads of innocent children”, he added. The Azov regiment, along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers, are now the last Ukrainian defenders left in the strategic city on the Sea of Azov coast. Meanwhile, efforts to help up to 100,000 civilians escape the devastated south-eastern city through a humanitarian corridor collapsed once again, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereschuk said. Earlier, she accused Russia of plotting to run its own parallel pathway out of Mariupol that would have conducted citizens to Russian territory. It comes as Ukraine’s President Volodymr Zelensky said that his country would abandon peace talks with Moscow if Russia kills any of Mariupol’s last defenders. He said the same would apply if it held a staged independence referendum in the occupied city of Kherson, as happened in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. The Ukrainian president praised Britain’s efforts in training his military amid accusations the UK blocked requests to strengthen Kyiv’s defences after Russia’s first strike eight years ago.

Sign up for the free Mirror newsletter He said that the UK, along with the US, was supplying the “biggest military aid” in its struggle against Moscow’s invading forces. In a phone call earlier on Saturday, he personally thanked Boris Johnson for Britain providing training on home soil, with Ukraine’s armed forces being taught how to use armoured vehicles that are being given to boost the war effort in eastern Europe. But a former defence secretary accused previous Downing Street operations of being reluctant to support Kyiv in the aftermath of Russian president Vladimir Putin ’s annexing of Crimea in 2014. Michael Fallon claimed that, when serving under former Conservative prime minister David Cameron, he was told to turn down requests for assistance in upgrading Ukraine’s defences despite the Ministry of Defence wanting “to do more”. “We were stymied and we were blocked in Cabinet from sending the Ukrainians the arms they needed,” Mr Fallon said. “Some in the Cabinet felt extremely strongly that we should do nothing to further provoke Russia. I felt that was absurd. The Russians didn’t need any provoking. They were already there, sending people across the border.” Today Russia’s defence ministry said its high-precision missiles struck nine Ukrainian military targets overnight, including four arms depots in the Kharkiv region where artillery weapons were stored. In an Orthodox Easter message President Zelensky vowed that no “wickedness” will destroy the country and prayed that God returns happiness to children and brings solace to grieving mothers. Standing inside one of the country’s best known landmarks, the 1,000-year-old Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, he declared: “Today, we still believe in the new victory of Ukraine and we are all convinced that we will not be destroyed by any horde or wickedness.

The last big strike on or near Odessa was in early April. ""The only aim of Russian missile strikes on Odessa is terror,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. Russia has denied targeting civilians in its ""special military operation"" that began on February 24. Meanwhile, in Mariupol Russia resumed its assault on the last Ukrainian defenders holed up in a giant steel works, a Ukrainian official said on Saturday. The attack comes just days after Moscow declared victory in the southern port city and said its forces did not need to take the plant. Russian forces were hitting the Azovstal complex with air strikes and trying to storm it, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said, adding ""the enemy is trying to strangle the final resistance of Mariupol's defenders"". The biggest battle of the conflict has raged for weeks as Russia seeks to capture a city seen as vital to its attempts to link the eastern Donbas region with Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow seized in 2014.

The so far unsuccessful war effort has caused appalling losses on Russia’s behalf, with recent claims suggesting Moscow has lost over 30,000 troops since February 24. Since the invasion began, it was reported that Putin has been told there have been 23,655 deaths among troops, and a further 6,902 mercenaries having died. Russia has not come clean on the scale of its war losses, and has hidden the return to the motherland of coffins and funerals. Whilst it began an official death count early on in the invasion, it quickly ended this after a few days. Online source General SVR today claimed that Putin has been told of a total of 30,557 deaths among the armed forces and privately-hired combatants. This claim could not be verified but a number of other estimates put Russia’s death toll at well over 20,000 people. One example of how Moscow avoids confronting the number of dead publicly is its failure to ever confirm how many died on the sinking of the Moskva, its Black Sea Fleet flagship. As the body’s pile up for Russia, the elite of its fighting force continue to be picked off in fighting, amidst reports Ukraine has been targeting majors, generals and other senior staff. A number of elite paratroopers appeared to be buried at a graveyard in the Tver region. As well as that, there are also new graves at a burial site called the Alley of the Paratroopers, in the Stavropol region. At least some of the dead are GRU military intelligence special forces officers, indicated by the flag with a bat and parachute prominently displayed. It reportedly belongs to the 10th Separate Order of Zhukov Special Purpose Brigade. On top of this, the Kremlin has lost eight generals and 35 colonels as its war effort has struggled so far. Among the most recently buried graveyards, flags beside the dead show that those who are dead are among Russia’s most elite and highly trained paratroopers and special forces. GRU Spetnaz officer Major Sergey Kashanskiy, 32, from Siberia, was killed in the ongoing fighting in Ukraine and is one of the latest high-ranking military men Russia has lost. Governor of Krasnoyarsk region Alexander Uss offered his “deepest condolences” to the family. Alongside him two other majors died, adding another blow to Putin’s war effort. Major Sergei Averyanov, 36, commander of an engineering battalion, was announced dead today by Ukraine and this was confirmed by the officer’s relatives in Russia. A VW-fanatic, he had served two tours of duty in Syria before dying in Ukraine. Major Alexander Shepel, 35, battalion commander of the second motorised rifles, was blown up by an anti-tank mine, according to reports. A memorial to him said: “You are our hero, we will not forget. We will not forgive, we love, we mourn ...

After moving some troops away from Mariupol - where hundreds of Ukrainian marines are bunkered down in a defiant last stand - the Russian leader is said to be focused on taking total control of the Donbas. The reports come after a senior Ukrainian official said Russian troops were massing in the self-declared republic of Transnistria and preparing to carry out ""provocations"" along the border. Ukraine fears Russian troops in Transnistria - believed to number around 1,300 - could open another front in the war. It comes after Putin savagely ordered his army to seal off all routes out of the vast Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol “so that even a fly cannot pass through”, effectively condemning those inside to their deaths. In a new interview, Captain Svyatoslav Palamar from the Azov Battalion holed up in deep tunnels in the plant insisted: “I always say that as long as we are here, Mariupol remains under control of Ukraine.” He went on: ""All the buildings in the territory of Azovstal are practically destroyed. They drop heavy bombs, bunker-busting bombs which cause huge destruction. We have wounded and dead inside the bunkers. Some civilians remain trapped under the collapsed buildings."" Mariupol's mayor says there are still 100,000 people stuck in the shattered city and their lives are in Putin's hands. Today a photographer who visited Mariupol this week revealed how dead bodies are being “chucked” into craters left by Russian airstrikes. Describing the scenes in the devastated city, Max Clarke said: ""It just keeps getting worse. ""When I first described the situation on the ground, there were bodies in impromptu graves but towards the end there were bodies chucked in craters left by airstrikes. ""I saw one which had 15 bodies chucked in."" Photographs taken today showed members of the Chechen special forces, and Russia's State Duma member Adam Delimkhanov, walking near the Azovstal steelworks. Meanwhile the World Bank has estimated that the physical damage to Ukraine's buildings and infrastructure from Russia's invasion has reached roughly £46bn. According to an official statement from the Kremlin, Russia is now also focusing on securing a land bridge between Ukraine and Crimea, which it seized in 2014. Tonight it emerged that Russian forces took 40 villages in east Ukraine on Thursday. A hospital was hit in the town of Lyman, north-east of Slovyansk, which had been targeted by Russian artillery and rockets overnight. But Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky says these and other gains are only temporary. After a series of catastrophic defeats, British military intelligence has revealed that the Russian military has now resorted to returning inoperable equipment back to base for repair. Ukraine says it remains hopeful for peace despite Russia rejecting a proposed truce this weekend over the Orthodox Christian Easter period.

The Ukrainian Ground Forces' 30th Mechanized Brigade, named after Prince Konstanty Ostrogski, said yesterday: ""On Maundy Thursday we skilfully cleaned Ukraine of the occupiers."" Orthodox Easter takes place this weekend with Good Friday celebrated on April 22 and Easter Sunday taking place on April 24. In the footage, a Ukrainian drone apparently locates a hidden Russian base with armoured vehicles and crates of ammo in the forest. Ukrainian defenders blast the target and a series of explosions is seen in the tree line as ammo is reportedly detonated by the flames. According to the Ukrainian military, the footage was shot by a drone after it had been used for reconnaissance operations in the area. Earlier this week, the Ukrainian military said that the 30th Mechanized Brigade had attacked a Russian convoy of trucks delivering supplies to invading troops. After the Russian convoy was destroyed in the attack, the Ukrainian brigade said ammo detonated inside the burning vehicles. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin called a ""special military operation"". Today marks the 58th day of the invasion. From February 24 to April 22, the total combat losses of Russian troops stand at 21,200 personnel, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 838 battle tanks, 2,162 combat armoured vehicles, 397 artillery systems, 138 MLR systems, 69 anti-aircraft systems, 176 warplanes, 153 helicopters, 1,523 vehicles, 8 vessels, 76 fuel tank trucks, 172 operational-tactical level UAVs, 27 units of special equipment, and four mobile SRBM systems. The United States has provided a large number of Javelin anti-tank missile systems to Ukraine. Russia has also been hit hard by international sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine, with its tank production chain said to be plagued by supply shortages. Meanwhile, Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the UN, has called for a four-day pause in fighting in Ukraine to mark Orthodox Holy Week and allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid and civilian evacuations. He said: ""Humanitarian needs are dire. People do not have food, water, or supplies to treat the sick or wounded or simply to live day-to-day. ""Inspired by the Holy Week, I urge all parties, and all champions of peace around the world, to join my Easter appeal. ""Save lives.

2022-04-22,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/girl-9-arm-amputated-after-26773477,"Girl, 9, has arm amputated after Russian troops shot her while she ran for cover","A nine-year-old girl was forced to have her arm amputated after she was shot running away from Russian soldiers in Bucha, Ukraine, according to an NGO report into human rights abuses by Vladimir Putin's troops. Human Rights Watch researchers yesterday published an extensive report documenting a catalogue of apparent war crimes committed during the occupation of the city. On March 5, Russian forces shot a nine-year-old girl as she was running from the Kremlin's troops with a man, witnesses told HRW. Neighbours took the girl into the basement of a nearby building to try and treat her wound, but she rapidly deteriorated. Victoria, an emergency nurse who was interviewed by HRW, said when she went to the girl she was near death and her arm tissue was dying. She was taken to the hospital to have her arm amputated. Her identity and current condition are not known. The report makes clear they didn't independently verify Victoria's claim, but two other witnesses interviewed by HRW say they witnessed the shooting and observed a massive bloodstain on the pavement where it happened. It is just one of the series of horrific examples of alleged war crimes committed by Putin's forces in Bucha. Human Rights Watch researchers found a catalogue of apparent war crimes committed during the Russian's occupation of the city when they managed to visit from April 4 to 10. The organisation's extensive report detailed evidence of execution, unlawful killings and torture. Richard Weir, a crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: ""Nearly every corner in Bucha is now a crime scene, and it felt like death was everywhere. ""The evidence indicates that Russian forces occupying Bucha showed contempt and disregard for civilian life and the most fundamental principles of the laws of war.” The Russian Defense Ministry has previously denied allegations that its forces killed civilians in Bucha as the report includes harrowing stories from witnesses contracting their claims. Loved ones who were rounded by Russian forces under the pretence they were ""hunting Nazis"" were later found dead in ""streets, in yards, or in basements"" and with ""signs that they had been tortured"". The report added: ""Ukrainian de-mining authorities said they found victim-activated booby traps placed on at least two dead bodies."" On April 15, Bucha’s chief regional prosecutor said that more than over 600 bodies had been found across the Bucha district, but this figure has not been independently verified. One woman told the HRW how she found her husband's body following an alleged execution by troops. Iryna, 48, was at home with her husband, Oleh Abramova, and her father, Volodymyr, when Russian forces started shooting at their house last month. She said her husband begged the soldiers to stop and insisted they were peaceful civilians. Iryna said told HRW: ""The soldiers accused us of killing people in Donbas. “They concluded that we were guilty and should be punished.” While one soldier questioned Iryna, another took Oleh further away out of view. One soldier then told her that ""Oleh will not return"". Minutes later, Volodymyr and Iryna found Oleh's body. She said: ""I saw that he was lying with his face down, and blood was pumping out of his left ear. “The right side of his face was missing, and brain tissue and blood were coming out of his wound.” She added that she saw soldiers standing nearby “watching the event as if they thought it was theatre.” Oleh's body remained in the courtyard for another two days before they could bury him as Russian forces reportedly spent their time cooking in the same place. Iryna also told the HRW she saw the body of a woman lying next to a bicycle near her house not long after her husband was killed. HRW said it is ""most likely the same woman whose death was captured on aerial footage"" and reported in international media. It comes as Putin 's army was ordered to blockade the Mariupol steelworks “so that not even a fly can escape.” Up to 2,000 soldiers and civilians, including many terrified children, are holed up in the plant, which has a series of underground tunnels and basements. They are living in terrible conditions and are running out of food and water. And there are growing fears some of the weak and injured could starve to death.

2022-04-21,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/putin-could-still-win-ukraine-26767349,Putin could still 'win' Ukraine war as troops battle in the Donbas,"Western officials believe Russia could still “win” its war in Ukraine - despite seven weeks of military reversals. They admitted Vladimir Putin might be able to claim victory, having reset his aims for the conflict - and could even launch a fresh bid to storm the capital. Forces are fighting in the long-awaited Battle of the Donbas after Kremlin troops began their assault on the breakaway region in eastern Ukraine. They are thought to be better prepared for the attack than for their initial invasion on February 24 - prompting Ukraine’s allies to send fresh waves of arms and equipment to bolster Ukrainian resistance. A Western official said tonight: “Putin has clearly failed in meeting his initial, pre-war objectives but he is still in a position to win.” They added: “The Russians have concentrated sufficient force such that if they were to use it intelligently they might be able to surround and destroy a very significant portion of Ukraine’s armed forces - some of its best forces - and make territorial gains which would then be very difficult to dislodge. “In a really worst case scenario they may be able to look again at whether they could revisit some of their pre-war objectives, potentially renew an attack on Kyiv or to attempt to take Odesa and deprive the rest of Ukraine from access to the sea.” “Any one of those things could certainly be described as a success.” However, Kremlin forces have failed to learn lessons over positioning vehicles in long lines - making them targets for ambushes by Ukrainian fighters. “They have not solved all of their problems - they continue to operate in relatively long convoys on single roads and make themselves vulnerable and in parallel, the Ukrainians continue to fight in a very smart way,” said an official. “While we see some improvement, it is as yet not a force transformed.” Allies are braced to support Ukraine, including by sending weapons, equipment and cash, “for a prolonged period of conflict, through perhaps much of the rest of this year - at least we have to plan for that eventuality”, warned the official.",7,4.417083075576295,4.865861005323334,-0.4487779297470391,6

Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has told Vladimir Putin that the southern port city has been taken, news agency Interfax reported this morning. If his claims are true, then Russia will have gained a major strategic advantage, as holding Mariupol would allow Putin's forces sea access and a potential route to Kyiv from the south. It will be the first major city that Putin's men have captured during the war. Shoigu said that 2,000 people remained in the Azovstal plant, a vast steelworks where the Ukrainian forces had gathered, but that they were blockaded in. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky likened the Russian's actions to ""terrorism"" and said that women and children were currently stuck in the steelworks. Russia-backed separatists began advancing into the plant on April 19 with “attack groups formed for storming the facility.” Today Putin ordered the Russian military to cancel plans to storm the Azovstal plant and said he wanted it to continue to be securely blockaded instead. Russia will now attempt to force the remaining troops in the steelworks to surrender by enforcing a complete blockade of the plant. With no chance of supplies getting into Azovstal, those inside will not able to hold out indefinitely. Carefully reading his words to Putin who sat close by across a small desk, Shoigu said: “As of today, all of Mariupol is under the control of the Russian Army. ""The people's militia of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Azovstal plant with the remnants of nationalists and foreign mercenaries is securely blocked.” Putin has said blockaded the plant was preferable to engaging in combat, which he described as ""unreasonable"", and claimed that those who surrender would be given medical help. ""I consider the proposed storming of the industrial zone unnecessary,"" Putin told Shoigu in a televised meeting at the Kremlin. ""I order you to cancel it."" ""There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities. ""Block off this industrial area so that a fly cannot not pass through."" Putin claimed that Russian efforts to ""liberate"" Mariupol - which lies in smouldering ruins - had been successful. Shoigu said that the situation in Mariupol was now ""calm"" after Russia evacuated 142,000 civilians to safety. His claims have yet to be independently verified and come after evacuation efforts from the city were widely seen as a failure. Western reports suggested just a few dozen people were able to escape Mariupol yesterday. Yesterday Zelenskiy has said an estimated 1,000 civilians are also sheltering at the steel works. Today he warned that Ukrainian forces in Azovstal may be able to hold their positions for several hours more. ""The people who are in the factory today and do not allow us to capture this small part of the ruined city are our border guards, the National Guard and the police, there are about a thousand locals, women who are hiding with children who are just afraid to leave, so that the locals who came out were killed by shells,"" he said of the situation in the plant. ""There (in Mariupol) everything was destroyed, 95-98% of all building. There is bombing from planes, artillery and missile damage. And they shoot everywhere, all over the city, and therefore a large number of people - they are afraid to even come out (from the shelters). Zelensky added: ""It's more like not a war, but such a terrorist operation by Russia against Mariupol and the people of this city."" While avoiding a full-out battle at the steelworks may make strategic military sense for the Russians, it robs Putin of being able to make a full and much needed declaration of victory. Over the past week the situation in Mariupol had become increasingly desperate after the Russians concentrated their assault on the south and east of Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers, including the controversial Azov Battalion, remain in the city having previously ignored calls to surrender. Viktor Macha, a Czech industrial photographer who visited the Azovstal steelworks in 2016, believes the Ukrainian forces chose the the plant as a base because of the “badass bomb shelters” built beneath it. Before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the plant employed more than 10,000 people. The city has endured some of the worst tragedies in the course of the war so far. In March a maternity hospital was destroyed by Russian shelling there, claiming the lives of several people including mothers and a child. Despite a large written warning that children were sheltering inside, the Russians bombed a Mariupol theatre, trapping more than a thousand people inside for days and claiming up to 300 lives. In recent weeks the food and medicine situation has become increasingly desperate for those trapped in the city as Russian forces encircled its perimeter. Mariupol, once a prosperous city of 400,000, is now a wasteland where corpses lie in the streets and Russia was hitting the Azovstal steel plant with bunker-buster bombs, the government in Kyiv said. Large black clouds of smoke billowed from there on Wednesday as evacuees queued to get onto buses, some clutching luggage or carrying small pets in their arms. Pensioner Tamara, 64, said she was going to stay with her sister in Zaporizhzhia after leaving the city with her husband, daughter, son-in-law and grandson yesterday. ""It is a pleasure...to leave after this nightmare. We lived in basements for 30 days,"" she said tearfully.

As Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine continues towards the end of its second month, a statement from an adviser to the Mariupol Mayor accused them of the latest atrocity. The Kremlin’s troops have reportedly built several mass graves near a bypass road in the besieged southern Ukrainian port city, and are dumping bodies packed inside plastic bags into the holes. Petro Andriushchenko shared the statement on Telegram, writing: “Mariupol. Right now. War crimes. After a long search and identification of the mass graves of the dead Mariupol residents, we have revealed the fact of building mass graves for the dead in the village of Manhush. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here “Near a bypass road, the occupiers built several mass graves, up to 30 meters each. They use trucks to deliver the bodies of the dead and simply throw them in bulk.” He claimed the bodies were all stuffed into plastic bags. He added: “This confirms our previous information that they are accumulating the bodies of the dead elsewhere within the industrial area in Mariupol. “This is direct evidence of war crimes and their attempts to hide them.” It is the latest reminder of the kind of atrocities Russia has committed so far in this war. A US satellite firm similarly identified a mass burial site containing about 200 graves near the same city. Maxar said its images showed the graves were growing in size and that they had begun towards the end of March. Local Ukrainian officials accused Russia of burying slaughtered civilians there. The alleged mass grave is near a village called Manhush, around 12 miles west of Mariupol. Mariupol has seen some of the fiercest fighting of the invasion so far. The city is strategically important and if taken by Russia, would be the first major city to fall and give them a land bridge between Russian controlled territories in the Donbas and Crimea. As things stand Putin’s troops control most of the city, with the remaining Ukrainian forces holed up in a massive iron and steel factory. The Ukrainian forces, led by Major Serhiy Volyna of the 36th Separate, are trapped in the factory with around 500 dead and hundreds of civilians. However Putin told his generals not to storm the factory but “block it so a fly can’t pass”.",47,4.722116341547549,4.140724140627515,0.5813922009200345,18

They are living in terrible conditions and are running out of food and water. And there are growing fears some of the weak and injured could starve to death. They are desperate to escape but Putin has slammed the door shut on any planned evacuation. As well as the 2,000 in the steelworks an estimated 120,000 remain trapped across the city. In a televised meeting, across a small table from his defence minister, Putin said there was “no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities”. Instead, he called for his forces to “block off this industrial area so that not even a fly can escape”. He added it would be “impractical” to storm the huge industrial area - which is four square miles in size. He claimed his decision was being made to safeguard the lives of Russian soldiers. Putin said that Russia would offer the Ukrainian defenders still in the plant the chance to surrender and lay down arms. He said: “The Russian side guarantees their lives and decent treatment in accordance with the relevant international legal acts. “All those who are injured will receive qualified medical assistance.” Putin also hailed Russia’s “liberation” of Mariupol after Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told him Russian forces now controlled the Ukrainian port city apart from the plant. It emerged tonight that more mass graves have been found in a village near Mariupol. City mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said “trenches” had been discovered in the village of Manhush, in the Donetsk region. He claimed Russian forces had been collecting the bodies in trucks and dumping them there. Speaking via video link from an undisclosed location, he said Russian soldiers were “mopping up their crimes”. “This is the second week in a row it’s totally closed. No one is allowed to enter. They are mopping up the place,” he said. “They are hiding the crimes committed by the Russian Federation in Mariupol. “According to our assessments, more than 20,000 civilians have been killed by enemy artillery and missile strikes in the streets of our city. “We also have evidence from municipal services in the city. They’ve seen those bodies in person and now we see those bodies disappearing. “These are war crimes and they are hiding these war crimes.” Mr Boichenko also said there were many incidents where residents had been “tortured and mistreated”. Ukraine ’s deputy prime minister has demanded that Russia allow an immediate humanitarian corridor for civilians to escape the steelworks in Mariupol where many are said to be hiding. Iryna Vereshchuk said: “There are about 1,000 civilians and 500 wounded soldiers there. They all need to be pulled out of Azovstal today.” In a separate development Britain set out 26 new sanctions yesterday targeting Russian military generals responsible for what it called “atrocities” in Ukraine, as well as individuals and businesses supporting the Russian armed forces. The so-called “Butcher of Bucha”, Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, is among them. Omurbekov led a unit that occupied the town, near Kyiv, where hundreds of bodies have since been discovered. He now faces a travel ban and asset freeze along with several fellow commanders. Other supporters of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have also been hit, including Oleg Belozyorov, the chairman of logistics company Russian Railways. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: “The depravity of Russia’s assault on the people of Ukraine is plain for all to see...Today’s new wave of sanctions hits the generals and defence companies that have blood on their hands.”",47,3.9021834220813254,4.404502012584552,-0.5023185905032266,9

The Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant describes itself as the largest producer of butyl acetate and industrial solvents in Russia and Eastern Europe. It is also the supplier of a wide range of chemical and petrochemical products in Russia and in the world.

Fighting in the southern port city of Mariupol has been some of the worst of the entire Russian invasion of Ukraine. The city has seen relentless Russian air strikes on a number of civilian targets, including a theatre which sheltered over a thousand people. Now one of the city’s last strongholds, an iron and steel factory, is being subjected to a never-ending barrage of fire but the Ukrainian commander inside has vowed to never give up, The Washington Post reported . The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works is the last holdout of Major Serhiy Volyna of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here His forces have been holding out against Russian troops who vastly outnumber them as they shelter hundreds of civilians and hundreds of injured. In one of his most extensive interviews so far, he has revealed what it is like inside the factory and vowed to never lay down his weapons and keep fighting as long as he received orders. Volyna has fought in Mariupol since the beginning of the Russian invasion and has hundreds of civilians, including women and children, sheltering in the metal works plant - although the exact number varies across reports. Local officials said earlier this week that as many as 1,000 civilians were taking shelter inside. Russia Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had previously told Putin that 2,000 people remained in the plant but were blockaded in by Moscow's forces, as Putin ordered him not to storm the factory but to ""block it off"". The Major described the Russian shelling as “round the clock” but said morale remained high amongst him and his troops. Volyna said Putin’s forces constantly used a mixture of air attacks, artillery both from the land and sea as well as tank and infantry assaults to try and penetrate their defences. He revealed the plant held at least 500 people wounded, including civilians. He said: “It’s in the basement where people just rot. There is no medication,”. The Ukrainian troops and civilians were using an underground system of tunnels that allowed them to keep sheltered from Russian attacks, the Post reported. Volyna described the situation as “tragic” and “critical” as he appealed to US President Joe Biden for help either through military or diplomatic means. The Soviet-era plant is one of the largest metallurgic factories in Europe and stretches over four square miles along the waterfront. Before it became a key battleground in Russia ’s invasion it was the lifeblood of the city’s economy and employed tens of thousands of people. Cut off from the world, Volyna only sleeps for two or three hours a night in a damp basement along with his troops. He said: “We save water together, we support each other, try to help each other as much as possible. Everyone is ready to continue as one.” “We are aware of everything, and we understand everything calmly and we continue to carry out combat missions.” The Russian Ministry of Defence previously issued a deadline for Ukrainians to give up their arms and exit. But Volyna told The Post he refused to trust Russian guarantees of safe passage, and repeat the mistakes of others. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that as many as 20,000 civilians had been killed in Mariupol since the Russian invasion began on February 24. Volyna described the city as “demolished from the face of the earth” with countless dead buried under destroyed houses and buildings. Makeshift graves have been popping up across the city and Volya described the horrors as “beyond basic human comprehension”. The capture of Mariupol would be a significant victory for Putin’s forces who have failed to achieve a number of key objectives so far. Russia failed to take the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and later retreated from around the northern city, refocusing its efforts on the east of Ukraine. On top of that it lost its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva. However, the capture of Mariupol would give the Kremlin a land bridge between the Russian controlled territories of Crimea and the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine.",47,3.2405949277512804,3.089029399338878,0.15156552841240245,9

The top ally of Vladimir Putin said Russian forces will seize the last main stronghold of resistance in the besieged city today after Ukraine proposed talks on evacuating troops and civilians there. Mariupol would be the biggest city to be seized by Russia since invading Ukraine eight weeks ago in an attack that has taken longer than some military analysts expected, seen over five million people flee abroad and turned cities to rubble. The last defence in the city is said to be centred on the Azovstal steel plant, along with about 1,000 civilians who are in hiding. Kadyrov, the head of Russia's republic of Chechnya, whose forces have been fighting in Ukraine, said: ""Before lunchtime, or after lunch, Azovstal will be completely under the control of the forces of the Russian Federation."" A few dozen civilians managed to leave the strategically important southeastern port on Wednesday in a small bus convoy, escaping the fiercest battle of the war. A Ukrainian marine commander, Serhiy Volny, said fighters at the steel works may not be able to hold out for much longer. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering there. Mariupol, once a prosperous seaside city of 400,000, is now a wasteland where corpses lie in the streets as Russia slams the Azovstal steel plant with bunker-buster bombs, the government in Kyiv said. The deputy commander of the Azov Regiment in Mariupol, Svyatoslav Kalamar, said several bunkers under the plant still held about 80-100 civilians each. Black smoke billowed from the plant on Wednesday as evacuees queued to get onto buses. Pensioner Tamara, 64, said she was going to stay with her sister in Zaporizhzhia. She was leaving with her husband, daughter, son-in law and grandson. ""It is a pleasure ... to leave after this nightmare. We lived in basements for 30 days,"" she said tearfully. Ukraine accused Russian forces of failing to observe a local ceasefire agreement long enough to allow large numbers of people to leave. Moscow denies targeting civilians and has blamed Ukraine for the failure of earlier attempts to organise humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol. If Russia captured Mariupol it would link territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014. Kyiv has proposed swapping Russian prisoners of war for safe passage for trapped civilians and soldiers. It was not known if Russia had responded to the offer of special negotiations. Fighters remain holed up in the plant and have ignored an ultimatum by Russia to surrender. Fewer civilians than hoped left on Wednesday. Ukraine said it had so far held off an assault by thousands of Russian troops attempting to advance in what Kyiv calls the Battle of the Donbas, a new campaign to seize two eastern provinces Moscow claims on behalf of separatists. Russia's forces had carried out strikes on dozens of military facilities in eastern Ukraine and had shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter near the village of Koroviy Yar, its defence ministry said. Meanwhile, Putin has said a first test launch on Wednesday of Russia's Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new and long-awaited addition to its nuclear arsenal, would ""provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded with the West for greater firepower as Putin's war machine begins a new phase of its bloody invasion with a full-scale offensive to take control of the mostly-Russian speaking Donbas in the east. And now Britain will soon send armoured Stormer High Velocity Missile (HVM) launchers, the Sun reports, with the Ministry of Defence demonstrating them for Ukrainians on Salisbury Plain two weeks ago. It is understood the 13-tonne vehicles can be flown to the war on C-17 transport planes in days. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Dr Alan Mendoza, of security think tank the Henry Jackson Society, told the Sun: “These vehicles are the best kit yet sent to Ukraine and will leave Russian pilots quaking. “The UK is putting Putin on notice that Russian aggression, war crimes, and rocket strikes will no longer be tolerated. The UK should wear Putin’s inevitable angry and overblown reaction to this as a badge of pride.” But Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British troops in Afghanistan, told the paper that UK's major boost to Ukraine's forces risks further angering Moscow, with the threat of retalitation coming in the form of ""cyber attacks, sabotage, assassination or other covert attacks for which his intelligence services have proven capability, including in the UK.” The Stormer is manufactured by BAE Systems, needs just three people to operate it and and uses Starstreak missiles, which can be used to take down low-flying aircraft and leave pilots terrified of attempting low-level attacks. It comes as Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said a ""significant part of the entire Russian army"" was concentrated on an offensive in the east in the mostly-Russian speaking Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have declared two independent republics that have been recognised by Russia. Mr Zelensky has been pleading for Western powers to give him greater firepower to fight back, with Boris Johnson saying on April 7 that he was ""certainly looking at what more military assistance we can give"" amid reports the UK could send armoured vehicles. On the same date, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK was ""stepping up"" the supply of arms, as she joined Nato counterparts in Brussels to hear the demands from Ukraine for more equipment. US President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved 800 million dollars (£610m) in military assistance for Ukraine, including artillery and helicopters, to bolster its defences against the expected Russian offensive in the country's east. Mr Johnson spoke to Mr Zelensky on Saturday afternoon, with a Downing Street spokesperson saying: ""The Prime Minister paid tribute to the bravery of Ukrainian forces who continue to valiantly defend their country's freedom."" Russia on Monday bombarded the western city of Lviv, where at least seven people were killed, and numerous other targets across Ukraine in what appeared to be an intensified bid to grind down the country's defences. Meanwhile, Government figures show around 16,400 people had arrived in the UK under Ukraine visa schemes by last Monday. About 13,200 had arrived under the Ukraine family scheme and 3,200 under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, provisional data shows.",49,4.02114796722281,3.105981909621963,0.9151660576008473,19

Boris Johnson told the weekly Cabinet meeting Ukraine's position remained ""perilous"" - with Russian President Vladimir Putin ""angered by defeats but determined to claim some sort of victory regardless of the human cost"", the Prime Minister’s spokesman said. The Cabinet was briefed by a senior national security official who, according to the PM's spokesman, told them: “Putin was focusing his attention on Donbas region and that the next phase of the war was likely to be an attritional conflict which could last several months. “ Russia would aim to exploit its troop number advantage but Ukraine had already shown this was unlikely to be decisive on its own. “There were some signs Russia had not learned the lessons from previous setbacks in northern Ukraine and there was evidence of troops being committed to the fight in piecemeal fashion. “Reports of poor Russian morale continued, with claims that some soldiers and even units were refusing to fight.” Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin told ministers allies were “expanding military aid to Ukraine and the UK continued to play a leading role,” the spokesman said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is expected to update the Commons on sending fresh supplies to the Ukrainians this week. Lieutenant General Lance Landrum, deputy chairman of the military committee at NATO headquarters in Brussels, said allies were sending heavier hardware. “We have seen an increase in heavier type weapons, defensive weapons, to help them in their fight, particularly in the east as the fighting escalates in the east,” he said at the Invictus Games in The Hague. He added: ""What we've seen is a huge fighting spirit from the Ukrainian forces. ""We've seen them be creative, and we've seen innovation and we've seen a lot of courage. ""They know their home terrain and they're fighting for their homes and their own families, and their own citizens. ""I think that that spirit is something that is really unpredictable from an adversary's point. ""I think maybe they were underestimated. There has been some support from outside nations, but the fighting spirit of Ukraine has really saved the day for them, and we are with them as they continue the fight in the east."" Earlier, former UK Joint Forces Command chief General Sir Richard Barron, who briefs MPs later, said Kremlin troops had “learned some lessons from the first 54 days of this war” as Russia launched the Battle of the Donbas. But he added: “Their morale won’t be any stronger from the battering they have had. “The Ukrainians should be very confident, if they are in well-prepared, defensive positions.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned a “very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive,” pledging: “No matter how many Russian soldiers are driven there, we will fight, we will defend ourselves. We will do it every day.” Former UK Joint Forces Command chief General Sir Richard Barrons today told the Commons Defence Select Committee Putin’s “goals have changed because of the fundamental lack of success in the military campaign to date”. He told MPs: “The original objectives were assessed to be to remove the regime in Kyiv, to dismantle the Ukrainian military so that Ukraine represented no military threat at all to Russia and to secure, at least, the full extent of the Donbas. “It has become clear that he can’t remove, currently, the regime in Kyiv, he’s a very long way away from dismantling the military and he’s still embarked on trying to seize the Donbas.” Ukraine needs heavy artillery from Western allies to help it resist invaders, he said. But he predicted a stalemate in the eastern region bordering Russia within weeks. “More likely than not this battle dissolves into some sort of stalemate - nobody has won and nobody has lost and nobody is going anywhere,” he said. “Stalemate may occur by late spring which no-one knows how to unstick. “In those circumstances we will have choices to make but we would be supporting an insurgency, we will be supporting the resistance on what will have become some sort of line of demarcation, where there is a ceasefire or not.” Raising the spectre of a new Cold War between Russia and the West, Gen Sir Richard warned: “We are now clearly looking at a confrontation for the rest of this century, I think, in which we are going to have to stand up for our security, our prosperity and our values in ways we have not had to do for a generation.” But he feared NATO was not ready to intervene in Ukraine, even if Kremlin troops took the capital. “At which point we will have a call to make and that call would be easier if we had made any preparations at all to act in those circumstances at the speed required - and frankly we have not,” he added. “The main reason that we are keen to avoid a war between Russia and NATO is that NATO isn’t ready, and one should be ashamed of that.”",7,4.033679835363382,2.909906021212045,1.1237738141513374,17

In the days after Moscow launched its long anticipated attack on the east of Ukraine, Kremlin foreign minister Sergei Lavrov issued the warning. Speaking to India Today, when asked whether Russia intended to unleash any of its nuclear weapons. He said: “At this stage, we are considering the option of conventional weapons only”. Lavrov, a long-time mouthpiece for the Kremlin and Putin, left the threat of potential nuclear war hanging for further down the line. Across the interview he parroted Kremlin propaganda lines claiming the US, the West and NATO were responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The Russian minister previously claimed in late January that Moscow had no intention to invade Ukraine. Less than a month later Putin announced the invasion. Speaking to India Today, he spread Kremlin lies saying: “The current events are rooted in the US and West's desire to rule the world. “They pumped arms into Ukraine. They violated their promises to Russian leadership and started moving NATO eastward after the Soviet Union disappeared. They said it's a defensive alliance and not a threat to Russian security.” Russia has claimed a number of justifications for its invasion, including blaming NATO, a defensive bloc, and its expansionism, and claiming it was “denazifying” Ukraine, despite the fact its president is Jewish. Lavrov also attempted to dispute the fact that Russian forces had committed war crimes and claimed Moscow was only targeting military infrastructure. This is despite the growing amounts of evidence proving otherwise, including how Russia has bombed maternity and children hospitals, repeatedly targeted shelters and humanitarian corridors too. He claimed Russia was not responsible for the atrocities in Bucha but satellite imagery from commercial provider Maxar Technologies, first reported by The New York Times, proved the bodies had been there for weeks. Lavrov’s comments on Russia’s nuclear weapons came Putin sent nuclear-capable bombers into the skies over Western Russia this week. Videos from Monday and Saturday caught four aircrafts which can carry nukes over the Kaluga region, between Moscow and the Ukrainian border. Threats and fears of involvement of Russia’s nuclear arsenal have punctuated the Kremlin’s so far unsuccessful invasion of Ukraine. Days after the invasion began on February 24, Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert and threatened NATO with “consequences greater than any you have faced in history” if they intervened. The Russian foreign minister also confirmed that his country have launched the latest stage of its invasion of Ukraine, what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the “battle of Donbas”. In the days and weeks leading up to Russia’s second phase of the attack, Ukraine and western intelligence sources warned that Russia was amassing troops and resources.",4,2.8616355651060226,3.216411814656795,-0.35477624955077225,7

The besieged port city has been pulverised after seven weeks of near constant shelling, killing around 20,000 residents. Roughly 100,000 are managing to survive with its last-known pocket of resistance fighters holed up in a four-square mile steel plant. Over the weekend Russia gave them until Saturday to give up- a demand which was ignored. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said troops in Mariupol were still fighting despite a Russian demand to surrender by dawn. ""The city still has not fallen,"" he told ABC's ""This Week"" programme, adding that Ukrainian soldiers continue to control some parts of the city. Russia said on Saturday it had control of urban parts of the city, with some Ukrainian fighters remaining in the Azovstal steelworks overlooking the Sea of Azov. Capturing Mariupol, the main port in the southeastern region of Donbas, would be a strategic prize for Russia, connecting territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014. After failing to overcome Ukrainian resistance in the north, the Russian military has refocused its ground offensive on Donbas while maintaining long-distance strikes elsewhere including the capital, Kyiv. About four million Ukrainians have fled the country, cities have been shattered and thousands have died since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24. ""The occupiers will be responsible for everything they did in Ukraine,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on his Telegram account, posting images of destruction he said were akin to the ""terrible times"" of World War Two. Drone footage carried by the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti on Sunday showed mile after mile of shattered buildings in Mariupol. In this morning’s briefing the Ministry of Defence claimed Mariupol’s ongoing resistance is slowing the invader’s advance in the rest of Ukraine. It read: “Russian commanders will be concerned by the time it is taking to subdue Mariupol. “Concerted Ukrainian resistance has severely tested Russian forces and diverted men and materiel, slowing Russia’s advance elsewhere. “The effort to capture Mariupol has come at significant cost to its residents. Large areas of infrastructure have been destroyed whilst the population has suffered significant casualties. “The targeting of populated areas within Mariupol aligns with Russia’s approach to Chechnya in 1999 and Syria in 2016. “This is despite the 24 February 2022 claims of Russia’s Defence Ministry that Russia would neither strike cities nor threaten the Ukrainian population.” It comes as Russia struck with several missiles in the city of Lviv on Monday. The Kremlin has stepped up attacks in the wake of the sinking of its flagship Moskva last week. Russia said on Sunday it had attacked an ammunition plant near Kyiv overnight with precision-guided missiles, the third such strike in as many days. Explosions were also reported in Kramatorsk, the eastern city where rockets earlier this month killed at least 57 people at a train station crowded with civilians trying to evacuate ahead of the Russian offensive.",47,2.857119273647509,3.434416607641179,-0.5772973339936698,6
2022-04-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-russias-shameless-propaganda-museum-26736608,Inside Russia's shameless propaganda museum detailing NATO's ‘cruelty’,"A shameless propaganda exhibition has opened in Moscow which claims to lay bare NATO 'cruelty' amid the Ukraine invasion. NATO: A Chronicle of Cruelty is live this month at the Museum of Modern History, a short walk from the Kremlin in Russia's capital city. While President Vladimir Putin directs the slaughter of soldiers and terrified citizens across the border in the neighbouring nation, back home his people are told lies and brainwashed to his own ends. No more so than at the exhibit, where juxtaposing images and artefacts are often crammed together in an effort to present NATO, an intergovernmental military alliance between 30 member states, as the aggressors. There are also plenty of shoehorned-in Nazi references relating to Ukraine, the eradication of which Putin had said was one of the driving forces behind the war. Russian military ""trophies"", supposedly from the current invasion, are on display, including an American flag riddled with bullets and a helmet emblazoned with 'SS' - standing for The Schutzstaffel, a major paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler. The display claims the two items were taken from a soldier in the Azov battalion, a union of Ukrainian National Guard. The exhibit is backed by Putin's ministry of defence, the culture ministry and key state news agency Rossiya Segodnya. A display at the start of the exhibit reads: ""NATO is infamous to the modern world as one of history’s most aggressive military-political alliances."" Visitors are told the history of NATO military campaigns in Iraq, Syria, and the former Yugoslavia. There are also images from US nuclear attacks on Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The display fails to clarify that both incidents took place several years before Nato was formed. The exhibition's launch comes on the heels of atrocities in towns and villages around Kyiv, allegedly committed by Russian troops. After weeks of struggling to better defences around the Ukrainian capital, Moscow forces retreated and the attack has now shifted focus to the Donbas border region in the east, as well as strategic port city Mariupol. The hope is that a Russia-occupied land corridor can be forged connecting the Donbas and previously reclaimed Crimea. But invading troops left behind a trail of devastation, including hundreds of massacred civilians, some buried in mass graves and others left strewn in the street in the likes of Bucha. Western leaders have accused the troops of war crimes, something the Kremlin denies. It described such claims as ""monstrous forgery"". Irina Velikanova, the museum’s director, also dismissed suggestions of war crimes, which include rape and torture. She told the Times, it is rather Nato, and in particular the US, that is guilty of ""systemic"" cruelty towards civilians. She cited the Vietnam War. ""Violence and cruelty, in principle, are not characteristic of the Russian people,"" she said, insisting any wrongdoing by Russian soldiers is always swiftly investigated and violations severely punished. Ms Velikanova said the idea for the exhibition came last year, inspired by Putin's demands that Nato withdraw forces from central and eastern Europe and stop its expansion east. He also warned Ukraine must never be offered membership. These demands were refused, and with Putin having always considered Ukraine a part of Russia - despite the country's shift to the west - and seemingly keen to return to some sort of neo-USSR regime, he invaded. Ms Velikanova added: ""We are not a news agency, of course, but we considered it important to organise such an exhibition. ""The topic was very relevant.""",45,3.242095599680393,3.6280057481138432,-0.3859101484334504,6

He said: “We can now confirm that Russian troops have begun the battle for the Donbas, which they have been preparing for a long time. “A large part of the Russian army is now dedicated to this offensive. ""No matter how many Russian soldiers are brought here, we will fight. We will defend ourselves."" His comments came in a video address that followed a number of reports of Russia stepping up its attacks. Zelensky's chief of staff said that the assault on Donbas marked the ""second phase"" of the war. Ukraine's top security official also said that Russian forces had attempted to break through almost the entire frontline in Donetsk, Luhansk and the Kharkiv region. His comments follow warnings from senior officials in Ukraine and the West that Russia was redirecting troops and resources to towards the country’s east. Initially, Russia claimed it was pulling troops out of parts of northern Ukraine, especially around the capital Kyiv, as apart of the ongoing efforts to reach a diplomatic solution. However, it quickly became apparent, Putin and the Kremlin were trying to reorganise their troops and resources after stoic Ukrainian resistance and poor tactics led to their invasion stalling. This led to them focusing their troops in the East of Ukraine, where there is heavy pro-Russian sentiment. And now fighting there, could end up looking like the Second World War, Ukraine's foreign minister has warned. Dmytro Kuleba told NATO allies sent out the terrifying warning in the days before the second wave of attacks begun. Speaking after talks with NATO foreign ministers at the alliance’s Brussels headquarters on April 7, he said: “The Battle for Donbas - and I regret to say it but this is true - will remind of the Second World War with large populations, manoeuvres, involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.” This comes after Western Officials warned that Putin may have looked to double or even triple the number of Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region ahead of the assault. One official told reporters on April 4: “I would imagine that, at outside estimates, what you’re looking at is a force which is probably the Russians looking to double or even treble the amount of force that they bring into that Donbas area. “But I would note that that is going to take some considerable time to bring them up to that sort of number."" So far the conflict has displaced nearly five million Ukrainians and taken tens of thousands of lives. After an initial push to seize Ukraine's cities and urban centres, Moscow pivoted to relentless air attacks and bombings on civilian targets. Only today, Ukrainian offiicals have said at least 17 people have died. This included seven in the western city of Lviv, which had been largely untouched until now.",7,2.135808886724732,3.035718077766441,-0.8999091910417092,6

Nina Khrushcheva added she believes Russia ’s president is prepared to do whatever it takes to claim victory. Her great-grandad stepped back from the brink when the Soviets and the US seemed on the verge of using nuclear weapons against each other during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. But Ms Khrushcheva fears the circumstances are different now. The professor of international affairs said: “I think Putin plans to win at any cost. If he needs to declare victory and he may need to use tactical nuclear weapons – I’m not predicting that – that could be one of the options the Russians may be prepared to use.” Tactical nuclear weapons are less powerful than the longer-range missiles that resulted in the crisis in 1962 when Khrushchev led the Soviet Union. But Ms Khrushcheva – a Russia scholar at the New School university in New York and a long-time critic of Putin – fears Moscow could use them to devastating effect in Ukraine. She said her great-grandad and the then US president John F Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis within days because they were “freaked out” by the prospect of mutual annihilation. Ms Khrushcheva, who was five when Khrushchev died in 1971, said previously: “Now look at it today. Putin is not freaked out. In fact, he has said he has opened the nuclear arsenal.” In his daily video update, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky also warned about Russia’s nukes. He urged nations to build air raid shelters and to stock up on anti-radiation medicine. Mr Zelensky added: “We shouldn’t wait for the moment Russia decides to use nuclear weapons – we must prepare for that.” He said in another interview that if Russia over-runs the Donbas region to the east, Putin may again try to seize Ukraine’s capital Kyiv. Mr Zelensky said: “I don’t trust the Russian military and Russian leadership. That is why we understand that the fact we fought them off and they were running away from Kyiv, from the north, from Chernihiv, it doesn’t mean if they are able to capture Donbas they won’t come further towards Kyiv.” There remained confusion last night over a deadline in the besieged seaport of Mariupol. Russia had told the remaining Ukrainian troops in the city to surrender or they could be killed. With communications difficult in the Black Sea port it was impossible to confirm what the situation was there. An estimated 100,000 people remained in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings, which are reported to be largely under Russian control. Mr Zelensky called the situation there “inhuman”, adding it remained “as severe as possible.” He said: “Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone in Mariupol.” Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, said on social media that despite Russia’s “surrender corridor” for the remaining troops in the city, “our defenders continue to hold the defence”. He added the hostilities from Russia have not been limited to the Azovstal steel plant, where Ukrainian soldiers are stationed. He said: “During the fighting, the occupiers shelled private residential houses with heavy artillery again.” Russia targeted other military installations in Ukraine overnight including a missile factory on Kyiv’s outskirts. Moscow has confirmed another shattering blow to morale with the death of the deputy commander of the 8th army, Vladimir Petrovich Frolov. St Petersburg governor Alexander Beglov said the general had “died a heroic death in battle with Ukrainian nationalists... [and he] sacrificed his life so children... in the Donbas would no longer hear bomb explosions”. Other Russian generals have also been killed during the war. It is unusual for such high ranking officers to get so close to the battlefield. Western sources think they have done so to take control of operations which have stalled in many areas. The death comes following the blow of Russian warship Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, sinking after being damaged by an explosion. It is claimed new footage shows the head of Russia’s navy, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, meeting surviving crew members in Sevastopol in Crimea.",47,3.2879230225830036,3.5796511785895473,-0.29172815600654367,17

Kira Obedinsky, 12, lost her mother when she was a baby and her father Yevhen was killed as enemy forces fought their way into the city in March. Shortly afterwards, the youngster and her father’s partner Anya attempted to flee the city in which 21,000 civilians have been killed by relentless Russian shelling. Before they could reach safety Kira was injured in a landmine blast and taken to hospital in Donetsk, which is controlled by Ukrainian separatists. Now her grandfather, Oleksander, fears he will never see her again. The Guardian reported him saying: “She was in a hospital bed, she had shrapnel wounds around her ear and face and her legs, but she seemed OK. “I was so relieved. But she told me she’s in Donetsk, and it seems like she’s on her own. She told me they’re taking her to a Russian city.” An official had said the grandfather could come and collect her from the hospital, which is impossible because of the invasion. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky previously told CNN Kremlin soldiers are forcing people fleeing Mariupol into Russia. He said: “Several thousand, tens of thousands, were forced to evacuate in the direction of the Russia Federation and we don't know where they are, they've left no document trail. ""And among them are several thousand children, we want to know what happened to them. ""Whether they are in good health. Unfortunately, there just isn't any information on this.” Unicef says more than half of Ukraine ’s 7.5 million children have now been forced to flee the ongoing violence in the nation. The Ukrainian Ombudswoman for Human Rights says more than 121,000 children have been ""deported"" by the Russian government. Lyudmila Denisova said in a statement on Facebook : “I appeal to the UN Commission for Investigation Human Rights Violations during Russia's Military Invasion of Ukraine and the expert mission set up by the OSCE participating States under the Moscow Mechanism to take into account these violations of Ukrainian children's rights, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.” Mariupol has been a target of the Russian government since the outbreak of war in February owing to its position on the coast. The city has been without food, heating and power for weeks, with more than 100,000 people still calling it home existing in a desperate situation. Despite overwhelming odds Ukrainian soldiers still fighting for its survival resisted a Russian ultimatum to lay down arms on Sunday in the pulverised port.

In Ukraine, all men between the ages of 18 and 60 are barred from leaving the country and have been urged to enlist in the armed forces to battle against Vladimir Putin's troops. Border guards working near the port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine say they seized a 26-year-old man who was trying to cross into neighbouring Moldova by taxi. In bizarre footage posted on social media, the man can be seen clad in a long black jacket and leopard print hat as he is questioned by guards, the Daily Star reports. The bemused officials then point to the boot of an open taxi which is packed with luggage. Taking to Twitter, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said: ""In the Odesa region, border guards together with the Troops found a 26-year-old Ukrainian in a taxi at a checkpoint. ""The traveller in women's clothing planned to get to Moldova. He also had a temporary conscript's certificate with him."" The incident comes after the UN urged Ukraine to have a more relaxed approach to their martial law restrictions. Speaking in March, Matthew Saltmarsh, head of news and media at UNHCR, the UN refugee agency said: “We recognise that states have a right to self-defence under both the UN charter and customary international law and that states may also require their citizens to perform military service under certain criteria and conditions, in line with international law. “At the same time … we appreciate these are very challenging circumstances and we would urge a compassionate and humane approach to those who are seeking to flee and are in need of safety and protection.” It comes as US defence officials have warned that a new horrific phase of Russia's invasion could begin this weekend. They believe Russia may start moving forces back into Ukraine within the next couple of days, after retreating from Kyiv within the last two weeks. The new offensive could begin before Russian troops have had a chance to regroup, NBC News reports.

Meanwhile Ukraine remains desperate for weapons - with president Volodymyr Zelensky offering cargo planes to Western allies to assist them in sending supplies over.

Major General Vladimir Frolov, deputy commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army, was laid to rest with full military honours in St Petersburg. It is unknown how he died or where he met his demise. His unit is believed to have been deployed in the area around besieged Mariupol. Alexander Beglov, the governor of St Petersburg, said at his burial: “A true patriot, a brave and brave man, he honestly and to the end fulfilled his military and human duty. “The people will not forget their heroes. Eternal memory to him.” He claimed Frolov had “fallen a heroic death in battle with Ukrainian nationalists”, following Russia's twisted portrayal of the invasion. His death followed seven other Russian generals killed in the war, although the Kremlin has only publicly acknowledged the death of one, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, who was believed shot by a sniper. Last month experts revealed there are a catalogue of reasons why several senior Russian officers have fallen in the invasion. It comes amid reports of unreliable equipment and electronics amongst Russian forces, as well as subordinates being too terrified to make quick decisions. Former US army general and CIA director David Petraeus said Ukraine also has ""good snipers"" which are able to target key individuals when a Russian chain of command breaks down. He said: ""The communications have been jammed. The column gets stopped, and an impatient general goes forward to see what’s going on. ""There’s no initiative, no non-commissioned officer corps, no sense of initiative at junior levels. They wait to be told what to do, and the Ukrainians have very, very good snipers."" An anonymous diplomat also told Foreign Policy that generals were ""struggling on the front line to get their orders through"". Russia has also lost another colonel, Miras Bashakov, a tank battalion commander, according to reports today. He was the 34th colonel known to have died in a war that has haemorrhaged Putin’s battlefield top brass. The scale of the high ranking death toll defies Vladimir Putin ’s claim that his “special military operation” is going according to plan.

""Now, another battle is coming: the battle for Donbas.” It is predicted that Russian troops will try and encircle Ukrainian forces between Donbas and the rest of the country, a senior defence official said. Earlier this week it was reported that Putin's forces have already started moving weapons and equipment into western Russia, ready for the battle. Meanwhile Ukraine remains desperate for weapons - with president Volodymyr Zelensky offering cargo planes to Western allies to assist them in sending supplies over. He said he had been frustrated by Western leaders asking repetitive questions about what weapons were needed. Zelensky told The Atlantic: ""You have it and here it is; we know where it is stored. Can you give it to us? ""We need armoured vehicles, for example. And not one per day. We need 200 to 300 per day. These aren't personal taxis, just for me; our soldiers need transport. ""Flights are available, the whole thing can be organized, we can do all the logistics."" A new offensive could signal a redefinition in Russia's war aims, with Putin's sights now set on only conquering the eastern provinces rather than Ukraine as a whole. This would put Ukrainian forces in eastern parts of the country in greater danger of being overwhelmed. Donbas has seen fighting on and off since 2014, with more than 13,000 people killed so-far. Putin has repeatedly falsely claimed that Kyiv is committing genocide against the Russian-speaking population in the region as a reason behind his invasion of Ukraine.",7,2.615246968931483,4.697399003085079,-2.0821520341535957,17
2022-04-15,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/moment-ukrainian-special-forces-destroy-26718907,Moment Ukrainian special forces destroy entire Russian convoy in sabotage attack,"A Russian convoy has been left burnt out and smouldering after it was ambushed by Ukrainian special forces (SS0). Images of the destruction wreaked by the elite fighting squad shows the column of armoured vehicles reduced to charred remains. The convoy had been moving from Kharkiv in the east of the country to Izyum, about 80 miles away, earlier this week when it was attacked. A huge explosion triggered by SSO operators stopped the vehicles in their tracks, the Ukrainian Ground Forces said while releasing images of the destruction. Having learned of the route the Russians planned to take, Ukrainian saboteurs planted TNT at key points along the road and underneath a bridge before detonating it as the armoured machines rolled above. Several vehicles were destroyed in the blasts, after which SSO operators and members of the Ukrainian army swept in to fight surviving Russian troops. The attack comes as fighting continues to rage in the east and south of the country, after Russian forces abandoned their efforts to take control of Kyiv. They have now focused manpower on taking control of Kharkiv in the east and Mariupol in the south. The invading forces enjoyed a major breakthrough on Wednesday when 1,026 soldiers of Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, surrendered in Mariupol, Russia claimed. Russian television on Wednesday broadcast clips of what it said was the surrender. In the footage, unarmed men in military fatigues were visible walking with their hands up along a grass- and tree-lined path towards masked soldiers cradling assault rifles. In one clip, four marines walked away from a damaged industrial building carrying a wounded person on a stretcher. One of the four carried a makeshift white flag as well. Wounded men were loaded onto a yellow bus. An unidentified Russian soldier said: ""You may be scared or not, but it is necessary to surrender anyway. The choice is not a big one. First, the encircling is tight enough. ""Second, there are at least five echelons (of troops), so it is not that simple to exit if someone would think that he can easily leave."" More than a dozen solders were lined up in formation in a dark room, where an unidentified prisoner of war said in Russian: ""I was in a group of 13 to 15 men who moved together and survived. We had to surrender as we had been encircled."" The main Sea of Azov port is the biggest target in the eastern Donbas region that Moscow now calls the focus of its campaign. If captured, it would be the first major city to fall since the war began. Its capture would help secure a land passage between separatist-held eastern areas and Crimea, which Russia seized and annexed in 2014.",47,3.541277853694614,4.314551710582437,-0.773273856887823,6

Earlier this month, Kremlin forces retreated after weeks of trying to breach the defences of the capital city and have since been regathering for attacks in the east. But on freeing the towns and villages from their occupation, the horrifying alleged war crimes committed by invading soldiers were laid bare. Andriy Nebytov, the head of Kyiv’s regional police force, said today bodies were left on the streets or given temporary burials. He said that data indicates 95% died from gunshot wounds. ""Consequently, we understand that under the (Russian) occupation, people were simply executed in the streets,"" Mr Nebytov said. More bodies are being found every day, under rubble and in mass graves, he added. ""The most victims were found in Bucha, where there are more than 350 corpses,"" he said. A war crimes prosecutor has vowed to catch the unimaginably barbaric Russian troops behind the massacres. As he watched four more corpses being removed from a mass grave of over 100 dead in stricken Bucha, War Crimes Prosecutor Andrii Turbor told the Mirror: “No matter how long it takes, time does not matter, we will catch those responsible for killing these innocent people. “This was unimaginable barbarism resulting in the deaths of so many people who were harmless, children, elderly people, women, civilians. “These people were Ukrainians and I am a Ukrainian - this is a matter of personal respect to do justice for these poor people. “This morning we found a 75 to 80 year-old woman here. Who can imagine killing such a person? I cannot imagine it.” It comes after Moscow troops' attacks on civilians in Ukraine were officially declared war crimes in a devastating international report ordered by 45 countries. Vladimir Putin's forces' attack that killed 300 people sheltering in the Mariupol Theatre was “most likely… an egregious violation” of humanitarian law and “those who ordered or executed it committed a war crime”, the report said. It also dismissed Russia 's claims that its attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol last month was “fake news”, saying the attack “must have been deliberate”. It added: “This attack therefore constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law and those responsible for it have committed a war crime”. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) interim report ran to nearly 100 pages and said Russian forces have intentionally targeted healthcare sites. The report only covers the conflict up to April 1, which means atrocities uncovered as Russian forces pulled back from Kyiv in recent weeks have not yet been fully analyse. Grim evidence of the killing of civilians in Bucha shocked the world, as well as the recent rocket attack on a train station in Kramatorsk where people were trying to flee. There were “several credible reports” of Russian forces “arresting civilians, including journalists, without any procedure, and ill-treating them by methods that amount to torture. This constitutes a war crime,” the report said. The report noted there have been “allegations of rapes, including gang rapes, committed by Russian soldiers in many other regions in Ukraine "". And it said: “Russia is failing to agree to evacuations or is violating such agreements through attacks on those trying to leave. “Intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival… constitutes a war crime.” The report concludes: “Violations occurred on the Ukrainian as well as on the Russian side. ""The violations committed by the Russian Federation, however, are by far larger in scale and nature.”",45,6.5043590563738904,3.570826973327429,2.9335320830464613,2

Mariupol has been devastated by Russian shelling, leaving the city in rubble and there has been evidence to suggest war crimes have been committed with hospitals and train stations among the buildings hit. Ukrainians have vowed to fight on in Mariupol with food and water dwindling in a city with strong strategic interest for Russia. It has been heavily under siege since the start of the invasion on February 24 and Russia is now claiming to have taken the city's port with Ukrainian fighters running out of ammunition. But the Ukraine government is so far denying that Mariupol's port has fallen. Russian state television has shown what appears to be Ukrainian soldiers surrendering at a steelworks and walking with hands up. Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday said 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had surrendered in Mariupol, which has been besieged for weeks, and that the port was fully under its control. Capturing its Azovstal industrial district, where the marines have been holed up, would give the Russians full control of Ukraine's main Sea of Azov port, reinforce a southern land corridor and expand its occupation of the country's east. Ukraine's general staff said Russian forces were attacking Azovstal and the port, but a defence ministry spokesman said he had no information about any surrender. ""Russian forces are increasing their activities on the southern and eastern fronts, attempting to avenge their defeats,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Wednesday night video address. Reuters journalists accompanying Russian-backed separatists saw flames billowing from the Azovstal area on Tuesday, a day after Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade said its troops had run out of ammunition. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, an ardent supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, urged remaining Ukrainians trapped in Azovstal to surrender. ""Within Azovstal at the moment there are about 200 wounded who cannot receive any medical assistance,"" Kadyrov said in a Telegram post. ""For them and all the rest it would be better to end this pointless resistance and go home to their families."" Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol and accuses Russia of blocking aid convoys to civilians marooned there. Its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said Russia had brought in mobile crematoria ""to get rid of evidence of war crimes."" Moscow has blamed Ukraine for civilian deaths and accused Kyiv of denigrating Russian armed forces.",47,4.0447057068913725,5.065749643718505,-1.021043936827132,29
2022-04-13,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-stricken-mariupol-21000-civilians-26707539,"Inside stricken Mariupol as 21,000 civilians killed and apartments destroyed","This aerial view of the stricken Ukrainian city of Mariupol shows how nearly every building has been ravaged by more than a month of continuous Russian bombardment. Vast apartment blocks are now charred, hollowed-out wrecks, with most windows blown out, and barely a single structure on the skyline is still intact. Smoke can be seen rising in the distance, an indication that the unrelenting shelling of civilian areas is ongoing, with Russian troops on the brink of overcoming staunch Ukrainian resistance in the key strategic port. It comes amid growing signs that Russia could be on the brink of capturing devastated Mariupol, which had a population of 450,000 before the conflict started. Today it was claimed that more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines had surrendered after running out of ammunition, food and water. They were said to be trapped in the Azovstal iron and steel works on the city’s shoreline, and had been cut off from their supply line. Local politicians, however, denied the reports, insisting that the elite troops had actually joined another battalion based in the same area. The last Ukrainian soldiers are putting up a hellish last stand in tunnels underneath the abandoned plant, to make the attackers’ bid to conquer the Sea of Azov as hard as possible. Mariupol’s mayor says 21,000 civilians have been killed during weeks of intense Russian bombardment, while 100,000 people are still waiting to be evacuated as humanitarian corridors have been repeatedly targeted by Vladimir Putin ’s forces. Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine, including the appalling bombing of a theatre in Mariupol in which children were sheltering, were officially declared war crimes in a devastating international report ordered by 45 countries. The attack on the Mariupol Theatre, in which 300 civilians died, was “most likely… an egregious violation” of humanitarian law, according to a new report for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE). In its interim findings, the report accused Putin and his generals directly of breaching international law, stating “those who ordered or executed it committed a war crime”. The OSCE also dismissed Russia’s claims that its attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol last month was “fake news”, saying the attack “must have been deliberate”. It added: “This attack therefore constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law and those responsible for it have committed a war crime.” The interim report ran to nearly 100 pages and said Russian forces have intentionally targeted healthcare sites. The report only covers the conflict up to April 1, which means atrocities against civilians uncovered in towns like Bucha and Irpin as Russian forces pulled back from Kyiv in recent weeks have not yet been fully analysed. Neil Bush, head of the UK’s delegation to the OSCE, said: “This report is just the first of likely many. “We must, as an international community, hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities that have been committed in Ukraine, including military commanders and other individuals in the Putin regime. “Soldiers and commanders who issue or follow illegal orders need to understand that their actions will be documented, and they will be held to account. Justice will be served.” The chief prosecutor from the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, visited Bucha today, and observed bodies being exhumed for identification from mass graves. He described the Kyiv suburb, where more than 400 civilians died, as a “crime scene”, and confirmed investigators “have reasonable grounds to believe the crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed”. “We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,” he went on International forensic investigators painstakingly recovered remains from the mass graves in a churchyard to identify the victims, who include many women and children. Overnight, US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a “dictator”, accusing him of genocide in Ukraine for the first time. In his strongest criticism of the Kremlin leadership since the war began, President Biden warned Putin was trying to “wipe out the idea of even being a Ukrainian”. Ukraine has claimed Russia has used mobile crematoriums in occupied regions to dispose of dead civilians. Officials also claim they were used to hide the real losses of Russian troops. Meanwhile a senior Ukrainian politician has warned there is a high likelihood that Russia will use chemical weapons against civilians. The mayor of Kharkiv said seven civilians in the city have died in the last 24 hours - including a two-year-old child. He also added that 22 have been injured following missile strikes on the besieged city. It comes as foreign intelligence sources suggested Russia is planning to muster a force that will outnumber Ukrainian troops by five to one when it launches a renewed assault on the Donbas region in the east. The redeployed force, consisting of tens of thousands of troops brought in from other areas, could begin its assault as early as the end of this week. Some of Putin’s staunchest supporters in Russia believe he will still ultimately invade the whole of Ukraine, despite pulling back troops from Kyiv to concentrate on all of the Donbas. They envisage Ukraine being wiped off the map and replaced with statelets obedient to the Kremlin - or submerged into the Russian Federation. Loyalist Russian MP Anatoly Wasserman - born in Ukraine - has given a chilling vision of the plan of Putin’s hardline backers, using the leader’s euphemistic term “de-Nazification” to justify the barbaric attacks on innocent civilians. “As long as Ukraine is independent, it remains a source of increased danger, first of all for itself, and then for everyone around,” he claimed. “I know for sure that the de-Nazification of Ukraine, while maintaining its formal independence from the rest of Russia, is impossible. As long as Ukraine is listed as independent, it is forced to follow the Nazi programme of turning its Russian majority into something anti-Russian. “So I am quite sure that the set goals of demilitarisation and deNazification will be achieved.”",45,3.9187598717041148,3.8221368245894136,0.09662304711470115,2

The huge pit containing the remains of hundreds of dead civillians was discovered after Russian troops withdrew from the town, which sits just outside Kyiv, at the start of April. Karina Yershova, 16, who was described as ""bright and talented"", was shot in the back of the head before she was thrown in the ""trash"", according to a family friend. Olesya Vasylets, a friend of Karina's mother, wrote on Facebook of her ""terrible pain"" over losing Karina before detailing the horrific circumstances of her death. Olesya wrote: 'Friends, terrible news. Racists killed my friend's daughter Karina Yershova. The pain is terrible. ""She was mocked, raped, and then shot in the trash.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Among the accusations of war crimes is a sickening report of a Russian soldier, Alexei Bychkov, raping an infant before sharing footage of the horrifying attack with a comrade online. Soldiers have also been accused of raping an 11-year-old boy in front of his mum, who was tied to a chair. Other accusations include drawn-out ordeals of sexual violence, with one woman, Elena, claiming she was raped for 12 hours, while Natalya, 33, said she was repeatedly attacked by the vile soldiers for hours after her husband was executed. One group of women, aged between 14 and 25, say they were held captive by the troops and systematically raped. Nine of them say they are now pregnant. Ukraine ’s Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova said today that five soldiers also sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl, who had fallen pregnant as a result of the atrocity. Denisova said on April 8 that Russian soldiers had kidnapped more than 120,000 Ukrainian children. A number of these children had reportedly been raped and thousands had allegedly been smuggled over the Russian border. The same day, Ukrainian official Oleksandr Vilkul told of another act of barbarism, claiming that Putin’s forces had raped a 16-year-old girl and an elderly woman. News of the latest horrific rape story comes as Putin’s soldier Bychkov was reportedly arrested in Ukraine, following the publication online of the video showing an infant being raped. Bychkov was detained in his home country on Saturday, after the sickening clip emerged on social media. It was not known exactly when and where the footage was filmed. Bychkov was also alleged to have shared other videos of child abuse with his friends and colleagues. The soldier was said to have been born in 1997, near Stavropol in southwestern Russia, and lives near Krasnodar. If the video is verified, it would be the latest war crime allegedly carried out by Russian soldiers. Today saw first official international designation of actions carried out by Russian troops as war crimes.

Another incident, where Russian troops shelled a maternity hospital in the city last month, was branded a war crime by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation and Europe's (OSCE) interim report. The report only covers atrocities committed up until April 1 - which was around the same time that Russian troops abandoned several towns and cities to refocus efforts on the pro-Russia east.

The Russian leader wants tens of thousands of soldiers in the Donbass region to ensure victory after failing to take capital Kyiv and being driven out of the region. Experts believe Moscow’s forces are now regrouping but could soon outnumber their Ukrainian counterparts by as many as five to one - which would tip the scales of battle overwhelmingly in their favour, The Times reported. Images captured by orbiting satellites have shown the build-up of troops and equipment on the border - just as they did in the days leading up to the brutal invasion of Ukraine. Should Mariupol finally fall to the invaders, as many as six thousand troops could be freed up to join the effort to take the east in the Belgorod and Voronezh regions. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former British military chief, said : “[The Russians] will try to put more ground forces in the face of the Ukrainians at once to get the force ratios right, knowing the Ukrainians in the east are in very well-prepared positions. “The Ukrainians are going to need weapons of great range and lethality.” He added the Russians will try to encircle their enemies, forcing them to leave their well defended positions they have held since fighting began with pro-Russian separatists in Donbas since 2014. It comes as Britain’s top soldier warned Ukraine and Russia are set for a “stalemate” as they prepare for a major battle in the Donbas. Chief of the General Staff General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith predicted the looming fight for the key eastern region bordering Russia is expected to be hampered by wet, boggy terrain. Kremlin forces are “at an operational pause right now as they regroup for a renewed offensive down in the south east”, the head of the Army told the Policy Exchange think tank. He added: “Whether that proves to be the decisive battle or not - at the moment we are measuring this campaign in days. “I think we ought to expect to measure it in months if not, in the scheme of things, years. “Probably at this rate, the most likely, immediate and interim outcome is a military, tactical stalemate in the Donbas with a Russian regime able potentially to claim some measure of success, and that potentially acting as a possible launch point for a subsequent campaign. “I don’t think the international community and Europe is going to be able to live comfortably with a frozen conflict in Ukraine at all.” He estimated between 10,000 and 15,000 Russian troops had been killed since war broke out on February 24, with between 20,000 and 30,000 injured. Meanwhile Putin said the invasion aimed to protect people in parts of eastern Ukraine and to ""ensure Russia's own security"".",7,4.72268253160293,5.217187000774524,-0.4945044691715932,17

In a stinging attack over the Russian assault he said that Putin was 'just trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian.' The comments came on Tuesday as Biden gave a speech at an ethanol plant in Iowa and he later stood by his words as he prepared to board Air Force One. He told reporters: ""Yes, I called it genocide because it has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian and the evidence is mounting. ""We'll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me."" Biden has repeatedly called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal, but Tuesday marked the first time he accused Russia of committing outright genocide in Ukraine. He had said at an event in Iowa on fuel prices: ""Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide a half a world away."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan have both stopped short of describing Russia's assault as a genocide in recent days. ""Based on what we have seen so far, we have seen atrocities,'' Sullivan told reporters last week. ""We have seen war crimes. ""We have not seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide.'' Shortly after Biden's remarks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted, ""True words of a true leader @POTUS. ""Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil."" Under international law, genocide is an intent to destroy - in whole or in part - a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. According to U.N. convention, this includes through killings; serious bodily or mental harm; inflicting lethal conditions and measures to prevent births, among other means. Biden has made a handful of statements about the war that U.S. officials have later had to walk back. The president stirred controversy on a recent trip to Poland when he ad-libbed a line at the end of a speech and said that Putin should not be allowed to remain in power. The White House clarified that U.S. policy was not to seek regime change. Genocide, considered the most serious international offense, was first used to describe the Nazi Holocaust. It was established in 1948 as a crime under international law in a United Nations convention. Since the end of the Cold War, the State Department has formally used the term seven times. These were to describe massacres in Bosnia, Rwanda, Iraq and Darfur; the Islamic State's attacks on Yazidis and other minorities; China's treatment of Uighurs and other Muslims and this year over the Myanmar army's persecution of the Rohingya minority. China denies the genocide claims.",45,3.9881070467806374,4.217651944965751,-0.2295448981851136,14
2022-04-13,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/boy-11-allegedly-raped-russian-26699993,Boy 'raped by Russian troops while mum was tied to a chair and forced to watch',"An 11-year-old boy was allegedly raped by Russian troops who had tied his horrified mother to a chair, forcing her to watch. Russian troops were claimed to have raped the boy in the town of Bucha, which has been under siege. Ukraine ’s Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova said five soldiers also sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl, who had fallen pregnant as a result of the atrocity. According to Sun Online reports, Denisova said on April 8 that Russian soldiers had kidnapped more than 120,000 Ukrainian children. A number of these children had reportedly been raped and thousands had allegedly been smuggled over the Russian border. The same day, Ukrainian official Oleksandr Vilkul told of another act of barbarism, claiming that Putin’s forces had raped a 16-year-old girl and an elderly woman. In a video posted on Facebook, Vilkul, the head of the military administration of Kryvyi Rih, said this was news that made his “blood run cold in [his] veins”. ""While rebuilding a peaceful life in the villages liberated in the Kherson region, a task we are currently working on, we are confronted with more and more horror stories,” he continued. ""For example, the rape of a 16-year-old pregnant girl and a 78-year-old grandmother in one of the villages towards Ingulets."" News of the latest horrific rape story comes as one of Putin’s soldiers has been arrested in Ukraine, following the publication of a video showing a baby being raped, online. The soldier, Alexei Bychkov, was said to have filmed himself abusing the baby before sending the footage to a Russian comrade. Bychkov was detained in his home country on Saturday, after the sickening clip emerged on social media. It was not known exactly when and where the footage was filmed. Bychkov was also alleged to have shared other videos of child abuse with his friends and colleagues. The man was said to have been born in 1997, near Stavropol in southwestern Russia, and lives near Krasnodar. If the video is verified, it would be the latest war crime allegedly carried out by Russian soldiers. At the end of last month The Mirror reported on Russian soldiers in Ukraine speaking of “raping girls” and “eating dogs” in horrifying audio clips from intercepted radio communications. In audio obtained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SSU), Russian soldiers can be heard nonchalantly speaking in their native language about the vile acts to others over the radio. “We have three tank guys here,” a man can be heard saying in the first clip. “They raped a girl.” A woman’s voice interrupts, to ask “who did?” “The three tankers,” the man responds. “She was 16 years old.” The woman asks if he’s talking about “our guys”, to which the man responds “yep”. The SSU collects facts on Russian war crimes for Hague, through chatbots, hotlines, messenger apps and email.",45,4.160707181517252,7.022008779950497,-2.8613015984332444,14

A video appears to show the Moscow troops blowing up one of their own armoured vehicles from just yards away in an alleged friendly fire incident. It was filmed by a Ukrainian drone in the village of Dmytrivka, just to the west of capital Kyiv, as Kremlin forces prepared to pull out of their stuttering advance. The bunched up Russian tanks are seen being suddenly attacked by a litany of blasts and explosions thought to be by enemy drones and artillery. The clip, filmed on March 31, shows the Kremlin vehicles marked with the distinctive 'V'. One of the tanks fires its main canon at another tank from almost point blank range. It could be that this was done intentionally if the tank had been disabled during the skirmish to rend it useless should Ukrainian forces capture it. According to reports, the incident saw Kyiv forces hit seven BMP-2 and one BMD-2 infantry fighting vehicles, as well as six T-72 main battle tanks. Eight soldiers were said to have been killed. Five weeks into the invasion, Russia began pulling out of its advance on Kyiv. It is thought President Vladimir Putin is now massing his forces in the country's east in an effort to record a battlefield win in the Donbas border region. Critics say it's a face saving exercise in time for the country's Victory Day parade on May 9 when Russia celebrates defeating Nazi Germany in the Second World War. The retreating troops have left behind a trail of devastation in the towns and villages around Kyiv, leading to allegations of war crimes. Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating civilian massacres in northwestern suburbs such as Bucha, Makariv and Borodyanka. The Prosecutor-General's Office also said yesterday it is looking into events in the Brovary district in the northeast. It comes as the body of a Ukrainian teen, who was allegedly raped and shot in the head by Russian soldiers, has been discovered among 400 corpses in a mass grave in Bucha. Karina Yershova, 16, who was described as ""bright and talented"", was shot in the back of the head before she was thrown in the ""trash"", according to a family friend. Among the accusations of war crimes is a sickening report of a Russian soldier, Alexei Bychkov, raping an infant before sharing footage of the horrifying attack with a comrade online. Soldiers have also been accused of raping an 11-year-old boy in front of his mum, who was tied to a chair. Other accusations include drawn-out ordeals of sexual violence, with one woman, Elena, claiming she was raped for 12 hours, while Natalya, 33, said she was repeatedly attacked by the vile soldiers for hours after her husband was executed. One group of women, aged between 14 and 25, say they were held captive by the troops and systematically raped. Nine of them say they are now pregnant.",45,3.5538817604327697,4.947387687978157,-1.3935059275453874,14
2022-04-12,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/ukrainian-soldiers-arrive-uk-days-26692082,Ukrainian soldiers will arrive in UK in days for training with British military,"Ukrainian troops will arrive in the UK in days for armoured vehicle training with the British military, the government confirmed today. UK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said the UK would step up its support for Ukraine’s Army as he warned “all options are on the table” if Russia is found to have carried out a chemical attack. Mr Heappey told LBC Radio: “There’s 120 armoured vehicles that are in the process of being made ready. “And the Ukrainian troops that will operate them will arrive in the UK in the next few days to learn how to drive and command those vehicles.” Radio host Nick Ferrari told him: “That’s tremendous, so we’re going to be training Ukrainian blokes and women on our kit here in the UK?” “Yes,” replied Mr Heappey. The UK has already been helping train the Ukrainian Armed Forces since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Speaking to the BBC Mr Heappey added: ""There are more shoulder-launched anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles that we are sending as well as loitering precision munitions, and as you heard the Prime Minister say at the weekend, we're also sending an anti-ship capability as well."" He spoke of the ""importance of upholding that the use of chemical weapons is a line that the international community simply won't tolerate"". Mr Heappey claimed Ukrainian troops can defeat Russian forces in the Donbas because of Vladimir Putin ’s “hubris”. The Russian President’s reported push for a military triumph in the fiercely-contested eastern region ahead of Moscow’s traditional May 9 Victory Parade bolstered Kyiv’s chances of winning, according to the Armed Forces Minister. Spring fighting conditions meant Kremlin soldiers risked becoming bogged down in the battle, he warned. Asked if the UK Government believed Ukrainian forces were able to repel Putin’s troops, Mr Heappey said: “We absolutely do. “There is hubris in the Russian plan for the next phase - you can conduct military options in Ukraine either in the dead of winter when the ground is frozen solid or in the summer when the ground is dry and hard. “The mud of Ukraine in the springtime has brought the Nazis to a standstill in Operation Barbarossa and Putin’s desire to have a May 9 Victory Parade through Moscow is just characteristic of the hubris and utter disregard for loss of Russian life that he has shown so far.” Terrain conditions meant Russian armoured convoys would be forced to remain on roads, making them “pretty easy pickings” for Ukrainian defenders, he added. It comes as Britain is “working urgently” to verify reports that Russian forces may have launched a chemical attack in Ukraine. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss became one of the first Western senior politicians to speak out last night - as Mr Heappey warned “all options are on the table” if chemical weapons are confirmed. He said: “The use of chemical weapons is abhorrent, does cross a line, and all options are on the table for how we respond.” Asked if that could mean direct NATO involvement, Armed Forces minister James Heappey told the BBC: “All options are on the table”. However he did also point he could not unilaterally pledge NATO involvement, and any response could also happen separately to the alliance. Last night there were unconfirmed reports from the besieged port city of Mariupol, whose mayor said more than 10,000 civilians have died in weeks of fighting. On Monday evening, Ivanna Klympush, a Ukrainian MP, tweeted: "" Russia 1.5hr ago used unknown substance in #Mariupol. ""Victims experience respiratory failure, vestib.-atactic syndrome. Most likely chem.weapons! ""This is red line beyond which must destroy economy of despotism. We demand full embargo on all fuels from #RU &heavy weapons 2UA now!"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby added from the US government: “We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely. “These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia's potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine.""",7,5.119761975931005,3.2297051554513785,1.8900568204796264,3
2022-04-12,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-moves-military-equipment-including-26696249,Russia 'moves military equipment including missile systems near Finnish border',"Russia has seemingly fired another warning to the West after reports soldiers have begun moving military equipment towards the Finnish border. The move comes as warmongering president Vladimir Putin told his enemies that they will face ""consequences"" if they ""worsen the situation"" in Ukraine. Claims their fearsome missile system have now been shifted amid a further NATO row will do little to ease tensions. Video has today emerged showing two Russian coastal defence missile systems driving ominously towards Finland's capital Helsinki, which sits on a peninsula in the Gulf of the country. Russia has warned both the Finns and Sweden against joining the intergovernmental military alliance, arguing the move would not bring stability to Europe. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her nation is still considering applying to join NATO by the summer following growing support. Putin today insisted that his stalling invasion of Ukraine would still prevail as he chillingly threatened world starvation as a result of Western sanctions against Moscow. The faltering attack, which has seen Russian troops retreat from Ukrainian cities and turn their attention on the Donbas region, is still going to plan, the flagging dictator insisted. Now the missile systems - understood to be the K-300P Bastion-P mobile coastal defence system - has been seen on the move. The deadly machine is designed to take out ships and aircrafts, military experts say. US defence officials said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been a ""massive strategic blunder"" - and is likely to lead to NATO enlargement. They expect both the Nordic neighbours to bid for membership in the months ahead. Twisted Putin vowed that troops will use ""weapons of unprecedented characteristics"" as he refuses to back down and admit his attempts to seize Ukraine are failing. He was surrounded by security officers as he touched down in the far eastern region of Amur this morning to visit a space port in commemoration of the Soviet's first manned space mission. His latest promise comes amid claims that Russian soldiers deployed illegal chemical weapons in the besieged city of Mariupol - where thousands of innocent civilians have been slaughtered. In recent weeks reports have emerged of Putin's rising paranoia, with him terrified of assassination or a coup carried out by the country's top military chiefs. War lord Putin is currently mainly living in a massive underground city protected from potential nuclear attacks that can house up to 100,000 people, it has also been claimed. The academic who first alleged the Kremlin leader is seriously ill alleges the Russian president has retreated to a vast nuclear bunker as he lives in fear of his enemies. Professor Valery Solovey, 61, also claims the dictator is unlikely to remain in politics beyond the end of this year due to poor health. The UK's armed forces minister James Heappey made his own veiled threat to the Kremlin today. He said ""all options are on the table"" if it's proven that Russian troops used chemical agents in Mariupol, which has not yet been verified by British intelligence.",4,4.5557428655467085,3.63908293362506,0.9166599319216484,26

The looming fight for the key eastern region bordering Russia is expected to be hampered by wet, boggy terrain, Chief of the General Staff General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith predicted. Kremlin forces are “at an operational pause right now as they regroup for a renewed offensive down in the south east”, the head of the Army told the Policy Exchange think tank. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox. Sign up for the free Mirror Politics newsletter “Whether that proves to be the decisive battle or not - at the moment we are measuring this campaign in days. I think we ought to expect to measure it in months if not, in the scheme of things, years,” Gen Sir Mark said. “Probably at this rate, the most likely, immediate and interim outcome is a military, tactical stalemate in the Donbas with a Russian regime able potentially to claim some measure of success, and that potentially acting as a possible launch point for a subsequent campaign. “I don’t think the international community and Europe is going to be able to live comfortably with a frozen conflict in Ukraine at all.” He highlighted seasonal conditions which could derail Moscow’s latest plan to seize the military advantage. “‘General Winter’ is busy handing over to General Mud’,” Gen Sir Mark said. “It’s just another way in which the Russian planners have been loose and casual with some of the practical realities of the campaign they have been embarked on. “It’s cost them momentum, it has cost them a lot of casualties and it’s led them into this operational pause and a major reappraisal as to the objectives of the operation.” His American counterpart, US Army Chief of Staff Gen James McConville, backed up warnings about the weather. “It's raining, it's wet … armoured vehicles - how they operate that type of terrain that’s very wet and boggy, they tend to spend a lot of time doing recovery operations and that’s going to force them to stay on roads,” he said. “When they stay on roads that gives the defenders an awful lot of opportunities to inflict (damage) on them. “It takes away the ability that an offensive force would like to manoeuvre on.” Gen Sir Mark accused Russia’s troops of failing to learn lessons from the UK’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Comparing the Kremlin’s assault on Ukrainian cities with the relentless pounding of Chechen capital Grozny two decades ago, he said: “I had assumed they had taken a different body of lessons from our own experience of our interventions over the last 20 years, and they had carefully constructed a hybrid playbook matched with a lethal and impressive inventory of conventional capability. “They had experimented with it in Syria, Libya, the Caucasus - I assumed that if they were to pursue their strategy in Ukraine, they would do so in a more indirect, asymmetric manner. “The fact they went all in with a strategy that really resembled Grozny as opposed to keyhole surgery has been a surprise.” Gen Sir Mark admitted he was “surprised” Kremlin forces had not performed better during the invasion - highlighting the “myriad of mistakes they have made”. He said the battle plan “execution has been poor”, citing “inadequate intelligence and information preparation”. “Their commanders have struggled to administer and resupply the force, and they seem to lack low-level initiative so when Plan A clearly came unstuck it has taken them sometime in order to reconfigure themselves,” he said. “We are about 47/48 days into a war they assumed might have taken five or seven.” He estimated between 10,000 and 15,000 Russian troops had been killed since war broke out on February 24, with between 20,000 and 30,000 injured. But Gen Sir Mark said the conflict showed the era of major battles on land was not over. “Many have prophesied potentially the end of land manoeuvre as being a viable instrument of warfare,” he said. “But I think land warfare, we are discovering today, has not actually been an aberration.” But, the senior military officer added: “The economics of the battlefield do seem to be changing in relation to emerging technologies. “What we can see in Ukraine today is a modernised and lethal, conventional inventory of Russian capability finding itself vulnerable - very expensive, quite exquisite, virtually-irreplaceable platforms being destroyed by very much cheaper, disposable capabilities. “Clearly there is something for both the defence industry and armies of the future.”",7,4.897660137347002,5.277335471491239,-0.3796753341442365,17

After leaving the plane Putin walked across the tarmac with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, with an agent clad in a jet black suit and tie walking just a few feet behind him. In his hand was a dark leather case - which reportedly contains Russia's 'White Button' which, if pressed, could launch nuclear missiles and cause unimaginable destruction to targets as far away as 16,000km (9,941 miles). Today was the second appearance of the case since Putin ordered the invasion of neighbouring Ukraine on February 24. Last Friday Putin was seen arriving at a funeral in Moscow with a military officer carrying a briefcase behind him. Mourners at Christ the Saviour Cathedral were removed to make way for Putin to pay his respects to the open coffin of ultranationalist and far-right lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky. In recent weeks reports have emerged of Putin's rising paranoia, with him terrified of assassination or a coup carried out by the country's top military chiefs. The military official carrying the terrifying hand luggage comes after Putin himself warned the West of ""consequences greater than any you have faced in history"" if they become involved in his invasion. The UK's armed forces minister James Heappey made his own veiled threat to the Kremlin today. He said ""all options are on the table"" if it's proven that Russian troops used chemical agents in Mariupol, which has not yet been verified by British intelligence. When questioned whether the use of the illegal weapons could trigger an on-the-ground response from British and NATO troops, he replied: ""All options are on the table"". British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Monday Britain was working with its partners to verify the details of reports that Russian forces may have used chemical agents in an attack on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where thousands are believed to have died during a near-seven week siege.

The Azov Regiment, formerly known as the Azov Battalion and formally called as the Azov Special Operations Detachment, is a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine - the country's national gendarmerie - and is based in Mariupol.

Vladimir Putin recently unleashed white phosphorus weapons in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. White phosphorous is used to cause rapid fires due to the aggressive way it combusts with oxygen. The use of the chemical is not banned under international convention when it is used as a smokescreen, but as an incendiary weapon in civilian areas, it is forbidden under the Geneva convention. The Ministry of Defence warned this morning of the ""possibility"" of Russian troops potentially using the weapon in Mariupol. In an intelligence update for April 11, the ministry said: ""Russian forces prior use of phosphorous munitions in the Donetsk Oblast raises the possibility of their future employment in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies."" Mariupol, with its strategic location on the coast of the Sea of Azov, has been battered by Russian strikes since the invasion began on February 24. Last week, dramatic footage showed the moment Ukrainian soldiers appeared to wipe out a Russian armoured personnel carrier in Mariupol. Another video from the scene shows the bodies of at least six Russian infantry troops. Putin has withdrawn his troops from Kyiv after fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces and large losses in troops and military equipment. However, Putin is not pulling out of his unjust war as he appears to continue his shelling in other parts of the country. It comes as Putin has turned to personnel from those who were discharged from service in 2012 to replace military personnel with the Russian death toll at almost 20,000 according to Ukraine. Putin is also said to be recruiting troops from Moldova, which has been classed as an occupied territory of Russia by the Council of Europe. Over the weekend, satellite images showed an eight-mile-long Russian convoy is making its way towards under-siege Ukraine marking a new phase in the conflict. Images from space showed the mass of military vehicles and artillery travelling in the direction of the eastern part of the war-torn country. Maxar technologies took the satellite images which showed the heavy military build-up as it made its way through Velykyi Burluk. The military column is headed toward eastern Ukraine according to experts who reckon it is bound for Luhansk and Donetsk. Last month the deputy head of Kyiv's police said white phosphorus munitions were deployed over Kramatorsk. Videos were taken on phones and by an ITV film crew showed a glittering light substance falling from the sky onto the city below. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared a video of material burning fiercely on the ground as it was touched with a spade. “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk,” he says in the video.",7,3.520871249981369,3.180247066223774,0.34062418375759496,27

Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station. ""Now, we are returning to life, but during the occupation we had our 'hotspots', many civilians died,"" Didych said. The number of bodies found in the grave in Buzova, which for weeks was occupied by Russian forces, was yet to be confirmed. The report was not able to be immediately verified with local officials. The corpses found in the graves appeared to be dressed in a mix of civilian and military clothing. One devastated woman was seen peering down into the manhole before breaking down. As she clawed at the earth she wailed"" ""my son, my son"". As Russian forces were engaged in an offensive against Kyiv in the first weeks of Moscow's invasion, a number of communities surrounding the capital, including Makariv, Bucha, Irpin and Dmytrivka remained under constant fire. In early April local media reported casualties found in and near Buzova, with about 30 bodies found at the time. With most of the towns and villages around Kyiv now seized back, discoveries of mass graves and civilian casualties have triggered a wave of international condemnation, in particular over deaths in the town of Bucha, northwest of the capital. On Saturday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that while the threat to Kyiv had receded, Ukraine was preparing for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country. Ukrainian officials have called on people in the east of the country to flee, as an eight-mile long Russian convoy was spotted making its way towards the country. The renewed ambush marks a new phase in the conflict. Images from space showed the mass of military vehicles and artillery travelling in the direction of the eastern part of the war-torn country. Maxar technologies took the satellite images which showed the heavy military build-up as it made its way through Velykyi Burluk. After fierce resistance from Ukraine, Russian forces withdrew from around Kyiv last week and are believed to be regrouping for a new Donbas offensive. Yesterday it was revealed Russia is trying to expand its depleted army with retired old soldiers, having suffered almost 20,000 deaths. It is thought to be recruiting soldiers from Moldova, which has been classed as an occupied territory of Russia by the Council of Europe. President Zelensky has warned the world that Russia's use of violence was a “catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone.” So far, according to Iryena Venediktova Ukraine ’s Prosecutor General, Kyiv authorities have discovered as many as 500 war crime suspects, along with 5,600 alleged war crimes.",45,4.697632740984994,2.911642885562394,1.7859898554225997,18

Alexei Bychkov has been named in Russian media as the soldier arrested and it is thought the video originates from the Ukraine conflict. If true it would be the latest Russian abomination to shock the world with Kremlin troops repeatedly accused of war crimes and genocide. The video has been shared on Telegram and other social media sites although few details about it have been confirmed. Ukraine media reports the man sent vile images and videos to a fellow soldier and it disseminated from there. On Saturday Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to the Ukraine capital Kyiv where he spoke with President Volodymyr Zelensky and walked the city's streets. Mr Johnson said that while Russian forces attacking Kyiv had suffered a defeat, their withdrawal was ""tactical"" as they prepared to refocus their military efforts on the east. He strongly condemned the ""war crimes"" being uncovered in the wake of their departure, with scores bodies of civilians who have been shot and killed being reported by the Ukrainian authorities. ""I think what Putin has done in places like Bucha and Irpin, his war crimes have permanently polluted his reputation and the reputation of his government,"" he said. Mr Zelensky welcomed the UK's ""decisive and significant support"" for his country as he urged other Western allies to intensify the pressure on Moscow. Earlier this week at the UN Mr Zelensky showed a short video of burned, bloodied and mutilated bodies, including children, in Irpin, Dymerka, Mariupol and Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing hundreds of civilians. Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia then told the Security Council that Russian troops are not targeting civilians, dismissing accusations of abuse as lies.

The reports come as Russian soldiers continue to be accused of carrying out war crimes. More than 20 people from villages and towns close to Kyiv spoke to Amnesty, several of whom had witnessed or had direct knowledge of horrifying violence committed by Russian forces. They repeatedly told of deliberate killings, unlawful violence, and widespread intimidation by Russian forces against unarmed civilians across the Kyiv region. Secretary General of Amnesty International Agnès Callamard said: ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes. “Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality. “The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime. These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command.” To date, Amnesty International has obtained evidence that civilians were killed in indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv and Sumy Oblast, documented an airstrike that killed civilians queueing for food in Chernihiv, and gathered evidence from civilians living under siege in Kharkiv, Izium and Mariupol. The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected accusations it has committed war crimes and has called allegations that its forces executed civilians in Bucha a ""monstrous forgery"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday Russian forces appeared to have committed war crimes by targeting civilians in Ukraine, but she said lawyers must investigate the alleged incidents.

The incident, in Kramatorsk, in northern Donetsk, on Friday is also understood to have left around a further 100 people wounded. Ukraine's railways boss Olexander Kamyshin said on the messaging app Telegram that thousands were at the station at the time of the strike. They were preparing to evacuate to safer regions as Russia focuses its troops on eastern Ukraine, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky subsequently lashed out on social media, accusing the invading troops of ""cynically destroying the civilian population"" and called it ""an evil without limits"". However, Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk claimed Ukrainian forces were responsible. In response, the Russian Defence Ministry said its Army did not have any targets assigned in Kramatorsk at the time of the attack. It claimed the type of missile involved is only used by Ukrainian forces. Kramatorsk was one of the only Ukrainian stations still operating. ""Two rockets hit Kramatorsk railway station,"" Ukrainian Railways said in a statement. Did you witness this incident? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk ""According to operational data, more than 30 people were killed and more than 100 were wounded in the rocket attack on Kramatorsk railway station."" Tochka U missiles are said to have been deployed, with the remnants of one seen on a patch of grass near the station. Three trains carrying evacuees were blocked in the same region yesterday after an air strike on the line, according to Kamyshin. Distressing footage from today's attack shows bodies lying on the ground among baggage as armed guards move around the scene. Pools of blood can also be seen. One particularly upsetting image shows the dead body of a station worker in an orange high-vis, with blood running through the gaps in the tiles around him. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said the attack on the rail station at Kramatorsk is a war crime and accused Putin of 'criminal endeavour in Ukraine'. Speaking at a press conference in Bucharest, Romania, he said: ""Not very far away this morning, in a place called Kramatorsk, what appears to be Russian missiles struck civilian people queuing for trains to seek a safer place from the war. ""The striking of civilian critical infrastructure is a war crime. These were precision missiles aimed at people trying to seek humanitarian shelter. ""It’s not the first time, in fact it’s sadly a repeat of many occasions when the Russian state, President Putin and his generals seek to take the war out on civilians, civilian areas and civilian national infrastructure. ""Whatever happens in Ukraine, we must not let the international community forget that What Putin is doing today is building his own cage around himself. ""Sanctions on his activities must not be freely lifted to allow him to go back to his super yachts and normality. ""What we are seeing is a criminal endeavour on a free and sovereign country. Britain and Romania and other NATO allies will not stand by and let that happen."" It is the latest atrocity involving the deaths of unarmed civilians amid Russia's catastrophic invasion. With Russian troops having withdrawn from the north of Kyiv, evidence is emerging of the devastation they caused in areas that they occupied. Local officials have said more than 300 people were killed by Russian forces in Bucha, 35 kilometres northwest of the capital Kyiv, and around 50 of them were executed. Bodies were allegedly found with signs of torture and some with bullets to the head while their hands were bound. President Zelensky said another Ukrainian town has been found in a ""significantly more dreadful"" state. Images are starting to emerge from Borodyanka, north east of Kyiv, where again Russians have been accused of targeting civilians. The Kremlin is said to be sending troops suspected of the Bucha massacre straight back to the frontline to sacrifice them, it was claimed. Wallace also vowed to do ""everything"" to ensure Putin's invasion of Ukraine is defeated. Speaking on a trip to Bucharest, he said the RAF will increase its contribution to protect Nato's eastern flank in Romania from four to six planes ""because Putin listens to only one thing and that is strength"". Mr Wallace added: ""It is that strength that Nato brings, and we're determined to bring it to the doorstep of Putin. ""We will do everything to see him defeated in Ukraine. There is more to do, Britain will do more, it will contribute more."" Testimony and other evidence of suspected war crimes in Ukraine after Russia's invasion must be collected from fleeing refugees so the acts will not go unpunished, EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson has also said on Friday. ""We have all seen the pictures, the videos of the result of war crimes.

The killing of civilians in the town of Bucha have been widely condemned by the West as war crimes, building pressure for stricter sanctions against Russia.

""There, on almost every street, is what the world saw in Bucha and other towns in the Kyiv region after the withdrawal of Russian troops.""

""Borodyanka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about (the number of) victims,"" she said. Moscow says one of the aims of its military campaign is to ""liberate"" largely Russian-speaking places such as the southern port of Mariupol from the threat of genocide by Ukrainian nationalists, who it says have used civilians as human shields. Zelensky has rejected those claims, saying they are a baseless pretext for Russia's invasion. Moscow has denied targeting civilians and says images of bodies in Bucha were staged by the Ukrainian government to justify more sanctions against Moscow and derail peace negotiations. Ukraine called on allies to stop buying Russian oil and gas, amid divisions in Europe, and to boost it militarily.

Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was ""appalled"" by the reports, adding: ""The targeting of civilians is a war crime. We will hold Russia and Putin to account."" Mr Wallace, visiting Romania for talks, said the strike was a repeat of the Russian president and his generals targeting civilians. Speaking at a press conference in Constanta, he said: ""Not very far away this morning in a place called Kramatorsk, what appear to be Russian missiles struck civilian people queuing for trains to seek a safer place from the war. ""The striking of civilians and critical infrastructure is a war crime. These were precision missiles aimed at people trying to seek humanitarian shelter."" The U.S. embassy in Ukraine described the attack as ""one more atrocity"" committed by Russian troops. On Twitter it said: ""The Russian missile attack on the Kramatorsk railway station, a hub for civilian evacuations, which left dozens of people killed and more than 100 injured, is one more atrocity committed by Russia in Ukraine. ""The world will hold (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to account."" Russia denies targeting civilians and its defence ministry has said its forces were not behind the Kramatorsk attack.",45,3.6530279166991497,4.512357939912364,-0.859330023213214,9
2022-04-07,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/intercepted-russian-radio-hears-soldiers-26662592,Intercepted Russian radio hears troops 'talk about killing civilians' in Ukraine,"Intercepted Russian radio heard soldiers discussing gunning down and killing civilians, Ukrainian intelligence has claimed. One of Moscow’s commander’s allegedly was heard screaming “kill them all” after soldiers said they had innocent civilians in their sights. Kyiv’s intelligence claimed they hacked a call during the ongoing battle of Mariupol, where an estimated 150,000 people remain trapped in the city where at least 5,000 people have been killed so far. In the intercepted call, a Russian soldier told his commander he could see two people wearing civilian clothing. The commander then responds: “Take them all out! Kill them all!” The soldier replies: “Understood.” The commander follows up with: “What are you waiting for?” He’s told “it is a village of civilians” before the Russian commander yells: “Shoot the civilian cars.” The clip was released by Ukrainian intelligence and has not been independently verified, but a BBC investigation suggested it was shot on or before March 29, west of Kyiv. This is far from the only intercepted communications that seem to have exposed Russian atrocities during the ongoing war. Germany’s spy agency picked up radio transmissions in which Russian soldiers chatted about carrying out the murders of several Ukrainians. BND officials presented the country’s parliament with the update on Wednesday after making the interception. News magazine Der Spiegel reported the chatter related to the deaths of people in the town of Bucha, the town occupied by Russian soldiers for more than a month and where 300 people were killed. But a source said they could not be sure. They said: “It's true that the federal government has indications of Russian perpetration in Bucha. ""However, these findings on Bucha refer to satellite images. The radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" In one of the transmissions a Russian is heard telling another how he shot someone on a bicycle, with some connecting it to an image of a dead body seen next to a bike in Bucha. In another a soldier says: “Firstly you question the soldier, then you shoot them.” Last month in intercepted radio transmissions Russian soldiers were heard talking of “raping girls” and “eating dogs” in horrifying audio clips. In audio obtained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SSU), Russian soldiers can be heard nonchalantly speaking in their native language about the vile acts to others over the radio. “We have three tank guys here,” a man can be heard saying in the first clip. “They raped a girl.” A woman’s voice interrupts, to ask “who did?” “The three tankers,” the man responds. “She was 16 years old.” The woman asks if he’s talking about “our guys”, to which the man responds “yep”. The next audio clip opens with a male voice asking another man “are you eating okay at least?” In response, the second male voice responds, “not too bad”. “We had Alabay (dog) yesterday”. It comes as Vladimir Putin' s flunky Dmitry Peskov insisted no war crimes have been committed in Ukraine on the same day Russia was kicked out of the UN Human Rights Council. Putin's press secretary branded the claims the Russian military was shelling civilians as ""fake"" and went as far as to say the atrocities in Bucha were a ""well-staged simulation"". Speaking to Mark Austin on Sky News this afternoon from his office in the Kremlin, Peskov reasserted his leader's position that the Russian invasion was a ""special military operation"", claiming his country was under a security threat. Mark challenged Peskov on if what was happening in Ukraine was really going to plan if they were withdrawing. Peskov said the troops are really withdrawing as ""an act of goodwill between Russia and Ukraine"" to ""lift regional tension"" and ""show Russia is ready to create comfortable conditions"". Peskov said: ""We insist that Bucha is a well-staged simulation...those people you see...they are not victims of Russia."" When faced with graphic images of the massacre in Bucha, Peskov double-down saying they were fake and staged after the Russian military had withdrawn, despite Mark insisting they have been verified and geolocated. He said: ""I will tell you it's fake.” Earlier today Russia followed Syria in 2011 in being suspended from the UN Human Rights Council after a vote of the UN General Council. She said during a visit to Romania: ""Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.”",45,4.207589397090335,3.113671036699077,1.0939183603912581,16

Peskov said the troops are really withdrawing as ""an act of goodwill between Russia and Ukraine"" to ""lift regional tension"" and ""show Russia is ready to create comfortable conditions"". When pressed by Mark on why Russian troops continue to shell cities such as Mariupol including the bombing of the hospital, Peskov sensationally said it was a fake. Peskov said: ""Mariupol will be liberated from nationalists battalions and we hope it happens sooner than later."" He continued: ""The hospital was a fake and we have very serious reason to believe it was a fake."" Mark continued to challenge Peskov on civilian casualties and asked about the horrifying reports from Bucha. Peskov chillingly said: ""We insist that Bucha is a well-staged simulation..those people you see..they are not victims of Russia."" When faced with graphic images of the massacre in Bucha, Peskov double-down saying they were fake and staged after the Russian military had withdrawn, despite Mark insisting they have been verified and geolocated. He said: ""I will tell you it's fake. Peskov added: ""We know pretty well the company that has provided these satellite images they work with the pentagon...its interesting to know that they don't have exact dates on their images so it's impossible to locate an exact date of those satellite pictures...we insist they were made after Russian troops had withdrawn."" Mark then showed a video of a civilian woman who was killed by Russian tanks, and Peskov continued to deny the allegations even as he was faced with images of Russian tanks. Mark showed the tanks have a 'V' marking on them, which is seen on Russian tanks. Peskov said: ""Those are not the tanks that were shooting. What you are showing right now is not the right tank...you have to be careful what you are showing."" When pressed on branding these claims as fakes, Peskov said: ""Well of course it can be a play of fakes, you can attach any date to an image that was made through satellite we have to doubt something..you cannot be without an investigation...you can't blame everything on Russia."" Peskov shockingly tried to blame the atrocities in Mariupol and Bucha by Ukrainian nationalists. He said: ""We have an even bigger amount of eyewitnesses of people who took part in these various situations in Mariupol and Bucha that were telling us the terrible stories of that nationalist battalion people...torturing people and not letting them leave the town."" However, he contradicted himself when saying he would be open to an independent investigation but said Russia has a ""bitter history"" with international investigations. Russia withdrew its membership from the International Criminal Court in 2016. Earlier today , Russia was suspended from the UN Human Rights Council after a vote of the UN General Council was called following the horrific scenes of death reported in Bucha. Russia was kicked out after a vote this afternoon was approved with 93 votes in favour, 24 against and 59 abstentions from member countries. Among other hard denials made by Peskov, came more shocking allegations. He claimed Ukrainian nationalists are not allowing civilians to leave and are using them as human shields against the Russian military. Peskov said: ""It's about Ukrainian nationalist personnel trying to use civil people as a shield so they are covering themselves with civil people and not letting them leave...at the start we were never shelling civil objects we were attacking military infrastructure."" It comes as NATO's Secretary-General warned that Russian forces are getting ready for a “major offensive” in eastern Ukraine - and NATO needs to be “prepared for the long haul"". Jens Stoltenberg said talks would focus on what extra military equipment members can provide to Kyiv as Ukrainian troops battle to repel Kremlin invaders.

Tetiana Oleksiienko, 69, said she was horrified when sick soldiers threatened her while digging in her garden - explaining how she stared death in the face. Fearing for her life under the threats of the sadistic soldiers, Oleksiienko fled her village if Andrivka, situated 70km outside Kyiv. She then hid in a neighbour's cellar with her terrified daughter and grandchildren. After emerging from the makeshift refuge weeks later, she returned to her home to find it completely destroyed by Russian thugs. However, Oleksiienko revealed the a huge ditch dug in the middle of her back garden remained - a horrific reminder of her encounter with the soldiers. The heartbroken 69-year-old told The Telegraph : ""They started digging with shovels and then drove in a tractor. ""I asked them: ‘What is this pit in my garden?’ And the soldiers said: ‘This is a cemetery.’ That’s what they said: ‘This is a graveyard for you.’"" She went on to say Putin's thugs were digging the pit with a view to use it as a mass grave. Oleksiienko added: ""They only failed to fill it because the Ukrainians took back control."" It comes as Russia is accused of carrying out a string of war crimes across Ukraine. Hundreds of civilians were slaughtered in the city of Bucha - with Ukrainian authorities branding Russian killers the ""butchers of Bucha"". Earlier horrifying reports also said Ukrainian women are resorting to cutting off their hair in an attempt to stop Russians from raping them, according to a town’s mayor. The world has been sickened by recent allegations suggesting invading troops are using sex attacks as a weapon of war in the under siege country. Horrifying stories have emerged from several towns and cities of troops raping women and girls in front of their families. In one account two teenage girls were raped in Ivankiv, a small town recently liberated from Russian occupiers. Deputy mayor Maryna Beschastna said the town's women are cutting off their hair to be “less attractive” to the troops, ITV reported. She said: “There was a case in one village, two sister were raped… girls of 15 and 16… children. “Women were pulled by their hair out of their basements, so that they could abuse them. ""Girls started cutting their hair short to be less attractive, so no one looks at them anymore.” The claim comes as testimony uncovered by human rights groups have ramped up calls for troops to be held accountable for their actions.

A leaked radio dispatch intercepted by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) captured the sound of an unidentified Russian troop detailing the positions of nearby non-combatants. His commander, who has also not been named, can then be heard ordering his subordinates to ""take them all f***ing out"". The soldier then clarifies that two people seen emerging from a grove are dressed in ""civilian clothes"" - but the information does nothing to change the commander's orders. ""Off them all, f***!"" he can be heard shouting. Morale among Russian soldiers appears to be low in the leaked recording, with one soldier complaining they're hopelessly outnumbered by the Ukrainians. ""Their group has 150,000 soldiers and there's f***ing 3,000 of us... They are on the left, right, encircling us, f***!"" he can be heard saying. ""There's so many of them and few of us. We don't have any support, no aviation, not a f***ing thing!'"" Ukraine says it has been able to listen in on a lot of Russian communications because their military still relies on relatively unsophisticated technology or even walkie-talkies. The horrifying audio sheds new light on the merciless violence that has been inflicted on the Ukrainian people since Russia invaded on February 24. Mariupol, a port city located in the southeast between Crimea and the Donbas region, has been one of the central targets of Russian aggression with up to 90% of the city's infrastructure believed to have been destroyed in airstrikes in recent weeks. It had a population of about 400,000 before the war, and around 300,000 remain trapped in the city now under siege, although other estimates put this figure at somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000. Up to 5,000 people are thought to have been killed in Mariupol since the shelling began, with many deaths attributed to starvation after the city's water and electricity was cut off. On March 20 Russian forces brutally bombed an art school that was sheltering 400 women, children and elderly people, ignoring the word ""children"" that had been desperately scrawled on the ground outside. One local woman said the corpses of the dead are having to be buried in sandpits in the city's kindergartens because it is softer and easier to dig quickly between airstrikes. ""I saw so many bodies, no one was able to pick all of them up,"" she told the Independent after escaping to the city of Zaporizhzhia, 200km north of Mariupol. ""People are burying them in the sand pits on top of each other."" Ukraine security officials claim Russia is preparing a ""false flag"" attack on Mariupol, which they will allegedly use to blame Ukrainian soldiers of committing against their own people. ""The main task of Russian propaganda today is to divert the attention of the audience, both international and domestic, as much as possible,"" the SBU has said. ""According to existing data, the occupiers are preparing a large-scale falsification: They plan to collect the bodies of Mariupol residents killed by the Russians themselves, and present them as mass victims of the Ukrainian troops. ""For this reason, there have been false theses recently that Ukrainians use peaceful residents as human shields."" Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said of the attacks on Mariupol: ""To do this to a peaceful city... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come.""",47,2.861107852452168,4.48709308298988,-1.6259852305377116,29

The hand in a heartbreaking picture has been identified as belonging to 52-year-old Iryna Filkina. Anastasiia Subacheva, a make-up artist from the nearby city of Gostomel, recognised the perfectly manicured fingers with red and white nail polish that had been photographed lying on the gravel. Subacheva said she felt her heart break the moment she spotted the lifeless hand on the street after Russian forces launched a barbaric attack on the city. She said: ""When I saw it, I felt physically like my heart started to break."" Ms. Subacheva, who has worked as a make-up artist in Bucha for five years, said she knew a lot of women there because she did their beauty treatments, reports the New York Times. Horrifically, her death appears to have captured in drone footage as she was pushing her bicycle home. The harrowing video suggests she was struck by a Russian tank, the armoured vehicle opening fire on the defenceless woman as she turned the corner. Her daughter - who fled Bucha before Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine - said that she pleaded with her mother not to cycle home on the day that she was killed. Iryna was a heating station operator who had reportedly reached out to Ms. Subacheva to inquire about makeup classes in a bid to follow her dream of becoming popular and increasing the number of her Instagram followers.

Ex-president and deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said Putin launched his brutal invasion of the former Soviet republic to bring peace to Ukraine, in a Telegram post. The shocking allegations were made as Western leaders shared fears Moscow is planning a new military offensive in southern and eastern parts of Ukraine. Medvedev said: ""To change the bloody and full of false myths consciousness of a part of today’s Ukrainians is the most important goal. ""The goal is for the sake of the peace of future generations of Ukrainians themselves and the opportunity to finally build an open Eurasia – from Lisbon to Vladivostok."" He further accused ""Nazis, murderers and collaborators"" of stirring up ""Russophobia"" in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The ex-Russian leader also said Putin's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine was undertaken in a bid to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-Nazify"" the country. Medvedev added the offensive ""will not only be decided on the battlefields"". He also questioned the legitimacy of Ukrainian sovereignty saying: ""The passionate part of Ukrainians has been praying for the Third Reich for the last 30 years."" The former president revealed on Wednesday Moscow intends to fight attempts to seize Russian property abroad in courts around the globe. He said: ""Our opponents … should understand that they will face a large number of cases in courts. ""Both in the national courts of the United States and Europe and in international courts."" Medvedev's comments come amid heightened concerns from Western officials including NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg that Rusasia will push to try to capture Ukraine's eastern region of Donbas in ""coming weeks"". Officials warned Russian troops may attempt to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky yesterday accused Russian military of carrying out the worst crimes since World War II. He told the UN Security Council civilians had been murdered and Russian tanks had crushed people ""for pleasure"". After finishing his speech via video link, he showed gruesome images of dead Ukrainians including charred and mutilated bodies. Mr Zelensky said: ""The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country ""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies."" He urged the UN to take action saying failure to do so would make the world body ineffectual. Mr Zelensky added: ""Are you ready to close the UN? And the time of international law is gone? ""If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately."" President Zelensky was praised for his ferocious and passionate attack on Russian military, telling the UN that ""accountability must be inevitable"". He said: ""We are dealing with a state that turns its veto at the UN Security Council into the right to [cause] death."" Before Putin launched his invasion into Ukraine, the Russian parliament's deputy chairman Pyotr Tolstoy said Finland and Ukraine should be incorporated back into an enlarged Russia. Speaking in January, he claimed NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will “crawl” back under the Kremlin’s sway after realising the “insignificance of their position”, according to Znak media. Tolstoy did not specify how this “restoration” might happen, but claimed it could be in the next ten years. He later claimed his comments about the Kremlin restoring its old empire at a Russian Press Day event had been a “joke”, but he previously made clear he holds such views. Last year he declared “there will be no Ukraine”, describing it as “part of Russia which has temporarily seceded”.

Ukrainian troops have been showing journalists grim scenes of bodies of civilians, destroyed houses and burnt-out cars in the streets in Bucha. ""This is mass murder on an unprecedented scale in Europe. We haven't seen the likes of this I think since 1995,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""I don't want to be commemorating another genocide in Europe years from now. ""We have the power, the world has the power to stop this, and it must act.""

He told Sky News: ""The war crimes are stacking up to the point that it looks like a concerted effort to reduce the Ukrainian population, and that is getting very close to the definition of genocide. ""It's absolutely right and proper that all these war crimes are being chronicled and evidence is being gathered. ""It is looking to me increasingly like genocide that is plotted from the top. The top, therefore, must bear responsibility and maybe one day, even if not in a physical court but in a court of history, be condemned."" Lord Dannatt was unsure if Vladimir Putin or his senior generals would face trial, but added that it is still possible. He told the programme: ""If you think back to the early, dark days of the Bosnian civil war, it seemed inconceivable that Milosevic (former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic) and Karadzic (Bosnian Serb former leader Radovan Karadzic) would find their way into court, but they did. ""It became perfectly possible to trace what had happened on the ground all the way up to them through this concept of command responsibility such that they were convicted.""

The images verify that corpses were lying in the open for weeks before Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, was liberated. Russian forces are accused of a litany of war crimes including murder, torture and rape, with troops carrying out acts of ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence"". Vladimir Putin's officials tried to claim that Ukraine had killed the innocent people in an act of ""provocation"" after troops withdrew - but the satellite images expose their callous lies. Devastating details have emerged of summary executions of civilians - many of who had their hands tied behind their backs - since Bucha was liberated. At least 410 were killed in and around Bucha, Ukraine said, with President Volodymyr Zelensky describing the slaughter as ""genocide"". Yesterday a mass grave of 57 bodies was uncovered in the city. Pictures taken on March 19 reveal dark objects found in the same places where rotting corpses were found after Russia withdrew. Private surveillance company Maxar Technologies also uncovered a 45ft trench where a mass grave was found in satellite images. Maxar spokesman Stephen Wood said in a statement: ""High-resolution Maxar satellite imagery collected over Bucha, Ukraine (northwest of Kyiv) verifies and corroborates recent social media videos and photos that reveal bodies lying in the streets and left out in the open for weeks."" The company previously said the first signs of excavation for a mass grave at the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints were seen on March 10. In a press conference Russian envoy to the UN Vassily Nebenzia falsely tried to pass the blame for the murders on Ukraine. She claimed the heartbreaking scenes were ""arranged by the Ukrainian information, information warfare machine"". Speaking from Bucha, Mr Zelensky vowed that Putin and his troops would be punished for the alleged war crimes. He said: ""It's very difficult to talk. It's very difficult to negotiate when you see what they did here. ""Every day we find people in barrels, cellars and everywhere else, some strangled, some clearly tortured."" He continued to reporters: ""These are war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide. You are here today and can see what happened. ""We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women, murdered children. I think it is more than ... this is a genocide."" Earlier today The Mirror reported that the Russian commander behind the atrocities in Bucha has been named and pictured. Kyiv intelligence sources have named Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade which occupied the region - as the commander in the area. Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said Mr Zelensky ""will give all the evidence"" to the international community at the Security Council meeting. ""If these awful atrocities will not change the agenda of all the world, what will change?"" the adviser asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Zhovkva said Ukraine needs ""additional weapons"", including tanks and missiles, to ""liberate more cities"" from Russia control. Dame Barbara Woodward, Britain's UN ambassador, called images coming from Bucha ""harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide"".

Heroic president Volodymyr Zelensky went into graphic detail about alleged atrocities committed by Russian troops in recently liberated towns and cities in Ukraine. He told the Security Council soldiers had slit the throats of non-combatants, raped and killed mothers in front of their children, and cut out tongues ""because they didn’t hear what they wanted to."" Mr Zelensky was referring to alleged war crimes committed in the town of Bucha - just northwest of Kyiv - which was recently abandoned by Russian forces after Vladimir Putin ordered the military refocus their brutal efforts in the Donbass region. The Ukrainian leader went on to say the atrocities were ""just for their pleasure"" and that soldiers ""cut off limbs"" and ""slashed their [civillian's] throats"". The president then compared Russia to ISIS during his address to the UN Security Council today. Mr Zelesnky, who visited Bucha yesterday, said there was ""not a single crime that they (Russian forces) would not commit"". Mr Zelensky said entire families had been slaughtered and troops tried to burn their bodies, and that people were shot in the street or thrown into wells. He said: ""This is no different from other terrorists such as Daesh who occupy some territories, and here it is done by a member of the United Nations Security Council."" He said: ""They support hatred at the level of the state and seek to export it to other countries through their system of propaganda and political corruption."" Though Bucha is the town that has become the focal point of the war crime allegations against Moscow, Mr Zelensky said it is ""only one of many examples"" of where Russian troops murdered, raped and mutilated innocents. During the meeting, convened by the UK, Mr Zelensky said: ""Today, as a result of Russia's actions in our country, in Ukraine the most terrible war crimes of all times, that we've seen since the end of World War Two, have been committed. ""Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes, they are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. ""They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from the hostilities. ""They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from air strikes. They are deliberately creating conditions in the temporarily occupied territories so that as many civilians as possible are killed there. ""The massacre in our city of Bucha is unfortunately only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days, and there are many similar cities, similar places, where the world has yet to learnt he full truth... dozens of other Ukrainians communities, each of them similar to Bucha."" Mr Zelensky then called for the UN to be reformed to combat Russian aggression. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has a veto with which it is able to block attempts to censure the Kremlin. ""This undermines the whole architecture of global security, it allows them to go unpunished so they are destroying everything that they can,"" he said. Ukrainian president Mr Zelensky said: ""Russia's leadership feels like colonisers in ancient times, they need our wealth, our people - Russia has already deported hundreds of thousands of our citizens to their country, they abducted more than 2,000 children."" He told the United Nations that Russia's forces were engaged in ""widescale looting"" from food to gold earrings ""pulled out and covered with blood"".

But there are mounting fears they are also prepared to commit even more barbaric war crimes in other areas of Ukraine to the east of the country. Ukrainian spies believe the notorious 64th Motorised Rifle Brigade will be sent into battle “hotspots” with little chance of survival, as the Kremlin scrambles to try and avoid them being alive for war crimes trials. Today Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence Agency said: ”Russian command will not rotate personnel in this unit and will throw them back to the frontline. “The Russian servicemen who committed atrocities in Bucha are being returned to Ukraine. “The 64th Motorised Rifle Brigade of the 35th All Russian Army whose servicemen committed mass murder and tortured civilians will be returned to Ukraine.” Sources said they believe Russia wants the men to be killed so there will be no living witnesses to the Bucha killings. They are thought to include “Butcher of Bucha” Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade. After his troops pulled out of Bucha more than 410 corpses were discovered of civilians, many of them with their hands tied and executed with a bullet to the head. Torture chambers have been found, where men were brutally beaten before being killed and the bodies of women and children have also been discovered. The remains have been removed from the town and are being examined by forensic experts preparing to present evidence in future war crimes trials. Today’s statement from intelligence chiefs added: “Another goal of the rapid return of the 64th Brigade to the territory of Ukraine is the rapid disposal of unnecessary witnesses. “That is redeployment to a section of the front where they will have no chance of surviving to make it impossible to testify in future courts.” It goes on to claim the disgraced troops have opposed the move but they have been ignored and will get just two days’ leave before going back into battle. Russia is under increasing pressure as its military has now suffered a death toll of almost 20,000 in almost six weeks of fighting. Moscow’s forces are continuing to suffer huge losses, retreating from major cities in central Ukraine, heading north from Kyiv and east towards Donbas. They have left dead bodies booby-trapped and trip-wires attached to grenades and mines in their wake, adding to the horror facing returning civilians. Luhansk governor Sergiy Gaiday said Russia is planning a major attack in the region as he ordered a mass evacuation. It is feared 60,000 Russian reservists are being called up to bolster a fresh offensive in the east in contested Donbas and possibly Kharkiv. Today Ukraine also revealed the Kremlin is planning more horrific “false flag” provocations - resorting to using the remains of Mariupol’s citizens. Kyiv’s SBU intelligence agency believes Kremlin spooks plan to pile more horror on the stricken port by claiming the dead were massacred by Ukraine. The agency - Ukraine’s equivalent of MI5- said: “According to available date the occupiers are preparing a large-scale falsification. “They plan to gather in one place the bodies of Mariupol residents killed by the Russians themselves and present them as mass victims of Ukrainian troops. “False theories have been circulating that ‘Ukrainians are using civilians as human shields. This is an outright delusion.” Sources have told the Daily Mirror that Ukraine’s intelligence agencies have had huge support from western intelligence, especially the UK and US. It has led to Moscow’s covert operations and false flag plans being leaked repeatedly as Ukraine has been able to second-guess the Kremlin. The Mirror understands that much of this intelligence has been hoovered up by British spy planes patrolling the region in the build-up to the invasion. Ukraine has also had constant updates from western allies on telephone conversations and other communications between Russian commanders. Today NATO warned of a fresh offensive by Russia in the east of Ukraine. The alliance’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: “We are seeing a new face of the war.” He added that Putin’s troops are being “remanned” and “rearmed” ahead of a “new, very concentrated Russian offensive in Donbas.” The Donbas region has been heavily contested between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists backed by regular Moscow troops for over eight years. The war in east Ukraine was triggered by the pro-European Maidan protests in 2014 which led to Putin ordering the annexing of Crimea and the arming of separatists. Moscow’s GRU spooks also spread lies via puppet media throughout the region and Russia about Kyiv’s government being supported by “fascists.” Putin’s argument for the invasion of “denazification” has been justified by the false narrative already spread about nazis being rife in Ukraine.",45,3.3778335300835387,3.300432890982087,0.07740063910145167,6

Bodies with bound hands, close-range gunshot wounds and signs of torture lay scattered across cities including Bucha and Hostomel causing global outrage. As Russian troops have eased back from their attacks on Kyiv and northern Ukraine, the extent of the devastation caused by the invasion is beginning to be fully understood. And there are reports of apparent torture and murder of civilians with bodies lying in the streets and claims of how people were randomly gunned down. Hostomel was the scene of intense fighting at the start of the invasion before Ukraine soldiers finally regained control of the strategically important airport. The Hostomel mayor Yriy Pzylyko was among those killed and his body was left with explosives to try and cause more death and destruction, reported The Times. Archpriest Piotr Pavlenko went to see the body of the mayor who was his friend but he was told not to touch the corpse as it would explode. It follows reports that bodies were left rigged with explosives in Irpin on top of the signs of torture taking place in Bucha. Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Yurchenko claimed the attacks on civilians in Bucha were especially disturbing. “Bucha was not so badly damaged as Hostomel but crimes were carried out deliberately on the civilians,” Yurchenko said, reported The Times. “Now we are discovering this is the case for so many places that the Russians occupied. In places where the fighting was intense, like Hostomel, probably more people have been killed. In occupied places like Bucha, women were raped, children were shot, people’s bodies were run over.” President Volodymyr Zelensky also hit out at the torture and claimed bodies were ""mined"". ""After what was revealed in Bucha and our other cities the occupiers were expelled from. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Corpses on the streets. Mined area. Even the bodies of the dead were mined,"" he said. ""The pervasive consequences of looting. Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers. Torturers. Rapists. Looters. Who call themselves the army. And who deserve only death after what they did."" Zelensky gave a message to Russians wanting mothers to know what the soldiers were doing to civilians in Ukraine. ""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed?"" he said. ""What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? ""How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible? ""Russian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers? You couldn't be unaware of what's inside your children. You couldn't overlook that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure.""",45,2.6552037672161823,2.9433758410055586,-0.28817207378937626,18

It comes as ""mounting evidence"" of war crimes committed by Russian forces in the city near capital Kyiv will be discussed by a United Nations Security Council today. The Ukrainian President - who was seen holding back tears as he visited the aftermath on Monday - will address the council, which is pushing to ensure ""justice is done"". Volodymyr Zelensky surveyed the alleged atrocities near capital Kyiv, describing the discovery of raped women and murdered children among the dead. He was accompanied by defending servicemen after invading troops had retreated from the area. US President Joe Biden called for Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to face a war crimes trial, adding he is now seeking further sanctions against Russia. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone's seen it,"" he said in an impassioned speech last night. Ukrainian officials have vowed to hunt down the ""butchers of Bucha"" after hundreds of dead civilians were discovered. Kyiv intelligence sources have named Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade which occupied the region - as the commander in the area. Growing evidence points to barbarism in Bucha with local women and children raped and shot and demands are growing for accountability over atrocities by Vladimir Putin's forces. Zelensky has warned that worse evidence of mass killings of civilians by Moscow will emerge as the Russian president repositions his troops to the south-east. It will be his first address to the Security Council, whose presidency is held by the UK, with members including Russia and China. The Ukrainian leader accused Moscow of committing ""real genocide"", as he appeared visibly emotional, flanked by his soldiers and wearing a bullet-proof vest. Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said Mr Zelensky ""will give all the evidence"" to the international community at the Security Council meeting. ""If these awful atrocities will not change the agenda of all the world, what will change?"" the adviser asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Dame Barbara Woodward, Britain's UN ambassador, called images coming from Bucha ""harrowing, appalling, probable evidence of war crimes and possibly a genocide"". She cited hundreds of bodies being dumped in the streets or in mass graves and allegations of rape. Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs."" He added: “Irpen, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with this, and is it worth living at all? How do I explain this to myself, how? “They must cease to exist. They must all be destroyed, each and every one of them, turned into dust, into mud, into clay, all of them.” Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identified the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia - and a number of other Russian military units. Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: ""In Bucha there was a military unit 51460 from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region... “Soon all these murderers, rapists and looters will be known by name."" InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit 51460 of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha. In the city, too, according to the Ukrainians, were forces from the Fifth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of 36th army of the Russian Eastern military district, the 331st Parachute Assault Regiment of 98th airborne division, the 137th Parachute Assault Regiment of 106th airborne division, the 104th and 234th Air Assault Regiments of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division, 14 and 45 separate guard brigades of special purpose; the 63rd special operational regiments of the Russian national guard, and the 155th separate guards brigade of marines of the Pacific Fleet. So far no commanders have been named from these forces apart from Omurbekov. Russian sources have hit back claiming the Ukrainians were responsible for the atrocities in Bucha and other locations - and are the ones guilty of war crimes. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these false accusations.” He said: ”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March 30. “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself. ""I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces.ed Forces. On the contrary, our troops delivered 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. ""Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US. “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, said: “There are no doubts that it is a staging organised by Kyiv authorities. “And the fact that the West has picked it up and is hyping it makes it an accomplice of this cynical and immoral crime.” Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia. ""I think that the very fact that these statements were made minutes after these materials were released leaves no doubts as for who has contracted this story,"" she told state-run Rossiya-1 television channel. The West decided immediately Russia was to blame “based on the videos, seconds-long videos and several photos. “And they are ready to pour accusations. “No expert work done, no information from the other side throwing light on what is going on..."" She claimed the massacres were ""a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks. Also today, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will hold talks with her Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, during the second day of her visit to the capital, Warsaw. She has called for Russia to be hit with the ""maximum level"" of sanctions and for more weapons to be supplied to Mr Zelensky's forces to help repel the Kremlin's troops. ""The idea that we should wait for something else bad to happen is just completely wrong,"" she said, applying pressure to allies. ""The reality is that money is still flowing from the West into Putin's war machine - and that has to stop."" She pressed for a ""clear timetable"" to eliminate imports of Russian oil, gas and gold, and for a further crackdown on industries financing Moscow's invasion. Poland's prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for focusing on the ""voices of German businesses"" rather than the innocents slain in Ukraine.

The military is recruiting former soldiers near civilian retirement in Chelyabinsk and Tyumen, two Siberian cities, according to Russian state media. It is understood that tank commanders, snipers and engineers are among the most sought after positions after a series of strategic blunders have left them short on the front line, The Times reported. It comes as Russia plunged to new desperate measures in an attempt to continue its brutal war with its neighbour by calling up 60,000 reservists, mainly from ethnic minority groups, as well as drafting some 134,500 new conscripts. The use of conscripts in the Russian president Vladimir Putin's bloody and violent war has been controversial with many inexperienced young men already killed or captured by Ukrainian forces. Conscripts are men aged between 18 and 27, who typically serve for one year but defence experts have said teenagers are being sent to the ""slaughterhouse"", prompting the Kremlin to U-turn and promise not to send new recruits into the heat of battle. However, it has since been reported that Putin plans to send 130,000 new conscripts to fight in Ukraine as Russia gets increasingly desperate for boots on the ground. A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “Putin has signed over 130,000 new conscripts into the Army. “The timing aligns with previous Spring drafts but we think that’s an unusually high number. “We do think there’s a realistic possibility these conscripts will be sent into Ukraine, even though the Russian MOD have said only professional soldiers will go to Ukraine.” They added Russia is deploying forces from Georgia, which it invaded in 2008. The official said: “Russia is redeploying elements of the forces that are in Georgia to reinforce the invasion of Ukraine. “We don’t think that this was planned, it’s a very odd thing for the Russian military to do. So we suspect it’s indicative of the problems they are having in Ukraine.”",7,6.32416735060357,6.8506242474770245,-0.5264568968734542,12

During the UK-convened meeting of the UN's most powerful body, whose membership includes Russia, Mr Zelensky called for those responsible to be ""brought to justice"" in a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials. Zelensky warned the world is yet to see the acts committed by the Kremlin's troops in other regions after evidence of atrocities was unearthed after their withdrawal from Bucha, near Kyiv. ""Today, as a result of Russia's actions in our country, in Ukraine, the most terrible war crimes we've seen since the end of World War Two are being committed,"" he said in the virtual address. ""Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation.

""The massacre in our city of Bucha is unfortunately only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days."" Mr Zelensky, in his first address to the council, accused Russia of ""wanting to turn Ukraine into silent slaves"" and its military of ""wide-scale looting"", stealing everything from food to bloodied jewellery. ""The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine,"" he said. ""Anyone who has given criminal orders and carried out them by killing our people will be brought before the tribunal, which should be similar to the Nuremberg tribunals."" Mr Zelensky played allies a video appearing to show bound, killed and burned civilians and mass graves in images from across his nation that the UK's ambassador to the UN Dame Barbara Woodward described as ""harrowing"". Meanwhile, on the second day of her trip to Warsaw, Ms Truss reiterated her vow to use Thursday's meeting of G7 and Nato allies to press for further sanctions. Having met Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and her Polish counterpart, she said economic actions so far are having a ""crippling impact"" and ""pushing the Russian economy back into the Soviet era"". She said the West has frozen more than 350 billion US dollars (£266 billion) of ""Putin's war chest"", rendering unavailable over 60% of the regime's 604 billion US dollars (£459 billion) of foreign currency reserves. But she said they must go further, to include further cracking down on Russian banks and ""going after industries that are filling Putin's war chest, like gold, and agreeing a clear timetable to eliminate our imports of Russian oil, coal and gas"". Mr Morawiecki has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for focusing on the ""voices of German businesses"" rather than the innocents killed in Ukraine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to urge Germany to set a date for phasing out Russian gas when he meets Mr Scholz in Downing Street on Friday. The UK, which currently holds the Security Council's presidency, convened the meeting to discuss seeking justice over the ""mounting evidence of war crimes"". Mr Zelensky made his address a day after visiting Bucha to witness the fallout and warning of further atrocities as the Russian president repositions his troops from around the capital to the south east. Russia's envoy to the UN Vasily Alekseevich Nebenzya also addressed the meeting, disputing the evidence of atrocities in Bucha, criticising Mr Zelensky and repeating baseless allegations of Nazism among Kyiv's leadership. However, the Kremlin's claims that the footage of bodies in the town has been ""staged"" has been contradicted by satellite images showing corpses in the street nearly two weeks before Russians fled the town. The Nuremberg trials were held to bring Nazi war criminals to justice following the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. The court cases, held in 1945 and 1946, tried the criminal actions of German professionals, industrialists, the SS, and the military officers tied to Adolf Hitler.",45,3.048897307977843,2.5141402541734013,0.5347570538044417,19

Footage shows what appears to be a decommissioned vehicle sent by London Ambulance Service go up in smoke under heavy fire from Russian tanks, in the southern Ukrainian city that has been under siege. It is yet another example of non-military targets that have been attacked by Vladimir Putin ’s invading army after atrocities came to light this week in cities on the outskirts of Kyiv that included claims of people being shot in the back of their head with their hands tied in Bucha. Ambulances packed with medical equipment were driven by 26 volunteers from the UK to Ukraine last week. Mykolaiv governor Vitaly Kim sarcastically suggested that the tanks were aiming at a robot that was put in the gardens of the children’s hospital for the benefit of the youngsters. He said: ""And then they were aiming at a super-modern robot on the territory of the hospital."" Head of the Mykolaiv Regional Council, Anna Zamazeeva, said on April 5 that the images showed ""yesterday's attack on a secret medical facility - an ambulance substation."" She added: ""The Russian occupiers yesterday again 'chaotically' fired rockets at Mykolaiv and Ochakov. But for some reason, most of the rockets flew to the area of hospitals, schools, nursery schools and residential areas... ""Unfortunately, yesterday, two children were injured from these shellings - a seven-year-old child in Ochakov and a fourteen-year-old child in Mykolaiv. ""Another child, unfortunately, died during the evening shelling. Sincere condolences to family and friends! We will never forgive the 'Russian world' for the suffering and death of our children! You will answer for everything!"" The siege of Mykolaiv began on the night of 26th February and is still ongoing. The city is a strategically important shipbuilding centre on the Black Sea as it lies en route to Odesa, which holds important status in Russian culture and history and is believed to be coveted by the Kremlin. Decommissioned ambulances are also being donated by South Central Ambulance Service with equipment to save hundreds of lives which have been collected by staff from bases across the south of England. Further lorry loads of vital items are set to leave from a base in Didcot, Oxfordshire, on Saturday, reported the Express. Kate Ellis, a paramedic team leader in Oxfordshire, said: ""The response we have seen throughout the organisation has been incredible from the very start and we have now ramped it up further with the donation of medical supplies and equipment which we know are so desperately needed in the conflict zones. ""This will help to ensure people can receive care for up to 24 hours while they await emergency surgery in hospital, meaning there is the potential for this work to help save hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. ""We estimate our volume of supplies will be able to supply one field hospital for up to two weeks and some of the equipment, such as the long boards and extrication devices, is of course reusable."" Will Hancock, chief executive of SCAS, said: ""We are all extremely proud of this work to support those most in need. ""The resolve everyone has shown to not only keep delivering in the day job after such a tough time of late but also drive forward with this outstanding voluntary programme is truly amazing."" Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement that its team witnessed Russian strikes during a visit on April 4 to a cancer hospital in Mykolaiv and managed to take cover and escape unharmed. ""Several explosions took place in close proximity to our staff over the course of about 10 minutes,"" said Michel-Olivier Lacharite, MSF head of mission in Ukraine. ""As they were leaving the area, the MSF team saw injured people and at least one dead body.""",47,5.049420737211658,5.653923058920142,-0.604502321708484,21

A clip recorded next to the blitzed Russian military vehicle appears to show household items strewn on the ground after they were allegedly plundered when Vladimir Putin's troops scurried through civilian homes in Ukraine. Among the looted items on the video are cooking pans, electric drills, and even children's toys. In further signs that the Kremlin's chaotic invasion has descended into pandemonium, the troops were allegedly ambushed, in the northeastern town of Sumy, close to the Russian border. The footage was shared by German journalist, Julian Ropcke, who writes for Bild.de. He tweeted: ""These Russians stole pans, toys, drills. But for this group, the raid in Sumy ended in death."" A grim photo shows the corpses stacked on top of each other beside the armoured personnel carrier they went raiding in. Just days ago, Ukrainian sources claimed as many as 17,000 Russian troops have been slain during the five-week war. Estimates from NATO suggest the number is significantly lower, at between 7,000 and 15,000 soldiers. It comes after Moscow redrew its attack lines, ordering troops withdraw from areas of northern Ukraine to refocus efforts on the Donbass region. Over the past few days Ukraine has retaken over 30 towns and villages in the Kyiv region. As the Russian soldiers abandon the cities and towns, they've been leaving behind mines and booby traps, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And as journalists enter the ""liberated"" areas, evidence has emerged of alleged atrocities - including the rape of women and children, post-mortem mutilations of torture victims, and the extrajudicial slaughter of innocent civilians. The revelations of recent days come after Russia announced it was going to scale down military operations around Kyiv and refocus its efforts in the pro-Russia east. Some have speculated this was in an attempt to limit the country’s losses and reinforce its forces who are already stretched thin. In a video address released last week, President Zelensky said: ""In the north of our country, the invaders are leaving. “It is slow but noticeable. In some places they are being kicked out with fighting. Elsewhere they're abandoning the positions themselves. ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" But at the time, Zelensky was unaware of the full picture. In the days that followed, evidence of war crimes emerged from formerly occupied towns, like Bucha to the northwest of the capital. Zelensky today told the UN Security Council soldiers had slit the throats of non-combatants, raped and killed mothers in front of their children, and cut out tongues ""because they didn’t hear what they wanted to."" The Ukrainian leader went on to say the atrocities were ""just for their pleasure"" and that soldiers ""cut off limbs"" and ""slashed their [civillian's] throats"". After comparing the Russian soldiers to ISIS, he went on to add there is ""not a single crime that they (the Russian forces) would not commit"".",45,3.059122340746198,3.318739220345732,-0.2596168795995344,18

Deeply disturbing reports began emerging from the town over the weekend which the invading forces left in front of a trail of destruction. It is feared that local women and children have been raped and civilians shot mercilessly and left in the street to die. The numbers of dead in the Kyiv Oblast town are suspected to stretch into the hundreds. Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, which leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade which occupied Bucha, is the first senior military official connected to the massacre to be named. Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs."" He added: “Irpen, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with this, and is it worth living at all? “How do I explain this to myself, how? They must cease to exist. “They must all be destroyed, each and every one of them, turned into dust, into mud, into clay, all of them.” Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identified the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia rather than Kyiv Oblast - and a number of other Russian military units. Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: ""In Bucha there was a military unit 51460 from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region... “Soon all these murderers, rapists and looters will be known by name."" InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit 51460 of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha. Forces from several other groups are also suspected of being in the town, including those from the Fifth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of 36th army of the Russian Eastern military district and the 331st Parachute Assault Regiment of 98th airborne division. So far Omurbekov is the only commander to be named. Russian sources have denied that they are responsible for the massacre, claiming that the Ukrainian army slaughtered its own people. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these false accusations. ”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March 30. “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself. ""I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces. ""On the contrary, our troops delivered 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. ""Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US. “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia for the massacre, which she said was ""a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks. The unsupported claims from Russian officials are typical of those which have been heard throughout the invasion and clearly aim to sow doubt and division within Ukraine and its allies. The scale of the massacre and its depraved nature has prompted a response from Western leaders, while it has been reported that Boris Johnson will seek to galvanise a tough response from allies to the crisis. On its 73rd anniversary, the Prime Minister will hail Nato as the ""greatest security alliance in the history of the world"" - adding that it has a responsibility to support the Ukrainian people as they fight for freedom with ""every fibre of their being"". It comes after the PM condemned Russia's ""despicable attacks"" against Ukrainian civilians in Irpin and Bucha, adding that ""we will not rest until justice is served"". This week he will welcome the Polish and German leaders to Downing Street for discussions on Nato and how to support Ukraine as it stands up to Russian aggression. On Sunday, Mr Johnson said ""no denial or disinformation from the Kremlin"" can conceal that President Vladimir Putin is ""desperate"" and ""his invasion is failing"". An adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said dead civilians had been found on the streets of the small city of Bucha and the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, in what resembled a ""horror movie"". In Bucha, north-west of Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers used cables to drag bodies off a street - from a distance due to fears they may be booby-trapped - as Russian troops withdraw and focus attacks on other parts of Ukraine. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found in Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. In a statement, Mr Johnson said the UK was ""stepping up"" its sanctions and military support, and ""bolstering"" humanitarian help for those on the ground. He added: ""The UK has been at the forefront of supporting the International Criminal Court's (ICC) investigation into atrocities committed in Ukraine. ""The Justice Secretary has authorised additional financial support and the deployment of specialist investigators - we will not rest until justice is served."" Earlier on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said ""indiscriminate"" attacks by Russian forces against innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha must be investigated as war crimes. Ms Truss said the UK would ""not rest"" until those responsible for ""atrocities"" in Ukraine had faced justice, adding that Russia would not be allowed to cover up its involvement through ""cynical disinformation"". Mr Zelensky's spokesman Sergey Nikiforov said authorities in Ukraine had found what looked ""exactly like war crimes"", including the bodies of executed civilians and mass graves.",45,2.8802405649975946,3.2017605684557844,-0.32152000345818976,18

Vladimir Putin's forces have been accused of genocide after evidence of summary executions, torture and rape was found in areas formerly under their control. Harrowing images from Bucha, on the outskirts of capital Kyiv, show bodies piled up in the street, with witnesses saying many appeared to have been shot while their hands were bound behind their backs. A bombshell report by Human Rights Watch yesterday said Russian forces had carried out ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence"" directed toward the Ukrainian population. Putin's troops have been accused of carrying out a ""massacre"" that ""could amount to genocide"" in Bucha, while allegations of violence toward civilians have been documented across the country. It is now feared that barbaric acts will be uncovered in cities such as Mariupol, which has been the focus of Russian invaders, with missiles raining down on the population for weeks. Tymofiy Mylovanov, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, warned that there could be worse to emerge. He posted on Twitter : ""The war crimes in Brovary and Chernihiv directions might be more heinous that those in Bucha. We have eyewitness accounts through friends, relatives and students."" Defence minister Dmytro Kuleba said he feared the situation in the besieged city of Mariupol would be even worse. He said: ""Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can."" These fears were echoed by Marie Yovanovitch, former US Ambassador to Ukraine, who said: ""I think it is clear what we're going to find [in Mariupol].. and it is going to be probably even worse than Bucha."" Yesterday Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba branded Russia ""worse than ISIS"", accusing invaders of killing ""out of anger and just because they wanted to kill"". He said: ""We understand they were killing civilians while leaving, while withdrawing, while staying there in this town of Bucha and also in other towns and villages in key regions, but also while withdrawing from them out of anger and just because they wanted to kill. ""There was no good reason for them. These were not guerrillas, they were not people opposing them. ""Russia is worse than ISIS, full stop."" Ukraine's defence ministry shared harrowing footage of the sight that greeted liberators in Bucha after the Russians withdrew, likening it to Srebrenica in Bosnia, where 8,000 Muslim men and boys were slaughtered in 1995. It said: ""New Srebrenica. The city of Bucha was in the hands of animals for several weeks. ""Civilians were being executed arbitrarily, some with hands tied behind their backs, their bodies scattered in the streets of the city."" Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said: ""The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians. ""They practically got a green light from Putin for a safari and they were shooting Ukrainian people.'' Human Rights Watch (HRW) has outlined several incidents relayed to them by witnesses. Witnesses who survived the brutal occupation before Russian forces withdrew have claimed that civilians including children, were tortured. Soldier Sergeiy Torovik told The Times he had been appalled by what he had seen in his hometown of Stoyanka, close to Kyiv. He described Russian troops as ""lower than animals"", recounting the horrific scenes he had encountered in a basement of a home, where he said 18 bodies were recovered. ""Some of them had their ears cut off,"" he said. ""Others had teeth pulled out. There were kids like 14, 16 years old, some adults. ""They just took the bodies away yesterday.” Jack Watling, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said that Russia would have planned its savagery toward civilians. He said: ""This was the plan, it was premeditated. ""If the Russian military had been more successful there would have been more towns like it."" Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at HRW, said: “The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.” He continued: “Russia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers. “Commanders should recognize that a failure to take action against murder and rape may make them personally responsible for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.”",45,3.0426560304801176,2.283423651594339,0.7592323788857787,14

Vladimir Putin's war effort is ironically reliant on the manufacturing power of the nation he's invaded, with his warships, tanks, missiles and fighter jets needing components from the opposition, sources say. It comes as there is a desperate hunt for the Butchers of Bucha after women and children were raped and shot by Russians, according to Ukrainian sources. Deeply disturbing reports began emerging from the town over the weekend which the invading forces left in front of a trail of destruction. It is feared that local women and children have been raped and civilians shot mercilessly and left in the street to die. Moscow has said it will reduce military activity near primary targets Kyiv and Chernihiv amid peace talks - though such claims have been met with skepticism. Ukraine and the West fear the Kremlin is simply looking to regroup before moving its focus on the Donbas region, rather than to try and promote trust. Putin could also look to use the southern port city of Mariupol, which has been decimated by Russian bombs, to more easily ship fresh supplies for a second wave attack. Senior defence sources told the Telegraph the Kremlin's military stocks are ""pretty bad"" as the invasion effort continues to drag on beyond initial estimations. Soldiers are said to be running low on weapons, while the withdrawal from Kyiv has meant dozens of tanks being abandoned. Meanwhile, the likes of the T-72 tank, a key component in Moscow's arsenal, needs parts said to be made in the eastern Ukrainian city of Izyum, which invading troops have failed to capture. Some estimates suggest defending troops have taken or destroyed at least 2,000 tanks and armoured vehicles. Similarly, the Kh-55 cruise missile is said to be reliant on an engine manufactured in Kharkiv. Sanctions put on Russia in an effort to force Putin into abandoning his war mean he can't buy arms from the likes of France, a major supplier since the Kremlin's Crimea invasion in 2014. On the flip side, Ukraine is continuing to receive more modern weaponry from NATO countries. This includes 4,000 anti-tank weapons (NLAWs) and Javelin anti-tank systems, as well as anti-aircraft missiles. Reports also say the British designed Starstreak missile was used by Ukrainian forces to take out a Russian helicopter.",7,3.6917126766208157,3.4092395650027822,0.28247311161803346,6

Pictures show the grave site with an approximately 45-foot long trench in the southwestern section of the area near the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints in Bucha. Global outrage spread on Monday over civilian deaths in Ukraine including evidence of bound bodies shot at close range and a mass grave found in areas retaken from Russian troops, as artillery bombarded the country's south and east. Taras Shapravskyi, deputy mayor of Bucha, a town around 40km northwest of Kyiv, said 50 of some 300 bodies found after the Kremlin's forces withdrew late last week were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops. Reuters reporters saw one man sprawled by the roadside, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, though the agency could not independently verify those figures or who was responsible for the killings. Ukrainian authorities were investigating possible war crimes as Moscow said killings were ""staged"" to sully Russia's name. Pictures of the destruction and apparent killings of civilians sparked shock and condemnation and looked set to galvanise the United States and Europe into fresh sanctions against Moscow. But it was not clear how quickly a new package could come together or if it would include Russian energy exports. The atrocities were also set to overshadow peace talks between Russia and Ukraine due to restart by video link on Monday. Asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would be held accountable for the civilian killings , Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said others also shared the blame. ""I think all the military commanders, everyone who gave instructions and orders should be punished,"" he told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" news program. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the images as ""a punch in the gut,"" while United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation. ""Putin and his supporters will feel the consequences,"" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, adding that Western allies wouldagree on further sanctions in the coming days. Germany's Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union must discuss banning the import of Russian gas -a departure from Berlin's prior resistance to that idea. French President Emmanuel Macron said there were very ""clear clues pointing to war crimes"" by Russian forces and that newsanctions was needed, and Japan said it would consult with allies on that issue. Macron said new sanctions should include oil and coal. The UN Security Council will discuss Ukraine on Tuesday and will not meet on Monday as requested by Russia, said Britain's mission to the United Nations, which holds the presidency of the 15-member council for April. Russia had requested the Security Council convene on Monday to discuss what it called a ""provocation by Ukrainian radicals""in Bucha after Kyiv's accusations. Russia has previously denied targeting civilians and has rejected allegations of war crimes in what it calls a ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarising and ""denazifying"" Ukraine. Ukraine says it was invaded without provocation. Human Rights Watch said it had documented ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in the Ukrainian regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv. Ukraine's foreign minister called on the International Criminal Court to collect evidence of what he called Russian warcrimes. The foreign ministers of France and Britain said their countries would support any such probe.

In the footage, which has been circulated online by the Donate UA campaign group, people can be seen walking into a building in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast. According to a translation of the Ukrainian, one person explains that the Russians set up a barracks in the town. ""In the next room they were executing civilians, their bodies are still here,"" they tell the camera. The video then focuses on a row of bodies, kneeling down and slumped against the wall with their hands bound. ""(They) tied their hands and made them kneel facing the wall,"" the person continues. ""A shot to the head, and that's it. The person is no more."" The military said at least one victim’s kneecaps had been shot first before he received a bullet to the head. The video is just the latest piece of disturbing evidence to come out of Bucha, a town abandoned by Russian occupiers as they moved the war to the east of Ukraine. The invading forces have left a trail of destruction in their wake. Disturbing reports suggest that civilians were mowed down in the street and left to die on the floor, while there have been multiple accounts of women and children being raped. Ukraine said that 300 people who lost their lives in the town died as a result of ""extra-judicial"" killings. Independent journalists have confirmed that people have been bound and shot in the town in apparent executions. One man was found with no other injuries on his body and powder burns on his face - sometimes a sign that a person has been shot at close range. The cloth used to bind the man's hands appeared to be a white armband. Russian troops, while they were in Bucha, required that local residents wear the armbands to identify themselves, according to one woman who was still wearing hers.

The move ensured vital items could not reach Russian forces and restricted their movements. It also allowed military vehicles to be targeted and military units to be weakened by Ukrainian forces. The Command of the Special Operations Forces (SSO) of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said the attack was a means of stopping Russian forces in their tracks. He said: ""This is how soldiers of the SSO of Ukraine are fighting to bring down the enemy. ""By cutting off the Russian occupiers from what is needed, we are weakening their units."" The SSO added: ""Effective ambushes to disrupt deliveries of supplies and fuel are one of the most important tasks."" The Ukrainian SSO did not mention where or when the attack on Russian supply lines took place. The footage shows a military tanker hit by what appears to be a rocket before bursting into flames. Ukrainian reports claimed yesterday, the Russian forces had lost more than 18,000 soldiers and officers, including seven generals, 644 tanks, 1,830 armoured combat vehicles. They also said military hardware had been taken out including 325 artillery systems, 105 MLR systems, 54 air defence units, 143 warplanes, 134 helicopters, 1,249 vehicles and seven warships. Additional Russian forces targets included 76 fuel tank trucks, 89 operational and tactical-level UAVs, 24 units of special equipment, and four mobile SRBM systems, it was claimed. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on 24th February in what the Kremlin is still calling a ""special military operation"" to ""demilitarise and denazify"" the European country. The United Nations' International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands, has ordered Russia to stop its invasion and remove its troops from Ukrainian territory. Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said his government is prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia. The Mirror told last week how Chernobyl is back under Ukraine control after Russians forces formally give up the nuclear site. The Ukrainian state nuclear company said on Thursday most of the Russian forces that occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power station after invading Ukraine have left the defunct plant, and suggested radiation concerns had driven them away. Though Russian troops seized control of Chernobyl soon after the Feb. 24 invasion, the plant's Ukrainian staff continued to oversee the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel and supervise the concrete-encased remains of the reactor that exploded in 1986, causing the world's worst nuclear accident. State-owned Energoatom said these workers had flagged earlier on Thursday that Russian forces were planning to leave the territory. ""The information is confirmed that the occupiers, who seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and other facilities in the exclusion zone, have set off in two columns towards the Ukrainian border with the Republic of Belarus,"" it said in a statement.

Inside they found a stash of laptops and cash reportedly belonging to residents of a nearby village where a battle had just taken place, according to the regiment. Villagers claim invading soldiers raided their homes and stole any valuables, including electronic devices, as well as household appliances, clothes, food and alcohol. Abandoned properties were also ransacked, with blankets, mattresses and curtains being removed. The Moscow troops are said to have threatened some who tried to stop them with weapons. It is unclear exactly where in the war-torn country the incident took place, though a photo posted to the regiment's website shows inside the vehicle with a laptop and a pile of money visible. Another shows the back of the tank marked with the letter 'Z'. Citizens of neighbouring Belarus, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, reportedly claim loot stolen amid the invasion is being sent back to Russia via a post office in Belarus. Earlier this month, Ukrainian troops seized a huge Russian KamAZ armoured vehicle fitted with a professional kitchen onboard. Its cupboards were stocked with just onions, potatoes and jars of pickles, according to a video. It came after it emerged invading troops were being fed out-of-date ration packs and questionably 'fresh' food - perhaps explaining why troops are stealing civilian food. Meanwhile, the Russian Army has been dubbed 'pathetic' after an army truck left soldiers behind in the snow. In a short piece of footage, soldiers are seen filing on to the back of truck with marked with 'Z' markings.

The numbers of dead in the town - which is situated just outside Kyiv to the northwest - are suspected to stretch into the hundreds. Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, who leads the 64th Separate Motorised Rifle Brigade which occupied Bucha, is the first senior military official connected to the massacre to be named. Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs."" Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identified the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia rather than Kyiv Oblast - and a number of other Russian military units. Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: ""In Bucha there was a military unit 51460 from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region... Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will meet Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Warsaw on Monday ahead of key G7 and Nato talks later this week where she will push for tougher economic measures against ""the Putin war machine"". Ms Truss argues that weakening Russia's economy will help strengthen Ukraine's hand in peace negotiations with Moscow. She will hold talks with Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday and has also pledged a £10 million civil society fund for Ukraine, including support for organisations dealing with sexual violence following reports of Russian forces using rape as a way to terrorise the civilian population. In a tweet published shortly before her expected press conference on Monday, the cabinet minister called for Russia to be suspended from the United Nations' Human Rights Council. ""Given strong evidence of war crimes, including reports of mass graves and heinous butchery in Bucha, Russia cannot remain a member,"" Ms Truss said. There has also been widespread international outrage about other atrocities, including possible mass executions carried out by Russian forces as areas around the capital, Kyiv, returned to Ukrainian control. The Prime Minister said: ""The discovery of more mass graves outside Kyiv is sickening. ""The UK will not stand by whilst this indiscriminate and unforgivable slaughter takes place. ""We are working to ensure those responsible are held to account. We will not rest until justice is done."" Ahead of her talks in Poland, Ms Truss said: ""Putin is yet to show he is serious about diplomacy. A tough approach from the UK and our allies is vital to strengthen Ukraine's hand in negotiations. ""Britain has helped lead the way with sanctions to cripple the Putin war machine. ""We will do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and we will keep pushing others to do more. ""We will continue to support those who are suffering as a result of Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine, including the victims of sexual violence and those in need of humanitarian support.""",45,2.7556192217832365,1.864261677634482,0.8913575441487545,14
2022-04-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/putin-set-send-130000-new-26633361,"Putin set to send 130,000 new Russian conscripts to Ukraine war, officials fear","Vladimir Putin is preparing to send troops that are currently in Georgia - plus more than 130,000 new Russian conscripts - into Ukraine, Western officials fear. The Russian President signed a decree ordering 134,500 new conscripts into the army last week as part of his annual Spring draft. At the time, Russia ’s defence ministry insisted they would not be sent to any “hot spots”. But a Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “Putin has signed over 130,000 new conscripts into the Army. “The timing aligns with previous Spring drafts but we think that’s an unusually high number. “We do think there’s a realistic possibility these conscripts will be sent into Ukraine, even though the Russian MOD have said only professional soldiers will go to Ukraine.” They added Russia is deploying forces from Georgia, which it invaded in 2008. The official said: “Russia is redeploying elements of the forces that are in Georgia to reinforce the invasion of Ukraine. “We don’t think that this was planned, it’s a very odd thing for the Russian military to do. So we suspect it’s indicative of the problems they are having in Ukraine.” The order came five weeks into Russia's invasion, which has run into fierce Ukrainian resistance. The issue of conscripts' involvement in the war is highly sensitive. On March 9, the defence ministry acknowledged that some had been sent to Ukraine after Putin had denied this on various occasions, saying only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in, Reuters reported. Putin's spokesman said at the time that the president had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts. The annual spring military draft, which runs from April 1 to July 15, will affect Russian men between the ages of 18 and 27, Putin's decree said. Shoigu said on Tuesday that those called up would begin to be dispatched to their assigned bases in late May. ""Most military personnel will undergo professional training in training centres for three to five months. Let me emphasize that recruits will not be sent to any hot spots,"" he said in remarks published on his ministry's website. However, Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer representing several members of Russia's National Guard who refused an order to go to Ukraine, said that under Russian law conscripts could be sent to fight after several months of training. US President Joe Biden today called for a war crimes trial against Putin, and said he was seeking more sanctions after the reported atrocities in Ukraine. Biden told reporters earlier today: “He is a war criminal. “This guy is brutal, and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone’s seen it. “I think it is a war crime ... He should be held accountable.” At the press conference, Biden added that he plans to hit Moscow with additional sanctions for its conduct throughout the war - which began with Putin sending troops over the border into Ukraine on February 24. The president said, ""I'll let you know"", when asked about the nature of those sanctions. Shocking footage emerging from journalists in Ukraine showed charred bodies on a highway near Kyiv. Ukraine said 50 of some 300 bodies found in Bucha northwest of Kyiv were victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops. Satellite images showed a 45-foot (14-m) -long trench dug into the grounds of a church where a mass grave was found. Ukraine called for an International Criminal Court investigation that France and Britain said they would support, and rights group Human Rights Watch said it had documented ""apparent war crimes"". Russia said alleged ""crimes"" by its troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and no resident suffered. The UK has said Russia appears to be committing war crimes but has stopped short of describing the action as genocide, as it is called in Ukraine. That is because the UK sees genocide as something defined by a court of law. A Western official said the UK is “quite legally purist” about the situation. Western officials hope the International Criminal Court will be able to play the role of prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine. Officials are doubtful about the possibility of setting up a separate Nuremberg-style war crimes tribunal, called for by Gordon Brown. An official said that would require a UN Security Council resolution - which couldn’t get through because Russia has a veto.",45,3.1487800905583896,3.531371703757667,-0.38259161319927726,12
2022-04-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukrainian-soldiers-blow-russian-target-26632970,Ukraine fires Javelin missiles at Russians and blow target sky-high,"This is the moment Ukrainian soldiers reportedly fired British-used Javelin missiles at a Russian target blowing it sky-high. The clip of the missile, which is thought to have been launched by the Ukrainian Ground Forces, was discovered this morning. Footage shows the missile careening toward its Russian target and as it hits, a massive flash from the explosion can be seen before the object is catapulted into the air. The Ukrainian military said the attack was carried out by members of the 5th Reserve Battalion of the 28th Regiment, known as the 'Knights of the Winter Campaign', using Javelin surface-to-air-missiles. The defending army shared the video with a message to their countrymen saying: ""Good morning Ukraine! During the night, the 5th Reserve Battalion of the 28th Regiment, named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, did a glorious job."" The military added: ""That's how the Javelin hits. Glory to Ukraine!"" In the footage, apparently filmed in the early hours of this morning, a glowing Javelin missile is seen speeding through the air at a low altitude before seemingly hitting the target, sparking a huge explosion. The Ukrainian Ground Forces did not say where the strike took place. The footage comes just over a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ""helping more"" than other leaders in the resistance against Russia. Mr Zelensky said France was more hesitant about sending weapons because it is ""afraid of Russia"" and that Germany ""was making a mistake"" in its attempt at a more balanced approach, due to its deeper economic ties with the world's largest country. Today marks the 40th day since Russian troops invaded Ukraine. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine says that the total combat losses of the Russian military in that time stand at about 18,300 personnel. They added that Russia has also lost ""647 tanks, 1,844 armored fighting vehicles, 330 artillery systems, 107 multiple launch rocket systems, 54 anti-aircraft warfare systems, 147 aircrafts, 134 helicopters, 1,273 motor vehicles, seven boats/cutters, 76 fuel tanks, 92 unmanned aerial vehicles, 25 special equipment units and four mobile SRBM systems"". News of the Russian Armed Forces' alleged losses come as shocking images of corpses of Ukrainian civilians in the city of Bucha, in Kyiv Oblast (province), have emerged, leading to widespread condemnation of Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron says there are clear indications that Russian forces have committed war crimes, while Boris Johnson has accused Russia of ""despicable attacks"". The Kremlin has denied the allegations and is claiming the footage has been faked.",49,3.7419581509434976,5.1394020646843215,-1.3974439137408239,27

Dmytro Kuleba said besieged Mariupol is ""even worse"" than Bucha, near Kyiv, where images of charred bodies and mass graves emerged after Ukraine retook the area. Standing alongside UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss in Poland, he backed her call to expel Russia from the UN Human Rights Council and warned: ""Half measures are not enough any more."" He invited all Western leaders still dithering over sanctions to visit Bucha and ""stand in front of the mass grave. To see the bodies of dead Ukrainian women who had been raped before being killed and who the Russians tried to set on fire to hide the traces of their crimes.” Bucha's deputy mayor said on Sunday that 50 residents had been victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops. The Kremlin on Monday denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha. ""This information must be seriously questioned,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""From what we have seen, our experts have identified signs of video falsification and other fakes."" But Mr Kuleba told journalists in Warsaw: “The horrors that we’ve seen in Bucha are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by Russian Army in the territory of Ukraine so far. ""And I can tell you without exaggeration and with great sorrow that the situation in Mariupol is much worse compared to what we’ve seen in Bucha and other cities, towns and villages nearby Kyiv.” He said the ""horrors"" demand “serious G7 and EU sanctions”. He added: ""The West continues to fill the Russian war machine with payments for Russian fossil fuels, with trade still taking place between Russia and western countries. ""Half measures are not enough any more."" Calling for tougher sanctions he added: ""This is not the request of Ukraine’s Foreign Minister - this is the plea of the victims of rape, torture and killings, their relatives and the entire Ukrainian nation."" He invited people who still buy Russian gas, oil and coal - or who still doubt whether to block Russia from SWIFT or block Russian ships from their ports - to stand at a mass grave of raped women. He said: “I invite all of them to visit Bucha without any delay. “To visit a small village and stand in front of the mass grave. “To see the bodies of dead Ukrainian women who had been raped before being killed and who the Russians tried to set on fire to hide the traces of their crimes.” He added: “And I do this address to all foreign ministers who will be meeting this week at NATO, at the EU, at the G7 ministerial. If you have doubts, reluctance or arguments about the need to keep doing business with Russia, go to Bucha first, and then talk to me.” It comes as leaders of western nations prepare to gather in Brussels from tomorrow to discuss the latest response. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she would be pressing for a ""tough new wave of sanctions"" and said Russia had ""no place on the human rights council"" of the UN. She said the UK will be going after Russian ships, banks, gold, and seeking a ""clear timetable to limit our imports"" of Russian oil, gas and coal. ""Being tough is the only approach that will work. Putin has escalated this war,"" she said. After US President Joe Biden branded Putin a war criminal she added: ""We need justice done at the International Criminal Court."" She also called for further weapons to be supplied to Ukraine to combat Vladimir Putin's invasion. Mr Kuleba said ""Ukraine won the battle for Kyiv - but the war goes on"".",45,2.943205803278667,3.528609872554629,-0.5854040692759619,19
2022-04-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mayor-husband-son-found-buried-26634101,"Mayor, husband and son found buried in shallow grave after being 'tortured'","The mayor of a Ukrainian village was shot and buried next to her husband and son in a shallow grave in further evidence of Russian war crimes, it has been claimed. Since Russian soldiers withdrew from towns and villages around Kyiv last week, Ukrainian troops have been moving in, showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces, destroyed houses and burnt out cars. Reuters could not independently verify who killed the family in the grave just outside Motyzhyn, west of Kyiv. Moscow has denied targeting civilians and has said similar reports of killings were ""staged"" to sully Russia's name. ""There have been Russian occupiers here. They tortured and murdered the whole family of the village head,"" said Anton Herashchenko, naming those killed as Olha Sukhenko, her husband Ihor Sukhenko and their son, Oleksandr. ""The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery. ""These scum tortured, slaughtered and killed the whole family. They will be responsible for this."" A Reuters reporter saw the bodies in a forest near a farm, which had been all but destroyed, just outside the village of Motyzhyn. Nearby a burnt out tractor could be seen and one of those buried in the sand had his head taped. The reporter also saw another body of a man in a well near to the burnt out farm, where black scorch marks climbed up its few remaining walls. He appeared to have been tied up. Vadym Tokar, head of the Makariv village council which neighbours Motyzhyn, told Reuters the family had been taken captive by Russian forces two to three days before the troops left. ""The bodies are still lying there, we can't get them out because there is a suspicion that they are mined,"" he said by telephone. Global outrage spread on Monday over civilian deaths in Ukraine including evidence of bound bodies shot at close range and a mass grave found in areas retaken from Russian troops, as artillery bombarded the country's south and east. Reuters reporters saw on Sunday several corpses by the roadside in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, one had his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation. On Sunday, Russia's defence ministry said in a statement all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging crimes by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Kremlin troops. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was seen speaking with townspeople during visits to the destroyed towns of Irpin and Bucha today. Bucha has become the focus of war crimes accusations against both Vladimir Putin and the Russian soldiers he ordered into neighbouring Ukraine. A group of twisted soldiers - dubbed the 'Butchers of Bucha' - are alleged to have raped and murdered both women and children in the town. On entering Bucha after its liberation, journalists found horrific scenes including corpses of women and elderly people - some restrained with their arms tied behind their backs, and others with gunshot wounds in the back of the head. But now Ukrainians in Bucha at the time of the Russian occupation have shared first-hand accounts of witnessing random passersby being shot, homes being looted, and residents being banned from leaving even during humanitarian corridor agreements. Mum Kristina said she spent 10 days trapped in a house in Bucha in ""terrible fear"" the Russian soldiers stationed in her own courtyard would murder her and her three-year-old daughter. Recalling the moment she finally got to safety among Ukrainian troops, she told the Insider: ""We are safe for now, but our psyche is blown, we have changed, nothing will be the same as before. ""We try to communicate normally, even joke around a bit, but when you close your eyes, you immediately see a road full of dead bodies, and how we froze with our hands raised, waiting for them to decide."" She went on: ""It's a blessing we managed to get out. But my soul and thoughts are with Bucha and with all the hero-cities, with the people who are trapped, with the children who should not be involved in the war at all."" Yekaterina, who said she evacuated Bucha on the second day, left her parents and sisters behind and they were held captive for four days. She accused the Russian army of using civillians as ""human shields"" and of murdering innocent civillians. She said: ""My dad stood in line to be shot. They miraculously got him out, while 10 other guys were stripped naked and shot.""",45,3.6552082720265004,1.8474326333417819,1.8077756386847186,18

Footage from outside the Ukrainian capital shows long queues of traffic as residents rush to return home following the Russian invasion. The lines of cars stretch for kilometres at the entrance to the city, the BBC reports. Roughly 2 million people fled Kyiv during the first few weeks of Russia's invasion - about half the city's population. Now Russian troops are currently said to be withdrawing from around Kyiv and Chernihiv, with the Kremlin claiming they are retreating out of ""respect for ongoing peace talks."" Russian forces have suffered heavy casualties. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned areas may still come under attack from above, while Russian troops could leave behind mines, abandoned equipment or ""even the bodies of those killed"". In Bucha retreating Russian troops have left behind significant evidence of war crimes. President Zelensky said: “It’s still not possible to return to normal life, as it used to be, even at the territories that we are taking back after the fighting. ""We need wait until our land is de-mined, wait till we are able to assure you that there won’t be new shelling."" Zelensky's words have been echoed by Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko, who urged people to take their time returning to the war-torn city. Klitschko said: ""The risk of dying is pretty high, and that’s why my advice to anyone who wants to come back is: please, take a little bit more time."" Today a mass grave containing the bodies of 57 civilians was found in Bucha, close to Kyiv, where Russian troops have been forced out. Ukrainian officials have said 410 civilians have been killed in the towns surrounding Kyiv, with 300 of them in Bucha alone. It follows reports of a group of Russian soldiers - branded the 'Butchers of Bucha' - allegedly raping and shooting women and children in the area. Visiting Bucha, Zelensky said it would be harder for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia after the scale of the alleged atrocities was uncovered. Becoming visibly emotional, he said: ""These are war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide. ""It's very difficult to talk when you see what they've done here. The longer the Russian Federation drags out the meeting process, the worse it is for them and for this situation and for this war."" He added: ""We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women and murdered children."" Russia has denied being behind the deaths, and has claimed that Ukraine has orchestrated the scenes for the media. Today US President Joe Biden called for a war crimes trial against Russian Preisdent Vladimir Putin over the alleged atrocities. He told reporters: “He is a war criminal. But we have to gather the information. ""We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight and we have to get all the detail so this could be – actual have a war crimes trial.

An emotional Volodymyr Zelensky again accused Moscow of ­genocide after he toured the devastated town of Bucha, where 300 residents were found dead, some bound and gagged. The Ukrainian President claimed ­thousands of people have been murdered and butchered by rampaging Russian troops since they invaded the country. As more mass graves were discovered, Mr Zelensky said: “It will be recognised by the world as genocide. We know of ­thousands of people killed and tortured, with their limbs severed, women raped and children killed.” Speaking about the massacre in Bucha, just outside the capital Kyiv, he added: “Hundreds of people were killed, tortured. Corpses on the street, mined areas. Even the bodies of the dead were mined. “Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers, torturers, rapists, looters who call ­themselves the army, and who deserve only death after what they did.” But shameless Moscow officials accused Ukrainians of staging the killings. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “From what we have seen, our experts have identified signs of video falsification and other fakes.” Mr Zelensky has set up a special body to ­investigate Russian war crimes – a call echoed by US President Joe Biden. He said: “I decided to create a special ­mechanism of justice in Ukraine to ­investigate and prosecute every crime of the occupiers in our country.” It will include “international experts, ­investigators, ­prosecutors and judges”. More than 100 corpses have been ­examined by forensic ­scientists preparing dossiers for future war crimes tribunals. Intelligence chiefs have a target list of Russian troops from 64 infantry brigades allegedly behind atrocities in Bucha. In Motyzhyn, to the west of Kyiv, the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range were seen in a pit. Boris Johnson branded the discovery “sickening”. Keir Starmer said Russian soldiers involved in war crimes in Ukraine should know “for the rest of their lives” they will be “chased down” and prosecuted. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss last night called for Russia to be kicked off the UN’s Human Rights Council over the ­atrocities. She said: “After these appalling crimes, Russia has no place on it.” As many as 22 schools daily have been hit by warplanes since the invasion started, Save The ­Children revealed. More than two million kids have fled while around 5.5 million remain. Up to 130,000 ­civilians are still unable to leave the besieged town of Mariupol. Grim ­statistics reveal 161 children have been killed and 264 injured. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the port city had suffered an even worse onslaught than Bucha. He added: “The horrors we have seen in Bucha are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.” An evacuation convoy escorted by the International Committee of the Red Cross was blocked in the town of Manhush as it attempted to reach Mariupol last night. Kharkiv resident Olena Kolesnik, who fled to Poland, said: “This is genocide. This is fascism.

Lawmaker Lesia Vasylenko - a member of the liberal Holos party - posted an image on Twitter of an exposed patch of torso with the Nazi symbol burned into the flesh. The lawmaker said it was scarred on the ""tortured body of a raped and killed woman"". The image - which has been pixelated due to its horrific nature - shows an area of bruised torso branded with the crude swastika, which appears to have been etched with repeated slashes and burns. Ms Vasylenko did not provide any information as to where the image was originally photographed but did accuse Russian soldiers of being responsible. Pro-Russian accounts claim the sickening torture was carried out by Ukraine's neo-Nazi Azov Batallion at a location near Mariupol, the MailOnline reports. But Ukrainian accounts dispute it was their countrymen, claiming instead that Russian troops mutilated the woman's corpse post-mortem. Ms Vasylenko added: ""Russian soldiers loot, rape and kill... Women with swastika shaped burns. Russia. Russian men did this."" In later tweets, the lawmaker heaped further accusations on the Russian enemy. One horrific allegation, which has been echoed by journalists entering liberated cities, claims 10-year-old girls are showing physical signs of having been violently raped. She wrote: ""10 y.o. girls with vaginal and rectal tears. Women with swastika shaped burns. Russia. Russian Men did this. And Russian mothers raised them. A nation of immoral criminals.""

The Russian pilot has been identified as Major Sergei Yermalov, the Ukrainian military has said. It is said he serves in the 159th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment and is based at Besovets airfield in North-West Russia. Ukrainian authorities also claim to have shot down two planes and one helicopter in the past 24 hours. The strike is yet another blow for Russian President Vladimir Putin as his military forces struggle to gain control of Ukraine and have been met with fierce opposition. On March 18, Ukrainian officials said troops firing a shoulder-launched Stinger missile destroyed one Su-34. The Su-35 has been one of Russia's strongest fighter jets since 2014. It is reported that it can hold up to 8,000 kilograms of weaponry and is hailed for its stealthy manoeuvrability. It comes as Vladimir Putin is said to be running out of weapons as his invasion drags on.

It comes as there is a desperate hunt for the Butchers of Bucha after women and children were raped and shot by Russians, according to Ukrainian sources.

Moscow has said it will reduce military activity near primary targets Kyiv and Chernihiv amid peace talks - though such claims have been met with scepticism. Ukraine and the West fear the Kremlin is simply looking to regroup before moving its focus on the Donbas region, rather than to try and promote trust.

A further 500 soldiers from the 3 Motostrils Division are in hospital with ""heavy alcohol poisoning of unknown origin"", it was claimed. Despite their efforts, Ukrainian civilians have been unable to stop the Russians destroying their towns and cities. The suburbs of Izyum, a city of 50,000, have been flattened by both indiscriminate shelling and precision strikes. Schools have been destroyed, health clinics reduced to rubble by shelling and ordinary houses demolished by airborne assaults. Mykola Shaposhnyk, who lived in a village called Hrushuvakha, told Sky News: ""The planes fly low. They were bombing so slowly, not in a rush, not in a rush. ""He is erasing the population, maybe to try and make people leave the place. Destroying Ukraine, definitely. ""Even my father, who lived through the (second world) war, said the Germans didn't do this."" According to Valerii Marchenko, the city's mayor, roughly 20,000 people are currently stuck in Izyum. Many are hiding in air raid shelters, slowly running out of food and medicine. The decision of the invading forces to abandon efforts to take Kyiv and focus on the east of the country was seen as a sign of the strength of the Ukrainian resistance effort. Yet the grim reality is that the evacuating Russians are leaving a trial of misery and destruction behind them. The mayor of the liberated town of Bucha said 300 residents had been killed during a month-long occupation by the Russian army, and victims were seen in a mass grave and still lying on the streets. Reuters journalists saw bodies lying in the streets and the hands and feet of multiple corpses poking out of a still-open grave at a church ground. ""The bastards!"" Vasily, a 66-year-old man said, weeping with rage as he looked at more than a dozen bodies lying in the road outside his house. ""I'm sorry. The tank behind me was shooting. Dogs!"" After more than five weeks of fighting, Russia has pulled back forces that had threatened Kyiv from the north to regroup for battles in eastern Ukraine. ""The whole Kyiv region is liberated from the invader,"" Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar wrote on Facebook on Saturday. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned in a video address: ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" Ukraine's emergencies service said more than 1,500 explosives had been found in one day during a search of the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital. Russia has depicted its drawdown of forces near Kyiv as a goodwill gesture in peace talks. Ukraine and its allies say Russia was forced to shift its focus to east Ukraine after suffering heavy losses. Both sides described talks last week in Istanbul and by video link as ""difficult"".",47,2.932863929453323,2.7759486972491936,0.1569152322041294,18

Today the UK's ambassador to Ukraine said she was aware of reports of women and girls being raped in front of their families, describing it as a ""deliberate act of subjugation'. Heartbreaking testimony uncovered by human rights groups have ramped up calls for troops to be held accountable for their actions. Charity Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had uncovered evidence of ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence"" against Ukrainian civilians, and said these must be investigated as war crimes. Melinda Simmons, British Ambassador to Ukraine, posted on Twitter: ""Rape is a weapon of war. Though we don’t yet know the full extent of its use in Ukraine it’s already clear it was part of (Russian) arsenal. ""Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime."" Describing her ordeal, a Ukrainian woman told Human Rights Watch that she was lucky to be alive after repeatedly being raped at gunpoint by a Russian soldier. The 31-year-old woman, identified as Olha - not her real name - told HRW she was targeted after Russian troops arrived in Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region of the country. Olha, who has a five year old son, was taken into a classroom in the school where she and her family were sheltering by a soldier, who told her he was 20. Describing her distressing ordeal, she said: “He told me to give him [oral sex]. ""The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more ‘motivation.’” The solider then proceeded to rape her, she told human rights workers. Olha continued: “While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was [name withheld] and that he was 20. ""He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with.” When she refused to get her possessions in order to stay with him in the classroom, he held a knife to her neck and raped her again, Olha said. He also hit her several times around the face. Olha, who was able to flee to Kharkiv and seek medical attention now plans to file a report with Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office, HRW said. Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at the charity, said: “The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.” He continued: “Russia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers. “Commanders should recognize that a failure to take action against murder and rape may make them personally responsible for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.” A villager in Mala Rohan described a very similar account of a 27-year-old woman with a five year old daughter being raped by a teenage Russian soldier. The 55-year-old, named Sergei, told The Independent : “The soldier who did it was a young guy, 19 years old. His name was Vladimir. He had been drinking all day before he raped the poor girl. ""He was out of control."" He said this was happening as there ""didn't seem to be much discipline"" among Russian troops. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba today accused Russia of carrying out a deliberate ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv and called on the G7 to impose ""devastating"" new sanctions on Moscow. ""We are still gathering and looking for bodies, but the number has already gone into the hundreds. ""Dead bodies lie on the streets. They killed civilians while staying there and when they were leaving these villages and towns,"" his ministry quoted him as saying on Twitter. Russia has so far not commented publicly on the claims. Moscow has previously repeatedly denied Ukrainian claims that it has targeted civilians.",45,3.1029407125452693,5.865098553981876,-2.762157841436607,14
2022-04-03,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/one-siberian-postcode-dozens-war-26623673,One Siberian postcode has dozens of war dead - but mysteriously none in Moscow,"A sinister postcode lottery relating to Russia's war dead raising questions about how many of Vladimir Putin 's troops have lost their lives. The worst-hit regions in terms of losses are, coincidentally, a long way away from the Moscow. This means the increasingly heavy flow of coffins from Ukraine to Russia may not be seen by those with their hands on the levers of power in the capital. Some estimates put the number of war dead at 17,000 soldiers in five weeks. A similar pattern is seen in the official records relating to St Petersburg, Putin’s birth city, where there is just one recorded death, and two captured troops. Moscow has sustained no announced deaths, while just ten servicemen from the capital were captured by the Ukrainians, according to the records. The region immediately surrounding the capital has similarly suffered far fewer fatalities than many places, with two reported dead, and 21 captured. The Leningrad region outside St Petersburg has seen one killed with two captured. Funerals are being held for those slain in the war in many regions - but not in main cities Moscow and St Petersburg. There is anecdotal evidence that a handful of burials of soldiers whose deaths were not announced have gone ahead over the past weeks. This contrasts sharply with the region of Buryatia, in Siberia, five time zones east of Moscow, where 64 have been reported killed in the war. Many of these are ethnic Buryats rather than Russians. The true toll here is almost certainly higher, not least because there is a time-lag in the release of information on the war dead. Pictures of some of the war dead highlight the appalling suffering in Buryatia, a Buddhist republic on the shore of Lake Baikal with a 972,000 population, some 12 times less than the city of Moscow. The Ukrainians have published numbers for Russian losses which have not been disputed by the Soldiers’ Mothers Committee in Moscow. More information has become available through social media tributes and the rising number of local reports of funerals. Taken together the available data show a striking pattern that far-flung Russian regions are worst hit by the crushing losses. Reports have highlighted Dagestan, close to the Caspian Sea, Tatarstan on the Volga River, Irkutsk in Siberia and Primorsky, on the Pacific coast, as suffering significant losses. Many of those killed from some of these faraway towns and cities are not ethnic Russians, and a large number of these men are young, in their late teens or twenties. Many of the military dead leave behind young families. Ahead of the war, when Russian officials maintained the pretence that service personnel were being sent solely for military drills, tens of thousands of forces were moved from across Russia, for example via the Trans-Siberian railway. Some travelled a week or more to regions surrounding Ukraine, or to Belarus, also used as a staging post for the war. Among those killed in Ukraine from devastated Buryatia was David Arutyunyan, 18, previously identified as the youngest Russian soldier to be killed in the war Also pictured are war dead Mikhail Garmaev, 34, paratrooper Naidal Tsyrenov, 23, Nikolay Ivanov, 33, Roman Kolosov, 29, a staff sergeant and boxer, Solbon Bolotov, 26, a corporal,22, Stepan Oseev, 31, Vyacheslav Sadykov, 22, Ivan Kargapoltsev, 28, Egor Khlystov, 23, Andrey Dandarov, 19, Zorigto Khotsaev, 21, Buryatia, Igor Chuposhev, 38, and reconnaissance technician Nima Oshorov, 45.",7,4.3274733271904315,3.7953508698358234,0.5321224573546082,5

A bombshell report by Human Rights Watch today said evidence had been uncovered of ""unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence"" directed toward the Ukrainian population. Vladimir Putin 's troops have been accused of carrying out a ""massacre"" that ""could amount to genocide"" in the city of Bucha outside Kyiv after dozens of civilian bodies were found when Russia withdrew. Today Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba branded Russia ""worse than ISIS"", accusing invaders of killing ""out of anger and just because they wanted to kill"". These are the latest in a long line of war crime allegations against Putin's forces since the start of the invasion in February. Russian troops are already accused of targeting civilians in merciless bombing campaigns and failing to observe ceasefires. In the past two days devastating pictures have emerged showing bodies piled up in areas occupied by pro-Russian forces, with many victims said to have have had their hands bound when they were shot. The International Criminal Court is investigating a string of allegations, amid calls for Putin and his top team to be tried as war criminals. Today Mr Kuleba told Times Radio: ""We understand they were killing civilians while leaving, while withdrawing, while staying there in this town of Bucha and also in other towns and villages in key regions, but also while withdrawing from them out of anger and just because they wanted to kill. ""There was no good reason for them. These were not guerrillas, they were not people opposing them. ""Russia is worse than ISIS, full stop."" Here we look at some of the allegations made against Russian forces in recent days and weeks. At least 300 residents are alleged to have been killed in the month that Russian forces occupied the city of Bucha. Sickening images show bodies piled in a mass grave, with many still lying in the streets following the Russian retreat. Today the mayor of the city, on the northern outskirts of Kyiv, showed journalists dead bodies white cloth tied around their arms. One of these appeared to have his hands bound, and appeared to have been shot in the mouth. Anatoliy Fedoruk said: ""The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians. ""They practically got a green light from Putin for a safari and they were shooting Ukrainian people.'' HRW has outlined several incidents relayed to them by witnesses. A woman named Tatiyana told HRW: ""They took six men from three different families. ""One mother had both of her sons taken [and shot]. ""Another young man was in his early 20s, his name was Bohdan, I know his mother well, she told me that the soldiers told her to wait near her house while they took her son … to question him. ""They said the same thing to other families. Instead, they led these six men away, took them to the far end of the village, and shot them."" Today the UK's ambassador to Ukraine said she was aware of reports of women and girls being raped in front of their families, describing it as a ""deliberate act of subjugation'. Heartbreaking testimony uncovered by human rights groups have ramped up calls for troops to be held accountable for their actions. Melinda Simmons, British Ambassador to Ukraine, posted on Twitter : ""Rape is a weapon of war.

""He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with.” When she refused to get her possessions in order to stay with him in the classroom, he held a knife to her neck and raped her again, Olha said. Witnesses who survived the brutal occupation before Russian forces withdrew have claimed that civilians including children, were tortured. Soldier Sergeiy Torovik told The Times he had been appalled by what he had seen in his hometown of Stoyanka, close to Kyiv. He described Russian troops as ""lower than animals"", recounting the horrific scenes he had encountered in a basement of a home, where he said 18 bodies were recovered. ""Some of them had their ears cut off,"" he said. ""Others had teeth pulled out. There were kids like 14, 16 years old, some adults. ""They just took the bodies away yesterday.” It is not an isolated allegation. Ivan Fedorov, mayor of the city of Melitopol, who was held captive by Russian troops for five days last month, said he had endured ""psychological violence"". He added: “I heard in the cells next, cries of the tortured, and I understood their degree of violence because human lives do not count for them."" Sonya Sceats, Chief Executive at Freedom from Torture, said: “As harrowing reports of torture, mass executions and the mutilation of corpses by Russian forces emerge, compassionate people across this country want the UK Government to do everything possible to help Ukrainians fleeing the conflict to reach safety and ensure perpetrators are held accountable."" Russia has repeatedly been accused of shelling civilian targets during its brutal assault on Ukrainian cities. These include a maternity hospital in Mariupol, as well as a theatre where civilians including children were sheltering. At least three people, including a child, died in the hospital attack, which was branded ""the ultimate genocide"". In a scathing statement accusing Putin's forces of war crimes late last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: ""Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded. ""Many of the sites Russia’s forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians. ""This includes the Mariupol maternity hospital, as the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights expressly noted in a March 11 report. ""It also includes a strike that hit a Mariupol theater, clearly marked with the word “дети” — Russian for “children” — in huge letters visible from the sky. ""Putin’s forces used these same tactics in Grozny, Chechnya, and Aleppo, Syria, where they intensified their bombardment of cities to break the will of the people."" Putin's forces have been accused of using cluster munitions in residential areas during its occupation of Kharkiv in late February. Witnesses and images strongly point to the use of Russian-made 9M55K Smerch cluster munition rockets, HRW said. Steve Goose, arms director at the campaign group, said in early March: “Kharkiv is under relentless attack from Russian forces and civilians are hiding in basements to evade explosions and debris. “Using cluster munitions in populated areas shows a brazen and callous disregard for people’s lives.” HRW said in a statement: ""Given the inherently indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions and their foreseeable effects on civilians, their use as documented in Kharkiv might constitute a war crime."" There have been several occasions when civilians attempting to escape besieged cities were seemingly targeted by Russian forces. During the Siege of Mariupol, it is claimed that shelling continued during a five-hour ceasefire. US Ambassador Michael Carpenter last month said that on March 5 and 6 evacuation corridors were bombed by Russia. Sickening drone footage on March 7 appeared to show a civilian with his hands up being shot close to the E40 highway near Kyiv. At least 10 more dead bodies, which had been burned, were later found along the highway.",45,2.661215518539555,5.651069217007424,-2.989853698467869,14

Mantas Kvedaravicius died yesterday in the besieged city whose fate he had spent years documenting. The Lithuanian film director’s death was confirmed by the Ukrainian Defence Minister and a colleague. A Lithuanian news agency, 15min, reported that Mr Kvedaravicius was rushed to a hospital but could not be saved. The ministry’s information agency tweeting today: ""While (he was) trying to leave Mariupol, Russian occupiers killed Lithuanian director Mantas Kvedaravicius”. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said: ""We lost a creator well known in Lithuania and in the whole world who, until the very last moment, in spite of danger, worked in Russia-occupied Ukraine.” The 45-year-old was best known for his conflict-zone documentary Mariupolis, which premiered in 2016 at the Berlin International Film Festival. It showed a city, a strategic port in a mostly Russian-speaking part of eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have clashed with Ukrainian forces since 2014. Mariupol was one of the main targets of Russia ’s invasion when it began on February 24. The city has spent weeks being bombed and reduced to rubble, with tens of thousands still trapped. ""Mantas Kvedaravicius, was murdered today in Mariupol, with a camera in his hands, in this s***** war of evil, against the whole world,"" Russian film director Vitaly Mansky, founder of the Artdocfest arts festival in which Kvedaravicius was a participant, said on Facebook. Kvedaravicius also won an award for his 2011 film ‘Barzakh’ which was shot in the Russian region of Chechnya, where the country fought two wars to put down rebellions between 1994 and 2009. Julia Duchrow, deputy secretary general of Amnesty International in Germany, said: ""The audience was taken into the villages, into the lives and souls of the people. ""Mantas Kvedaravicius has shown great courage for this: The film was shot without permission and at great personal risk. ""This courage, this unconditional will to show human rights violations and make them accessible to the public, distinguished Mantas Kvedaravicius."" Inside the terrorised city of Mariupol, civilians are almost entirely without food, water and electricity as temperatures plummet below zero at night. Many are unable to leave their shelters due to the ongoing Russian missile strikes and shelling and loved ones cannot let their family and friends outside know they’re still alive. The city has seen some of the worst Russian atrocities including the bombing of a maternity and children’s hospital, and of a theatre where thousands of innocents were sheltering. Mariupol’s residents even wrote ‘children’ in Russian outside the theatre in hope Putin’s forces would not attack it.",47,3.288312894790437,5.198548047372391,-1.9102351525819539,9
2022-04-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-leaving-mines-dead-bodies-26621135,Russia leaving mines on dead bodies as troops retreat claims Ukrainian President,"Russia is leaving behind mines and booby traps as their troops withdraw from areas of northern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed. As the Kremlin’s forces withdraw from areas around Kyiv or are forced back by Ukrainian counterattacks, they are sabotaging houses, roads and even bodies, it has been claimed. Over the past few days Ukraine has retaken over 30 towns and villages in the Kyiv region. This has happened since Russia ’s announcement this week that it was going to scale down its military operations around the capital and focus its efforts in the pro-Russian east. Some have speculated this is in an attempt to limit the country’s losses and reinforce its forces who are already stretched thin. In a video address released today, President Zelensky said: ""In the north of our country, the invaders are leaving. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here “It is slow but noticeable. In some places they are being kicked out with fighting. Elsewhere they're abandoning the positions themselves. ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" Due to these concerns, emergency services have told people in the newly liberated regions to be extra-vigilant. They have said more than 1,500 explosives have been found in one day of searching in the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital. Zelensky went on to say that efforts were ongoing to clear mines and make the area safe, but for now residents were advised against returning. He added: ""It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was,”. The shocking claims come amidst a surprise retreat from Russian forces. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. Moscow’s forces initially surged across Ukraine, attacking the country on multiple fronts and coming within a few miles of the capital. However, since then, reports have suggested that Russian forces have become stretched thin, with videos emerging showing armoured and personnel vehicles running out of fuel. On top of that, there have been numerous claims of low morale amongst Moscow’s troops and even mutinies. That has reportedly led to Russian generals and military commanders coming to the frontline, which has led to at least 13 top army leaders being killed already. After an objectively unsuccessful invasion so far, the move now comes as an attempt to shore up parts of the invasion in more pro-Russian areas, where they can have more reliable supply lines. This comes five weeks into Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. His country finds itself outcast on the international stage, with only China and India the major powers yet to denounce its actions. A series of economic sanctions have hit the nation hard, but some have argued they still haven’t gone far enough. Chelsea owner Roman Ambramovich was one of the Russian oligarchs hit by the economic actions. Despite previously threatening people with legal action over suggesting he had a close relationship with Putin, Ambramovich reportedly flew to Russia on the day of the invasion to speak to the Russian president in person, the FT reported . The paper was told another oligarch was surprised at how close the two were.",7,4.821486057232741,4.632603825892516,0.18888223134022564,8
2022-04-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-soldiers-hurl-stun-grenades-26620960,Russian soldiers hurl grenades and shots heard as they disrupt peaceful protests,"Russian soldiers violently broke up peaceful pro-Ukrainian protests as the Kremlin’s invasion continues into its sixth week. In Enerhodar, which lies on the Dnipro river in Southern Ukraine, Moscow’s troops reportedly opened fire on protestors who opposed the ongoing invasion. This comes as Vladimir Putin ’s invasion of Ukraine enters its sixth week, as Kyiv’s forces have begun making remarkable progress, taking territory back from Russia. Hundreds of people gathered for a peaceful rally in the centre of the town this morning. There the crowds sung the Ukrainian national anthem until Russian soldiers arrived to dispel the protestors. Some were reportedly arrested as Moscow’s forces were said to have thrown tear and stun grenades into the crowds and shots and explosions were heard. The town has been occupied by Russian forces since March 4. Local authorities shared a video of the violence on Telegram and later Emine Dzheppar, the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, tweeted out the video. She said: “Another video from #Enerhodar near #Zaporizhzhia, #Ukraine, where Russian occupants fire on brave Ukrainian protesters”. That came alongside the video which showed protestors fleeing from clouds of smoke, as gunfire and explosions rang out behind them. Early reports also accused Russian forces of shelling another part of the town on Saturday. This comes as the latest intelligence update from the Ministry of Defence highlighted the success Ukrainian forces were having with a number of counter-attacks. They coincided with Russian retreats around the capital Kyiv, as Russia claimed it was originally done to help peace talks, but intelligence in the US and Ukraine doubted this motive. Russian forces even retreated from Hostomel Airport, which saw fierce fighting from the first day of the invasion. But, reports suggested that Russia was instead redeploying these troops to eastern and southern parts of the country to support their troops there. It added: “Along the eastern axis, Ukraine has re-taken several villages. “In the east of Ukraine, Ukrainian forces have secured a key route in eastern Kharkhiv after heavy fighting. “This follows the liberation of Trostyanets, in the vicinity of Sumy, earlier this week.” On top of that, Ukrainian authorities said they were hesitant to let civilians back into the areas previously occupied by Russian troops over reports of mines and tripwires being left behind. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that retreating Russian forces were creating a “complete disaster” sabotaging homes and even bodies in their wake. His warning came this morning as concerns about the humanitarian crisis gripping Mariupol continue to worsen. The city is encircled by Russian troops and most attempts to get humanitarian aid into the civilians inside have been unsuccessful. This week, there were reports of an attack on a Russian oil depot which the Kremlin claimed was Ukraine’s first strike on Russian territory since the war began. Kyiv strongly denied the allegations and suggested Moscow negligence may be to blame. So far, during fighting, more than four million people, largely women, children and the elderly, have fled their homes in Ukraine to escape the fighting. The majority of the refugees entered Poland, but it is not known how many settled there or travelled on into other countries. Despite worries on the first day of the invasion, that Russia would sweep Ukraine and take the capital within days, the fighting has been severely prolonged. This was reportedly because of a mixture of fierce resistance from Ukraine and under-resourced, poorly equipped and led Russian troops.",47,3.4305192950206913,3.7171860775499064,-0.28666678252921507,10

Lt Col Vitaly Slabtsov, 43, was an elite paratrooper buried with full military honours, say reports. Reports suggest Slabtsov was killed during a special operation in Donbas, Ukraine, although not many details have emerged regarding his death. Slabtsov's funeral was held in Ryazan in central Russia, home of Russian paratroopers, on Friday. His body was placed in a closed coffin, indicating he had suffered devastating wounds in the war. A Russian flag draped the coffin as it was taken for burial, while Slabtsov was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. Pictures taken at the service show several Russian military personal in attendance, with one holding a picture of Slabtsov. Slabtsov served with the 83rd separate air assault brigade based in Ussuriysk, in the extreme east of Russia, and was one of Vladimir Putin's top Russian colonels. At the funeral, cemetery workers told reporters there are three rows of graves reserved for more victims, suggesting they are expecting another 70 funerals. The news comes after Lt Col Alexander Kornik, 39, was reported to have died alongside eight soldiers of his regiment, with 17 more injured, after they were hit while building a pontoon bridge in the Chernihev region. Six bodies of dead servicemen could not be removed from the water, and were carried away by the current on March 27, said senior Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsymbalyuk. However, separate accounts give the date of his death as March 2 and March 15. Additionally, it was announced this week that top Russian general Col Denis Kurilo had been ""eliminated"" along with 1,500 troops. The commander of the 200th motorised rifle brigade died in fighting outside Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, it was claimed. Just three days prior, Ukraine announced Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev, 48, was the seventh general and the second lieutenant general to be killed in the invasion. Sources in Kyiv said the commander, who previously claimed that the war would be over in a matter of hours, died in a strike close to Kherson city. Pictures show a funeral service held for Kornik in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg where he was given full military honours. Despite this, Russia has not officially announced his death in common with many soldiers killed in Ukraine. Putin has only acknowledged the death of one general so far, understood to be Major Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky, in a speech shortly after the war began. Ukrainian forces have also claimed to have eliminated Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, Major General Oleg Mityaev, Major General Vitaly Gerasimov and Major General Andrei Kolesnikov. Reports indicate that Kornik was chief of staff of the 40th Engineer Regiment. Russian troops have experienced severe casualties in the five-week war with Ukraine claiming as many as 17,000 killed. Between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have lost their lives in battle, according to estimates from NATO. The Kremlin has lost at least nine colonels and several more high ranking officers, according to reports. Putin ’s negotiators have said this week that Russian forces would ease back from attacks on Kyiv and northern Ukraine although shelling has continued and there is a fear that they are simply regrouping. It comes as Ukraine has managed to retake some territory taken from the Russians especially around Kyiv. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy said in a video address that the military situation in the east remained extremely difficult and Russia was preparing for new strikes in the Donbas region and the city of Kharkiv. He added that Russian troops in the north of the country were pulling back, slowly but noticeably.",7,4.587689875152399,5.1346869521282175,-0.5469970769758188,22
2022-04-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-russia-accuses-uk-escalating-26618638,Russia accuses UK of escalating Ukraine war and vows to target British weapons,"Russia has accused Britain of escalating the Ukraine war and says weapons it has supplied will be targeted. An official from the invading country made the warning after the UK delivered Starstreak missiles to Ukraine. A video has emerged of what appears to be one of the high-tech munitions being used to down a Russian helicopter. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said that more weapons will be sent to Kyiv to aid Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia. The pledge, which was made after a conference held by military donors to the country, has not been met warmly by Russian ambassador Andrey Kelin. Mr Kelin told TASS news agency: ""All arms supplies are destabilising, particularly those mentioned by Wallace. ""They exacerbate the situation, making it even bloodier. Apparently, those are new, high-precision weapons. ""Naturally, our armed forces will view them as a legitimate target if those supplies get through the Ukrainian border."" Since Russia invaded Ukraine the UK has been providing it with military aid, including anti-tank weapons and the Starstreak. The latter is the UK’s most advanced manned portable missile system and hits targets with three kinetic darts. A video showing the tail of a Mi-28N helicopter being snapped off has been verified, reported the Times, with a Ministry of Defence source saying it showed a Starstreak in action in Ukraine. The source also said that the anti-air missile system has been used in Ukraine for almost a week. Mr Wallace hosted a conference of 35 nations helping Ukraine this week. He said that ""more lethal aid"" would go to the country. and that longer range artillery would be provided, along with anti-ship missiles. Mr Kelin warned against supplying more arms, saying that ""wrong decisions of this kind are very dangerous, because they are aimed at fuelling the conflict"". He added: ""They reveal the desire to do us as much harm as possible. He went on to claim that supplying more weapons will serve to fuel the idea ""that there's no need for negotiations at this point"". ""This is the position of an ostrich, an attempt to hide your head in sand in a fit of powerlessness and blind rage."" Kelin also looked to counteract claims that Russia is being pushed back by Ukrainian forces, suggesting that the West had been duped by unreliable intelligence. ""I have a feeling that London’s perceptions of what is going on in Ukraine from the military point of view are formed from overly positive reports of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry and the leadership of Ukraine,"" he continued. ""If we look at maps that are being published by papers and magazines here, they rely exclusively on Ukrainian sources. ""They still believe that the Azov battalion is about to liberate Mariupol, that the people’s militia forces have made no progress at all in the Lugansk region."" The ambassador may have been responding to comments Mr Wallace made yesterday, when he claimed Vladimir Putin ""is now a man in a cage he built himself"". As the Russian war against Ukraine entered day 37, the Defence Secretary said Russia's president no longer bore the ""force"" he used to. In an interview with Sky News, he said: ""President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. ""His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. ""The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. ""He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with the consequences of what he has done to his own army. ""We have seen it before. It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas."" The Chief of the Defence Staff earlier expressed similar sentiments. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said Russia's bid to take all of Ukraine during its invasion looks to have ""fallen apart"" as Mr Putin's troops retreat. The head of Britain's armed forces said the Russian leader had been ""misled"" about the effectiveness of his country's armed forces, with ""early indications"" suggesting Moscow was withdrawing troops - a move that has opened them up to counter attacks by Ukrainian defenders. In a speech and follow-on question-and-answer session at an Institute for Government (IfG) event, the Chief of the Defence Staff said Mr Putin was a ""weaker and more diminished figure today"" than he was before the invasion started on February 24. He announced that the UK was ""incredibly cautious"" about believing Russian claims of ground troops withdrawing from Kyiv but said there did appear to be signs the Kremlin was preparing to focus its efforts on the east and south of Ukraine.",49,4.72638596571836,4.169827471125702,0.5565584945926583,12

The 331st Guards Parachute Regiment are considered among the most fearsome and well-trained in the Russian army, having fought for the city of Ilovaisk in the Donbas in 2014. Their involvement in Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year, and fatalities they've suffered, is indicative of how the invasion hasn't gone as planned. The regiment's commanding officer, Col Sergei Sukharev, was killed in Ukraine on 13 March - a major blow for any military unit. His deputy Major Sergei Krylov was killed alongside him. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here According to the BBC, in the month since the invasion began, at least 37 other members of the 331st have lost their lives in Ukraine. The men had been part of a column that advanced into Ukraine from Belarus, led by Russia's airborne forces, that was tasked with capturing Kyiv. Like many other regiments they soon found themselves bogged down by intense resistance fighting and logistical difficulties. Videos circulating online show vehicles marked with VDV - the symbol for Russia's airborne forces - wrecked and abandoned in villages near the capital. While the Kremlin has not been forthcoming when it comes to announcing the deaths of its men in Ukraine, Russians have been posting tributes to fallen soldiers on social media site V'Kontakte. One has been set up Sergeant Sergei Duganov, a member of the 331st. ""Nobody knows anything,"" one woman wrote on it, the BBC reported. ""The 331st regiment is disappearing. Almost every day, photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. What's happening? When will this end? When will people stop dying?"" The deaths of so many members of the 331st will come as a blow to the Russian military, in part symbolically due to their reputation. In a video posted online last May, a general tells soldiers of the 331st Parachute Regiment that they are ""the best of the best"". As well as serving in the Balkans, Chechnya and Donbas, they regularly took part in Red Square parades in Moscow. However many of their number have died, its clear that the 331st did not achieve their central mission of circling and then taking Kyiv. Earlier this week the Kremlin announced plans to focus the invasion effort on the east of the country in what has widely been interpreted as an acceptance that the army was stretched too thin. This morning Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that retreating Russian forces are creating “a complete disaster” by leaving mines in homes as they retreat to the east. “They are mining the whole territory,"" the Ukrainian president said. ""They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed. There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.” Zelensky went on to urge Russian families not to let their young men sign up for the army as the Kremlin’s annual military conscription drive began. “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains,"" he said. ""Don’t send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. Keep them at home."" According to the BBC the following members of the 331st have died: Klim Abramov, Cpl Artem Arbuzov, Oleg Bedoshvili, Capt (Co Cdr) Yurii Borisov, Snr Lt Ilya Chernyshev, Cpl Yuri Degtaryov, Konstantin Dobrynin, Sasha Dolkin, Sgt Sergei Duganov, Kiril Fedoseyev, Andrey Kovalevsky, Maj Sergei Krylov, Stanislav Kutelev, Cpl Yanosh Leonov, Sgt Alexander Limonov, Snr WO Sergei Lobachyo, Cpl Ivan Mamzurin, Cpl Ilya Martynenko, Lt Lev Ovchinnikov, Maksim Ovchinnikov, Cpl Leonid Panteleyev, Maj Oleg Patskalyev, Sgt Stanislav Petrutik, Sgt Roman Pomelov, Snr WO Pavel Rudenko, Snr Lt Alexander Shalygin, Sgt Nikolai Smirnov, Col Sergei Sukharev, Maxim Svetlenko, Snr Lt Nikolai Symov, Daniil Titov, Maxim Trokai, Ivan Turyev, Sgt Maxim Vorotyntsev, Capt Alexei Vyshegorodtsev, Alexei Yelimov, Cpl Artem Yergin, Sgt Ravshan Zhakbaev, Cpl Danila Zudkov.",7,4.625900173961113,4.827399051009273,-0.20149887704816027,22
2022-04-02,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/horror-mass-killings-ukraine-men-26621558,Horror at genocide in Ukraine as civilians slaughtered and bodies lining streets,"Horrifying details are emerging of mass killings and civilians being slaughtered in the streets of Ukraine in previously Russian-occupied areas. As the Kremlin’s forces pull out of towns and villages around the capital Kyiv, Ukraine’s forces and journalists from the west are able to step foot back in them for the first time since they were taken early in the invasion. However, they have been greeted with horror scenes of dead bodies littering the streets. At least 280 people were found dead in the village of Bucha, after Russian forces left the settlement. A reporter for the AFP news agency in the village counted dozens of bodies and one man whose hands were tied. Their bodies littered the streets, greeting those who entered the village. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In the recaptured town of Bucha, reached by news agency Reuters, the sprawled remains of more than a dozen bodies lined one road. A mass grave in the grounds of a church was still open, with hands and feet poking through the red clay heaped on top. Bucha's mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said more than 300 residents had been killed and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “Indeed, this is genocide - the elimination of the whole nation and the people.” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was appalled by atrocities in Bucha and voiced support for the International Criminal Court's inquiry into potential war crimes in Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia on Sunday of carrying out a deliberate ""massacre"" in the town and called on the G7 to impose ""devastating"" new sanctions on Moscow. ""We are still gathering and looking for bodies, but the number has already gone into the hundreds. ""Dead bodies lie on the streets. They killed civilians while staying there and when they were leaving these villages and towns,"" his ministry quoted him as saying on Twitter. Other world leaders rushed to accuse Moscow or war crimes but Russia denies targeting civilians and rejects war crimes allegations. The photos show the widespread destruction and horrific actions of the Russian armies amidst fears this is only the beginning. A video believed to be of one such village shows Ukrainian troops having to slalom their trucks down the streets to avoid all the dead bodies that lay there. The haunting images show a significant number of dead, cast across the street and at the road side with no one to move their bodies. The video ends with two more bodies, of two people who died together. More horrifying reports are coming from the liberated regions around Kyiv and in Kyiv Oblast. Anastasiia Lapatina, a Ukrainian journalist, said: “Russians are shooting civilians after tying their hands behind their backs. “Dead bodies are all over the Kyiv oblast, on the streets, in cars, in people’s yards. Mass graves are full of unidentified bodies. ""Many families will never know what happened to their loved ones"". Another horrifying picture from Motizhin, in Kyiv Oblast, shows dead bodies half buried in what could be a mass grave. Faces and limbs are sticking out of the dirt and sand where the bodies were dumped. These shocking reports confirm the worst fears of many as the invasion continues into its fifth week. There have long been reports of Russian atrocities from occupied territories but the new pictures are proof of what many feared. BBC journalists found the bodies of civilians who were slaughtered by Russian troops in another part of Kyiv. In Mria and Myla, both in the Kyiv Oblast, they counted a total of 13 dead bodies along a stretch of road. It comes after Ukraine's troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages around Kyiv since Russia pulled back from the area this week, Ukrainian officials said. ""The whole Kyiv region is liberated from the invader,"" Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said. Ukraine's armed forces reported diminished Russian air and missile strikes on Saturday but said Russian troops retreating from near Kyiv were deploying mines. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in a video address: ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" Ukraine's emergencies service said over 1,500 explosives had been found in one day during a search of the village of Dmytrivka, west of Kyiv. However, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg feared the departure of Russian troops from around Kyiv was “not a real withdrawal”. He told CNN: “What we see is that Russia is repositioning its troops and they are taking some of them back to rearm them, to reinforce them, to resupply them.” Invading soldiers are thought to be regrouping after the Kremlin previously claimed they were concentrating on consolidating gains in eastern Ukraine and along the southern coast. Russian forces continued to pound the Black Sea port city of Odesa, the main base for Ukraine’s navy. If taken, it would give Russia a land corridor from Crimea to Transnistria - a Russian-speaking breakaway province of Moldova that hosts Russian troops. Serge Nykyforov told BBC1’s Sunday Morning show: “We found mass graves, we found people with their hands and with their legs tied up...and with shots, bullet holes, in the back of their head. “They were clearly civilians and they were executed. “We found half-burned bodies as if somebody tried to hide their crimes but they didn’t have enough time to do it properly.” He added: “It looks, I have to be careful with my wording, but it looks exactly like war crimes.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “Russia’s despicable attacks against innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha are yet more evidence that Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine. “No denial or disinformation from the Kremlin can hide what we all know to be the truth – Putin is desperate, his invasion is failing, and Ukraine’s resolve has never been stronger.”",45,3.3643416924290612,3.5560561342158774,-0.19171444178681618,18
2022-04-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/moment-ukraine-attack-helicopters-hit-26608588,Moment Ukraine attack helicopters 'hit Russian oil depot' sparking huge inferno,"An inferno burns into the night sky in shocking footage taken at a major oil depot in Russia, which has been blamed on an attack by an Ukrainian attack helicopter. The huge fireball was recorded at the site in border region Belgorod, with footage seeming to show missiles hitting the Freida industrial district of Belgorod city, causing a massive explosion, injuring two workers. The oil plant is around 25 miles from the Ukrainian border and firefighters are attempting to put out the flames. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of Belgorod region, claimed the depot was hit by a low altitude Ukrainian attack helicopter strike at around 5:50am local time, although there was no immediate confirmation. He said: “There are casualties. Two people. They're employees of the oil depot. They've been given first aid and their lives are not in danger. “We are starting to resettle the residents of Pochtovaya, Makarenko and Konstantin Zaslonov streets to a safer location.” Two days earlier Russia claimed Ukrainian forces had dropped a missile on a munitions depot some 12 miles from the border, also in Belgorod region. Six missiles hit the facility in Krasny Oktyabr with four soldiers wounded, according to Russian sources. If the attacks on Russian territory are confirmed as Ukraine, it would mark a significant escalation in the war, and a change of tactics from Kyiv. Until now, hostilities have been limited mainly to Ukrainian territory. On the earlier attack, Gladkov claimed: “Six cases of shells ... were registered. The most important thing is that there are no victims.” Meanwhile British military intelligence claim Ukrainian forces have retaken the villages of Sloboda and Lukashivka to the south of Chernihiv and located along main supply routes between the city and Kyiv. The Ministry of Defence said in its latest update: “Ukraine has also continued to make successful but limited counter attacks to the east and north east of Kyiv. Chernihiv and Kyiv have been subjected to continued air and missile strikes despite Russian claims of reducing activity in these areas, the ministry added. It comes as Britain's top military officer claimed Vladimir Putin has already lost the war and is weaker than he was a month ago. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin said: “I think we will have to look and explore and understand what the events in Ukraine mean and what impact does that have on the Integrated Review, and I think that’s perfectly fair. ""I think it would be insane not to.”",47,4.30455456662439,3.7492906124331142,0.5552639541912754,21

They were left behind by retreating Russian soldiers in what has been dubbed the highway of death. The BBC report that the tragic people were found on the same stretch of road where Vladimir Putin's troops were caught on video executing a couple last month. The broadcaster claim 13 bodies were counted between Mria and Myla, villages whose Ukrainian names translate as Dream and Sweetheart. Two of the dead are confirmed as Ukrainian civilians. The others have yet to be officially identified. They were found yards from where a couple were killed while trying to escape last month. Emergency service members carried the bodies civilians killed by the Russian attacks and they were to be transferred to a mortuary. Maksim Iowenko, his wife Ksjena and their six-year-old son were part of a convoy driving down the road when a Russian tank opened fire. Their young son survived and a friend's mother, who was also in the vehicle when it came under fire from a Russian tank unit, was injured. The BBC say bodies were strewn along a 200-yard stretch of the E-40 motorway that runs into Kyiv from the west. Journalists accompanied Ukrainian troops say they are uncovering more evidence of war crimes carried out by Putin's soldiers Along the road full of burned out cars, petrol stations and a hotel were in ruins following the relentless shellings. It is around five miles south of Irpin, a city recently reclaimed by Ukrainian troops. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn had confirmed around 3,500 people had stayed in the city, but this week that up to 300 civilians and 50 'defenders' were killed during during attacked. It comes as Russia may cut off a third of Europe's gas supply today after governments rejected Putin's demand for payment to be made in roubles, with Germany calling it ""blackmail"". Putin said he has signed a decree that foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas and in a televised address claimed contracts would be halted if these payments were not made. It is the Russian leaders strongest response yet to massive economic sanctions that have been imposed by the West on the country following its invasion of Ukraine. And a senior Russian foreign official said that the European Union will be hit hard for the sanctions, reported RIA. ""The actions of the EU will not remain unanswered ... the irresponsible sanctions by Brussels are already negatively affecting the daily lives of ordinary Europeans,"" Nikolai Kobrinets told the news agency.",45,4.070147725595642,3.975746471029613,0.09440125456602866,18

The daring dawn raid, apparently by two Ukrainian Mi-24 attack helicopters, is said to have sent a fireball shooting from the Belgorod complex, which was obliterated. Tonight there was also speculation it might have been a “false flag” or self-inflicted assault by Russia to excuse a major escalation in its war-crimes riddled invasion. It is possible Russia launched the attack themselves as they have the same helicopters and it was perhaps an attempt to scupper peace talks with Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba refused to confirm or deny whether it was a suspected Russian “false flag attack” or a successful Ukrainian military operation. There were also reports that two 25 pound unguided rockets smashed into the depot, setting off a blaze that was still burning throughout the morning. If it was a Ukrainian attack it is believed to be only the second time Ukraine has launched an attack inside Russia during the 37 day-long invasion by The Kremlin’s forces. Belgorod is just 25 miles north of the border with Ukraine and is 50 miles from Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, which has been battered by war. Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said: “The fire at the oil depot occurred as a result of an airstrike from two helicopters of the armed forces of Ukraine which entered the territory of Russia at low altitude. “There are no victims.” Previously it has been reported that Ukrainian troops hit another depot in Belgorod with Tochka ballistic missiles in a desperate bid to slow down the Russian military’s fuel supply chain. It has also been revealed that as many as 300 Syrian Army soldiers, recruited by Putin’s military to join the invasion effort, have arrived in Ukraine. They have fought alongside Kremlin troops in Syria, battling Islamic State, al-Qaeda factions and other terrorist organisation. They have been brought in as the spearhead force from President Assad’s troops and will be joined by hundreds more within days, sources said. In addition as many as 1,000 members of President Putin’s private military company The Wagner Group, a killer band of mercenaries, are also believed to be in Ukraine. Wagner fighters are believed to fighting in contested Donbas, in the east of Ukraine. On Friday there were reports Ukrainian troops were ambushing many Russian troops as they retreated towards Belarus from their positions north of Kyiv. And Ukraine accused Russian forces of using children as human shields in villages near Chernihiv. Sources said they used children as hostages to avoid locals being able to give their coordinates to Ukraine’s artillery teams. And a BBC team discovered 13 dead bodies on a stretch of road outside Kyiv, many of them civilians and possibly victims of more Russian brutality. As many as 17,500 Russian troops have been killed in brutal fighting in Ukraine, but the impact on civilians has been horrific, with thousands dead. During the day a Russian missile attack on a civic building in Mykolayiv killed 28 civilians, with the death toll expected to rise. As many as 153 children in Ukraine have been killed during the invasion, which is now in its sixth week, and 245 have been injured. Overnight air raid sirens blared throughout Ukraine and loud explosions went off in the capital Kyiv. It is thought some Russian troops have withdrawn from the northern outskirts of Kyiv and headed towards Belarus. But air-sorties on Kyiv and Chernihiv have increased since Russia said it would back off from the two cities as part of peace talks in Turkey.",47,3.731284553843236,3.611323934760987,0.11996061908224931,21

Anton and Alexei were both signalmen of the 150th Rifle Division and each leave behind partners, one of whom is pregnant.

The city has been left a ghost town with remaining civilians hiding in basement bunkers after weeks of devastating shell attacks. Parliamentary Human Rights Commissioner Liudmyla Denisova said the vulnerable targets, as well as doctors, are being snatched by troops in the southern port city and taken to the Donbas or Russia. Speaking on her Telegram channel on Wednesday, she claimed more than 70 such people have already been kidnapped out of a maternity hospital in the Livoberezhnyi district. Denisova urged the world community to pressure captives to release the hostages by increasing sanctions on Vladimir Putin's country. ""Such enemy actions threaten the life and health of women and newborns, and violate their right to life, freedom and personal integrity, guaranteed by Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" she added. Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko has also confirmed that people had been kidnapped from Mariupol. He said troops also abducted Kira Obedynska, the 12-year-old daughter of water polo champion Yevhen Obedynskyi and taken her to the occupied city of Donetsk. Obedynskyi was killed in Mariupol. Kyrylenko said: ""After the death of her father, Kira was left an orphan, since she had lost her mother in infancy. ""Kira is in Donetsk now, she was deported there along with the people with whom she was hiding in a shelter. ""There is information that the Russians took the documents from all those with Kira. ""They promised to issue new Russian documents and deport them to Russia in the future."" The Governor added that the girl has relatives in Ukraine. Her grandfather, Honored Water Polo Coach of Ukraine, Oleksandr Obedynskyi, is ready to take her into his home. Denisova said invaders have already abducted almost 500,000 people from the temporarily occupied territories. Key Russian target Mariupol, which usually has a population of more than 400,000, is said to have been 90% destroyed in constant bombardments since the invasion began on February 24.

NATO chief Jan Stoltenberg believes Moscow is double dealing after claiming it would withdraw from Kyiv and Chernihiv to build up trust during peace talks. He said Russia was regrouping its forces amid evidence that its troops have suffered huge losses and have been repeatedly pushed back north of Kyiv anyway. Mr Stoltenberg said: “We have heard the recent statements that Russia will scale down military operations around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine. “But Russia has repeatedly lied about its intentions. So we can only judge Russia on its actions, not on its words. According to our intelligence, Russian units are not withdrawing, but repositioning. “Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region. “At the same time, Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering.” It came after UK spy boss Sir Jeremy Fleming said Putin had “massively misjudged” the war. The GCHQ chief, in Australia, said in a rare public speech: “He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanise. “He overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory. “We’ve seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale – refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment, and accidentally shooting down their own aircraft. Even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.” The White House confirmed that “Putin is being misinformed by his advisors”, while the head of Britain’s armed forces, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, said Russia’s bid to take all of Ukraine looks to have “fallen apart” and said that Moscow’s withdrawal leaves its troops open to counter-attacks. Further allegations of Russian war crimes emerged today. Ukraine’s SBU spy service released a tape of an intercepted call in which a Russian soldier said: “We have three tank guys here – they raped a girl.” The voice adds: “She was 16.” In another call a soldier “sick” of ready meals said: “We had dog yesterday. We just wanted some meat.” The recordings, being compiled for future war crimes trials, were released on Twitter. One Ukrainian responded: “Filth – they will burn in hell.” Some Russian troops retreating from nuclear disaster zone Chernobyl, north of Kyiv, are being taken to a clinic in Gomel, Belarus, to be treated for “acute radiation sickness”. Yaroslav Yemelianenko, from the Ukrainian state agency overseeing the exclusion zone, said Russian troops had disturbed radiated sites. He said: “There are rules for dealing with this area.. because radiation is physics – it works without regard to status or shoulder straps.” By the war’s 36th day, 148 Ukrainian children had been killed. And Ukraine claimed 400,000 locals had been abducted to Russia. Rescuers searching ruined areas of Kyiv were warned by police that corpses could be booby-trapped. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the nation’s defence was “at a turning point”, and asked for more help from the West with “tanks, aircraft, artillery systems”. A petition to try Putin at the International Criminal Court has almost 1.5million signatures globally. Accusations include the bombing of a Mariupol theatre sheltering refugees where the death toll has hit 300. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said crimes against humanity, are being “thoroughly documented”. Despite claims of a retreat, both Kyiv and Chernihiv suffered more air attacks in the last 24 hours.",7,3.751721203307889,3.432236872309767,0.3194843309981219,6
2022-03-31,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/putins-misfiring-ukraine-invasion-worryingly-26602732,Putin's misfiring Ukraine war 'worryingly mirrors 90s Grozny comeback victory',"Vladimir Putin's 'misfiring' Ukraine invasion is actually mirroring Russia's successful occupation of Grozny in the 1990s, an expert has warned. Analysts are comparing the Kremlin leader to a misinformed and cornered rat who is more dangerous now than he was at the start of the war five weeks ago. The ex-KGB intelligence officer might begin to draw hope from his country's historical turnaround during the Chechen War in 1995, it is claimed. Leaked battle plans suggest Putin was confident his forces would conquer Ukrainian capital Kyiv within 48 hours when he declared his ""special military operation"" on February 24. But instead, the city has held strong and Moscow has seen catastrophic losses. On the face of it, Putin appears to have miscalculated many key points along the way. Ukrainian citizens haven't welcomed his troops as the saviours with open arms he was anticipating, and his opposing number, Volodymyr Zelensky, has not been defeated. He assumed Russia's economy was sanction proof, but it isn't. He counted on the support of China but they're hedging their bets. And his 'modernised' military is too riddled with mismanagement, low morale and old-fashioned equipment to bulldoze a plucky defence armed with high-tech NATO-supplied weaponry and a clear shared goal. The best obvious outcome at this stage is one in which Putin attempts to save face by accepting considerably smaller spoils and some sanctions are lifted, reports DNYUZ. Troops are already pulling back in certain areas. But such assumptions might be wrong, argues New York Times reporter Carlotta Gall, who covered the first Chechen war in the mid-1990s. In the early stages, Chechen fighters overcame an armoured Russian brigade - which went against Moscow's assumptions. But the invading troops regrouped and instead launched a sustained attack on Grozny from afar using artillery and air attacks, ending in Russian soldiers guarding a destroyed city on plastic chairs. “There is a whole next stage to the Putin playbook, which is well known to the Chechens,” Gall writes in NYT. She said that war began with a ""shocking display of Russian incompetence"", with a ""blundering"" army consisting of conscripted soldiers ignorant of the real state of play. An expected swift overthrow of local leadership turned into a dogfight with Chechen fighters wiping out an entire Maikop brigade in one night. The Chechens celebrated victory, but Gall recalls, the lull failed to last. A renewed bombardment from Russian forces saw the defending troops expertly use Guerrilla warfare to hold off invaders for weeks. But it didn't deter the invaders and they continued with ""brute force"", annihilating anything in their way with tactics that grew were more and more horrific - and seemingly out of control. ""There was much in the experience that echoes in Ukraine today,"" writes Gall. ""Even though nearly 30 years have intervened, it is staggering to see Russia employ many of the same tactics — and mistakes — in Ukraine."" But after three months, they finally had what they wanted in the capital Grozny. A Chechen commander, Muslim Cheberloevsky, who fought against the Russian army, said of Moscow: “They have stupid tactics from the time of the Russian empire, they have not changed. “Their most important tactic is throwing bodies into the battle. They do not care about their own soldiers."" However, there is also an argument this has all been a distraction, and Putin instead has had his eyes on the energy rich eastern regions of Ukraine, home to Europe's second-largest natural gas reserves. Added to that are Crimea - taken in 2014 - which contains huge offshore energy fields, and Luhansk and Donetsk, taken before last month's full-scale invasion, with their enormous shale-gas field. Putin is also bidding to take much of Ukraine's coastline. Canadian energy expert David Knight Legg said: “Under the guise of an invasion, Putin is executing an enormous heist.” His primary plan all along may well have been to simply secure Russia's monopoly on energy - putting it in a far stronger position in the long run when dealing with sanctions.",7,3.5338351231275227,3.839563833272456,-0.3057287101449333,6

Lt Col Alexander Kornik, 39, was reported to have died alongside eight soldiers of his regiment with 17 more injured. Six bodies of dead servicemen could not be removed from the water, and were carried away by the current on March 27, said senior Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsymbalyuk. However, separate accounts give the date of his death as March 2 and March 15. News of Kornik's death comes the day after it was announced that top Russian general Col Denis Kurilo had been ""eliminated"" along with 1,500 troops. The commander of the 200th motorised rifle brigade died in fighting outside Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, it was claimed. Just three days prior, Ukraine announced Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev, 48, was the seventh general and the second lieutenant general to be killed in the invasion. Sources in Kyiv said the commander, who previously claimed that the war would be over in a matter of hours, died in a strike close to Kherson city. Pictures show a funeral service held for Kornik in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg where he was given full military honours. Despite this, Russia has not officially announced his death in common with many soldiers killed in Ukraine. Putin has only acknowledged the death of one general so far, understood to be Major Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky, in a speech shortly after the war began. Ukrainian forces have also claimed to have eliminated Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, Major General Oleg Mityaev, Major General Vitaly Gerasimov and Major General Andrei Kolesnikov. Reports indicate that Kornik was chief of staff of the 40th Engineer Regiment. The Russian troops were killed seeking to build the pontoon over the Desna River. Ukrainian sources say that five years ago he was barred from entry to the country and found carrying classified documents seen as military training manuals. They included blasting and de-mining instructions and guides on installing heavy machine guns on vehicles, as well as the construction of fortifications and defensive structures. He was accused at the time of supervising the training of gangs in the occupied territories of Ukraine.",7,5.767450721642947,5.756414705884628,0.011036015758319806,22

The Pentagon confirmed Russian troops were pulling out of the irradiated nuclear wasteland, but an employee at the Public Council at the State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management said they were running away ""irradiated"". He said they were being transported by the bus load to a special radiation medical centre in Gomel, Belarus to help treat their radioactive poisoning. In a post on facebook, Yaroslav Yemelianenko, who worked to keep the site safe, said: ""Another batch of radiation irradiation of Russian terrorists who captured the Chernobyl zone, was brought to the Belarusian center of radiation medicine in Gomel today. ""Digging the trenches in the Rudu forest, bitches? Now live the rest of your short life with this. There are rules of handling this territory. ""They are mandatory to perform because radiation is physics - it works regardless of status or chases. If you have minimal intelligence in command or soldiers, these consequences could have been avoided."" He went onto quote a Belarusian TV channel which said ""about 7 medical PAZs arrived at the Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology. ""The photo shows that people are visible in cars. Let's note that Russian soldiers are brought to this centre on a regular basis"" This shocking revelation comes as US intelligence confirmed Russian soldiers have withdrawn from the site. It also comes days after Russian claimed it would 'drastically reduce combat operations' around Kyiv. Earlier this week, Moscow claimed it would take the significant step as a gesture to advance peace talks, but both Ukrainian and US officials expressed scepticism about Russian intentions. ABC News reported that the Pentagon said they had only seen “small numbers” of Russian withdrawals after Russia's first claim, but that these were repositioning of troops, not retreat. They challenged Russia characterising this as a move for peace, when in reality it was talked up military strategy. Then, the Pentagon said it believed those troops could simply be moved elsewhere such as to the Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, where Russia controls. In its most specific description of Russian forces moving away from Kyiv, the Pentagon said that ""less than 20%"" of the Russian contingent in the vicinity of the Ukrainian capital were starting to ""reposition"". Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said those that had begun to move away from Kyiv had been deployed in the vicinity of the Hostomel airport north west of Kyiv. He added, it appeared that the Russian troops being pulled away from the capital was in an effort to resupply and reorganise with their help elsewhere, not send them back to Russia. However, the move will be greeted as good news by many as early fighting around the infamous nuclear power station raised fears it could become damaged amid gunfire. It comes as earlier today the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned the occupying Russian forces that there was a danger of ammunition exploding at the site. In a video posted on Telegram, she said: ""We demand that the UN Security Council immediately take measures to demilitarize the Chernobyl exclusion zone and introduce a special UN mission there to eliminate the risk of the repeat of a nuclear catastrophe."" Only days ago, Russian troops trampled unprotected one of deadliest area, Chernobyl's 'Red Forest', kicking up radioactive dust. On the first day of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the site's workers quickly became trapped there at the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. The workers were stuck there for more than 12 days under Russian guard, keeping the site working and safe. Even though it is no longer a functioning power station, Chernobyl was never abandoned and requires constant supervision to keep safe. It was this that Russia jeopardised early on. But now, it looks like as Russia's invading forces continue to be stretched thin, the Kremlin may have recalled the soldiers. This comes over a month into Moscow's deadly invasion of Ukraine. Early reports claimed Russia had intended to seize the capital in a 'lightning invasion', the Financial Times reported. Instead of seizing the capital and rampaging across the country, welcomed as victors, like some Russian troops reportedly expected, they are in the second months of staunch, bloody Ukrainian resistance. And instead of ousting comedian-turned-politician Volodymyr Zelensky's government, Russia are now negotiating with them.",7,3.365457328036323,3.8781117627293233,-0.5126544346930002,11

The complex - clearly marked with the famous red cross and white background sign - was struck with artillery and targeted by warplanes. It was the latest possible barbaric war crime committed by Moscow’s troops amid growing doubt about Kremlin peace negotiations. The red cross building is in besieged port city Mariupol where officials warn a desperate humanitarian disaster is fast unfolding with thousands killed by Russia. Ukrainian ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said: “In Mariupol, the occupiers aimed at the building of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)."" She said that on Wednesday the building came under fire even though its roof is marked with an internationally recognised Red Cross symbol. The symbol marks out that the structure holds wounded or ill people, or civilian or humanitarian cargo and is clearly visible from the air. She added: “This is another war crime by the Russian Army in accordance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and a gross violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. “I call on the world community to condemn the barbaric actions of the occupying country in shelling the ICRC building and to take measures to end the bloody war on the territory of Ukraine as soon as possible.” There is overwhelming evidence now of apartment buildings, residences, hospitals, cultural venues, and shopping malls destroyed by Russian bombs. As many as 300 people have been slaughtered by Russian airstrikes and shooting in Irpin, near Kyiv before the town was snatched back by Ukraine this week. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn confirmed that he believed many bodies of victims still lie beneath the rubbled buildings. It was revealed by Ukraine today that 145 children have now died from Russian attacks and 232 have been wounded. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly counter-attacked Russian troops around the capital and in other cities throughout the country, driving them back. Many observers and analysts believe Russian claims of a withdrawal from Kyiv and Chernihiv coincide with Moscow suffering huge losses. A former western intelligence officer told the Daily Mirror: “This is not about the Kremlin seriously negotiating a peace deal with Ukraine. “It is about Russia regrouping, consolidating, re-arming and forming new battle plans to try and bring Ukraine to its knees, whilst leaving it ruined. “The Kremlin knows its forces have been hammered with losses of more than 17,000 and there is huge cynicism about their intentions to negotiate.” London-based security sources added that their counterparts in the United States were also “highly doubtful” about Russian sincerity regarding peace. Today a former Ukrainian national security adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky cast doubt on Russian pledges to stop attacking Kyiv and Chernihiv. Moscow negotiators had suggested they will partially withdraw from the two cities as a gesture to gain trust from Ukrainian peace negotiators in Istanbul, Turkey. But Kyiv suffered a massive cyber attack within hours and by morning Ukraine announced there was “no evidence” of a Russian withdrawal. The capital’s Ministry of Defence reported a “massive” and “ongoing” cyber attack on its official website - with Russian hackers being prime suspects. Oleksander Danylyuk said the sound of shelling this morning had confirmed his fears. He added: ”This is just regrouping,” and he added that Russia is “not going to ease their grab” on Kyiv and Chernihiv – “this is just words.” He continued: “As always there are military and diplomatic KGB games all combined, this is just one game.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed fears that Moscow is not serious about de-escalating as peace talks continue. He said: “Yes, we can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive. But those signals don’t silence the explosions of Russian shells. “Of course we see the risks. Of course we don’t see any basis for trusting the words voiced by those or other representatives of the state that is continuing to fight for our destruction.” Mayor of Ukrainian city Ivano Frankivsk Ruslan Martsynkiv, told the Daily Mirror: “I do not believe the Russians intend to stop this attack - not at all. “Even if there was a peace deal negotiated, they will start the war again within a year, maybe even sooner. Nobody believes them and why should they, given what they are doing?” Negotiations resumed this morning, five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead, almost four million Ukrainians fleeing the country and nearly ten million displaced. UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said UK sanctions against Russia will remain in place until the invasion of Ukraine is “withdrawn.” He added: “The sanctions are there to tighten the grip on Putin’s war machine.”",47,3.4471793582248575,3.436710997816796,0.010468360408061539,9

The nation's forces announced this week they had retaken Trostyanets, a town northwest of Kharkiv, that became the site of fierce clashes with Russian troops for weeks. Last week, after its advances stalled on several fronts, Russia appeared to revise its military goals in Ukraine. Russia claimed it would focus its efforts on the battle in the eastern Donbas region. In images emerging from the town after it was abandoned by Russian troops, victorious Ukrainian servicemen can be seen walking among the debris of destroyed Russian military vehicles. Other pictures show the ghost town left behind after entire neighbourhoods were razed to the ground by Russian bombs. The 20,000 person town fell at the beginning of March, the Governor of Sumy Oblast said. Experts say around 15,000 troops stationed in the town were part of an armoured group believed to be waiting for supplies before launching an offensive on Kyiv. Earlier today one of Vladimir Putin's highest-ranked aides announced Russia plans to drastically cut its military activity around Kyiv and Chernihiv. Deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said the decision comes in the interest of pursuing more peace talks between the countries. It comes amid hopes that a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could be held in the coming days.

Ukraine has announced that Colonel Denis Kurilo, commander of the 200th motorised rifle brigade, had been ""eliminated"". He is claimed to have died in fighting outside Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine. The Ukrainian army claims Kurilo's brigade had lost around 1,500 troops since the start of the war, while overall 17,200 members of Putin's forces are claimed to have died. In a statement it said: “During battles near Kharkiv, the enemy’s 200th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade lost two battalion and tactical groups and the brigade’s commander, colonel Denis Kurilo. ""The losses of the 200th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade came to more than 1,500 troops."" Three days before Kurilo's death was announced, Ukraine said Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev, had been killed in a strike close to the southern city of Kherson. Rezantsev, who previously claimed that the war would be over in a matter of hours, was claimed by Ukraine to be the seventh general and the second lieutenant general to die in the invasion. At this point Putin has only acknowledged the death of one general - thought to be Major Gen Andrey Sukhovetsky - in a speech shortly after the war began. Ukrainian forces have also claimed to have eliminated Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, Major General Oleg Mityaev, Major General Vitaly Gerasimov and Major General Andrei Kolesnikov. Additionally there have been reports that Maj Gen Magomed Tushayev, of the Chechen national guard, has been killed, the BBC reports. The first general's death came only four days into the invasion, and in the just over three weeks since, a significant number of Russian military leaders have been killed in battle. Many Russian units suffering heavy losses in Ukraine had been forced to return home and to neighbouring Belarus, British military intelligence today. It comes after Russia promised to scale down military operations around Kyiv. .Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reacted with scepticism to the offer made by Russia during negotiations in Istanbul aimed at de-escalating a conflict now in its fifth week. His forces have halted the invasion on most fronts, and some analysts noted that Russia's promise to reduce fighting mostly covered areas where it has been losing ground. Heavy losses and the withdrawal of some troops was impacting Russian operations, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence. It said: ""Such activity is placing further pressure on Russia's already strained logistics and demonstrates the difficulties Russia is having re-organising its units in forward areas within Ukraine.""

Roman Hrybov was based on the tiny Snake Island in the Black Sea with 13 other soldiers when he refused to give up despite being outnumbered and being bombarded from sea and air by the Russians. On being told to put down their weapons, the response from Hrybov by radio that “Russian warship, go f*** yourself”, was broadcast around the world. Initially it was feared that the soldiers had died as the radio recording suddenly cut out but it was later revealed that some had survived and were taken prisoner. President Volodymyr Zelensky said at first that all the soldiers would be given posthumous medals. He later said in an interview that “some of the soldiers died, some were taken prisoner”. Now Hrybov, from the city of Cherkasy, has been returned in exchange for sailors on a Russian ship that was captured on March 25 by Ukrainian forces. A video by Cherkasy’s Regional State Administration has shown him being given an award from the head of of the regional administration Igor Taburets. Hrybov said: ""I want to say a big thank you to the Ukrainian people for such support. We strongly feel this support, it inspires us."" Also, Taburets said that the border guard was ""an example"" to other Ukrainians. ""I think that Ukraine should really know its heroes and Cherkasy should know its heroes,"" he said. ""The most important thing is that he survived, in spite of moral pressure, in spite of everything, and he will be an example for our Ukrainians and the people of Cherkasy.""

It comes as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russian troops are murdering officials in cities throughout the country Speaking from Kyiv, he accused Moscow’s forces of kidnapping Mayors and then leaving them dead or missing. Early in the war Ivan Federov, mayor of Melitopol, was abducted by Russian troops, sparking mass protests by Ukrainians. Ten masked soldiers are said to have entered the town’s crisis centre, put a bag over his head and marched him away to an unknown location. Days later Yevheniy Matvieyev, head of the southern town of Dniprorudne, was also abducted by Russian troops, leading to accusations made against Moscow of “systematic war crimes” by Ukraine’s military. Zelensky said: “They are kidnapping the mayors of our cities. They killed some of them. We can’t find some of them. “We have already found some of them and they are dead.” The shocking claim comes amid fears Russian troops are compensating for their disastrous invasion by resorting to deliberately targeting civilians and executing officials.

Ramzan Kadyrov, known for his love of using cruel mediaeval tortures against his enemies, has been promoted to Lt-General in the national guard. In the past the West has suspected him of ordering a number of extra-judicial killings outside Russia, which he has always denied. His crimes are said to include human rights abuses and torturing his political opponents and gay activists. The tyrant has now taken charge of Russia’s mission to wipe port city Mariupol - once the home of around 500,000 people- off the map. Operativnye Svodki Telegram channel reported on March 28: ""Sources close to the Chechen leader's entourage say that Ramzan Kadyrov is in Mariupol and personally leads the special operation."" A video shows him meeting and embracing General Andrey Mordvichev who was the fifth of Putin’s leading soldiers to die in Ukraine in the war, according to the Defence ministry of Ukraine. Ruslan Geremeyev, a senior officer with the Chechen Interior Ministry, suspected of involvement in the 2015 assassination of Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, is also said to be taking part in Russia ’s ""special military operation"" in Mariupol. Kadyrov credited him with a key role in the mayhem that has seen much of Mariupol destroyed. He said: “My dear brother Ruslan Geremeyev always completes tasks entrusted to him. “He was assigned the most difficult sector in Mariupol and the commander completed the mission with flying colours... “This time too, he lived up to his name of an experienced and fearless commander.” Around 100,000 people are still trapped in Mariupol, which has been 90% destroyed after being pulverised by air and artillery strikes. Surrounded by Russian forces, those doing their best to survive in the city have had no power, water or heat for more than a month. Shops have been emptied of supplies and bodies of those killed in the incessant bombing raids either litter the streets or have been buried in makeshift graves. It is feared as many as 5,000 have been killed in Mariupol where hundreds of corpses have been dumped in mass graves ordered by its council. Mayor Boichenko said on national television: “The situation in the city remains difficult. People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe. ""We need to completely evacuate Mariupol."" “The Russian Federation is playing with us. We are in the hands of the invaders.""",47,4.992457506786205,4.373286613271488,0.6191708935147169,24

The unconfirmed report from Kyiv's Ministry of Defence said that the un-named commander of Russia ’s 13th tank regiment – part of the “4th tank division of the Russian Federation” shot himself on discovering 90% of his tanks could not be used. It is claimed that materials from the tanks had been stolen, reported the Daily Star. Bill Browder, a businessman who was for many years the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia, says that financial corruption has crippled the Russian army. “My estimate is that 80% of the military budget is stolen by Russia’s generals, because 80% of all budgets in Russia are stolen by the officials in charge,"" Browder told the Wall Street Journal. Because their wages are skimmed by their superiors, the rank and file troops are reduced to selling the fuel from their tanks on the black market to supplement their income. Ukraine ’s Ministry of Defence said in a Telegram bulletin that that some of the tanks’ vital electronic equipment, which contains gold and other precious metals, had been stripped. It claimed Russia is “is trying to put into operation a significant amount of equipment coming from long-term storage facilities,” and “the condition of this equipment is mostly extremely unsatisfactory, which makes its full use impossible”. Ukraine reportedly said that Russia’s plans to transfer equipment from storage facilities and into battle have collapsed because so much of the kit has been stripped and sold by servicemen. The corruption comes from the top, says Browder, with Russian leader Vladimir having a personal fortune “north of $200 billion” hidden away in secret bank accounts – often in the names of his oligarch cronies. That figure would put the Russian leader's net worth close to that of the official richest man in the world, Elon Musk. But, he adds, Putin’s incredible wealth could be taken from him if he were to be deposed by a Kremlin rival. “The moment he’s not in power, none of these handshake deals with the oligarchs will be respected,"" he said. It’s because of Putin’s need to be seen a strongman within Russia that the invasion of Ukraine was triggered, claimed Border. “Putin believed he needed a good war. And so the fundamental motivation for invading Ukraine was about staying in power,” he stated.",7,4.406312107145352,4.672417431796428,-0.2661053246510763,17

Russian state media reports that Ukraine shelling struck the arsenal causing it to explode. There are at least four injuries although that may be downplaying the severity of the attack. Witnesses said the strike had “presumably” come either “via drone or short range ballistic missile”. Video of the explosion shared to the social media platform shows a huge explosion illuminating the night sky in the distance of the scene being filmed. It seems to cause the ground to shake, with the clip shuddering up and down as the videographer pans the scene. The attack comes as the latest blow to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who is currently said to be hiding away at a top secret nuclear bunker east of Moscow. Movements of planes used by top Kremlin officials show that Putin could be spending some or all of his time at the hideaway near Surgut in western Siberia, it is claimed. The use of the high security bunkers, if confirmed, is alarming and suggests Putin may be preparing to deploy nuclear weapons, and move that would lead to inevitable reprisal. Putin's defence minister Sergei Shoigu is also believed to be in a bunker near Ufa in the Urals, 725 miles east of Moscow, according to investigative journalist Christo Grozev. The Kremlin said it will be withdrawing troops from the Kyiv area of Ukraine after days of stalemate at the Ukraine capital. The UK's defence ministry Ben Wallace said earlier that Ukrainian forces had succeeded in pushing back Russian troops from a number of positions. In Chernihiv, however, the city remains under heavy shelling. The city's mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, has estimated that 400 residents have been killed there since the war began. Deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin claims the decision to withdraw troops from the are Kyiv area comes in the interest of pursuing more peace talks between the countries. There are hopes that a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could be held in the coming days. Ukrainian negotiators have proposed adopting neutral status with international guarantees to protect it from attack. Negotiators said they would not join alliances or host bases of foreign troops - but would have their security guaranteed in a similar manner to the collective defence clause of NATO. The countries identified to be allowed in facilitating these guarantees are Israel and NATO members Canada, Poland and Turkey. Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said he will be reporting the Ukrainian proposals to Putin.",47,4.116299067279837,4.334920207733835,-0.2186211404539975,25

Vladimir Putin's forces have been accused of a war crime amid reports that civilians are being made to leave the city of Mariupol - meaning children are forcibly separated from their parents. The port city has been devastated by weeks of heavy bombardment, and it now claimed that Russian soldiers have been bursting into cellars where people are hiding and telling them they must leave in 15 minutes. Segei Orlov, deputy mayor of Mariupol, said that if they refuse, their buildings are destroyed, leaving families ""entombed"". He said he has been told that up to 40,000 people are being taken to Russia to work for the state in ""depressed areas"". Mr Orlov told The Sun : “Russian troops are bursting into cellars and basements where our people are hiding like frightened mice and telling them: ‘You have 15 minutes to leave.’ “If they refuse to come out the buildings are destroyed, leaving families entombed. ""We have made contact with people who have told us what is happening — they are being taken off to Russia to work for the state in depressed areas."" He described it as ""forced labour"", saying civilians are being made to work for Russia in order to survive. Mr Orlov also claimed children were being separated from their parents when being taken from the city, saying hundreds of youngsters ""from kindgergarten age upwards"" are being held at a hospital in Donetsk. He said Russia is ""trying everything they can to break us"". The United Nations has confirmed 1,119 civilian deaths and 1,790 injuries across Ukraine - but says the real toll is likely to be higher. Yesterday Ukraine said 139 children had been killed and more than 205 wounded so far in the conflict. Mariupol, located between Crimea and eastern areas held by Russian-backed separatists, has been devastated by weeks of heavy bombardment. Thousands of residents are sheltering in basements with scarce water, food, medicine or power. The Ukrainian President is willing to meet Moscow on some of its demands if Russian troops withdraw from the country, he has revealed. Volodymyr Zelensky told a group of Russian independent journalists on Sunday that Kyiv was prepared to become neutral and meet Moscow on some of its demands. It would abandon its drive to join NATO and vow not to develop nuclear weapons, on the basis that Russia would withdraw troops and give Kyiv security guarantees. No peace deal would be possible without a ceasefire and withdrawal of troops, he said, though he ruled out trying to recapture all Russian-held territory by force, saying it ""would lead to a third world war"".

A sickening video shared widely on social media appears to show a senior commander admitting to ""war crimes"". At least three Russian troops appear to have been shot in the legs after being detained, and some have white bags on their heads. In the distressing video, one loses consciousness or dies, say reports. The Ukrainians appear to be quizzing the men in order to identify Russian officers. The “torture” allegedly took place in the village of Olkhovka (Vilkhivka) on the eastern outskirts of Kharkiv, on Friday. The footage has caused outrage in Russia, but Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelensky, has also acknowledged that this “massacre” amounted to a “war crime”, and promised a full investigation. ""I can say we have an extremely strict attitude towards such cases,” he said, referring to the footage. “There will be an investigation. I have repeatedly said officially that we do not torture prisoners.” Ukraine ’s army was “European” and while there would “always be excesses”, a “massacre of prisoners of war is against the laws of military honour and is a war crime”. He vowed: “There will be a very serious investigation, and those guilty, if found, will be punished.” He said that “every member of the defence forces will be told that this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour, it is a war crime”. He added: “More precisely, what is happening there has the characteristics of a war crime, a crime that can only be qualified by a court, which has no statute of limitations, no amnesty in Ukrainian or international law.” Russia has separately opened a criminal investigation into the “extreme cruelty” of Ukrainian “nationalists” in their treatment of Russian military captives. “Footage appeared on the Internet in which Ukrainian nationalists treat prisoners extremely cruelly,” said a statement from the Russian Investigative Committee. “A video circulating on the net shows how captured soldiers were shot in the legs without medical assistance. “According to some reports, illegal actions took place at a base of Ukrainian nationalists in the Kharkiv region.” Ukraine’s military commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhniy did not specifically deny the authenticity of these videos but claimed Russia “produces and shares videos with inhuman treatment of alleged ‘Russian prisoners’ by ‘Ukrainian soldiers’ in order to discredit Ukrainian defence forces.

The footage from the Russian invasion of Ukraine captures a weapon system targeting the armoured vehicle, which appears on the system's screen in a grainy image. A series of munitions are then seen striking the hull of the T-72B3 tank, and a few seconds later the vehicle explodes as the projectile detonates. The hand of a Ukrainian soldier operating the system can also be seen, as they guide in the precision weapon to hit the tank at close range. It is thought to be a Skif anti-tank guided missile. Ukrainian forces have inflicted heavy losses on Russian armour, using sophisticated anti-tank weaponry to cause heavy damage to Putin's armoured columns. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The Javelin missile system has been put to particularly devastating use by Ukrainian armed forces. This anti-tank weapon is used by infantry, and is capable of hitting targets both directly and indirectly, with the projectile being designed to plunge down on top of a tank from above where the armour is often weakest. The Javelin's distinctive sound when fired can also have a significant psychological impact on enemy soldiers, and its operators can change position frequently, making them difficult to track down. One Russian solider was even bribed into surrendering his vehicle, which he gave up in exchange for £7,500 and Ukrainian citizenship. Russian morale appears to be only getting worse, with one Russian solider even driving his tank over his commanding officer as a result of the awful losses the Russian army has suffered. At least fifteen senior Russian commanders have so far been killed during the invasion, with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky claiming that more than 16,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, as well as significant losses being inflicted on Russian military hardware. Observers of the invasion have highlighted Putin's abject failure to achieve the objectives of the invasion, despite the Kremlin's assertion that the 'special military operation' had achieved what it set out to. Nonetheless, despite the losses suffered by Russian forces, there has still been a devastating impact upon Ukraine, with some drawing harrowing parallels between the military and media tactics that Russia used during its intervention in Syria in 2015.

The claims were made by mayor Vadym Boichenko as the Ukrainian forces maintain their grip on parts of the country. But the leader did not say how the 5,000 death toll was calculated. It came as Oleksandr Markushyn, mayor of Irpin, near the fiercely fought over city of Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces had seized full control back over the town. Irpin has been one of the main hotspots of fighting with Russian troops near the capital. He said in a post on Telegram: ""We have good news today - Irpin has been liberated.

They killed some of them. We can’t find some of them. “We have already found some of them and they are dead.” Zelensky’s shocking claim comes amid fears Russian troops are compensating for their disastrous invasion by resorting to deliberately targeting civilians and executing officials. Ahead of peace talks the Ukrainian leader said his country could declare neutrality and offer security guarantees to Russia to secure peace “without delay”. Whilst claiming only a face-to-face meeting with Putin would end war Zelensky added: “Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state - we are ready to go for it.” Talking before the latest round of peace talks, which are to be held in Turkey tomorrow, Zelensky stressed Ukraine ’s priority is ensuring its sovereignty and its “territorial integrity.” He said: “We must come to an agreement with the president of the Russian Federation, and in order to reach an agreement, he needs to get out of there on his own feet - and come to meet me.” Today it emerged 17,000 Russian troops have been killed in the invasion and 586 tanks blown up in ferocious fighting. Moscow has also lost 123 warplanes and 127 helicopters to Ukraine’s ground defence systems.

And Ukraine has lost $432 billion from the Russian invasion, according to Kyiv Economy Minister Yulia Svyridenko. She said: “This is the sum of the only one-time losses that Ukraine has suffered since the Russian invasion.” She added that the biggest damage is the loss of infrastructure - 5,000 miles of roads, dozens of railway stations and airports worth £90 billion were destroyed and damaged. With Russia’s offensive stalled its troops have resorted to pummelling Ukrainian towns and cities with rockets and artillery in a grinding war of attrition. Fierce fighting has raged on the outskirts of Kyiv, but Russian troops remain miles from the city centre, their aim of quickly encircling the capital faltering In Stoyanka village near Kyiv, Ukrainian soldier Serhiy Udod said Russian troops had taken up defensive positions and suffered heavy losses. He said “probably they thought it would be like Crimea”, which Russia annexed quickly and almost without a shot fired in 2014. He added: “But, here it’s not like in Crimea.

Here they suffer and get killed.” A fiercer than expected Ukrainian resistance, bolstered by weapons from the UK and other Western allies, has bogged Russian forces down.

Ukraine 's head of military intelligence Kyrylo Budanov said the despot was planning to ""create North and South Korea in Ukraine"". Mr Budanov was referring to the carving-up of Korea into two separate states after World War Two. He predicted Russian forces will be pushed back with a new phase of military action that he called ""Ukrainian guerilla safari"". He said: ""In addition, the season of a total Ukrainian guerrilla safari will soon begin. ""Then there will be one relevant scenario left for the Russians, how to survive."" It comes as the country's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the West to give Ukraine tanks, planes and missiles to help fend off the Russian forces, which the Kyiv government said were increasingly targeting fuel and food depots. In its latest military assessment, the British Ministry of Defence said Russian forces appeared to be concentrating their efforts on encircling Ukrainian troops directly facing separatist regions in the east. ""The battlefield across northern Ukraine remains largely static with local Ukrainian counterattacks hampering Russian attempts to reorganise their forces,"" the ministry said. After more than four weeks of conflict, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and Moscow signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions to focus on securing the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army for the past eight years. A local leader in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic said on Sunday the region could soon hold a referendum on joining Russia, just as happened in Crimea after Russia seized the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014. Crimeans voted overwhelmingly to break with Ukraine and join Russia -- a vote that much of the world refused to recognise. Moscow says the goals for what Putin calls a ""special military operation"" include demilitarising and ""denazifying"" its neighbour. Ukraine and its Western allies calls this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion. The invasion has devastated several Ukrainian cities, caused a major humanitarian crisis and displaced an estimated 10 million people, nearly a quarter of Ukraine's total population. In a late-night television address on Saturday, Zelenskiy demanded that Western nations hand over military hardware that was ""gathering dust"" in stockpiles, saying his nation needed just 1% of NATO's aircraft and 1% of its tanks. Western nations have so far given Ukraine anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles as well as small arms and protective equipment, but have not offered any heavy armour or planes. ""We've already been waiting 31 days. Who is in charge of the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it really still Moscow, because of intimidation?"" Zelenskiy said, suggesting Western leaders were holding back on supplies because they were frightened of Russia. Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said on Sunday that Russia had started destroying Ukrainian fuel and food storage centres, meaning the government would have to disperse stocks of both in the near future. Appearing to confirm that, the Russian defence ministry said its missiles had wrecked a fuel deposit on Saturday as well as a military repair plant near the western city of Lviv, just 60 km (40 miles) from the Polish border.",7,2.9652856441680964,2.8297842877796566,0.13550135638843974,6

Water, power and heat stopped working weeks ago as the people trapped inside attempted to survive on scraps they found in what was left of long-abandoned shops. Chillingly, the city has been unable to keep up with the huge death toll as the bodies of soldiers fighting to protect the city from Russians pile up at the side of the road with civilians who did not make it out.

Instead makeshift crosses are seen scattered around the ruined remains of people’s homes, or near where families were once hiding from the fighting. Others who are found have been buried with dozens of others in huge makeshift grave sites, with the UN reporting one which is believed to hold 200 corpses. Earlier this month authorities ordered workers to dig 25 metre long trenches as morgues were already at breaking point. In tragic scenes they were seen making the sign of the cross as the dead- wrapped in old carpet- are pushed into the makeshift mass graves. Among those killed in Mariupol were those caught in a devastating airstrike on a children’s hospital , killing at least 17 and injuring many more. Mayor Vadym Boichenko “My heart today is full of rage. “Today Russia led by its leader President (Vladimir) Putin carried out an air strike on a peaceful city, firing on a children's hospital,” he said. “They wanted to take away the lives of our children, our women, our doctors.” The number of civilians killed by a Russian air strike on a theatre in Ukraine has reached at least 300. Council officials in the port city of Mariupol city used eyewitness reports after the March 16 bombings to compile the grim toll. Tens of thousands are still trapped inside. Matilda Bogner, head of the UN human rights team, said there is “increasing information on mass graves that are there”. She added: “The extent of civilian casualties and the extent of damage raises serious concerns and suggests strongly there have been violations of international humanitarian law and in particular of indiscriminate attacks.” Olena Stokoz of Ukraine's Red Cross earlier warned: “The whole city remains without electricity, water, food, whatever and people are dying because of dehydration.”",47,3.9255874789249243,5.217088653015021,-1.2915011740900968,29
2022-03-27,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/spy-suspect-held-ukraine-following-26568470,'Spy who took secret photos' is arrested after missile attack on Ukraine city,"A spy suspect was being held yesterday following a cruise missile attack on the west Ukrainian city of Lviv. He was arrested at the scene of one of two target areas hit having filmed missiles heading towards the city. Police found he had even sent pictures of local checkpoints to two Russian mobile telephones before the attack, which injured five people. As many as six cruise missiles were fired on Saturday afternoon at Lviv as US President Joe Biden visited neighbouring Poland. It came amid growing fears the Kremlin is turning the sights of its long-range missiles towards the west of the country as its invasion is faltering and suffering huge losses. The Russian onslaught was a reminder that Moscow is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine despite claims it is re-focusing its offensive on the east. The back-to-back weekend airstrikes, which hit a fuel depot and a military repairs complex, shook the haven for an estimated 200,000 people who have fled their hometowns. The first strike involved two Russian rockets that hit an industrial area in the northeastern outskirts of Lviv. A second rocket attack occurred just outside the city hours later and caused three explosions. It is not known if one of more missiles either failed to reach Lviv or was shot down. Yesterday the UK distanced itself from Biden’s apparent call for Russian regime change when he said in an impassioned speech in Poland that Putin “cannot remain in power”. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the overthrow of Putin is “up to the Russian people” after the US President’s apparently unscripted call caused the White House to row back. A White House official argued that the US president’s point was that the Russian leader “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region”. Mr Zahawi said it is “for the Russian people to decide how they are governed” but suggested they “would certainly do well” to have someone who “is democratic and understands their wishes”. He said: “That’s up to the Russian people and it is only the Russian people that can make that decision, I suspect most of them are pretty fed up with Putin and his cronies and the illegal war.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky renewed his plea for western allies to provide tanks and fighter jets to repel the Russians, as he hailed the courage of his troops defending the besieged city of Mariupol. He said: “If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to hand over dozens of jets and tanks had 1% of their courage.” Yesterday the latest horror toll of children caused by the Russian invasion was revealed as Ukraine said 139 children have died and more than 205 have been injured. The Prosecutor General’s office said 733 educational institutions have been damaged, 74 of them completely destroyed. But Russia has lost a staggering number of troops and military hardware in the invasion.

Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff says that 16,600 Russian soldiers have been killed. Among the warcraft destroyed are 582 tanks, 121 aircraft, and 127 helicopters. But it is feared the losses have triggered a deadly reaction by Russia to take their failure out on the civilians, ruthlessly slaughtering them in constant barrages. There are fears that the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, which has been holding out against Russian forces, could become the next Mariupol. The city, close to the border with Belarus on the road to Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, is surrounded, and trapped residents are suffering a lack of power and drinking water as well as shelling. Just over a month into the invasion, Russia’s attack has slowed into a grinding war of attrition as its military tries to pound cities like Chernihiv into submission. Bombings of hospitals and other non-military sites, such as the Mariupol theatre where Ukrainian officials said a Russian air strike is believed to have killed some 300 people last week, have sparked war crime allegations. Russia, struggling to excuse its huge losses, has claimed the first stage of the operation - reducing Ukraine’s fighting capacity - had “generally been accomplished”. Col-Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said Russian forces could now focus on “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas”. Donbas is the largely Russian-speaking eastern region where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Mariupol is located there, although outside of the two territories controlled by the separatists. Russian troops appear to have stalled their ground offensive aimed at capturing the capital, Kyiv, and are concentrating on gaining ground in Donbas in the country’s south-east. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, appearing by video-link at Qatar’s Doha Forum, slammed the destruction of Mariupol. He said: :”They are destroying our ports. The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.” In Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko says 90% of houses are damaged, 2,600 of them suffering direct hits from Grad howitzers or Buratino artillery strikes - of which 40% cannot be rebuilt. It means almost half of the city needs to be entirely rebuilt from scratch. Russian troops are now consolidating east, trying to move up from the south in areas like Mariupol and south from Kharkiv to encircle Donbas - where the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk are disputed. Experts have said Russian forces are trying to surround thousands of Ukrainian troops trying as President Vladimir Putin tries to capture the region in a desperate bid to make some capital from his disastrous invasion.",47,2.8735941858453273,3.906762245249741,-1.0331680594044137,9
2022-03-26,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/signs-russias-losing-wage-ukraine-26561769,Seven signs Russia is losing will to wage Ukraine war after 'change of target',"In the face of crippling sanctions and heavy losses, Russia appears to have changed its objectives for the war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade their neighbour on February 24 and, it is thought, hoped to swiftly capture capital Kyiv. Volodymyr's Zelensky's government would be removed with a pro-Kremlin puppet government installed within days. However that has not happened. Ukraine resistance has surprised not only Putin but also western intelligence officials who thought the war could be brief. But the stiff resolve of Ukraine, and the support of NATO countries supplying them weapons and aid, has seen Russia suffer heavy casualties, including several generals. Vladimir Putin's hopes for a swift victory such as when his forces annexed Crimea have vanished and instead his army is bogged down in a land war with a well-supplied Ukraine. Efforts to shell cities such as Kyiv and Mariupol into submission have also failed. When Russian troops invaded, in what the Kremlin still calls a 'special military operation', the Kremlin sought to seize Kyiv, overthrow Volodymyr's Zelensky's government and install a puppet leader. Over a month on it seems their targets have changed. Top Russian general Sergey Rudskoy said on Friday the ""first stage"" of Russia's ""special military operation"" has been mostly accomplished and that Russian forces will now concentrate on ""the complete liberation of the Donbas"". Western officials say that Russia continues to experience setback after setback. They believe General Rudskoy's announcement implies that Moscow knows that its ambitious pre-war strategy has failed. ""Russia is recognising that it can't pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously,"" one official said. A Russian whistleblower reportedly claimed a leaked report called the invasion a “total failure” and that there are “ no options for a possible victory "". A so-called analyst in Russia's feared spy agency the FSB reportedly leaked the document which claims spies were kept in the dark over Putin's Ukraine plan. Russian human rights activist and operator of the anti-corruption website Gulagu.net Vladimir Osechkin published the report on Facebook, reported The Times. The report allegedly concluded: "" Russia has no way out. There are no options for a possible victory, only defeat.” Sergey Beseda, head of the Federal Security Branch, Russia's intelligence branch, was arrested along with his deputy, Anatoly Bolyukh, an expert claimed. Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled Russian human rights activist also confirmed the arrests. Mr Osechkin told The Times that while the arrests were made on accusations of embezzlement of funds, he said the “real reason is unreliable, incomplete and partially false information about the political situation in Ukraine”. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russia's national guard and a part of Putin's security council, admitted progress of the invasion had been slower than expected. He said: ""I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like,"" Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guard's website. ""But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us."" Zolotov has been at Putin's side since before the turn of the century and has spent the last 13 years in charge of his personal security. One of Vladimir Putin's brigade commanders was killed by his own troops, it has been reported. A furious Russian soldier drove over Russian Colonel Yuri Medvedev with a military tank on the frontline in protest, it has been claimed. Angered by heavy losses suffered by the unit, he is said to have taken his commander down in front of other horrified soldiers. Western officials confirmed the Russian general was killed ""as a consequence of the scale of losses that had been taken by his brigade"". They added: ""We believe that he was killed by his own troops deliberately. We believe that he was run over by his own troops."" The man who was behind the wheel of the tank “blamed the commander of the group, Col. Yury Medvedev, for the deaths of his friends.” Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev, was killed in a strike near the southern city of Kherson - the seventh general to die in the conflict. He had been commander of Russia's 49th combined army. It is thought that low morale among Russian troops has forced senior officers closer to the front line. A mayor in Slavutych occupied by Russian forces has been released from captivity and the soldiers have agreed to leave after a mass protest by residents. Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site, was taken by Russian forces but stun grenades and overhead fire failed to disperse unarmed protesters on its main square on Saturday. The crowd demanded the release of mayor Yuri Fomichev, who had been taken prisoner by the Russian troops. Attempts by Russian troops to intimidate the growing protest failed and on Saturday afternoon Fomichev was let go by his captors.",7,3.4847885885128367,3.9192415451008604,-0.43445295658802374,24
2022-03-26,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putins-troops-defensive-ukraine-26560763,Vladimir Putin's troops on defensive as Ukraine captures more than 100 tanks,"Ukraine’s counter-attacks has left Russia’s invasion reeling with at least 117 tanks belonging to Vladimir Putin ’s forces captured and reports that more than 500 could have been destroyed. With unconfirmed figures claiming that Ukraine has lost 74 tanks, its gains mean that it would now have more tanks than at the start of the invasion. Russia ’s advance has notably lost momentum in recent days with troops failing to press forward in many areas or topple key cities while at the same time Ukraine soldiers have won back some terrain. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine put Russian tank losses at 561 in a Facebook post on Friday. It also said 115 of Russia's warplanes have so far been destroyed in the conflict which has now entered its fifth week. Ukrainians have fought for every inch of ground and it has led to Russian forces resorting to pummelling cities with shells which is causing a high number of casualties. Forbes' aerospace and defence expert, David Axe, reported the Express, said: ""The Ukrainian army’s main tank, the T-64, no longer is in active use in the Russian army. But the Ukrainians also operate at least two models that the Russians still use too, the T-72 and the T-80. ""The T-80 actually is an evolution of the T-64, itself one of the most sophisticated tanks Soviet industry ever produced. ""The T-72, by contrast, is a simpler, cheaper tank - one suitable to mass-production and easy support in the field. It’s not for no reason that Ukraine generally assigns its T-72s to reserve formations."" Mr Axe added: ""In any event, there aren’t many captured Russian tanks Ukraine can’t use in some capacity. ""The question is how quickly Kyiv’s army can take stock of a vehicle its troops, or civilians, have seized, repair any damage, fuel it up, restock its ammo and assign it to a crew with the right training."" Moscow signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the East as Ukrainian forces went on the offensive to recapture towns outside the capital Kyiv. In an announcement that appeared to indicate more limited goals, the Russian Defence Ministry said a first phase of its operation was mostly complete and it would now focus on the eastern Donbass region, which has pro-Russia separatist enclaves. ""The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which ... makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbass,"" said Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate. Reframing Russia's goals may make it easier for Putin to claim a face-saving victory, military analysts said.",7,3.167276228350994,4.363552864709876,-1.1962766363588817,6

It comes as Ukrainian soldiers push back towards Kherson in a bid to retake the captured city. The Kremlin is suffering crippling losses in the conflict, with many of its top commanders now dead. Morale among the rank and file of Russia's army is also said to be low as Russian forces are pushed back. Putin has finally admitted that 1,351 soldiers have been killed in the invasion, with 3,825 wounded, although the real figure is likely far higher. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine claims that 16,400 Russian soldiers have been killed so far. It also said the Kremlin had lost a huge amount of equipment, including 575 tanks, 1,640 armoured vehicles, 117 planes, 127 helicopters and seven ships. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky echoed the claim that more than 16,000 Russian troops had been killed in the conflict during his night-time address. He said his soldiers had delivered 'powerful blows' to Moscow and called for Putin to negotiate, but warned he would not give up sovereign territory. Meanwhile, NATO also estimates that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the invasion. Ukraine is now said to be on the brink of recapturing Kherson in the country's east - the first major city to fall to the Russians. An adviser to the Ukrainian ministry of defence, Markian Lubkivskyi, predicted troops could take the city back on Saturday. Mr Lubkivskyi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I believe that today the city will be fully under the control of Ukrainian armed forces. ""We have finished in the last two days the operation in the Kyiv region so other armed forces are now focused on the southern part trying to get free Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities."" Facing unexpectedly fierce resistance, the Russian defence ministry said that having accomplished the ""first phase"" of military operations, its forces would concentrate on the Donbas region part-held by Moscow-backed separatist rebels. Western officials said the Russian statement was a recognition its forces were overstretched and may have to ""pause"" operations around Kyiv and other cities while they focus on the east of the country.

2022-03-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-counter-attack-forces-back-26552597,Ukraine counter-attack forces back over-stretched Russian troops near Kyiv,"Ukrainian troops launched a series of counter-attacks which forced back over-stretched and under-supplied Russian troops, just outside the capital of Kyiv. The Ministry of Defence announced the successful manoeuvres in an intelligence update this morning. Kyiv’s troops had managed to not only push back the Russian invaders, but reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 21 miles east of the city that has long been Russia ’s main target. Since the invasion began over a month ago, it was reported that the Kremlin initially thought they could achieve a ‘lightning invasion’ that would see them sweep the city, and Ukrainian capital, in a matter of days. However, instead of deposing Volodymyr Zelensky ’s government, Moscow now finds itself negotiating with it. In the latest intelligence update, posted on Twitter, the MoD highlighted specific Russian failings - a common theme of this invasion. The Russian troops had overextended their supply lines it said, which left it vulnerable. This has reportedly been an issue previously as Russia expected fighting to last days, and was unprepared for the prolonged conflict it now finds itself in. From here, the MoD said it was likely that Ukraine ’s troops would continue to push onwards, including towards the strategically significant Hosomel Airfield - where there was fierce fighting at the beginning of the invasion. The MoD said: ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometres (21 miles) east of Kyiv. ""Ukrainian forces are likely to continue to attempt to push Russian forces back along the north-western axis from Kyiv towards Hostomel Airfield.” However, in the south of the country, Mykolaiv is still under heavy Russian siege and Moscow’s troops continue their efforts to surround the city. The MoD added: ""In the south of Ukraine, Russian forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance."" This all comes as fighting continues into its second month, after the invasion began on February 24. Despite many thinking Kyiv and their troops would fall in days, fierce Ukrainian resistance has prolonged the war. Only last night, Kyiv counter-attacks saw success targeting a landing ship and ammunition depots in the southern city of Berdyansk. This was a part of a reported shift in tactics from Ukraine to target Russian supply chains and leave their frontline troops under-resourced. As fighting continues there have been reports emerging of cracks appearing between Russian president Vladimir Putin and other top Kremlin officials. His once close ally and defence minister Sergei Shoigu has not been seen in public in two weeks. Close allies reportedly told one investigative news outlet Agentstvo that he had heart problems, and the Kremlin said yesterday he simply had a lot on his plate. On top of that, one of Putin’s other allies, Anatoly Chubais, who gave him his first job in the Kremlin, quit his job and fled Russia in opposition to the war.",7,3.3650603494533153,4.763640951845211,-1.3985806023918959,6

The Drama Theatre of Mariupol, where hundreds including children had been sheltering, was hit by the deadly airstrike last Wednesday. It's believed some Ukrainians are still trapped under the rubble of the bombed theatre in Mariupol, in the south-east of the country. The city council of Mariupol confirmed on Friday morning that the death toll is believed to be at least 300. ""The drama theatre was cynically destroyed by the heralds of the 'Russian world',"" a statement said. ""These fascists of the 21st century were not stopped by either the huge inscription 'children', or the statements of the people themselves that there were only peaceful people - women, children, the elderly. ""The occupier knew where he was hitting. He knew what could be consequences and all the same, the bombs fell on the place that became a refuge for hundreds of Mariupol residents. There cannot be and never will be an explanation for this inhuman cruelty."" Serhiy Taruta, a Ukrainian politician, previously confirmed that those under the rubble cannot be evacuated because the rescue services in the city had been decimated by Russian forces. In a Facebook post he wrote: ""No one understands. Services that are supposed to help are demolished, rescue and utility services... are physically destroyed. ""A lot of doctors have been killed. This means that all the survivors of the bombing will either die under the ruins of the theater, or have already died."" Svitlana Zlenko, who fled Mariupol with her son a day before the theatre was bombed, described the city as ""hell"". She described how she was forced to melt snow to get water to cook pasta and they lived in constant fear of Russian air raids. The mum spent some of her last days in the city sheltering in a school, and described the moment a woman was wounded during a bombing, when shrapnel hit her hip. She said: ""She was lying on the first floor of the high school all night and prayed for poison so that she would not feel pain.

Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev, 48, was killed in a strike by the Ukrainian armed forces, they say. He was Commander of the 49th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District. The Russian side has not so far confirmed the death. A service member said Lt. Gen. Yakov Rezantsev told them on the fourth day of their deployment that the war would be over quickly. The soldier said: “Do you know what he told us? ‘It’s no secret to anyone that there are only a few hours until this special operation is over.’ - And now those hours are still going."" As the Kremlin reportedly fumes at the loss of some of its top generals, experts have said there could be a catalogue of reasons why senior Russian officers have fallen. It comes amid reports of unreliable equipment and electronics amongst Russian forces, as well as subordinates being too terrified to make quick decisions. Former US army general and CIA director David Petraeus said Ukraine also has ""good snipers"" which are able to target key individuals when a Russian chain of command breaks down. He said: ""The communications have been jammed. The column gets stopped, and an impatient general goes forward to see what’s going on. ""There’s no initiative, no non-commissioned officer corps, no sense of initiative at junior levels. They wait to be told what to do, and the Ukrainians have very, very good snipers."" An anonymous diplomat also told Foreign Policy that generals were ""struggling on the front line to get their orders through"". Analysts believe Russian commanders are now suffering a higher casualty rate than in any conflict since World War Two. We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures and video on this breaking news story. The first general's death came only four days into the invasion, and in the just over three weeks since, a significant number of Russian military leaders have been killed in battle. Some of the dead Russian commanders were said to have come to the frontline, something they would normally do if there were issues over decision-making, or their seniority was needed to get the troops forward. Western sources said that a lot of generals are being killed because they are being pushed closer to the front line than usual to boost Russian soldiers' morale According to Foreign Policy magazine, Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said: “It’s a bigger problem if you lose commanders of units because then it’s harder to have someone step in and take over."" It comes after Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin are reportedly sending execution squads after their own army with orders to kill any Russians who try to flee. Ukraine security services claim that prisoners of war have told them of the horrific tactic that has reportedly seen Russian guns aimed at their own. The ‘execution squads’ are a revival of Stalin’s World War Two tactics and are another sign of dire morale among Moscow’s troops, The Mail Online reports. There have also been reports of Chechen units being sent in to try and stop Russian deserters. Since the Russian invasion began on February 24, Kyiv has released videos of Russian captives who were saying on camera how they chose to quit rather than keep fighting. Ukraine has sought to take advantage of poor Russian morale throughout the invasion and is waging a propaganda war of its own to promote success stories.",7,4.341268597570758,4.331798017352605,0.009470580218152946,22

Kateryna Diachenko, 11, was inside the residential house in Mariupol, in the south-east of the country, when it was struck by a deadly airstrike, her coach, Anastasia Meshchanenkova, said. The young girl was a rhythmic gymnast, the sport in which Vladimir Putin ’s supposed partner Alina Kabaeva won an Olympic gold medal and countless other honours. “She was supposed to conquer the world, but died buried in rubble,"" Kateryna's coach said. “Can there be any justification of that? Look at this talented girl. She was supposed to give her smiles to the world. “What are children guilty of? I believe that there is a space in hell for everyone who is involved - and as soon as possible.” She added: “I cannot speak, maybe when I come back to my senses.” Kateryna’s mother Marina Diachenko has not spoken about her loss, while reports say her son Artyom, Kateryna’s younger brother, is a talented kickboxer. Kabaeva - who plays a major role training young gymnasts in Russia - has not commented on Kateryna's death even though condolences have come in from around the world. Bulgarian gymnast Iliana Raeva said: “I can’t believe we live in such a cruel world."" The Swiss federation said she was ""one of many victims of a senseless war”. In her only comment on the war, Kabaeva castigated the refusal to allow the Russian team to compete at the Beijing Paralympics. “There has never been a more shameful page in the history of world sports,” she said. A petition has been started to demand she is thrown out of Switzerland where reports suggested she was hiding during the war with children she supposedly shares with Putin. “It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says the incendiary petition.

The Ukrainian government has previously said that it was impossible to tell how many were killed because Mariupol is in chaos and under almost constant bombardment from besieging Russian forces. Russia has denied bombing the theatre. The Kremlin says Russian forces have not targeted civilians after invading Ukraine on Feb. 24. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the rubble and that the theatre basement, where local officials said many people were sheltering at the time of the bombardment, had withstood the attack. Ukraine officials believe more than 2,300 people have died in the Mariupol siege and those remaining are starving and suffering a lack of water. And there is increasing alarm over the fate of those locals who manage to escape the hell of Mariupol. The city council revealed Russian troops are kidnapping civilians, possibly as many as 5,000 so far, and processing them into Russia, confiscating their passports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the siege on Mariupol was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". Professor Mark Galeotti, principal director of Mayak Intelligence, said Mariupol has been ""comprehensively trashed"" by the bombardment, but civilian casualties will continue to rise in coming days. ""In the grand scheme of things the Russians aren't in a position to escalate, but the point is that they've chosen Mariupol as a key target,"" he said. ""Mariupol has become a symbolic site of resistance and one way or another they will make sure that they take it."" He continued: ""For Putin every extra city he can take is an extra bargaining chip."" He said that with the city completely cut off, every Ukrainian troop killed would be one less enemy to fight, as reinforcements are unable to reach Mariupol.",47,5.151919657916136,3.041438447182831,2.110481210733305,9
2022-03-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-desperate-russia-claims-first-26556306,Russian chief says war will focus on east Ukraine in first sign of scaling back,"A Russian army chief has claimed that the first phase of the country's invasion of Ukraine is ""complete"" - but also signalled that the aims of the invasion may be scaling back. Kremlin troops are shifting their focus on completely ""liberating"" eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, it's claimed. The country's defence ministry said on Friday it has ""liberated"" 93 per cent of the territory of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, and 54 per cent of the Donetsk region - the two areas that jointly make up the Donbass. Sergey Rudskoy, head of the main operational department of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, did not rule out storming Ukrainian cities that had been blockaded in a statement on Friday. He added that Russia would react immediately to any attempt to close the airspace over Ukraine - something Kyiv has asked NATO to do, but NATO has resisted. The defence ministry said on Friday that the operation would continue until Russian forces had completed the tasks that had been set, without elaborating. On Friday, the Russian army updated its losses in Ukraine to 1,351 soldiers, while saying that it had evacuated more than 400,000 civilians. Since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, thousands have died in shelling and missile attacks, while millions more have fled the country. Last week, a theatre in Mariupol, where hundreds including children had been sheltering, was hit by a deadly airstrike, killing what is believed to be at least 300 people. Despite the bombardment, the Ministry of Defence said on Friday morning that Ukrainian forces are driving back the Russians from around Kyiv. The latest assessment said the Ukrainians were expected to continue to try to push the Russians away from the capital. ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometres (22 miles) east of Kyiv,"" it said. In the south of the country, it said the Russian advance on the key Black Sea port city of Odesa was being slowed by ""logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance"". Since the invasion began over a month ago, it was reported that the Kremlin initially thought they could achieve a ‘lightning invasion’ that would see them sweep the city, and Ukrainian capital, in a matter of days. However, instead of deposing Volodymyr Zelensky’s government, Moscow now finds itself negotiating with it. In the latest intelligence update, posted on Twitter, the MoD highlighted specific Russian failings - a common theme of this invasion. The Russian troops had overextended their supply lines it said, which left it vulnerable. This has reportedly been an issue previously as Russia expected fighting to last days, and was unprepared for the prolonged conflict it now finds itself in. From here, the MoD said it was likely that Ukraine ’s troops would continue to push onwards, including towards the strategically significant Hosomel Airfield - where there was fierce fighting at the beginning of the invasion. The MoD said: ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometres (21 miles) east of Kyiv. ""Ukrainian forces are likely to continue to attempt to push Russian forces back along the north-western axis from Kyiv towards Hostomel Airfield.” However, in the south of the country, Mykolaiv is still under heavy Russian siege and Moscow’s troops continue their efforts to surround the city. The MoD added: ""In the south of Ukraine, Russian forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west towards Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance."" Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24 in what it called a ""special operation"" to weaken its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance to the invasion and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces. Only last night, Kyiv counter-attacks saw success targeting a landing ship and ammunition depots in the southern city of Berdyansk. This was a part of a reported shift in tactics from Ukraine to target Russian supply chains and leave their frontline troops under-resourced. Speaking in Russia on Friday, Vladimir Putin said the West has already cancelled JK Rowling and is trying to cancel Russia. The Russian president cited the Harry Potter author as an example of what happens in the West, adding that it likes to cancel people and compared that with cancelling Russia. Putin said Ms Rowling was cancelled ""just because she didn’t satisfy the demands of gender rights"". He said: ""They are now trying to cancel our country. I'm talking about the progressive discrimination of everything to do with Russia."" On Friday, the Russian army confirmed 1,351 soldiers had died in conflict in Ukraine, while 3,825 soldiers had been wounded. A senior defence ministry official, Mikhail Mizintsev, said more than 400,000 civilians had been evacuated to Russia from the separatist eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions, as well as the rest of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that Ukraine had lost 14,000 troops while 16,000 were wounded.",7,3.3726654351861147,4.027731494741396,-0.6550660595552809,6

Vlad, 22, and his brother-in-arms Mark, also 22, are two of the troops stationed in Kharkiv in the north of the country. As Ukraine's second city, and a settlement which lies close to the Russian border, Kharkiv was always likely to be firmly in the sights of the Russian forces. The night before columns of tanks and artillery batteries rolled over the Ukrainian border Vlad and Mark were at a fellow soldiers wedding. When they heard the news that the war had began - something which shocked them despite the weeks of build-up - they were rushed straight to the front lines in Kharkiv.

Since the war began a month ago today there has rarely been a break from the near constant bombardment of Russian artillery, the BBC reports. Much of the city has been completely flattened in the shelling and once pretty suburbs have been reduced to muddy fields. Half the city's 1.4million person population has fled since the Russians arrived, and now bodies lay uncollected on the battlefront. According to Vlad and Mark the invading forces did not appear prepared for a long winter war. They have found the bodies of Russian soldiers wearing light clothing in possession of surprisingly small amounts of rations. So far only one group of Russian soldiers have managed to breach the city, it has been reported, only for the Ukrainian forces to repel them after a long, bloody skirmish. Vlad, a professional soldier, has urged his opponents to leave Ukraine and return to their homes. ""Run. Run away. Either you stay here in the ground or you go back home,"" he told the BBC. ""Don't kill kids, destroy homes and families."" Mark added: ""Go back home while you are still alive."" Earlier this week Ukraine's minister for internal affairs, Denys Monastyrsky, said that Russians were doing just that. On Tuesday, Ukraine's armed forces claimed that 300 Russian troops ""refused to comply with orders to carry out combat"" and left an area of intense fighting in the Sumy region. The Centre for Defence Strategies, a leading Ukrainian think-tank said: ""Russian forces are aware of the hopelessness of their situation and increasingly choosing desertion to avoid death."" Mr Monastyrsky said that Russian soldiers were defecting with military equipment and tanks, after realising they were being used as ""cannon fodder"".",7,4.606102784649551,3.6308768257503474,0.9752259588992032,10

Before Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, while Vladimir Putin ’s troops gathered on the border, Kharkiv was seen as one of the cities most at threat and it has withstood horrific bombings and slaughter. The resistance of the city has typified the response from Ukrainians since Russia’s invasion on February 24 and residents have refused to surrender. Nina was photographed with her face covered in cuts and scarring from an attack with a tweet saying that she wanted people around the world to know what was happening in the city. The tweet, shared by President of the Liberal Democratic League of Ukraine, Arthur Kharytonov, read: ""This is Nina. She is a professional pharmacist from Kharkiv. ""Before the Russian bombing attack she served in the '9.11' drugstore. Nina agreed to show the face after the meeting with simple Russians. ""To make the world know the truth. She will need a very long treatment."" Russia calls the war a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from ""Nazis"". Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said hundreds of buildings, many residential, had been destroyed. ""It is impossible to say that the worst days are behind us, we are constantly being bombed,"" he said. A witness in the city said she saw people on the roofs of apartment buildings dropping grenades or similar ordnance onto the streets as the resistance continues. A second witness, outside the city, reported hearing more intense explosions than on any day since Russian troops began attacking last month. Putin says his ""special operation"" is aimed at destroying Ukraine's military capabilities and capturing what Russia regards as dangerous nationalists there. The invasion has killed thousands and driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes. Russian bombs have hit residential areas, schools and hospitals in Kharkiv and other cities. ""Putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said as London unveiled restrictions on Gazprombank and Alfa Bank.

In the days after the Russians first invaded the country a column of armoured vehicles and troops moved from the northern border down towards the capital, in an attempt to encircle it. On the way they began bombarding the town of Makariv, which sits about 50kilometres (31miles) west of Kyiv. As with much of the invading forces' actions, the attack was broad reaching and brutal, with one shell attack killing 13 people at a bakery, according to Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian resistance remained strong however, responding with fierce attacks of their own and even derision over tactical radio channels. The New York Times investigators partnered with ham radio enthusiasts to intercept some of the radio chatter between the Russian forces. In one instance a Russian military member asked for clarification over the radio, urging the recipient to ""respond more clearly"". All that came in response was a jaunty whistled tune, the apparent work of a radio jammer hopping onto the channel. Another told the Russian, whose codename is Buran, to get out of the country. ""Buran, go home,"" they said. ""It's better to be a deserter than fertiliser."" In the month since the Russians invaded amateur radio enthusiasts have been picking up messages sent on unsecured channels. Military experts have suggested that the invading forces' inability to properly encrypt their signals suggests a lack of organisation on their part. As well as providing a medium for mockery, in keeping their radio channels open the Russians have given away important pieces of strategic information. “Decision has been made to withdraw all Russian units from the residential area, artillery will target the area,"" one soldier warned during the invasion of Makariv, The Times reports. In Luhansk Oblast at the beginning of the war a Ukrainian soldier on the front lines intercepted one message saying: ""Our fighter planes start bombing in ten minutes. You understood me?"" In Makariv, the loosely guarded nature of the Russian radio channels didn't appear to have too much of a negative impact on their invasion efforts as the town soon fell. However, this week the Russian forces were driven out of the town and many of the outlying areas, away from the main route into Kyiv. Their failure to take Makariv is a telling blow to the Kremlin’s plan to encircle and capture the Ukrainian capital and enforce regime change.",7,3.769606610902264,4.034523076452767,-0.26491646555050297,23

Since then, thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed, millions of refugees have fled over the border and once-thriving cities have been razed to the ground by indiscriminate shelling. However, if it was a quick win Vladimir Putin wanted - and it's widely believed the Russian president did not expect the Ukrainian forces to put up such a formidable fight - then the tyrant will have been bitterly disappointed.

Russian forces have failed to make quick inroads into Ukraine following the start of the “special military operation” on February 24 and appear to have stalled in their bid to overthrow the government in Kyiv. While Putin has heavily censored Russian media there has been discontent at the invasion of a country which to many is seen as being like a brother, while now heavy casualties by the Russian army, reported to be as high as 15,000, is making it more unpopular. A month has now gone by since the launch of the invasion and there is even evidence in some areas of Ukraine that the Russians are being pushed back. And a Federal Security Service [FSB] source has told Vladimir Osechkin, a dissident Russian who is wanted by authorities for exposing abuse in prisons, that anger is building towards Putin. Putin’s own frustration at the slowness of progress in Ukraine has seen him look to blame FSB officers and Osechkin’s source said that this has gone down very badly. Osechkin told The Times that high-ranking officers are also angry at the sanctions that have impacted on their ability to spend their wealth in the West. Putin, a former KGB agent, knows the FSB well having been its director from 1998 to 1999. ""For 20 years Putin created stability in Russia. FSB officers, policemen, state prosecutors, those people inside the system, were able to live good lives,"" Osechkin told The Times. ""For every week and every month that this war continues, the possibility of a rebellion by those in the security services increases."" Osechkin’s source is believed to be in an analytics department of the secret service. With tempers simmering, Putin is believed to be wary of his close ally and friend, defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who is in overall charge of the stalling military operation. Long-time ally FSB security service head Alexander Bortnikov, rumoured to be a stand-in should Putin fall in a coup, is also under pressure, as is Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff. Another target of Putin's fury is Igor Kostyukov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed forces, who may face imminent removal. Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov said military counterintelligence is probing an FSB security service department. He told the New Yorker: ""That could mean that, finally, people in Moscow started asking themselves why the US intelligence was so accurate. ""Military counterintelligence is mostly about mole-hunting, identifying the sources of leaks. So it looks like now Putin is getting angry, not only with bad intelligence and the bad performance in Ukraine but also about the sourcing of the US intelligence about the invasion, and why US intelligence was so good before the invasion, and why the Americans knew so many things about what was coming."" The climate of fear means that intelligence on the scale of Ukraine's likely resistance to Russian invaders was hidden from Putin. But Soldatov does not expect a move by his inner circle to assassinate Putin, despite the increasing hostile treatment they face. ""I think now Putin is almost in no danger,"" he told ZDF Heute in Germany. He has two security services, who are primarily responsible for ensuring that nothing happens to Putin personally. ""We know that he himself is a former intelligence officer, who understands the different risks. He often claims that he successfully survived from 12 to 13 assassination attempts on his life. In this sense, everything is safe for him.""",20,7.166308189649338,6.566907951683163,0.5994002379661749,24

Earlier this week the Kremlin admitted around 10,000 of its armed forces have so far been killed in the war. The MoD’s latest update agrees in grim reading for tyrant Vladimir Putin who is set to replace his soldiers killed on the frontline with people with little or no experience in warfare. The MoD said: “Russian forces have almost certainly suffered thousands of casualties during their invasion of Ukraine. “ Russia is likely now looking to mobilise its reservist and conscript manpower, as well as private military companies and foreign mercenaries, to replace these considerable losses. “It is unclear how these groups will integrate into the Russian ground forces in Ukraine and the impact this will have on combat effectiveness.” The update comes a month after Russia launched its brutal and cruel invasion of its neighbour. Putin's invasion has faced fierce resistance, with Russian officials reportedly recording the deaths of 10,000 Kremlin troops in Ukraine. The shocking figure was published by a pro-Kremlin newspaper, citing Russian defence ministry officials. However, the statistic was quickly taken down from the website. World leaders including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US Joe Biden are set to take part in an emergency Nato summit today in Brussels to discuss the latest on the invasion. The PM will use the visit to set out details of a new support package for Ukrainian forces, including 6,000 anti-tank and high explosive missiles.

He said: ""We will see who is a friend, who is a partner and who has sold out and betrayed us. “Together we should not allow Russia to break anyone in Nato, the EU or G7, to break them and drag them to the side of war. “We ask that the alliance declare that it will fully assist Ukraine to win this war, clear our territory of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine.” He also called for people to take to the streets in demonstrations against the war worldwide. He added: ""Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities. “Come in the name of peace. Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life. ""Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard. Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters.

The mayor said: ""The city cemetery cannot handle all the dead, so we are keeping people in morgues and refrigerators longer than normal. “We are burying people in the old cemeteries that haven't been used in a while.” On top of that he shows the burning buildings and ruin and debris that was once his city. He was driving on Shevchenka street, located in the east of the city, as he shows ruined billboards and homes with their roofs blown off or walls caved in. He added: ""There was a direct strike here. There is a tractor over there burning. We are located right now in the zone of combat."" ""Look at these neighbourhoods. They are completely destroyed. You can clearly see that complete carnage has been unleashed here.” The continued bombings of Ukrainian cities is seen by many as a change in tactics after the invasion failed to take the country’s urban centres. Instead of conquering them, Moscow seems intent some have argued on following a Grozny-style bombings that infamously levelled the Chenynan capital. The Kremlin only turned to this after its failure to achieve a ‘lightning invasion’ where it reportedly sought to take Ukraine and Kyiv in a few days. However, instead of deposing the government, Russia now finds itself negotiating with it. On CNN the analyst said that Russia resorted to this “mediaeval siege method of just pounding towns” because after suffering such heavy losses its army is struggling to operate. This came after NATO estimated as many as 15,000 Russian troops were already dead, but others have argued as many as 30-40,000 could be dead, injured, or missing in action. That is a significant chunk of the estimated 150,000 Russian troops who were initially stationed on the border. It is also more dead in one month than Russia suffered in over a decade of fighting in Afghanistan. As Russia’s invasion stutters and struggles, one of its architects, Sergei Shoigu, has not been seen in public in nearly two weeks. Sources close to him told investigative news outlet Agentstvo he was having “heart problems” previously. But today the Kremlin said that the top Kremlin official and once close ally of Putin simply had ‘a lot on his plate’ and was too busy to do media. In the first few weeks of the invasion, Shoigu did a number of media appearances, speaking frequently.",47,3.714197937232241,3.972700021977903,-0.25850208474566205,18

Other aspects are far harder to get a clear grip on - Is Russia changing tactics, being beaten back or both? These questions are made harder by the relentless information war being waged on both sides - conflicting narratives designed to aid their own causes. While the Russian advance has no doubt slowed, what this means for the huge military's next steps and the innocent people it is invading remain largely unclear. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned that Vladimir Putin may be intending to use peace talks pushed for by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky as an opportunity to regroup his forces. She said she was ""very sceptical"" about the Kremlin's position, telling the Times: “If a country is serious about negotiations, it doesn’t indiscriminately bomb civilians that day.” She said the talks could be a ""smokescreen"" warning that “what we’ve seen is an attempt to create space for the Russians to regroup”. Reports claim the Russian military’s strategy has changed, no longer focused on taking certain cities with troops on the ground but instead dropping back and raining artillery shells down on the civilians. Heavy bombardments of densely populated areas is now a primary tactic, similar to those used in Russia’s wars in Chechnya and Syria. In a tweet, the UK Ministry of Defence said that Russia has ""been forced to change its operational approach and is now pursuing a strategy of attrition"", and turning to ""indiscriminate firepower"" as a tactic. Statements about any kind of Russian pullback being intentional has been heavily disputed by Ukraine, however. Ukraine insists Moscow has lost its ‘offensive potential’ after its own armed forces pushed Russia out of Makariv, a tactically significant suburb of Kyiv 37 miles to the west of the capital, “thanks to the heroic actions of our defenders”. UK intelligence appears to corroborate this, with the latest report saying Russian forces remain “largely stalled in place”. Meanwhile, in the south of the country, Russian forces are still unable to take the port city of Mariupol despite Ukrainian fighters and citizens being under heavy siege and surrounded on all sides. On Tuesday March 22, the Ministry of Defence tweeted: “Despite heavy fighting, Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy the southern city of Mariupol. “Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine have endured yet another day of limited progress with most forces largely stalled in place. “Several Ukrainian cities continue to suffer heavy Russian air and artillery bombardment with the UN reporting that more than 10 million Ukrainians are now internally displaced as a result of Russia’s invasion.” On March 22, Ukraine claimed Russian forces had just three days of supplies left after supply chain breakdowns - a claim hard to verify given that Ukraine too is thought to be running low military equipment, with its own supply line reliant on allies. Western sources have said that the supply chain claims are ‘plausible’, but hard to nail down as fact. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist with the Rusi thinktank, told the Guardian : “Resupply issues are hard to gauge, as both sides are keeping that information close to their chest due to operational security concerns.”",7,2.7994453103033408,4.204873198832957,-1.4054278885296165,23

In a city savaged by Vladimir Putin ’s war machine, Mr Romanchenko's funeral was held on Thursday, with family members including his son and daughter paying their final respects. In emotional pictures taken at the service, heartbroken relatives were seen crying while leaning on Mr Romanchenko’s casket and cross. Mr Romanchenko had campaigned tirelessly for a better world in his city Kharkiv after surviving inside the notorious death camps of Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, Peenemünde, and Mittelbau-Dora during the Second World War. He was widely respected and his heroic concentration camp survival story was known across Europe and America. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said of Mr Romanchenko’s death on Monday: ""Please think about how many things he has come through. ""But he was killed by a Russian strike which hit an ordinary Kharkiv multi-storey building. With each day of this war, it becomes more obvious what denazification means to them."" The memorial for the Buchenwald said in a statement: ""The horrific death of Boris Romanchenko shows how threatening the war in Ukraine is for the concentration camp survivors. ""We mourn the loss of a close friend.""

Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev has been dubbed the ""butcher of Mariupol"" as he's the suspected mastermind behind the relentless bombing of the city. Mariupol was home to 400,000 people before the war broke out on February 24 and now up to 90 per cent of the city has been destroyed or damaged, according to Ukrainian authorities. Col Mizintsev is officially known as the director of the Russian National Centre for Defence Management and has been accused of being behind the bombing of maternity hospital as well as the shelling of an art school that was being used as a bomb shelter for residents. Sergey Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa military administration, accused the bloodthirsty colonel of ordering several devastating strikes in Mariupol, which has led to hundreds of civilian deaths. Bratchuk wrote: ""He ordered the bombing of a maternity hospital, children's hospital, drama theatre, and civilian homes. All who lay down their arms are guaranteed safe passage out of Mariupol."" The Ukrainian government has claimed that attempts to establish humanitarian corridors out of the city have been disrupted by attacks from Russia's military.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Olexander Scherba, Ukraine's former Ambassador to Austria, branded Col Mizintsev the ""Butcher of Mariupol"" as he shared an intercepted audio clip between himself and a junior officer. In a translation tweeted out by Scherba, it should Col Mizintsev calling a soldier who was not wearing his uniform the ""scum of the highest order"". He is recorded saying: ""Why is his face not mutilated yet? Why hasn't anyone cut off his ears? Why isn't this moron limping yet? ""At night, when he walks out, unknown assailants jump him. Just jump him over and over, beating him in the face with a bottle and then pouring another litre into it."" Col Mizintsev is said to have orchestrated Russia's involvement in the Syrian Civil War between 2015 and 2016. Russian forces carried out a series of airstrikes, including the sieging of Aleppo, which left 1,640 civilians dead. It is likely the high-ranking officer played a key role in the shelling of Aleppo. It was widely reported at the time that Russian troops used cluster munitions and barrel bombs in built-up urban areas in Syria to inflict maximum casualties on civilians. Government forces also reportedly dropped chlorine in Aleppo in a series of devastating gas attacks. In April 2018, a chemical attack was carried out in the Syrian city of Douma, killing almost 50 people and injuring well over 100. Mariupol is in southeastern Ukraine between the annexed territory of Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region. Mariupol's location as a port city on the Black Sea is also important to the Ukrainian economy as an industrial powerhouse.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It comes as Russian state TV has issued a chilling nuclear threat to the west if NATO puts peacekeepers into Ukraine, saying World War Three might be around the corner. Moscow's tightly-controlled state TV went into propaganda overdrive, warning alliance leaders meeting in Brussels today against deploying any troops into Ukraine, even if they were there to maintain peace. These chilling threats come four weeks into Russia's invasion, as Putin's forces continue to bombard countless Ukrainian cities with air raids, but Kyiv's resistance holds fast. Moscow continues to cover up the extent of its losses in the war, as it has not updated its official death toll in weeks. The ratcheting up of rhetoric saw blunt, undisguised warnings from the Kremlin's mouthpieces on state TV, worrying that Poland would seek a NATO mandate for peacekeepers. They also went on to claim Poland would seek a land grab, to snatch back Ukrainian territory that was once part of Poland, such as the city of Lviv. At the start of the invasion, Russian troops entered Kharkiv, which is about 12 miles south of the border from Russia. People's homes were destroyed by Russian bombs - including that of a Holocaust survivor. In Mariupol, residents have refused to surrender and continue to face shelling, causing a humanitarian crisis as people run out of water and supplies. Mariupol has seen some of the war's most horrifying scenes, including the bombing of an art school housing hundreds of refugees. The word 'children' had been written in Russian on the outside. The advance of Russian troops has been met with not just fierce resistance by Ukrainian soldiers, but the protests and condemnation of Ukrainian cities. According to reports, Putin has threatened the residents of Mariupol with ' military tribunals ' after the rejected surrender. Earlier this month, three people were killed in the Mariupol maternity hospital bombing by Russian forces, including a six-year-old child, as women gave birth in what has been described as the ""ultimate genocide"". Russian forces have been attempting to take over Kyiv and have been slowly advancing towards the centre. On Sunday night, Retroville shopping mall, in the capital's Podilskyi district, was hit. Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said at least eight people had been killed in the strike, the Kyiv Independent reports. The bodies of six people have been laid in front of the destroyed building, according to news agency AFP. It comes as the Russian advance on Kyiv falters, with forces stalling northeast of the city.

The terrifying machine, one of thousands to have rolled into the war-torn nation since the outbreak of war a month ago today, was reduced to rubble in the attack. Drone footage showed the moment the tank was hit causing a massive fireball reaching into the sky in the Ukrainian ambush. Debris was hurled across the road towards nearby agricultural buildings. The wreck is now one of thousands of charred remains of tanks littering the roads of Ukraine as its forces take the fight to Putin’s invading army. Around 3,000 of the war machines are believed to have been destroyed during the war so far. The human toll has reached 10,000 according to a pro-Kremlin TV show who accidentally published the figure before swiftly taking it down. Nato’s numbers are even higher, estimating between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian deaths during the four weeks of war. A senior official said the number was based on information from Ukrainian authorities, Moscow and intelligence. Around 30,000 - 40,000 Russian soldiers are said to have been injured. Officially Moscow has admitted around 500 of its soldiers have been killed, including several high-ranking generals moved to the frontlines. It comes ahead of an emergency summit meeting in Brussels today in which Boris Johnson is expected to urge western allies to help ""keep the flame of freedom alive"" in Ukraine. The PM pledged the UK will supply thousands more missiles to the military in Kyiv. He will use the visit to set out details of a new support package for Ukrainian forces, including 6,000 more missiles comprising anti-tank and high-explosive weaponry. It takes the number of munitions, including next-generation light anti-tank weapons systems (Nlaws) and Javelin missiles, provided by the UK to the war effort to around 10,000. As well as sending more missiles, the UK is providing £25 million from the Foreign Office's conflict security and stabilisation fund to help pay the salaries of Ukrainian soldiers and pilots. It is also supplying and training Ukrainian troops in the use of Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles as well as providing body armour, helmets and combat boots. The Ministry of Defence ’s latest update reads: “Russian forces have almost certainly suffered thousands of casualties during their invasion of Ukraine. “ Russia is likely now looking to mobilise its reservist and conscript manpower, as well as private military companies and foreign mercenaries, to replace these considerable losses. “It is unclear how these groups will integrate into the Russian ground forces in Ukraine and the impact this will have on combat effectiveness.”",7,4.520377503849944,3.6334710084601767,0.8869064953897672,27

The southern port city has been bombarded for most of the past month and is now surrounded by Russian forces, which are stopping crucial supplies getting in. Dmytro, a businessman who left the city on Tuesday, said that people in Mariupol are now resorting to desperate measures. “You hear the words but it’s impossible to really take them in, to believe this is happening,” he told the FT on claims that people are having to eat dogs. “It is hell on earth.” Since February 24, Mariupol has been transformed from a thriving port city to a vast stretch of ruin, buildings reduces to rubble and the dead left in the street. Two of the worst atrocities of the war so far have taken place there. The Russians shelled a maternity hospital, killing at least four people including a child, and a theatre. More than 1,000 people were trapped underneath the blown up building for days as they were sheltering in it at the time of the bombing. Before International Red Cross workers were evacuated from the city for their safety this week, they reported back on scenes of devastation, desperate hunger and vanishing medical supplies. The Russians ordered that the Ukrainians surrender the city on Sunday, but their demands were refused. Fighting has now broken through defences on the outskirts of Mariupol and is now raging on the city streets. Russian forces are already in control of Livoberezhnyi Raion, or left-bank district, in the east of the city, as well as Mikroraiony 17-23, a string of residential neighbourhoods in the north-east. Its residents are not the only ones who have been left alarmingly low on supplies due to the Russian invasion Food and medical supplies onboard over 100 foreign flagged ships stuck in Ukraine due to are running low, with little progress on creating a maritime corridor to allow them to sail away, industry officials said today. London's marine insurance market has widened the area of waters it considers high risk in the region as the conflict intensifies and perils to merchant shipping grow. The UN's shipping agency said this month it would work to create a safe maritime corridor for merchant ships and crews stuck in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov. Five merchant vessels have been hit by projectiles - with one of them sunk - off Ukraine's coast. Some foreign crew members that were onboard ships have been evacuated out of Ukraine, said Guy Platten, Secretary General with the International Chamber of Shipping industry association. But there are still around 140 foreign flagged vessels with over 1,000 mariners from 20 countries that are unable to leave because of the fighting. ""Seafarers...have become the collateral damage in the conflict,"" he told a virtual news briefing. Platten said one Romanian ship with 20 seafarers had only three days' worth of supplies left due to fighting in the port city of Mariupol. ""It is unsafe for them to leave the ship or for the ship to sail,"" he said, adding that various organisations were trying to resupply the ships with essentials. Platten said at least two seafarers had been killed due to the fighting although full figures were still being corroborated. Stephen Cotton, General Secretary with the International Transport Workers' Federation union, said there were ""high levels of anxiety"" among foreign crews as supplies dwindle. Cotton said: ""We have to recognise there is competition for food depending on which ports you are in on the coast.

Major Dmitry Toptun, a motorised battalion leader, reportedly died when his armoured vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile in Izyum, near Kharkiv. While paratrooper commander Major Alexey Osokin is also understood to have died in the fighting elsewhere. There are said to be multiple reasons for why so many of the President's senior commanders have been wiped out since the ""special operation"" started this time last month. Ukrainian figures suggest up to 15,300 invading troopers have been killed - with Moscow still having failed to take the capital Kyiv. Toptun and Osokin's apparent deaths come after three Spetsnaz special forces commandos were ""liquidated"" during the battle for Mariupol. Documents found in a captured Tigr tank implied Captain Konstantin Druzhkov, 33, Islam Abduragimov, 19 and Shamil Aselderov, age unknown, were all among those killed. Leaked intelligence showed Putin had been hopeful of completing his invasion within 48 hours, after troops moved across the border in the early hours of February 24 - followed by a relentless campaign of air strikes. The Kremlin's inner circle is blaming such leaks to Britain and the US - subsequently passed to Ukraine - for their poor progress and has launched a purge to find those guilty of undercutting them. Putin is said to be ""incandescent"" and believes such betrayal has, at least in part, allowed the movements of his top generals and elite forces to be so easily tracked. The President - a former Soviet KGB intelligence officer prior to his rise to power - is also reported to be growing wary of defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who is in overall charge of the invasion. Sources are also reported to have said Putin has been dismissive in private of long-time ally Alexander Bortnikov, FSB security service head. Putin has also reportedly started snapping in meetings at Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff - blaming him for heavy losses of military hardware. The Russian leader's fury has also been allegedly targeted at Igor Kostyukov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed forces. Before the invasion even began he humiliated SVR foreign intelligence chief Sergey Naryshkin during a public meeting. There is some suggestion Putin will negotiate a deal which he'll market to the Russian people as a ""surrender"", before launching a ""victory parade"" in May. One source told the Sun: “He is incandescent that US and UK intelligence appear to know the Russian army’s next moves all the time, starting with predicting the invasion before he was ready to acknowledge it."" Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov said military counterintelligence is probing an FSB security service department. He told the New York Post: “So it looks like now Putin is getting angry, not only with bad intelligence and the bad performance in Ukraine but also about the sourcing of the US intelligence about the invasion, and why US intelligence was so good before the invasion, and why the Americans knew so many things about what was coming.” Soldatov also said part of the problem is high-ranking military personnel are so scared to tell Putin the truth, due to fear of being jailed, intelligence on the scale of Ukraine’s likely resistance to Russian invaders was hidden from him. However, he does not believe that the Russian President is in much danger of being assassinated by those in his inner circle. Putin was a former intelligence officer himself and so is well aware of how to manoeuvre risks, and has two separate security services ensuring his personal safety, he said.",7,5.274522748022666,3.5954127326622243,1.679110015360442,24

Victor Andrusiv, an adviser to the minister of internal affairs, said: “He didn’t see the point of war”. A meet up was agreed and the tank commander was taken away after all the other troops in the tank had already fled back to Russia. Mr Andrusiv added: “He could not return home because his commander told him he would shoot him dead and say he died in battle. “Misha told us that he had barely any food left, the command structure was chaotic and almost absent, morale is very low.” Mr Andrusiv made the claims yesterday on social media, as apart of the ongoing communications war between the two sides. He said the defector would be given $10,000, a TV, phone, kitchen and shower to spend the rest of the war with. His remarkable story follows growing claims that Russia’s forces are being hamstrung by desertions, with many of its troops conscripts. Denys Monastyrsky, the minister for internal affairs, said: ""We are seeing cases of surrender when Russian troops voluntarily contact our military and declare that they want to surrender, that they do not take part in active hostilities."" He claimed that many realised they were being used as ""cannon fodder"" by their commanders. The Centre for Defence Strategies, a leading Ukraine think-tank echoed this, saying: ”Russian forces are aware of the hopelessness of their situation and increasingly choosing desertion to avoid death”. Ukraine also claimed that two days ago they saw a sharp rise in defections in the southern Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence ’s intelligence agency said: ""Having seen the real strength of the Ukrainian defenders, the occupiers are no longer interested in easy money and the possibility of looting, which they were promised before the invasion."" Other reports of intercepted messages from demoralised Russian soldiers have revealed them talking about officers who shot themselves in the leg to get home. Both US and UK intelligence reports are believed to have discussed the low morale among Russian troops as their losses mount. One Pentagon report said how soldiers simply parked their vehicles and walked away into the woods. Sources from Belarus have suggested that a number of wounded troops have been taken there for treatment, often arriving in horrific condition having gone several days without food. Alongside that, a military hospital in Moscow is reportedly said to be ‘overflowing’.

The Russian president is said to be “incandescent” as his military plans were leaked to the West, who shared it with his Ukrainian enemies. The failure is seen as one of the main reasons several of his top generals and elite forces have been eliminated during the four weeks of warfare. Putin is said to be growing wary of his close ally and vacation friend Sergei Shoigu, Russia ’s defence minister, who is in overall charge of the stalling military operation. Long-time ally FSB security service head Alexander Bortnikov- spoken as a stand-in should Putin fall in a coup - is also under pressure, as is Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff. Another target of Putin’s fury is Igor Kostyukov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed forces, who may face imminent removal. A source said: ""He is incandescent that US and UK intelligence appear to know the Russian army’s next moves all the time, starting with predicting the invasion before he was ready to acknowledge it."" It comes as the Kremlin admitted more than 10,000 Russian soldiers have so far been killed in Ukraine, with thousands more injured. Morale is so low several are said to be hunting for Ukrainian ammunition to shoot themselves in the leg so they are sent home from the frontlines. Putin is believed to have said to his commanders losing 50,000 would be “nothing compared to the goals that will be achieved after the victory”. Russia’s loss of half a dozen generals is seen as linked to the leaks of his military operation movements. Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov said military counterintelligence is probing an FSB security service department. He told the New Yorker: ""That could mean that, finally, people in Moscow started asking themselves why the US intelligence was so accurate. “Military counterintelligence is mostly about mole-hunting, identifying the sources of leaks. “So it looks like now Putin is getting angry, not only with bad intelligence and the bad performance in Ukraine but also about the sourcing of the US intelligence about the invasion, and why US intelligence was so good before the invasion, and why the Americans knew so many things about what was coming.” The climate of fear means that intelligence on the scale of Ukraine’s likely resistance to Russian invaders was hidden from Putin. But Soldatov does not expect a move by his inner circle to assassinate Putin, despite the increasing hostile treatment they face. “I think now Putin is almost in no danger,” he told ZDF Heute in Germany. “He has two security services, who are primarily responsible for ensuring that nothing happens to Putin personally. “We know that he himself is a former intelligence officer, who understands the different risks. “He often claims that he successfully survived from 12 to 13 assassination attempts on his life. “In this sense, everything is safe for him.”",7,5.019164354872405,5.6151386863891615,-0.5959743315167563,24

Vladimir Putin ’s apparent aims of a quick toppling of the Ukraine government with a “special military operation” on February 24 have not gone to plan due to stubborn resistance from their neighbours. So far no major city has fallen to the Russian army and due to the slowness of the invasion Putin’s forces have taken to heavy shelling which is in turn causing a heavy loss of life. Thousands of Ukrainians have died but the Russians have also suffered heavy losses against an opponent who is heavily motivated to defend its homeland. Officially the Kremlin had claimed that there had been 498 Russian deaths on March 2 but now it appears to be as high as 9,861, with a further 16,153 injured. The figures were published by the pro-Putin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda last Sunday citing Russian defence ministry officials. But then the statistics were quickly removed from the article. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that it would not be possible to negotiate an end to the war in his country without meeting Putin. Zelensky told European public television networks such a meeting could discuss the future of occupied Ukrainian territory, but more time would be required to resolve the issue. He also repeated his acknowledgement made earlier this month that Ukraine could not now secure NATO membership. ""I believe that until such time as we have a meeting with the president of the Russian Federation...you cannot truly understand what they are prepared to do in order to stop the war and what they are prepared to do if we are not ready for this or that compromise,"" Zelensky said. Zelensky has sought a meeting with Putin for nearly a year, but the Russian leader has refused and instead demanded the Ukrainian president resolve his country's ""civil war"" with separatist territories linked to Moscow. Since Russian troops poured into Ukraine last month, Zelensky has issued increasingly urgent calls for talks to end the fighting. Last week he called for a meeting quickly so that Russia could ""limit the losses caused by its mistakes"". Russia's assault on Ukraine has forced a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes as well as killing thousands. Germany predicted the refugee number could reach as high as 10 million in coming weeks. ""I am ready at a meeting with the president of Russia to raise the issue of occupied territories, but I am certain that a solution will not come at this meeting,"" Zelensky. He said several conditions would need to be met before such matters could be dealt with, namely, a ceasefire, the withdrawal of troops and security guarantees. ""If people are trying to stop a war, there is a ceasefire and troops are withdrawn. The presidents meet, reach an agreement on withdrawing troops and there are security guarantees of one sort or another,"" he said. ""Compromises must be found, one way or another of guaranteeing our security."" Zelensky said Ukraine is well aware it cannot be admitted into NATO now. NATO member states, Zelensky said, ""understand that they do not want to fight with Russia and therefore cannot take us in...we have to reconcile ourselves to that and say 'ok, other guarantees'.""",7,3.771696356003155,3.819819560645678,-0.04812320464252329,6

The Institute for the Study of War, a US think tank, says Russian troops are strengthening their positions around the periphery of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and in other parts of the country. Nearly a month after the invading army first crossed the border, the lightning advance which Vladimir Putin anticipated has failed to materialise. Now latest satellite footage shows troops digging trenches and fortifications around military equipment northwest of Kyiv. With a stalemate unfolding in key battlegrounds, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky today asked the Pope to intervene in the conflict. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In a call with Pope Francis, he asked if the Catholic Church could play a “mediating role”. The president said he discussed the “difficult humanitarian situation and the blocking of rescue corridors by Russian troops.” So far the Kremlin has not responded to the Vatican’s numerous offers to help set up negotiations. President Zelensky also addressed the Italian parliament and referred to his lengthy conversation with the Pope. Meanwhile Ukrainian officials said Moscow has lost its “offensive potential” and is being forced to call in reinforcements from the “depths” of Russia as it retreats in key battles. It said some troops are deserting, forcing generals to take drastic decisions. The Ukraine armed forces said Russian troops had been “repelled” from Makariv, a strategically important Kyiv suburb, and the Ukrainian flag was raised over the town “thanks to the heroic actions of our defenders”. The recapture of Makariv, about 37 miles west of Kyiv, could prevent Russian forces from encircling the capital from the northwest. It comes as a senior Ukrainian general has claimed that the Kremlin is preparing its population for a “long war” and implementing draconian mobilisation measures, including deploying members of the youth military organisation, who are aged between 17 and 18. Officials claim 15,000 Russian soldiers have died so far, although these figures cannot be verified. Saboteurs sent into Ukraine at the beginning of the conflict continue to be caught. They include a man disguised as a monk who was detained in Kyiv, First Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin revealed last night. “The enemy is using various cover-ups,” he revealed. “A saboteur dressed in monastic clothes has been detained in Kyiv. Instructions, photos of checkpoints, military facilities and calls to Russia have been found on his phone.” In Britain, the Ministry of Defence said Russian forces have “endured yet another day of limited progress, with most forces largely stalled in place”. The Ukrainian military also claims the invading army only has stockpiles of ammunition and food to last for “no more than three days”. And a senior US defence official said a lack of correct equipment has led to some soldiers suffering from frostbite. It says the operation to take over Ukraine is being mobilised “chaotically”, leading to increasingly desperate tactics seen in the southern cities and around the capital Kyiv. US President Joe Biden warned that Putin might resort to biological and chemical weapons as his “back is against the wall”. He believes the Russian leadership is prepared to carry out so-called “false flag” operations to justify its propaganda, including that America actually has chemical weapons ready to be launched in Europe. “They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine,” he went on. “That’s a clear sign he’s considering using both of those. He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what’s about to come.” Putin “knows there’ll be severe consequences because of the united Nato front,” he added, without specifying what actions the alliance would take. President Biden also confirmed that Russia has used hypersonic missiles against key targets in Ukraine. Kyiv’s deputy head of police has accused Russian forces of using white phosphorus in the city of Kramatorsk, in the northern part of Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared a clip of a substance releasing white smoke into the air as it burned on the ground. Mr Biloshytskiy wrote: “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk.” White phosphorus is a toxic substance that is self-igniting when it interacts with oxygen. In a signal of how willing Russia is to target its firepower on civilians, Ukraine’s Health Minister Viktor Lyashko said ten hospitals have now been completely destroyed since Russia invaded Ukraine. He said others could not be restocked with medicines and supplies. Despite significant Ukrainian resistance, the mayor of Boryspil city near Kyiv has told residents to “leave town ASAP” as fighting against Russian forces draws closer.",7,3.1411264522160605,3.5675919827081537,-0.42646553049209324,23

A voice can be heard on the footage saying: “It is not very clearly visible - but eight sanitary buses are moving…” The ghostly footage is from Gomel (Homel) in Belarus, close to the border with Ukraine where war is raging. It is assumed that the human “cargo” inside those buses is from battles with the Ukrainian army in the Chernihiv region. “I can see them bringing in a stretcher; I guess there are both wounded, and Cargo-200 (the Russia war-speak for those killed in battle),” said the author. However, other sources dispute that these buses with blotted windows and displaying the V-insignia are makeshift ambulances. These sources believe them to be macabre hearses packed with coffins en-route to devastated bereaved families in Russia. Gomel’s hospitals are already filled with Russian wounded from the war. Referring to young soldiers deployed by Vladimir Putin the video commentator says: ""The wounded are ‘children’, young men born in 2003. “They are all last autumn's conscripts, and they get delivered here without eyes, ears, with their intestines twisted."" Some buses in Gomel have brought the wounded and maimed - rather than the dead from Putin’s war. “They had to be hose-washed from blood,” according to one account. “Most of these young men are incredibly hungry, saying they haven’t eaten properly for a week. “Whoever could walk was sent to buy extra instant noodles for the wounded. “The hospital staff is shocked.” It comes as Kyiv generals claimed Russian soldiers only have enough supplies for ""three more days"" of fighting in Ukraine as attacks on Mariupol fail and offensives are stalled elsewhere. Vladimir Putin 's troops could run out of ammunition, food and fuel in a matter of days because of an inability to form a fuel pipeline, claimed the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Forces have been ""largely stalled"" elsewhere in Ukraine, including Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv. The assessment is in line with other Western allies' opinion that Russian supplies will run out this week and they will be forced to go on the defensive as they wait for more to arrive. This ""operational pause"" will give Ukraine forces a chance to counter-attack. This is something Ukrainian forces have already achieved in Makariv on the outskirts of Kyiv, capturing a key highway and blocking Russian soldiers from surrounding it to the northwest. Yet this setback doesn't mean a ceasefire is imminent. Judging on events up until this point, Russia could get more brutal the longer the war drags on. It comes as the Russian advance on Kyiv falters, with forces stalling northeast of the city. The Kremlin attack from the direction of Hostomel - to the northwest - has been pushed back.

Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs shared the damning update in a Facebook post, which accused the ""aggressor state"" of Russia of kidnapping children. The post read: “According to the information received, on March 19, Russian occupation forces illegally took 2389 children to the territory of the Russian Federation, who were in the temporarily occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. “Forced relocation of civilian population to the territory of the aggressor state, in particular children, has signs of kidnapping. ""Such actions are a gross violation of international law, in particular international humanitarian law.” The MFA carried on to say that by “destroying homes and killing parents”, Russia deprives Ukrainian children of parental care and puts their lives in further danger. An urgent response from the international community is needed, the statement said, to stop the barbaric war against the Ukrainian people. It continued: “The facts of kidnapping children, as well as hundreds of other facts of crimes by Russian occupiers against civilians in Ukraine, are carefully documented by law enforcement. “The culprits of these crimes will be brought to justice."" The abduction or illegal removal of children during a period of conflict is one of the six “grave violations” named and condemned by the UN Security Council. These six violations make up the basis of the Council’s framework to monitor, report and respond to abuses suffered by children in times of war. Just last week, the Kremlin was accused of war crimes against children for bombing a Ukrainian theatre in Mariupol, which was housing a number of youngsters. Sheltering Ukrainians painted the word ""children"" outside the theatre in a desperate but futile attempt to deter a Russian attack. The large letters spelling out the Russian script warning came before forces went on to drop a powerful bomb on the theatre that was being used as a shelter for families. The city council said it's ""impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act"" and that efforts were underway to find the identities of the victims - and just how many innocent Ukrainians were slaughtered. They confirmed the central part of the venue was completely destroyed, as was the entrance to an area being used as a bomb shelter. The death toll from the bombing is still unknown, but more than 1,000, including women and babies, are still feared trapped in the bombed ruins of the theatre. It comes as an elite Spetsnaz fighter who used Stalin’s real name as an alias has today been named among three special forces fighters killed in the battle for besieged Mariupol.

Maksym ""Max"" Levin's was last heard from on March 13 when he told a friend he entering a warzone in the capital's Vyshhorod district. Max's friend Markiyan Lyseiko told local media his pal had been carrying a camera through a war-torn village in the hours before his disappearance. On the day he vanished, Max had travelled by car to a village close to Moshchun - which has been the site of intense clashes where Russian troops pummelled residential buildings to the ground with heavy artillery fire. He then travelled by foot to get within the battle zone, just north of besieged Kyiv. His final message was received on March 13 at 11.23am - and he has not been in contact with anyone since, according to Markiyan. Local media has suggested that Max may have either been killed, wounded, or taken prisoner by enemy soldiers. Levin, who is in his early 40s, has worked as a photojournalist and documentary photographer for both Ukrainian and international news outlets, including the BBC, Reuters, and AP. His photos have appeared in the Wall Street Journal and TIME magazine among others. Many of his projects were focused on the crisis in Donbass but he switched to covering the war in Ukraine after Vladimir Putin ordered troops to invade in late February. He has also worked on video and photo packages for human rights organisations like the World Health Organisation and the United Nations. In the past he said one of his dreams was to take a ""photo that will stop the war"".

Mariupol has seen some of the war's most horrifying scenes, including the bombing of an art school housing hundreds of refugees. The word 'children' had been written in Russian on the outside. The city has been heavily bombed by the advancing Russian troops and Vladimir Putin's forces are currently holding the city under siege, causing a humanitarian crisis as people run out of water and supplies. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said of the siege: ""To do this to a peaceful city... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come."" In exchange for a safe humanitarian corridor of people leaving the city, Russia offered terms of a Ukrainian surrender, which was rejected on Monday. The advance of Russian troops has been met with not just fierce resistance by Ukrainian soldiers, but the protests and condemnation of Ukrainian cities. According to reports, Putin has threatened the residents of Mariupol with 'military tribunals' after the rejected surrender. Mariupol is in southeastern Ukraine between the annexed territory of Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donbas region. It is a port city on the Sea of Azov, connected to the Black Sea, and became the capital of the Donetsk Oblast region after Donetsk was captured by separatists. Mariupol itself briefly fell to separatists in 2015. Of its 400,000 population before the war, around 300,000 remain trapped in the city according to Ukrainian sources, though other estimates put this figure at somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000. Despite its strategic importance and innocent population, the heavy bombardment has seen around 80% of the city destroyed as a result of Russian airstrikes. As a war tactic, Russia has proven it is happy to level cities in order to pummel them into submission, sending a warning to other cities that choose to resist. The location of Mariupol makes it strategically important to advancing Russian troops and enables them to set up a 'land bridge' between the occupied regions of Donbas and Crimea. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014. With so much being thrown at Mariupol, it is clear the city is important to Putin's invasion plan and many of the approximately 6,000 troops attacking the city would be free to attack elsewhere once they have taken control, further harming Ukrainian defences. Mariupol's location as a port city on the Black Sea is also important to the Ukrainian economy as an industrial powerhouse. Mariupol makes steel, repairs ships and is responsible for the production of heavy machinery, vital to both Ukraine's war effort and its economy. If Russia can control the Black Sea coastline, it will be able to cut off Ukrainian trade. Putin's view - that Ukraine is actually Russian and therefore belongs to the superpower - means that the capture of Mariupol is culturally significant as well.",47,3.9925812525939377,3.5032402832151117,0.489340969378826,29

A UK government minister today warned any use of chemical or biological weapons by Russian forces in Ukraine would ""undoubtedly"" be a war crime. Speaking to Sky News, business minister Paul Scully added: ""This is Vladimir Putin's war, the Kremlin's war against Ukraine. It is not the Russian people's. We have to make sure that we can appeal to the Russian people to bring an end to this."" President Biden’s warning came after days of increasingly nervous briefings that Putin could use chemical weapons from both sides of the Atlantic. He told a business event Putin’s “back was against the wall.” He added: “Now he's talking about new false flags he's setting up including, asserting that we in America have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe, simply not true. “They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That's a clear sign he's considering using both of those."" Biden also told businesses to be alert for cyber attacks by Russia. ""It's part of Russia's playbook,"" he said in a statement. Russia summoned the US Ambassador to Moscow yesterday to complain about Biden saying of Putin: “I think he is a war criminal”. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the latest comments by the US President. It comes as some bury neighbours in roadside graves in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Russian artillery continues to blast the eastern cities of Kharkhiv, Sumy and Chernihiv - while in the capital Kyiv, shells hit a shopping centre on Sunday evening, killing at least eight people.

Russian troops have failed to capture any major Ukrainian city more than four weeks into their invasion. They are increasingly are resorting to massive destruction of residential areas with air strikes, long-range missiles and artillery.

Ukraine ’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk hit out at the 5am deadline given to Mariupol, which has been 90% destroyed by barrages. She said: “There can be no question of any surrender, laying down of arms. “We have already informed the Russian side about this.” In a foul-mouthed blast, mayor adviser Petro Andryushchenko rapped a plan to move the city hall to Russia. On Facebook, he wrote: “They gave us until the morning. Why wait – the answer is ready – f**** you – you won’t get Mariupol.” Soon after yesterday’s deadline, smoke rose from several places in the southeast port amid multiple strikes. In Kyiv, debris was scattered for hundreds of yards and windows were left smashed several blocks away from the blasts overnight on Sunday. Last night, emergency crews tried to find survivors and establish if more people were killed in Russia’s latest barbaric attack. Missiles sparked a mushroom cloud and fires on several storeys of the mall in the Podilsky district. Footage showed a huge blast, followed by smaller explosions that left much of the complex in the rubble. Firefighters pulled out at least one man, covered in dust, after the blasts. Residents of a nearby building, whose windows were blown out, said they had spotted a mobile rocket launcher near the mall several days earlier. Russia said it had struck the shopping centre because it was being used as a rocket store. An apartment block in Kyiv was also hit on Sunday, leaving five people injured. But Ukraine has beaten the bulk of Russian troops back 15 miles out of the city. President Volodymyr Zelensky added Ukraine would never bow to Vladimir Putin ’s ultimatums and key cities would not accept occupation. He added any deal to end the war would need a referendum. Figures released on day 26 of the invasion show Ukraine is battering Russian forces who have lost more than 10% of their troops – 15,000. More than a quarter of Russian warplanes (97) have been shot out of the sky and around half of their helicopters (121) have been downed. More than 40% of Putin’s tanks (498) have also been destroyed. Sources said Russia has lost more than half its armoured personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles. The Ukraine military added: “The enemy continues to insidiously destroy the infrastructure of captured cities, launch missiles and bomb strikes on peaceful neighbourhoods of Ukrainian cities and villages, rob, kidnap and take hostages civilians.” An unnamed US defence official said Ukraine is showing “no signs” of ending its resistance and is repeatedly counter-attacking. The source added Moscow’s forces are shelling Ukraine’s cities in a “near desperate attempt to gain leverage” in talks. Last week, Ukraine said it had lost 1,700 troops and that tally is thought to have risen in recent days. But its strong defence has led to fears Russia is increasingly turning on civilians to force Kyiv into capitulating. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has claimed the Kremlin illegally deported 2,389 children to Russia from the disputed region of Donbas. It urged the global community to increase pressure on Russia to end the war. Many Ukrainian officials have been kidnapped by Russians trying to force a surrender. There have been repeated incidents caught on camera of Russian troops executing and targeting civilians. Captured Russian gunner Valery Vasilyev, 18, told Ukraine’s SBU security agency how he was ordered to shoot civilians in Kharkiv. According to Ukraine, Moscow’s troops have shelled 135 hospitals, nine of which have been destroyed. Yesterday CCTV footage emerged of protestors being shot at in Kherson. Russia has reportedly passed details of more than 500 captured Ukrainians to the Red Cross and is to be prepared to swap them for detained Russians. Some of Ukraine’s orphans have reached a hospital in Kyiv where doctors hope to be able to provide care and perform life-saving surgeries. The governor of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said buses evacuating civilians from frontline areas were hit by shelling yesterday and four children were wounded in separate incidents. Ukrainian officials say 8,057 people escaped through seven humanitarian corridors yesterday. Ukraine said a shell hit a chemical plant outside the eastern city of Sumy just after 3am yesterday, causing a leak in a 50-ton ammonia tank that took hours to contain. And there were reports of state-sponsored Russian looting as five ships with tens of thousands of tons of grain were taken in Berdyansk port.",47,3.3571047122690296,3.6727615500635076,-0.31565683779447795,21

It comes as Ukraine said it would not accept ultimatums from Russia after Moscow demanded it stop defending besieged Mariupol. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are suffering through Russian bombardments laying waste to the port city. Gennadiy Druzenko, 49, told Ukraine-24 channel about Russian military prisoners of war: “I have always been a great humanist and said that if a man is wounded, he is no longer an enemy but a patient. “But now [I gave] very strict orders to castrate all [captured Russian] men, because they are cockroaches, not people.” Since 2014, some 500 doctors - male and female - have worked with Druzenko’s mobile hospital. A lawyer by training, he set up the First Voluntary Mobile Hospital which deploys civilian doctors and nurses in the conflict zone close to the separatist republics in eastern Ukraine. He also told famous Russian TV host Yevgeny Kiselyov on Ukraine-24 channel: “Believe all doctors who saved the patients - Russians will die here. “Die in large numbers. “Those who [come here] will remember their nightmare on Ukrainian soil. “Like the Germans remember Stalingrad.” The Russian Investigative Committee opened a criminal case into the comments, which means that if Druzenko is captured he will face trial under Russian law. The head of the committee Alexander Bastrykin, a former university classmate of Vladimir Putin, initiated a criminal case over his castration demand which is “contrary to the law and the norms of medical ethics”. He said: ""The head of the Ukrainian Mobile Hospital project, Gennady Druzenko, called for violence against captured soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces live on a Ukrainian TV channel. ""He gave this instruction to the doctors of mobile hospitals.” Druzenko is set to be put on Russia ’s international wanted list. Mariupol has become a focal point of Russia's assault on Ukraine, but attacks were also reported to have intensified on the country's second city Kharkiv on Monday. The conflict has driven almost a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes, and Germany predicted the refugee number could reach as high as 10million in coming weeks. Europe said Russia was using refugees as a tool and that it was prepared to take more action on top of existing sanctions to isolate Russia from global finances and trade. Russia's military had ordered residents of Mariupol to surrender by 5am local time on Monday, saying those who did so could leave, while those who stayed would be handed to tribunals run by Moscow-backed separatists. President Volodymyr Zelensky's Government responded that it would never bow to ultimatums and said cities such as the capital Kyiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv would always defy occupation. ""There can be no question of any surrender"" in Mariupol said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. Russia's invasion, now in its fourth week, has largely stalled, failing to capture any major city, but causing massive destruction to residential areas.",47,3.8531430242306173,4.61546616413457,-0.7623231399039523,29

Overnight, Russian bombs destroyed a Kyiv shopping mall, killing at least eight people. Firefighters have been working through the night to rescue Ukrainians trapped underneath the rubble of the complex. Retroville shopping mall, in the capital's Podilskyi district, was hit at just before 10.48pm last night. Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said at least eight people had been killed in the strike, the Kyiv Independent reports. The bodies of six people have been laid in front of the destroyed building, according to news agency AFP.

The city has been ""comprehensively trashed"" by missiles fired by Vladimir Putin's forces, but defiant leaders today said there was ""no question"" they would lay down their arms. Civilian buildings including a theatre where families were hiding have been targeted in recent days, while President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the siege was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". Tens of thousands remain trapped inside Mariupol, a port on the Azov Sea, as Ukrainian troops and volunteers bravely defend their homeland against the advancing invaders. Russia is determined to seize the city and Putin's forces have completely encircled it on both land and sea, stopping vital supplies getting in and out. Professor Mark Galeotti, principal director of Mayak Intelligence, said that Russia would never have expected Ukraine to surrender the city, and the surrender call was little more than posturing. He told The Mirror: ""As much as anything else it was grandstanding so they can say 'look, we're being reasonable' before they unleash the next wave of hell."" Prof Galeotti said Mariupol has been ""comprehensively trashed"" by the bombardment, but civilian casualties will continue to rise in coming days. ""In the grand scheme of things the Russians aren't in a position to escalate, but the point is that they've chosen Mariupol as a key target,"" he said. ""Mariupol has become a symbolic site of resistance and one way or another they will make sure that they take it."" He continued: ""For Putin every extra city he can take is an extra bargaining chip."" He said that with the city completely cut off, every Ukrainian troop killed would be one less enemy to fight, as reinforcements are unable to reach Mariupol. On Friday Russian forces unleashed high-tech hypersonic missiles for the first time in combat - a move Prof Galeotti said could indicate it is running out of conventional weaponry. ""It's like using a Rolls Royce to go and do a weekly shop,"" he said. ""It's a ridiculously expensive missile that they've used for a purpose that it didn't deserve, but they're looking at what else they've got in the cupboard. ""It's an area in which the Russians have a technical advantage, it's possible that they're saying 'don't mess with us.'"" Prof Galeotti said seizing Mariupol would not be a ""war winning"" moment for the Russians, but it would be a heavy blow for Ukraine. ""Now we're getting reports of Russians in Mariupol, it implies that we're approaching the end game."" Mariupol has been bombarded with missiles in the three weeks since the war began, but this now means Russian forces are running out of targets in the city, Dr Deborah Sanders told The Mirror. Even Kremlin supporters believe that taking Mariupol will not be easy, despite the merciless bombing. Dr Sanders, reader in Defence and Security Studies at King's College London, told The Mirror that the refusal to surrender would likely lead to a ""continuation"" of the assault on the city, but not necessarily an increase. She said she believes Russia lacks the firepower to intensify the attack, and Ukraine cannot afford to give up any territory. Dr Sanders said: ""They (Russia) do not have the firepower to necessarily be able to intensify the attack as they are heavily engaged in the other theatres with a continued push on Odesa. ""Taking Kyiv or at least regime change - overthrowing President Zelensky - remains they key priority. ""One problem they are likely to face is what targets to hit, very little remains standing in Mariupol. If President Putin's aim is to coerce the Ukrainians into accepting his peace terms, then he is lacking a ladder of escalation. ""Not only is there a lack of military capacity to intensify shelling, but a continuation of this tactic will make increased sanctions more likely."" Mariupol is of such importance to Ukraine that it ""will never willingly surrender"" it, Dr Sanders said. She stated: ""The Ukrainians need to demonstrate that they can take the pain, that they will continue to fight, this will put them in a much stronger negotiating position. ""In essence, the Ukrainians need to drag this war out as long as possible, as the costs to Russia are immense - both in terms of the military costs, but also in terms of the reputational and economic costs of sanctions. ""The costs to Ukraine, of course, are also immense, but they could be much much worse and Ukraine could end up losing large swathes of its territory in the east, access to the Sea of Azov and its very independence."" A Russian-backed separatist leader in eastern Ukraine said he believed it would take more than a week to take control of the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Denis Pushilin, head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic, told Russia's Interfax news agency: ""I am not so optimistic that two or three days or even a week will close the issue. Unfortunately, no, the city is big."" It comes after a deadline for Ukrainian leaders to surrender the city passed in the early hours of this morning. Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, urged Ukrainian forces in Mariupol: “Lay down your arms. “A terrible humanitarian catastrophe has developed. All who lay down their arms are guaranteed safe passage out of Mariupol.” ""There can be no question of any surrender, laying down of arms,"" the Ukrainska Pravda news portal cited Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk as saying early on Monday. ""We have already informed the Russian side about this."" Mrs Vereshchuk said over 7,000 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Sunday, with more than half escaping from Mariupol.",47,3.492002453877566,4.603940439048558,-1.111937985170992,17

Aliia Roza claims she trained to become a secret agent like James Bond as an 18-year-old at a classified school near Moscow.

Now living in the US under an assumed name, Aliia has watched the war unfolding in Ukraine with horror and says countries should unite to stop Putin. Speaking of her past, she said: “When I was 18, I was sent to a military academy…they showed us how to seduce, manipulate, convince people, how to shoot from different types of guns, how to do martial arts and be a perfect soldier on the field. “You would need to make this person not just be nice to you but also fall in love in order to give the information you want, because this person has to trust you."" She told The Sun : ""In my opinion, European Union and the United States should unite together and close the sky, first of all and second, do an embargo for Russian gas and petrol.""

Officials say up to 5,000 people have been made to leave the city of Mariupol, which has seen intense fighting over the past week, and sent to south-western Russia. The move has provoked chilling parallels with Nazi concentration camps in the 1930s and 1940s, with the Russian invaders accused of following ""the logic of Nazi Germany"". City mayor Vadym Boychenko likened the move to the actions of Hitler's Third Reich, saying it was ""hard to imagine"" it could happen in the 21st century. It is claimed that Russian troops trawled through the phones and documents of residents before telling some they were being deported to Russia. Mr Boychenko said: ""It is known that the captured Mariupol residents were taken to filtration camps, where the occupiers checked people's phones and documents. ""After the inspection, some Mariupol residents were redirected to remote cities in Russia; the fate of others remains unknown. ""What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War Two, when the Nazis forcibly captured people. ""It is hard to imagine that in the 21st century people would be forcibly deported to another country. ""Not only are Russian troops destroying our peaceful Mariupol, they have gone even further and started deporting Mariupol residents."" Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun told Times Radio that Russia was following ""the logic of Nazi Germany"". She said: ""From what we know from the city mayor and the city council, is they are taking Ukrainian citizens. ""They are sending them through what are called the 'filtration camps' and then they are being relocated to very distant parts of Russia, where they are being forced to sign papers (saying) that they will stay in that area for two or three years and they will work for free in those areas."" Ms Sovsun agreed when it was put to her that what she was describing was ""effectively slave labour"". British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has condemned the ""abduction and deportation"" of Ukrainians. She said she was ""appalled"" by the reports and said Putin must be ""held to account"" for his treatment of civilians during the invasion. Mariupol is in the throes of a humanitarian emergency after being encircled by Russian troops, cut off from energy, food and water supplies and facing a relentless bombardment. On Sunday, city authorities said a bomb destroyed an art school where 400 people had taken shelter, with rescuers searching for people possibly trapped under the rubble. Only days before the shelling, there was a separate attack on a theatre in the city where more than 1,000 people were said to have been bunkered.

Olha Stefanishyna spoke out as her President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's siege of the port city of Mariupol was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". Weeks into the Ukraine-Russia war, Russia ’s defence ministry said it had struck Ukraine with cruise missiles from ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, and launched hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace. The city council in Mariupol said Russian forces bombed an art school where about 400 residents had taken shelter. There was no immediate word of casualties, and Reuters could not independently verify the claim. Russia denies targeting civilians. Asked if she believed it was a genocide, Ms Stefanishyna told Sophy Ridge On Sunday on Sky News: ""I absolutely believe it. I am a lawyer myself and I commit myself to implementation of the decision."" Ms Stefanishyna added: “It’s really important that all political leaders around the world… stay united and establish the anti-war coalition. Only this joint effort will allow us to prevent this massive genocide and murdering in the 21st Century”. She said that while Kyiv was still open to talks with the Kremlin, Ukraine would “absolutely not” give up some territory to Russia. She highlighted “horrible stories women have heard about women who have been raped for hours and then murdered”. She referred to the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which has urged Russia to ""immediately suspend the military operations"" it began on February 24 in Ukraine.

She went on: “Ukraine will resist as long as it needed to make sure that no terror, no mass murdering, no genocide is committed on this land in the 21st century. ""But it's absolutely clear that only a Ukrainian army, and only a Ukrainian president, will not be able to withstand it alone.""

Vasylenko also claimed that some Ukrainians were so vulnerable they could not escape, with the MP saying Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""changed his strategy to target the most vulnerable groups of women and children"". The Ukrainian MP's claims come after Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko claimed Putin was ""not healthy"" and a ""danger to the world"". Vasylenko said: ""Most of [the women over 60] were executed after being raped or took their own lives.

The powerful Kalibr missiles are capable of travelling up to five times the speed of sound. The Russian Defence Ministry said the missile was launched from ships in the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea at Ukrainian military infrastructure. Spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: ""Kalibr cruise missiles were launched from the waters of the Black Sea against the Nizhyn plant that repairs Ukrainian armoured vehicles damaged in fighting."" The use of the missiles is the latest sign Vladimir Putin is getting increasingly desperate as his military struggles to carry out his illegal invasion of Ukraine. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The Kalibr weapon is so powerful that NATO has been dubbed 'The Sizzler'. Russian officials have claimed it can travel between 1,500-2,500 kilometres. The spokesman also said further missiles, including the hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, were also launched from Crimea to destroy a fuel storage facility used by Ukraine. The launch of the Kinzhal missiles has not been officially verified yet. While Russia has not previously launched large scale attacks from the sea, its navy has blockaded routes into Ukraine via the Black Sea. At least 100 ships are reportedly stranded in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, prompting calls for Russia to open a blue corridor to allow them out. Ukrainian grain exports via that route have stalled completely, raising the threat of global food shortages. Ukraine's ports on its southern coast have become key strategic targets for the Russian forces, who could use them to target the capital Kyiv from two directions. Yesterday, a clip filmed from a military drone shows people fleeing through the snow after a base in the Ivano-Frankivsk region was struck by a Kinzhal hypersonic missile. Smoke is seen billowing through the air after bright flashes at the moment of impact. Russia's defence military earlier said it had used hypersonic weapons for the first time in combat during Friday's strike. The strike is believed to have been carried out using Kinzhal - or 'Dagger' - missiles, which have been claimed to have a range of around 2,000 km. Their speed and ability to fly low makes them ""invisible"" to most anti-missile defence systems, and they are capable of carrying nuclear warheads, experts have said. This morning President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Russia's incessant bombing of Mariupol.

The news of the 'abduction' comes as Russian forces attacked an art school in the city which was being used as a shelter from constant shelling and left it in ruins People are believed to be trapped under the rubble where it is thought 400 people had taken refuge but there was no details on the number of casualties. The city's council said thousands had been 'forcibly deported' to Russia as they fight to protect their homeland. The Mariupol authority claimed Russia ""illegally took people"" from Livoberezhniy district and from a sports club property which was being used as a bomb shelter. The Kremlin has claimed buses carrying ""refugees"" from Mariupol began to arrive to Russia on Tuesday. Mariupol's mayor Vadym Boychenko compared the situation to Nazis removing civilians in the Second World War. He said: ""It is known that the captured Mariupol residents were taken to filtration camps, where the occupiers checked people's phones and documents. ""After the inspection, some Mariupol residents were redirected to remote cities in Russia; the fate of others remains unknown. ""What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War Two, when the Nazis forcibly captured people."" The mayor said it was difficult to imagine that deportation could happen in the 21st Century in addition to destroying the city Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, said Russia's siege of the port city of Mariupol was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". ""Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents were deported onto the Russian territory,"" the city council said in a statement on its Telegram channel late on Saturday. Russian news organisations have said buses have carried several hundred people Moscow calls refugees from Mariupol to Russia in recent days. Many of Mariupol's 400,000 residents have been trapped for more than two weeks as Russia seeks to take control of the city, which would help secure a land corridor to the Crimea peninsula. President Vladimir Putin calls the assault on Ukraine a ""special operation"" aimed at demilitarising the country and rooting out people he terms dangerous nationalists. Western nations call it an aggressive war of choice and have imposed punishing sanctions on Russia aimed at crippling its economy. The Mariupol bombardment has left buildings in rubble and severed central supplies of electricity, heating and water, according to local authorities. Rescue workers were still searching for survivors in a Mariupol theatre that local authorities say was flattened by Russian air strikes on Wednesday. Russia denies hitting the theatre. Air raid sirens sounded across Ukrainian cities on Sunday and Russia's defence ministry said cruise missiles were launched from ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, as well as hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace. Hypersonic missiles were deployed by Russia for the first time in Ukraine on Saturday, in a strike which Moscow claimed destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command confirmed the attack in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region, but said the Ukrainian side had no information on the type of missiles used. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said seven humanitarian corridors would open on Sunday to enable civilians to leave frontline areas.",47,3.12608282931164,2.4959882788487664,0.6300945504628737,29

General Sir Mike Jackson said the world was now in “unchartered territory” and that he is increasingly fearful nuclear weapons will be used on people once again. When asked directly if he feared the Ukrainian conflict would lead to a global war, he said: “I can’t rule it out. I find that very hard to say. ""The situation is now very delicate in terms of east west and its future. Its uncharted territory. ""We haven't, thank God, seen nuclear weapons used since 1945. But I honestly can’t say with confidence we can survive another century without such use.” Sir Mike went on to urge the Prime Minister to “play the long game” as he continues to try and support Ukraine. He told GB News: “Strategically we have to continue on the road we have now set out to assist Ukraine, short of offering military presence in the air or the ground. ""I am content with that argument. We have to continue ostracising Vladimir Putin while remembering our dispute isn’t with the Russian people. ""They, in the long term, are in as much danger from Putin as the rest of the world. We must play it long. ""Old points of contention in the West, socially, politically, should now be overshadowed by the strategic importance of getting this right.” His comments came on a weekend when the Russian forces appear to have upped the intensity of their attacks on Ukrainian cities. Earlier today, Mariupol's city council reported that an art school in the city, where about 400 people were sheltering, was attacked. A video has also begun circulating of the Russian military firing what appear to be thermobaric missiles from a launcher. The Russian missiles explode at a much higher temperature than most, and their blasts last longer than conventional weapons. The heat they produce can cause massive damage to internal organs and cause flash burns. It emerged this morning that Russian ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea launched cruise missile strikes on Ukraine and fired hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace today and yesterday. One of the strikes destroyed a large fuel storage facility in the Nikolaev region in southern Ukraine, while another damaged a workshop used to repair damaged armoured vehicles. Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that hypersonic Kinzhal (Dagger) missiles were also fired from airspace of Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Russia also hit a Ukrainian military preparation centre where foreign fighters joining Kyiv's forces were based. Since the invasion began on February 24, western countries have been unwilling to send troops into Ukraine for fear of it leading to a larger conflict. Putin has implied that Nato boots on the ground in Nato would lead him to launch a nuclear attack.",49,3.942210491462667,3.28008091543132,0.6621295760313473,26

These claims have not been independently verified but if it is true then it could be seen as a war crime by Russian troops. Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications tweeted: ""56 people were killed in Kreminna, Luhansk Oblast - the occupiers shot from a tank (a) home for the elderly. ""Russians fired at it. Cynically and deliberately. They adjusted the tank, put it in front of the house, and started firing."" The statement went on: ""Those who lived to their old age in the house - 56 people - died on the spot. The survivors, 15 people, were abducted by the occupiers and taken to the occupied territory in Svatove to the regional geriatric boarding school."" In a separate statement on Telegram, Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk Regional State Administration, said: ""It is still impossible to get to the site of the tragedy."" It was shared by Olexander Scherba, Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria. He tweeted: ""Absolute horror in Kreminna near Luhansk. ""On March 11, (a) Russian tank approached the local senior home and fired multiple shots. 56 civilians dead - Luhansk governor."" Vladimir Putin's government has repeatedly denied claims that his forces are deliberately targetting civilians despite widespread images of hospitals and schools being bombed.

2022-03-20,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/breaking-russia-gives-ukraine-hours-26514814,Ukraine rejects Russian ultimatum to surrender stricken city Mariupol overnight,"Ukraine has rejected a call to surrender the besieged city of Mariupol after Moscow gave Kyiv until the early hours of March 21 to lay down their arms, according to a Russian state news agency. Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, told his counterparts they have until 5am Moscow time (2am GMT) on Monday to respond to his ultimatum, RIA reports. According to the state controlled media outlet, ""the Ministry of Defence wanted to receive a written response from Kyiv"" to demands to surrender by that time. Mariupol has been under siege for weeks and the city now has little food, water and power amid a humanitarian crisis that is increasing pressure on European leaders to toughen sanctions on Moscow. Russian Colonel-General Mizintsev urged Ukrainian forces in Mariupol: “Lay down your arms. “A terrible humanitarian catastrophe has developed. All who lay down their arms are guaranteed safe passage out of Mariupol.” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here But Ukraine has rejected Russian calls to surrender the port city. ""There can be no question of any surrender, laying down of arms,"" the Ukrainska Pravda news portal cited Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk as saying early on Monday. ""We have already informed the Russian side about this."" Mrs Vereshchuk said over 7,000 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Sunday, with more than half escaping from Mariupol. Many of the city's 400,000 residents remain trapped as fighting rages on the streets around them. It is unclear what will happen to those who do not surrender in the city, which has suffered terrible losses at the hands of constant Russian bombing over the past three weeks. Moscow has claimed that the Ukrainian army has been using civilians as ""human shields"" during the conflict. In reality the invading Russian forces have been bombarding built up civilians areas at such a pace that most residents were unable to escape before the bombs began to fall. According to RIA, Colonel-General Mizintsez has also called on the civilians of Mariupol to decide where their allegiances lie. ""Separately, the department appealed to the authorities of Mariupol, noting that now they have the right to make a historical choice: either they are with their people, or with the bandits,"" RIA reports. ""Otherwise, they face a military tribunal, the Russian ministry stressed."" Russia has said it will open a humanitarian corridor leading both east and west from Mariupol from 10am tomorrow Moscow time. Colonel-General Mizintsev has urged his Ukrainian counterparts to maintain a ceasefire during that period and for civilians to leave the city. ""From 10am to 12pm - for all armed units of Ukraine and foreign mercenaries without exception, without any weapons and ammunition along the route agreed with Ukraine,"" he said, RIA reported. ""From 12am simultaneous passage of humanitarian convoys with food, medicines and essentials: from the east — Russian humanitarian convoy, from the west — formed by the Ukrainian side."" Ukrainian civilians may be unwilling to trust the Russians to keep a ceasefire as several attempts to evacuate Mariupol have been scuppered by deadly shell attacks from the invading force. Colonel-General Mizintsev, without providing evidence, said that Ukrainian ""bandits"", ""neo-Nazis"" and nationalists had engaged in ""mass terror"" and gone on a killing spree in the city. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the siege of Mariupol was ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come"". The situation in the eastern port of Mariupol has become increasingly desperate over the past three weeks. The Russians, determined to seize the city due to its strategic location, have now completely encircled it on both land and sea, stopping vital supplies getting in and people getting out. While accurate death tolls are difficult to ascertain given that fighting is now raging in the city centre, it is feared thousands have died in Mariupol. Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, warned that the city was facing a ""humanitarian catastrophe"". Two of the worst tragedies of the war so far have taken place in Mariupol. On March 9, Ukraine said that a Russian strike hit a children’s and maternity hospital, killing at least one child. This week a bomb was dropped on a theatre, trapping more than a thousand people beneath rubble for days. According to Mariupol city council and Ukraine’s human rights spokesperson, Lyudmyla Denisova, Russian troops have forced thousands of the city's residents to leave and head to Russia. “Several thousand Mariupol residents have been deported to Russia,” Denisova said on Telegram. On Saturday evening Vadym Boychenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said there was now street fighting in the city centre.",47,3.424785454882789,3.951641373313389,-0.5268559184305999,29
2022-03-20,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/horrifying-propaganda-clip-russia-firing-26511665,Horrifying footage of Russia 'firing thermobaric rockets' that melt human organs,"An alarming Russian propaganda video shows off terrifying thermobaric rockets which can melt human organs. In the clip soldiers can be seen loading lengthy missiles onto a launcher while jaunty Russian orchestral music plays in the background. The military vehicle is then seen rolling into position at the edge of a field before the jets are ignited and the missiles are launched. They can be seen belting their way through the clear blue sky before smashing into the ground, causing a great cloud of thick smoke to rise up. It is unclear whether the footage, which has been widely shared on semi-official Russian Telegram channels, was taken during the Ukraine conflict, or is previously recorded promotional material for the deadly weapon. Separate videos circulating on social media appear to show the aftermath of the TOS-1A Solntsepek 24-barrel multiple rocket launcher, which ignites the surrounding area when it is fired. It has been claimed the launcher was spotted in the vicinity of Mariupol, although this has not been confirmed. Moscow defence sources claimed: “The TOS-1A Solntsepek was used against Ukrainian nationalists by the people's militia of the Donetsk People’s Republic with the support of the Russian army during a special operation in Ukraine.” While the Solntsepek can fire a range of weapons, it is closely associated with the use of thermobaric missiles, which the Russian military boasted of using ten days ago. The missiles are seen as one of the deadliest on the modern-day battlefield, so much so its use is strictly regulated. The Russian missiles explode at a much higher temperature than most, and their blasts last longer than conventional weapons. The heat they produce can cause massive damage to internal organs and cause flash burns. Sebastian Roblin, a military expert, writing for 19fortyfive.com, said: ""A TOS-1 rocket barrage will wipe out everything within the 200-by-300m blast zone."" The UK's Ministry of Defence confirmed that previous footage had shown Moscow was using the TOS-1A against Ukraine. The defence organisation said if Vladimir Putin was to use the weapon against civilians he would've broken war laws. ""The Russian MoD has confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine. The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects,"" the MoD tweeted towards the start of the conflict. If claims that Russia has used thermobaric missiles again are confirmed, then it will fit into a pattern of escalating aggression and more extreme military measures seen this weekend. Russian ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea have launched cruise missile strikes on Ukraine and fired hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace today and yesterday.

One of the strikes destroyed a large fuel storage facility in the Nikolaev region in southern Ukraine, while another damaged a workshop used to repair damaged armoured vehicles. Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said that hypersonic Kinzhal (Dagger) missiles were also fired from airspace of Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Russia also hit a Ukrainian military preparation centre where foreign fighters joining Kyiv's forces were based. While Russia has not previously launched large scale attacks from the sea, its navy has blockaded routes into Ukraine via the Black Sea. At least 100 ships are reportedly stranded in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, prompting calls for Russia to open a blue corridor to allow them out. Ukrainian grain exports via that route have stalled completely, raising the threat of global food shortages. Ukraine's ports on its southern coast have become key strategic targets for the Russian forces, who could use them to target the capital Kyiv from two directions. So far Mariupol and Odessa remain in Ukrainian hands, despite intense efforts by the Russians to break the resistance forces' will. The missile attack this morning comes as Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said seven humanitarian corridors would open on Sunday to enable civilians to leave frontline areas. Ukraine has evacuated a total of 190,000 people from such areas since the Russian invasion began on February 24, Vereshchuk said on Saturday, though Ukraine and Russia blame each other for hobbling the process. Efforts to get civilians out of Mariupol have been frustrated over the past fortnight due to Russian shell attacks during periods of agreed ceasefire. The situation in the port city is getting increasingly desperate now, with widespread food and medicine shortages combing with large numbers of casualties. Residents of the city have claimed that they are being taken against their will to Russia. One official, Pyotr Andryuschenko, told the New York Times that between 4,000 and 4,500 people in Marupol had been moved to Tangarog, a city in the Rostov region which borders Ukraine’s south-east corner. One Ukrainian man also told the newspaper he had been in contact with three families who had been forcibly relocated without their passports. This morning President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Russia's incessant bombing of Mariupol. He claimed Russian forces in the city would ""go down in history"" as being responsible for ""war crimes"". “To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,” he said. The cruise missile attack today is the latest sign that Russia is employing increasingly extreme tactics. After a theatre with the words 'children' written outside in large letters was bombed earlier this week, Russian forces struck a school where 400 women and children were sheltering. Russia's defence military earlier said it used hypersonic weapons for the first time in combat during a strike on a base in the Ivano-Frankivsk region. The missile's speed and ability to fly low makes them ""invisible"" to most anti-missile defence systems, and they are capable of carrying nuclear warheads, experts have said.",47,2.0665995523697087,4.508469173762006,-2.4418696213922977,26
2022-03-19,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/syrians-say-war-ukraine-only-26509666,Syrians say Ukraine war 'only beginning' as Putin unleashes same brutal tactics,"A survivor of the Syrian civil war has warned that the brutality being unleashed by the Russians in Ukraine is only the beginning. For Abdel Kafi al-Hamdo, the heart-breaking scenes that have been coming out of Ukraine since February 24 remind him of another conflict. The English teacher was swept up in the Syrian civil war, which saw President Bashar al-Assad's forces fight various opposition factions with the backing of Vladimir Putin's Russia. Over the course of the decade long conflict, more than 200,000 civilians lost their lives, including 25,000 children. Assad's forces plumbed the depths of modern warfare by unloading bombs onto built up areas of Aleppo and releasing chemical weapons including mustard gas and sarin. Hambo says the terrible nature of the war and the way in which it spilled into all areas of civilian life affords Syrians a unique insight into the conflict in Ukraine. ""They destroyed us; they destroyed our psychology,"" Hamdo, who once found himself stepping over dead bodies to meet a friend in hospital, told CNN. ""This is what will happen in Ukraine. What's going on in Ukraine is only the beginning."" The links between the Syrian civil war and the Russian invasion of Ukraine are clear. As with the Syrian government forces, Russia has not been shy in unleashing indiscriminate shell attacks on built up civilians areas. Russia helped launched what United Nations investigators called a campaign of ""systemic"" attacks on hospitals in Syria. More than 300 attacks were made against various medical facilities over a four year period to 2015. In Ukraine, Russian forces have targeted hospitals with shell attacks - in one instance hitting a maternity hospital in Mariupol and killing a child. Another clear parallel between the conflicts is how they have both pushed Western countries into difficult decisions about whether they should intervene. In 2013, the Obama administration said that the Assad regime crossed a ""red line"" when it used chemical weapons on its own people. Somewhat led by the UK's decision not to intervene which followed a historic House of Commons vote, the US did not send troops into Syria. So far Western allies have come to the same decision with Ukraine. Two years after the US decided not to fight directly in Syria, the Russian military moved in and helped prop up a very weakened Assad. He remains in power to this day, and Russia maintains a presence in Syria. By moving into Syria when it did, Russia's military gained valuable modern warfare experience which will have guided its invasion of Ukraine. In August last year Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu boasted about how the military had practiced using hundreds of weapons in the Middle Eastern country. ""We have tested over 320 (types of weapons), in fact, we have tested all the weapons, except for easy-to-understand versions (in Syria),"" he said. Ismail al-Abdullah was a member of the White Helmets volunteer rescue group and witnessed first hand the terrible destruction and misery the war wreaked in Syria. He too has been watching the invasion of Ukraine through the eyes of someone who survived a war in their own country. ""It is frustrating to see Russia repeating the same misinformation and falsehood,"" he said of spurious Russian claims that the bombed Mariupol hospital had been turned into a base for nationalists. ""Russia devastated tens of hospitals and killed hundreds of medical staff in Syria under this false pretext."" Mr al-Abdullah reacted to a photo that was widely shared two weeks ago of a family killed as they tried to flee Mariupol. ""This pic is so reminiscent to what has been happening in Syria since 10 years,"" he said. When asked what advice he would give to Ukrainians caught up in the conflict, Mr al-Abdullah- urged people not to walk in open roads to avoid snipers. He also said rescue workers should wait to help those caught in air strikes until the sky is clear of planes, to avoid being hit in a double-tap attack.",47,4.696274101602019,4.966792003997189,-0.27051790239517004,2

The “unstoppable” Kinzhal – or Dagger – obliterated a Soviet-era underground weapons store. Moscow claims the missile travels up to 1,250 miles at Mach 10 – 10 times the speed of sound – and can dodge air-defence systems. It is the first time Russia has confessed to using the aero-ballistic weapon. Security expert Dominika Kunertova fears Russia is retaliating at moves by Britain and its allies to arm Ukraine. The West has provided £1.25billion-worth of military aid. Ms Kunertova said: “It’s a signal to the West, because Putin is annoyed that the West is daring to shift all these weapons.” Meanwhile, as the sickening war enters a fourth week: * Dozens of Ukrainians were feared dead in a blitz on a military barracks near Mykolaiv. Some 200 men were asleep when three missiles hit. * Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Putin to engage in direct peace talks – accusing him of war crimes for blocking aid. * A 38-hour curfew was enforced in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia after a rocket strike killed nine. * Fierce fighting continued to rage in the besieged city of Mariupol. The Kremlin said the hypersonic missile – which can be carried by MiG-31 fighter jets or launched from warships – hit a munitions depot in Delyatun, in the Carpathian mountain foothills 380 miles west of Kyiv. Aerial footage from the Russian military shows a huge explosion. People are seen fleeing as smoke billows. The blast came hours before weeping soldiers honoured two comrades among 35 killed in a strike on a training base in Yavoriv, near the Polish border, a week ago. Security in Yavoriv remained tight amid fears saboteurs and spies are pinpointing bomb targets. From Ivano-Frankivsk, 30 miles north, soldiers were digging in defences, preparing machine-gun positions and sand-bagging areas around statues and public offices. Checkpoints were positioned every 10 miles. A couple from Kramatorsk, Donetsk, fled here a week ago. They said: “It’s like the war has followed us here.” Ukraine, meanwhile, claims 14,400 Russian soldiers have been killed. British defence chiefs believe Russia may have burned thousands of bodies in mobile crematoriums, buried many on the border – or removed them to a hospital in Homel, Belarus. Staff there say 2,500 bodies have already been shipped. But Moscow’s Defence Ministry insists it has lost fewer than 500 soldiers. Fierce fighting still raged in the port city of Mariupol. Street combat was said to be hampering efforts to rescue 1,300 feared trapped in the basement of a bombed theatre. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said: “Our forces are doing everything they can but the forces of the enemy are larger than ours, unfortunately.” A mortar attack in the town of Makariv, near Kyiv, killed seven. In the capital itself, doctors were battling around the clock to treat 200 maimed soldiers and civilians, including one stabbed in the heart. Military surgeon Igor Homenko said: “What we’re seeing is hard to cope with, in terms of our skills but also emotionally.” The injured incuded soldier Yurij, 68, who was badly hurt when his home was bombed, vowed to return to the frontline, telling the Sunday Mirror: “Everybody is ready to fight and protect our people. We feel victory is within our grasp.” Ukraine’s troops are even turning Russian weapons – seized in battles in the east – on their enemy. Four senior commanders have been shot by snipers using a Russian rifle called a Dragunov. Ukraine deputy PM Iryna Vereshchuk said 190,000 civilians have been evacuated via humanitarian corridors. And she said 562 Russians were being held as prisoners of war. President Zelensky again called for negotiations, saying: “It’s time to meet, it’s time to talk, it’s time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia’s losses will be such that you will need several generations to recover.” Even when peace does come, the threat of unexploded bombs will pose a threat for “decades” to come, experts warn. Some 2,000 have been killed or maimed by devices buried in the disputed Donbas region since 2014. Now other areas have been laced with mines too. James Cowan – CEO of HALO Trust, which has 430 people in the country clearing mines – said: “We want to clear the streets and cities of Ukraine of the devastating deluge they are littered with.”",47,3.127335579434557,3.691227415227791,-0.5638918357932337,29

2022-03-19,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-generals-ukraine-killed-kremlin-26471059,Kill list of 13 Russian commanders as generals 'pushed to front line' in Ukraine,"Five generals are among the senior Russian military figures to perish in Ukraine as Vladimir Putin sends his forces to die in his illegal invasion. Troops were told that they would be given a hero's welcome in Ukraine, but the Kremlin's lies have instead cost upwards of 12,000 Russian lives. The latest senior figure to die in the war is Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev, one of Putin's most trusted leaders. The invaders have endured heavy losses since the war began on February 24, amid reports that numerous demoralised Russian troops have refused to fight. The first general's death came only four days into the invasion, and in the just over three weeks since, a number of Russian military leaders have been killed in battle. Some of the dead Russian commanders were said to have come to the frontline, something they would normally do if there were issues over decision-making, or their seniority was needed to get the troops forward. Western sources said that a lot of generals are being killed because they are being pushed closer to the front line than usual to boost Russian soldiers' morale Listed below are the most senior Russian military officials to have died in Ukraine so far. Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev was one of Vladimir Putin’s most senior commanders, in charge of the 8th All-Military Army of the Kremlin’s vast Southern Military District. Moscow did not initially confirm his death in keeping with most previous claims of the the deaths of several generals. Ukraine now claims to have killed five holding the rank of General. “As a result of fire on the enemy by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the commander of the 8th All-Military Army of the Southern Military District of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvishev was killed,” said a statement from the army general staff in Kyiv. Colonel Sergei Sukharev, one of Russia's top paratroop commanders, is the latest to be killed, in another blow to Vladimir Putin’s debilitating war effort. The colonel, of the 331st Guards Parachute Assault Regiment from Kostroma, was confirmed dead by state TV in Moscow on March 18. The airborne regiment commander had played a key role in the Battle of Ilovaysk, which was the single biggest loss of life for Ukraine during its war against Russian-backed separatists prior to the invasion. His death was first reported by Ukraine's Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security on March 17 before it was later confirmed. The Ukrainian statement read: ""Commander of the Kostroma Airborne Regiment, Colonel Sergei Sukharev…got lost in the ‘[military] exercises’, but returned home the right way."" His deputy Major Sergei Krylov was killed alongside him, said the report and Sukharev had only been in charge of the feared regiment since October. They were among a number slain from the “glorious” Kostroma regiment, seen as among Russia ’s most elite fighting forces. Major General Oleg Mityaev was the fourth general to die in Russia's invasion of Ukraine so far. He was killed along with a number of elite special force fighters as they tried and failed to take Mariupol. The south Ukrainian city has seen some of the most relentless Russian bombings and aerial attacks, but is yet to be taken by Putin's forces. A picture of the 47-year-old’s corpse was released by Kyiv on March 15 and Moscow are yet to comment on his death. General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, was killed in fighting last week, on March 11. He was among 20 Russian generals understood to be leading the invasion of Ukraine. Kolesnikov had only been promoted in December 2021. He had previously been a lieutenant colonel and chief of staff of the 4th Guards Tank Division, personnel of which were involved in Kosovo and in the second Chechen war. The Chief Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine's defence ministry said in a statement Major General Vitaly Gerasimov was killed on Monday, March 7 along with several other officers. Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, was the second of Putin’s generals to die in the invasion. The statement read: “Another loss among the senior command staff of the occupying army. “During the fighting near Kharkiv, Vitaly Gerasimov, a Russian military leader, major general, chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 41st Army of the Central Military District of Russia was killed. ""A number of senior Russian army officers were also killed and wounded. Gerasimov, 45, had fought with Russian forces in Syria and Chechnya and had taken part in the seizure of Crimea in 2014. Lieutenant Colonel Denis Glebov was killed near the city of Chuhuiv, according to Russian media. He was serving as Deputy Commander of the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces. His funeral was held on Sunday 6 March, Russian media reported, and he was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. Beneath the rank of major general, many other senior officials have lost their lives over the past three weeks. Andrei Sukhovetsky, a high-ranking Russian general, was the first senior figure confirmed to have been killed during fighting in Ukraine. As Major General he sat only four positions below the Marshal of the Russian Federation, who runs the entire armed forces. Experts said his death would have come as a bitter blow to the Russian military command and would've been fed back to Putin himself. Sukhovetsky was the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army. He is the most senior known casualty when he died on February 28, only a few days into Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sukhovetsky was a highly respected paratrooper, famed for leading training missions in “hostile territory”. A military source said he had been killed by a sniper. ""It is with great pain that we have received the tragic news about the death of our friend Major General Andrei Sukhovitsky during a special operation in Ukraine,"" a statement from a Kremlin insider said. ""We send our hearts out to his family. My deepest condolences."" Sukhovetsky also took part in Russia's military campaign in Syria. Christo Grozev, executive director of investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, said that confirmation of his death would be a “major demotivator” for Russian troops. Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Safronov, Commander of the 61st Separate Marine Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, died when Ukrainian forces recaptured the city of Chuhuiv in Kharkiv. Guard Colonel Konstantin Zizevsky , Commander of the 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment, died during a military operation to ""protect the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics,"" according to Mikhail Vedernikov, the governor of the Pskov Region. He died alongside Guard Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Agarkov. Ukrainian forces claimed to have killed Colonel Andrei Zakharov in an ambush on a Russian armoured column in a suburb of Kyiv. General Magomed Tushaev, a Chechen warlord, is believed to have been killed in a battle in Ukraine after a 56 tank convoy of Chechen vehicles were destroyed near Hostomel. Vladimir Zhonga, a warlord who led the Sparta Battalion - a Neo-Nazi military unit that has the Kremlin's backing - has also died. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine?

The use of the missiles is the latest sign Vladimir Putin is getting increasingly desperate as his military struggles to carry out his illegal invasion of Ukraine. The strike is believed to have been carried out using Kinzhal - or 'Dagger' - missiles, which have been claimed to have a range of around 2,000 km.

The statement did not say where he was killed but other accounts claimed it was in the village of Chornobaivka, Kherson Region. This was attributed to Vadym Denysenko, advisor to the Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister. The Ukrainians also claimed that wounded Russian soldiers have filled all hospital facilities in Gomel city in Belarus. “All health institutions with surgical departments are involved in the admission and treatment of the wounded occupiers,” said the Ukrainian general staff. “Surgeons are working around the clock. “All scheduled operations of Belarusian citizens are either canceled or postponed indefinitely. “A high death rate is recorded among the severely wounded Russian invaders.” The report of Mordvishev’s death comes as Russia is launching a propaganda campaign to show ""heroes"" - those troops who have killed a large number of Ukrainian “nationalist” or “Nazis”. Pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda highlighted Sergeant Alexei Gapchennko who in an ""unequal battle with superior enemy forces…personally destroyed up to 10 nationalists during the battle."" Gapchenko also ""captured 13 Ukrainian neo-Nazis, who, during interrogation, provided valuable intelligence about the enemy”.

It has since raised the question whether it would be capable of an all out victory despite its considerably larger military. Zelensky has said Ukraine had always offered solutions for peace and wanted meaningful and honest negotiations on peace and security, without delay. His latest appeal to Putin comes with Ukrainian cities now having suffered weeks of heavy shelling leading to mass civilian casualties, and Russia has said it is ""tightening the noose"" on the port city of Mariupol which has been reduced to rubble. Zelensky gave a video address in the early hours of Saturday saying: ""I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk. ""The time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover.""

The Ukrainian president said there was no information about how many people had died after a theatre in the city of Mariupol, where hundreds of people had been sheltering, was struck on Wednesday. More than 130 people had been rescued so far, he said. It comes as Britain's chief of defence intelligence has warned that Putin is now engaged in a deadly war of attrition as Russia's advance in Ukraine continues to stall in the face of fierce resistance. Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull said the Kremlin has been forced to switch tactics, turning to the ""reckless and indiscriminate"" use of firepower which will inevitably lead to more civilian casualties. The Russians have ""enormous"" stocks of artillery ammunition and could maintain their bombardment for weeks in an attempt to force Ukraine into submission, Western officials say. The warning came as Putin made a rare public appearance to address a mass flag-waving rally at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium to mark the eighth anniversary of his country's annexation of Crimea. He praised the efforts of Russia's forces, declaring: ""Shoulder to shoulder, they help and support each other."" But Gen Hockenhull said that, more than three weeks into the campaign, it is clear the Kremlin has still not achieved any of its initial objectives. ""It has been surprised by the scale and ferocity of Ukrainian resistance and has been bedevilled by problems of its own making,"" he said. ""Russian operations have changed. Russia is now pursuing strategy of attrition. This will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. ""This will result in increased civilian casualties, disruption of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis."" Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said that she fears peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are being used as a ""smokescreen"" by the Kremlin to allow forces to regroup. In an interview with The Times, Truss said: ""If a country is serious about negotiations, it doesn't indiscriminately bomb civilians that day."" The minister said she was ""very sceptical"" about the negotiations, and added: ""What we've seen is an attempt to create space for the Russians to regroup."" She said: ""We don't see any serious withdrawal of Russian troops or any serious proposals on the table."" Truss said that ""the Russians have lied and lied and lied. I fear the negotiation is yet another attempt to create a diversion and create a smokescreen"". At the same time, Putin is tightening his control over Russian media in a bid to disguise the heavy losses his forces have suffered in battle, Gen Hockenhull said. ""The Kremlin is attempting to control the narrative, hide operational problems and obscure high Russian casualty numbers from the Russian people,"" he said. As many as 7,000 Russian troops have died so far in the fighting, including four major generals and a number of other senior officers, American sources estimate. Russian forces have been continuing to pound the outskirts of the capital Kyiv, while the cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Mariupol, where more than 2,500 civilians are reported to have died, remain under siege. Earlier another missile strike was reported on an aircraft maintenance plant on the outskirts of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, which has largely so far escaped the fighting. Western officials are concerned that as Russia uses up its stock of precision weapons, it will turn increasingly to ""dumb"" bombs resulting in even more casualties among the civilian population. ""There is an enormous amount of artillery ammunition which the Russian forces hold. It may be a logistical challenge for them to get all of it in place,"" one official said. ""But if they are able to get those supplies forward then they could mount that artillery bombardment for a very, very considerable period of time. Those bombardments could be very intense."" UK armed forces minister James Heappey said the indiscriminate shelling of cities was ""very probably"" a war crime and that the Russian president bore ultimate ""culpability"" for atrocities. He warned, however, that everyone in the military chain of command could be held responsible for war crimes they were involved in. ""The evidence being gathered points very much towards war crimes being committed in Ukraine,"" he told Sky News. ""The culpability for war crimes sits absolutely with the leader of the Russian government, the man who decided to do all of this in the first place,"" he said. ""It is not just Putin who ends up being responsible for war crimes as and when the evidence is gathered and people are held to account. ""They too are involved in the prosecution of war crimes in Ukraine. This is a stain on the Russian nation.""",7,3.3917764731940214,3.5076951227067856,-0.1159186495127642,1

The death of Col Sergei Sukharev, of the 331st Guards Parachute Assault Regiment from Kostroma, was confirmed by state TV in Moscow. Earlier his ""liquidation"" had been claimed by Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security. “Commander of the Kostroma Airborne Regiment, Colonel Sergei Sukharev…got lost in the ‘[military] exercises’, but returned home the right way,” said the Ukrainian statement. His deputy Major Sergei Krylov was killed alongside him, said the report. They were among a number slain from the “glorious” Kostroma regiment, seen as among Russia’s most elite fighting forces.

Sukharev was seen on Russian TV in January when he led his troops back from Kazakhstan where they had been sent following a wave of protests. Russian described their mission as “peacekeeping” and Sukharev said his forces protected a vital power plant in Almaty. Killed, too, in the latest Ukrainian fighting was military intelligence officer Sergey Vishnyakov, of the GRU’s 22nd Separate Special Forces Brigade. He is believed to have been killed fighting near Mariupol in a Grad attack by Ukraine’s Azov battalion.

Russia has failed to announce its estimated death toll in Ukraine for more than two weeks. There are claims it runs to around 7,000 with suspicions the true figure is being kept secret to prevent a sapping of support in Russia. Yet the daily toll - including elite soldiers - indicates Russia is haemorrhaging its forces in a “military operation” supposedly fought to boost its security, and “deNazify” Ukraine. Russia has seen the deaths of at least four generals in Ukraine.

Professor Michael Clarke, a former director of the Royal United Services (RUSI) think tank highlighted the catalogue of mistakes Russian forces have and continue to make during their invasion of Ukraine. Such was the poor state of affairs of the Russian side that he said they were “making almost every tactical mistake it is possible to make”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: ""They [Russian troops] look like forces that were completely unprepared, that hadn’t thought through what a major campaign might look like. ""The Ukrainians are stalling the Russian advance in all areas and even operating now quite effective counter attacks. The Russians are losing a lot of equipment and troops.""

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here It added: “Ukrainian forces around Kyiv and Mykolaiv continue to frustrate Russian attempts to encircle the city. It added that the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remained surrounded and subject to relentless Russian aerial attacks. Prof Clarke said that Ukraine has a ""NATO standard"" battlefield command and control system, built with help from NATO countries since 2014. He added that an attack on a plane maintenance plant in Lviv this proved Russia was now trying to weaken Ukraine’s aerial ability. This comes after weeks of failure from Russia to seize control of the skies and Ukraine calling for a ‘No Fly Zone’ to be introduced by western nations. Striking the western city just 70km from the Polish border was also ""an attempt to frighten the west out of helping Ukrainians as much as they have been"", he added. Former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, General Sir Richard Shirreff said Russian forces had shown “extraordinary incompetence” during their stuttering invasion of Ukraine. Talking to Sky News, he said that the amazing “lack of professionalism” was partly because “amateurs talk tactics, and professionals talk logistics”. He said that Russian troops morale was “absolutely rock bottom"", adding: ""They were expected to be greeted by flag-waving crowds and they have been greeted by ferocious defence. ""Putin cannot accept defeat and therefore in typical KGB style if he is facing trouble in one direction, he could cause even greater trouble in another.” Because of this the former commander warned that Putin could turn to extreme measures to try and change his fortunes. He said: ""We should be on our guard to chemical attack, quite potentially the use of tactical nuclear."" He warned that a ramp-up in forces could very easily lead to a general war that spilled beyond the Ukrainian border and “could easily go nuclear”. He added ""we can take nothing for granted"" and a ramp-up of forces would lead to a ""general war that could easily go nuclear"". Western intelligence sources reportedly said that Russia had intended to take Ukraine in a ‘lightning invasion’. This would have, in theory, seen them race across the country in a matter of days, seizing cities and urban centres before taking the capital and replacing the government with a puppet. Instead, Russia now finds themselves negotiating peace terms with Volodymyr Zelensky and his administration. According to recent reports from the Financial Times, a tentative 15-point peace plan has been outlined which could see Russian forces withdraw from Ukraine. Reportedly, it would be conditional on Kyiv accepting neutrality and curbs on its armed forces.

The Russian President rang the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on Thursday afternoon and explained what his conditions were for a peace deal with Ukraine. Following the call, the BBC spoke to Mr Erdogan's leading adviser and spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin who was part of a small number of officials listening in on the call. One of the chief demands is that Ukraine should be neutral and not apply to join NATO, which Ukrainian President has already conceded to, the report says. There are also demands for Ukraine to undergo a disarmament process to make sure there's no threat to Russia and protection for Russian as a language in Ukraine, reports said. Another demand was said to be about 'de-Nazification' which is deeply offensive to Zelensky, who is Jewish himself. Other discussions involved the status of Donbas in eastern Ukraine, though no specific details were given about this. Putin reportedly said that some of the negotiations would need to be face to face with Zelensky, which the latter is said to be prepared for. A peace deal could take a long time to reach and it will be a long time until Ukraine is able to rebuild the cities Russia has destroyed. Russia expanded its missile strikes to Lviv in the west of Ukraine as British intelligence suggested Vladimir Putin's invasion had made only ""minimal progress"" this week. Armed forces minister James Heappey said on Friday the early-morning attack on the city that has swelled with people sheltering from elsewhere in Ukraine showed Russia was broadening its strikes. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said several missiles hit a facility for repairing military planes near the city's international airport and also damaged a bus repair site. Shelling around the capital of Kyiv also continued as the number of refugees estimated to have fled exceeded 3.4 million.",47,4.6908049223101225,3.595978477495039,1.0948264448150833,6
2022-03-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/how-russias-three-day-ukraine-26500525,How Russia's '3-day' Ukraine invasion became Putin's humiliation - full timeline,"Vladimir Putin 's military has been advancing at a snail's pace since the illegal invasion of Ukraine last month. Immediately on February 24, the invasion has received international condemnation as the world rallies behind the Ukrainian people and President Volodymyr Zelensky as they continue their fierce resistance. Putin has refused to call his invasion what it is - a war. Instead, he only refers to it as a ""special military operation"" to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. He had hoped it would last just three days. Reports of Putin's inner circle crumbling continue to circulate as he appears to be losing his control over the invasion. It is near the end of the third week of the invasion and morale among the Russian troops in Ukraine is waning and top military commanders are being killed. Former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, General Sir Richard Shirreff said Russian forces had shown “extraordinary incompetence” during their stuttering invasion of Ukraine. Talking to Sky News, he said that the amazing “lack of professionalism” was partly because “amateurs talk tactics, and professionals talk logistics”. He said that Russian troops morale was “absolutely rock bottom"", adding: ""They were expected to be greeted by flag-waving crowds and they have been greeted by ferocious defence. ""Putin cannot accept defeat and therefore in typical KGB style if he is facing trouble in one direction, he could cause even greater trouble in another.” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here After weeks of saying there was no plan to invade, Putin orders his military to launch a full-scale assault. This action sparked international anger and Moscow’s stock exchange plummets by an unprecedented 45 per cent. Multiple countries announce sanctions to try and cripple Russia's economy. Within four days of the illegal invasion, things had already started to go wrong for Putin. Andrei Sukhovetsky, a high-ranking Russian general, was the first senior figure confirmed to have been killed during fighting in Ukraine. As Major General, he sat only four positions below the Marshal of the Russian Federation, who runs the entire armed forces. Experts said his death would have come as a bitter blow to the Russian military command and would've been fed back to Putin himself. Sukhovetsky was the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army. Lieutenant Colonel Denis Glebov was killed near the city of Chuhuiv, according to Russian media. He was serving as Deputy Commander of the 11th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces. His funeral was held on March 6, and he was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. The Chief Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine's defence ministry said in a statement Major General Vitaly Gerasimov was killed on March 7 along with several other officers. Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, was the second of Putin’s generals to die in the invasion. Gerasimov, 45, had fought with Russian forces in Syria, was a veteran of the Second Chechen War and had taken part in the seizure of Crimea in 2014. A Russian whistleblower reportedly claimed that a leaked report says the invasion has been a “total failure” and there are “ no options for a possible victory "". A so-called analyst in Russia's feared spy agency reportedly leaked the document which claims spies were kept in the dark over Putin's plan. Russian human rights activist and operator of the anti-corruption website Gulagu.net Vladimir Osechkin published the report on Facebook last week, reported The Times. The report allegedly concluded: "" Russia has no way out. There are no options for a possible victory, only defeat.” Less than a week later a third major general was killed in Ukraine. General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District, was killed in fighting on March 11. He was among 20 Russian generals understood to be leading the invasion of Ukraine having been promoted to the rank of Major-General in December last year. Western sources said that more generals are being killed than usual because they are being pushed closer to the front line to boost Russian soldiers' morale. Sergey Beseda, head of the Federal Security Branch, Russia's intelligence branch, was arrested along with his deputy, Anatoly Bolyukh, an expert claimed. Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled Russian human rights activist also confirmed the arrests. Mr Osechkin told The Times that while the arrests were made on accusations of embezzlement of funds, he said the “real reason is unreliable, incomplete and partially false information about the political situation in Ukraine”. Vladimir Putin allegedly turned to China asking for military equipment, US officials said. Footage and images from the Ukraine battlefields had shown the widespread destruction of tanks and other armoured vehicles. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned Beijing that it would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over the war in Ukraine. However, China has denied this ever happened. Asked about the reports, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, said: ""I've never heard of that."" Liu said that ""utmost efforts should be made to support Russia and Ukraine in carrying forward negotiations despite the difficult situation to produce a peaceful outcome”. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russia's national guard and a part of Putin's security council, admitted progress of the invasion had been slower than expected. He said: ""I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like,"" Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guard's website. ""But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us."" Zolotov has been at Putin's side since before the turn of the century and has spent the last 13 years in charge of his personal security. Russia's Channel One was interrupted by Marina Ovsyannikova carrying a huge placard which read ""stop the war, don't believe propaganda, they're lying to you."" Her message was written in Russian and English aimed at the channel's millions of viewers - but producers quickly switched the broadcast to a clip of a hospital as they dealt with the situation. She was later fined 30,000 rubles or £214. Major-General Oleg Mityaev was the fourth general to die in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He was killed along with a number of elite special force fighters as they tried and failed to take Mariupol. The south Ukrainian city has seen some of the most relentless Russian bombings and aerial attacks but is yet to be taken by Putin's forces. A picture of the 47-year-old’s corpse was released by Kyiv on March 15 and Moscow are yet to comment on his death. General Roman Gavrilov, the deputy chief of Russia 's Rosgvardia unit, which was the spearhead of the first push into Ukrainian territory, was arrested by the FSB - Russia's successor to the KGB. According to Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian investigative journalist, the reason for the arrest is unclear. He cited a course that says he was detained over ""leaks of military info that led to loss of life"", while two others say it was ""wasteful squandering of fuel"". Supply line issues are thought to have plagued Russia's forces since the first days of the invasion. Elvira Nabiullina, 58, reportedly handed in her resignation amid claims she stood up to Putin over his war in Ukraine. The head of the Russian Bank's resignation is rumoured to have come after she privately argued with Putin over the devastation faced by Russians from Western sanctions he did not expect to be so serious. The former economic adviser to the Kremlin leader told reportedly told Putin that his invasion of Ukraine has plunged the Russian economy into a “sewer”, adding: “I am an expert in a completely different field.” She is respected both in Moscow and the West as a highly competent technocrat, one of the best central bankers in the world who has guided Russia through relative stability even amid worsening relations with the West - but the war on Ukraine may have changed her line. Colonel Sergei Sukharev, one of Russia's top paratroop commanders, is the latest to be killed. The colonel, of the 331st Guards Parachute Assault Regiment from Kostroma, was confirmed dead by state TV in Moscow on March 18. The exact date he was killed in known. The airborne regiment commander had played a key role in the Battle of Ilovaysk in 2014, which was the single biggest loss of life for Ukraine during its war against Russian-backed separatists prior to the invasion. A former Russian deputy prime minister quit his role as chair of a prestigious foundation. Arkady Dvorkovich, deputy prime minister from 2012 to 2018, questioned the war and told US media this week that his thoughts were with the Ukrainian civilians. The 49-year-old was accused of undermining Russia by a senior ruling party lawmaker. This morning it was announced he stepped down from his role had at the Skolkovo Foundation, an innovation and technology hub on the outskirts of Moscow.",7,4.021860312167612,4.436573921569377,-0.4147136094017654,22

However, one Ukrainian politician warned that without the rescue services to save them, they were buried alive, destined to die down there. The shocking news comes days after the theatre was first hit by a Russian air strike on Wednesday. Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said today that so far 130 people had been rescued from the rubble. In a televised address she said that rescue work was ongoing. Serhiy Taruta, a Ukrainian politician, confirmed this and said hundreds remained unaccounted for. He added that they cannot be evacuated because the rescue services in the city had been decimated by Russian forces. In a Facebook post he wrote: ""No one understands. Services that are supposed to help are demolished, rescue and utility services... are physically destroyed. ""A lot of doctors have been killed. This means that all the survivors of the bombing will either die under the ruins of the theater, or have already died."" Over a thousand people were sheltering at the theatre in one of Ukraine ’s worst hit cities, when it was struck. Over 350,000 Ukrainian remains in the besieged city, surviving Russian bombing attacks, officials have said. Svitlana Zlenko, who fled the city with her son on Tuesday, a day before the theatre was bombing, described Mariupol as ""hell"". She described how she was forced to melt snow to get water to cook pasta and they lived in constant fear of Russian air raids. She spent some of her last days in the city sheltering in a school, and described the moment a woman was wounded during a bombing, when shrapnel hit her hip. She said: ""She was lying on the first floor of the high school all night and prayed for poison so that she would not feel pain. ""[She] was taken by the Red Cross within a day, I pray to God she is well."" Many in Mariupol are without food or medicine with humanitarian corridors in, being shelled by Russian forces. Ms Zlenko added: ""The dead are not taken out. Police recommend to the relatives of those who died of a natural death, to open the windows and lay the bodies on the balcony. ""I know you think you understand, but you will never understand unless you were there."" The bombed theatre had the words “children” written in Russian in front and behind it, to try and warn off Russian bombers and missile strikes to the vulnerable inside. However, Putin’s forces still laid waste to the shelter in a merciless attack that has characterised Moscow’s approach as their invasion continues to stutter and make little progress. Only today, a Russian missile struck an airport near the western city of Lviv, where hundreds of thousands had found refuge from the Russian forces. In light of the failed reported ‘lightning invasion’ where the Kremlin had hoped to take the country, and capital in a few days, Russia has resorted to relentless shelling and bombings of civilian targets. However, today, in a Ministry of Defence intelligence update, they confirmed that across this week Russia had made little progress, in spite of its ruthless air raids. This was in part due to fierce Ukrainian opposition which has killed four Russian generals and over a dozen leading officers in three weeks of fighting. US President Joe Biden is due to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping at 1pm this afternoon. This meeting will be held in hope to bring one of the two powers yet to denounce Russia, on side with the west. India is the only other power yet to publicly condemn Putin or Russia. Despite reports that Russia had been begging China for military aid and assistance to sidestep aid, recent noises from the eastern power has suggested it does not want to be tied to Putin and his oligarchic mafia state. Since the start of the invasion, more than 3.2million people have been forced to flee their homes and leave Ukraine. As of today, the United Nations Human Rights Commission said that 3,270,662 people had left the country. Over half of these, 1,975,449, had entered Poland, and it is unknown how many stayed her or moved on to other countries. In the past few days, reports suggest border crossings have slowed, but as food chains continue to collapse and the conflict threatens to worsen, the streams of refugees could pick up once more.",47,4.932730938992619,3.9915665589263125,0.9411643800663065,9
2022-03-18,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/how-russia-crumbled-after-invasion-26502385,"How Russia crumbled after invasion - 28,000 killed or wounded and Putin weakened","It was supposed to be one of the world’s most powerful and modern armies, against which few countries - not least its little neighbour Ukraine - would stand a chance. But three weeks into Putin’s war and Russia faces the real prospect of humiliation as its invasion falters and its army is exposed as ill-equipped and badly prepared. This morning Russia was forced to confirm that yet another of its military leaders, and one of Russia’s top paratroop commanders, has been killed in battle, along with his deputy. And as their advance grounds to a standstill following devastating attacks by Ukraine’s defenders, Russia is increasingly having to resort to long-range missile attacks, like the ones which hit Lviv in west Ukraine in the early hours of this morning, believed to be launched from warships in the Black Sea. Meanwhile, the Russian economy is collapsing, the country has become an international pariah, and increasing numbers of prominent Russians are turning against their president. Here’s how Putin’s attempt to capture Ukraine and rebuild Russia’s once-glorious empire is really going… The US believes that as many as 28,000 Russian soldiers have been captured, killed or wounded in the fierce fighting raging across the country - amounting to around a fifth of its total forces. The Ukrainians have deployed weapons shipped over from the West - including at least 17,000 anti-tank rockets and 900 Stinger missiles - with devastating effect, destroying hundreds of tanks and armoured personnel carriers. In a single day this week, Kyiv’s commanders said they had shot down four aircraft - including two helicopters. Meanwhile, the Oryx Blog, a group that tracks the conflict in real time, has said 230 heavily armoured tanks have been taken out, and drone footage of charred vehicles lining the roads has been shared widely online. There have also been reports of Russian soldiers defecting, leaving piles of uniforms next to their abandoned armoured vehicles. Dr Natasha Kuhrt, a War Studies lecturer at King’s College London, says: “Morale has been a problem with Russia’s army since the Soviet Union and corruption is endemic. Soldiers were deployed being told they were just on exercises, before being sent to the frontline - and many of them will have family in Ukraine as well.” But Russia is still believed to have an estimated 280,000 soldiers and 2,000,000 reservists ready to be called up. In addition, it has close ties with the notorious Wagner Group, a firm of around 6,000 battle-hardened mercenaries who have previously been accused of crimes against humanity in Africa. The country also has a vast military-industrial complex, making up close to a fifth of the world’s entire arms sales - second only to the US - and supplies almost all of its own equipment. Even so, earlier this week US officials said Moscow had reached out to China for military support amid reports that everything from armoured vehicles to ammunition and fuel are running low on the front lines. An intelligence update yesterday by the Ministry of Defence claimed the Russian invasion “has largely stalled on all fronts” while “the vast majority of Ukrainian territory, including all major cities, remains in Ukrainian hands.” Putin was so confident in a quick victory that soldiers were reportedly only issued with three days’ worth of rations when the offensive began. Twenty-three days later, however, troops have become bogged down - sometimes literally - amid fierce resistance and are failing to take control of key cities. Attempts to encircle Kyiv look increasingly fraught with the rivers that cross the city, as well as difficult terrain like marshlands, stalling the Russian advance. And while in other cities in the south, like Mariupol, and the east, like Sumy, the Russians have surrounded them and cut off supply routes, the Ukrainian fightback is frustrating Putin’s plans. Meanwhile the towns and villages they have occupied, Russian soldiers face constant and angry opposition from residents. In the region around Kherson, a key strategic city captured at the start of the invasion, at least 400 people are said to have been arrested and whisked away to unknown locations. Dr Khurt says: “They were hoping to take Kyiv within as little as 36 hours. Now it’s increasingly clear it will be hard, if not impossible, to capture the whole of the capital. “The problem of whether attackers can actually control the territory you’ve conquered is always difficult - and this is a big issue for Russia, potentially getting bogged down in urban warfare.” Four out of 20 of Russia’s brigadier generals have died in three weeks on the battlefield in Ukraine. The latest, Major General Oleg Mityaev, who was killed this week in the besieged city of Mariupol, was in command of the 150th motorised rifle division, and had previously fought in Syria. Another nine senior Russian military figures have also reportedly died in the fighting, including the leader of the marine brigade and two air assault troop commanders. And in a fresh blow, state TV in Moscow today confirmed the death of one of Russia’s top paratroop commanders, Col Sergei Sukharev. The military leader, who was killed alongside his deputy, his among a number slain from the Kostroma regiment, seen as one of Russia’s most elite fighting forces. Losing so many of those who were leading Russians into battle is likely to both affect troop morale and the smooth running of the already chaotic war effort. Rita Konaev, of Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, believes Ukraine is likely to be targeting top-level Russian officers. “I don’t think this is an accident,” she said. “One is an accident, but this many is targeted.” At the same time, Putin is said to have sacked several other army generals as Moscow scrambles to change strategy after its attempted ‘shock and awe’ blitz fell flat. Investigative outlet Bellingcat reported yesterday that General Roman Gavrilov, the deputy head of the Russian National Guard, which is believed to have faced huge losses in Ukraine, has been detained by the secret services. Last week Oleksiy Danilov, head of Ukraine’s security council, said ‘around eight’ Russian commanders had been fired since the start of the conflict. A furious Putin last week placed Sergey Beseda, the head of the FSB’s foreign service, and his deputy, under house arrest after blaming them for intelligence failings in Ukraine. Putin is said to blame the agency, which he ran before becoming president, for intelligence given to him ahead of the invasion suggesting Ukraine was weak, riddled with neo-Nazi groups, and would give up easily if attacked. Philip Ingram, a security expert and former senior British intelligence officer, said Putin was obviously “very angry” and was blaming his intelligence agencies. He said: “He blames them for sending him the advice that led to the poor decision-making in Ukraine.” Experts have been astounded at Russia’s flawed intelligence, exposed on the first day of the invasion with Russia’s botched attempt to seize Kyiv’s Hostomel airport, when paratroopers flown in to take the airport were outnumbered by well-equipped Ukrainian special forces and quickly wiped out. Russia this week also admitted to losing its first GRU military intelligence spy in the war. Captain Alexey Glushchak, 31, from Tyumen in Siberia, died in the carnage in Ukrainian port Mariupol. “Due to the strict secrecy of the military operation, the circumstances of the death of Tyumen hero are not disclosed,” said a statement. However, the devastating attack on the Ukrainian military base where 35 people were killed during an airstrike shows that Russia’s network of spies are still active in the country. Ukrainian intelligence chiefs believe that an agent claiming to be an international volunteer had sent coordinates and information to Russia before the attack. At the same time, American military officials have reportedly confirmed that top Russian commanders are using mobile phones and cheap walkie-talkies to give orders to their troops in the field, leaving their messages wide open to being intercepted. In at least one case, this is said to have helped the Ukrainian army geolocate a top officer and take out him and his staff. With Western sanctions crippling Russian businesses and sparking a run on the banks, the ruble has lost nearly a quarter of its value in three weeks since the invasion began. Now, there are warnings that Russia could default on more than £30 billion in debt it borrowed in US dollars and Euros because it has been barred from trading in the foreign currencies. On Wednesday, Moscow’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov insisted the country had been able to settle an installment of nearly £90m due that same day. Analysts, however, fear that future deadlines may not be so easy to meet if its reserves run dry. Over the past few weeks, weekly inflation has soared by more than 2% per week, smashing past records and forcing ordinary people to shell out more for basics like food, toothpaste and even tampons. Shoppers have stripped shelves and rushed to get hold of sugar, rice and pasta. In more bad news for the Kremlin, the International Energy Agency has warned that the country’s oil exports could soon fall by as much as a third, with Western nations turning their back on its fuel. The UK, US, Canada and Australia have already banned Russian energy imports, slashing around 13% of its sales virtually overnight. Britain and a number of other nations have unleashed huge trade tariffs on hundreds of other Russian products, with Downing Street announcing a 30% tax hike for high-end vehicles, luxury goods and works of art worth a total of £900m. At the same time, the government has slapped a ban on exports of big name brands like Burberry and Land Rover, leaving glitzy stores in Moscow with empty showrooms. Putin himself has faced up to the fact the bloody war is taking its toll on the economy, telling anxious citizens that the country will need to “accept the new reality,” and admitting that things “won’t be easy” from now on. The outcry over the invasion that Russians were told for weeks was just “Western hysteria” has brought thousands out onto the streets to oppose the regime, with authorities launching a brutal crackdown on protestors. Human rights group OVD.info estimates 14,980 people have been arrested at demonstrations, and one recording leaked to the media appeared to show detainees being beaten by police. According to Dr Ian Garner, a historian and expert on Russian war propaganda, “young people are being increasingly sidelined by Putin - they’re losing the opportunities to travel abroad and live overseas - those are the people we see taking part in anti-war protests.” Top celebrities like TV hosts, actors and musicians have joined the calls for peace, with dozens leaving the country or facing being blacklisted over their opposition to the invasion. Top Bolshoi ballerina Olga Smirnova quit her role on Thursday saying “I never thought I’d be ashamed of Russia… but that was then and this is now.” Marina Ovsyannikova, a producer on state TV, was arrested after stepping in front of cameras earlier this week during a live broadcast with a sing saying “you are being lied to - stop the war.” According to Garner, despite the unease at home, the Kremlin is doubling down on its rhetoric. “We’re seeing some really aggressive, nationalist propaganda being put forward by the government.” For those willing to stand up to Putin, he warns, “a big repressive crackdown could be in the works - combining the sheer aggression of the Russian state and the willingness to murder innocent people. Russia is turning into the kind of place we haven’t seen since the start of the Stalin era.”",7,3.072712574346335,4.426059538909338,-1.353346964563003,17

The heartbreaking images show rows and rows of empty prams of various colours, set out in the Rynok square in the historic western Ukrainian city under blue skies. Each one of the prams is empty and represents a child killed since February 24, and a family mourning their tragic loss.

His words echoed Ukraine's calls for the west to turn the country's airspace into a no-fly zone. However, western leaders like Joe Biden have always said that they would never take such an action as it would likely lead to open war with Russia. As the invasion continues, an intelligence update from the British Ministry of Defence said that Russia had made ""minimal progress"" this week. The stuttering attack was reportedly initially planned by the Kremlin to be a 'lightning invasion', that would have seen them take the country in a matter of days and depose the standing government. Instead, Russia finds itself struggling to take the major cities and urban centres, while negotiating with the government it sought to depose. The display of prams is just one sign this week of Russia's barbarity. Experts have said that, after its failure to take the cities quickly, the Kremlin then turned to indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets. This week also saw a theatre in Mariupol that was sheltering around 1,300 civilians attacked. Serhiy Taruta, a Ukrainian politician, confirmed the atrocity and said hundreds remain unaccounted for. He added they cannot be evacuated because the rescue services in the city have been decimated by Russian forces. In a Facebook post, he wrote: ""No one understands.

Speaking on day 23 of the Russian invasion, the UK’s Chief of Defence Intelligence said the Kremlin had been “surprised by the scale and ferocity of Ukrainian resistance” and “bedevilled with problems of its own making”. General Jim Hockenhull said its tactics had changed and Moscow was “now pursuing a strategy of attrition”. He warned: “This will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. “This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis.” He also accused Putin of stepping up his propaganda war and deceiving Russians about troop deaths. Gen Hockenhull said: “Putin has reinforced his control over Russian domestic media. “The Kremlin is attempting to control the narrative, hide operational problems and obscure high Russian casualty numbers from the Russian people.” Boris Johnson today spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and promised more defensive weapons to the country, a day after the UK announced it will send anti-aircraft missiles to Poland. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister reiterated his disgust at Russia’s barbaric actions in Ukraine and his admiration for the steadfast resistance of the Ukrainian people in the face of tyranny. He said the entire United Kingdom stands with Ukraine. “The UK intends to provide and committed to work with allies at next week’s NATO meeting to step up military support to Ukraine. “They also discussed progress in ongoing peace talks. The Prime Minister offered his support for Ukraine’s position in negotiations and the President said the UK’s close involvement was highly valued. The UK will continue to exert pressure at all levels to oppose Putin’s act of aggression, including through sanctions, lethal aid and diplomatic action.” Russia has sustained heavy casualties so top brass are drafting in replacements, including from the “eastern military district” and mercenaries, according to a Western official. “They're looking at forces in the Pacific fleet, they are looking at Armenia, they are also looking at private military companies,” said the official. “We have seen reports of Chechen forces and Syrian mercenaries being recruited as well. “They are trying to make good those losses. “The challenge of course they will have is integrating those - that rather slightly odd mix of different groups and forming that into an effective fighting force. “They have struggled with the effectiveness of their force with their troops which they are training with, used to operating together. “Bringing just more people to the fight won’t necessarily provide a panacea to the problems they have been facing so far.” The official warned that cities could be subjected to weeks of pounding by Russian heavy guns. Moscow could mount an “artillery bombardment for a very, very considerable period of time”, depending on intensity and ammunition supplies, they said. The official added: “Those bombardments could be very intense. “The scale of artillery assets that have been made available to the forces on all of the strategic directions are really, really considerable. “There is also an awful lot of artillery in reserve across Russia.” However, attempts to encircle the capital Kyiv were being “frustrated” by Ukrainian resistance, they added.",7,3.1436385534382048,4.37403099615372,-1.230392442715515,1

The rescue effort has been severely hampered as most of the city of Mariupol’s emergency services have been destroyed and many of its doctors killed. Just a few more emerged today from the ruins – one with serious injuries – after Russia’s barbaric attack on Wednesday. As many as 1,300 people are thought to have been in the basement of the three-storey building and only around 130 have been able to get out so far. Local politician Serhiy Taruta warned hundreds of possible survivors will die because there is nobody to pull them out. He said: “No one understands. Services that are supposed to help have been demolished, rescue and utility services are destroyed. “A lot of doctors have been killed. This means survivors will either die under the ruins of the theatre, or have already died.” Human rights official Lyudmyla Denisova said there was still no information on the remaining civilians thought to be in the building. Today Russian troops renewed assaults on Ukraine ’s cities, shelling residential buildings and reducing infrastructure. The port city of Mariupol is now believed to be 90% destroyed. President Vladimir Putin ’s military launched 6am strikes as far west as Lviv, just 40 miles from the Polish border. Four strikes from cruise missiles from the Black Sea hit an aeroplane repair complex close to Lviv airport in the west, just five miles from the city, wounding one person. Two missiles fired at Lviv were blown out of the sky by air defence systems and huge smoke plumes billowed into the air near Lviv. The first refugees from Mariupol arrived in the city, where activists today lined up 109 prams to highlight the number of children killed so far in the invasion. Yulia Yashenko, 28, said: “The city is being wiped off the face of the earth. Our house was burned by artillery. They fire everything at the city, every weapon is used. “There is black smoke everywhere. There are bodies everywhere and there is nobody to collect them. It is only fate that we are alive. We could have been killed any time. “People took us in their car out of the city on the green corridor [humanitarian corridor]. It should not be like this. Tell the world what is happening.” Air raid warnings blared in Ivano-Frankivsk, 80 miles south of Lviv, but no attack came. Ukrainian ballet star Artyom Datishin, 43, died having fought for his life for almost three weeks in hospital after being shelled by Russia in Kyiv in the opening days of the invasion. Artillery strikes hit a residential building in north Kyiv, killing at least one person. Two were killed in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. And 21 people died near the north-east city of Kharkiv when Russian shelling destroyed a school and a community centre on Thursday. At least 45 people died in missile strikes on a Ukrainian military base in Mykolaiv. But the toll on Russia’s forces has been enormous – with as many as 30,000 troops taken out of action, either having been killed, injured or taken prisoner. Moscow’s special forces 2nd Spetsnaz Brigade unit 64044 has lost 30 troops and suffered 80 injured, whilst a further 50 are missing in action. Ukraine believes 14,300 Russian troops have been killed since the invasion started. As many as 450 Russian tanks have been blown up, 93 warplanes shot down and 112 helicopters destroyed, whilst 1,448 armoured personnel carriers have been knocked out. Chief of Defence Intelligence, Lieutenant General Sir Jim Hockenhull, said Putin had adopted a new strategy to counter Ukrainian resilience. He said: “Russia is now pursuing a strategy of attrition. This will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure, and intensify the humanitarian crisis. “Putin has reinforced his control over Russian domestic media to control the narrative, hide operational problems and obscure high Russian casualty numbers from the people.”",47,3.8958717066089172,4.645211627547665,-0.7493399209387479,21
2022-03-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-ukraine-war-uk-sends-26491040,UK sends hi-tech missiles and 100 troops to Poland to protect from Russian jets,"Britain is sending a hi-tech missile defence system to Poland to protect the NATO nation from Russian warplanes and drones. A hundred UK troops will be deployed to operate the Sky Sabre weapon, which only came into service with the Army and RAF in December. It was due for Army use two years ago. It comes after Russia fired 30 cruise missiles into a military base just a few miles from Ukraine's border with Poland. The deployment was announced by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace on a visit to Poland, which borders war-torn Ukraine and key Russian ally Belarus. He said: ''We are going to deploy the Sky Sabre medium-range, anti-air missile system to Poland with about 100 personnel to make sure that we stand alongside Poland, protecting her airspace from any further aggression by Russia.” Boris Johnson ’s spokesman said: “This is a ground-based air defence capability supporting the Polish armed forces at the request of the Polish government. “It is, as ever, a purely defensive capability which we are providing on a bilateral basis to Poland. “It will remain under UK control at all times. “A hundred personnel will be deployed alongside it - they are required to operate the Sky Sabre system. “It is a short term deployment which will be kept under review.” The ten-and-a-half foot, surface-to-air missile is operated by 16th Regiment Royal Artillery, based at Baker Barracks, Thorney Island, Hants. It is designed to provide “360-degree simultaneous coverage and high degrees of manoeuvrability”. Announcing its arrival into Army service, the Ministry of Defence said: “Sky Sabre marks a massive leap forward in the UK’s armed forces’ capability to defend itself from fast attack jet fighters, missiles and even air dropped bombs. “Its accuracy and agility means it is capable of intercepting an inbound object the size of a tennis ball travelling at Mach 1.” The Army said the system could intercept “24 tennis balls all travelling at the speed of sound simultaneously”. No10 declined to “speculate on what it may or may not be used for”. But NATO leaders have feared Russian jets and drones attacking Ukraine could stray into Polish airspace - encroaching onto the alliance’s territory. That would immediately raise the stakes in the escalating conflict, with Russia effectively invading NATO territory. Such an incursion could trigger NATO’s collective defence clause - Article V - which states that an attack on one member nation is an attack on the whole organisation. Coalition defence ministers met in Brussels this week to agree to bolster defences on the alliance’s eastern flank following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Asked if it was a response to Russia bombing near the Polish border, the Prime Minster’s spokesman said: “I wouldn’t say it’s in response to one specific issue. “I think we’ve always seen that both working in NATO and bilaterally with our European counterparts, we want to ensure the borders of Europe are well-protected in light of the aggression we continue to see from Putin.”",49,4.514633344789478,5.129355331170198,-0.6147219863807205,7
2022-03-17,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russias-most-barbaric-war-crimes-26490300,Russia's most barbaric war crimes - from theatre bombing to bread queue massacre,"As horrific scenes continue to come from the war-torn cities across Ukraine, world leaders have condemned Vladimir Putin's actions as war crimes. Horrific scenes of bombed out buildings and street fighting have been played out in recent days in the southern city of Mariupol - while a convoy of Russian vehicles continues its approach to Kyiv. Reports of the use of thermobaric vacuum weapons - which before detonating the cloud in a huge fireball that sucks up all the oxygen in the area - have emerged from the war zone. Discussions are already underway about whether Russian president Vladimir Putin has committed war crimes. Here we take a look at Putin's horrific attacks on civilians and alleged war crimes across Ukraine Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Last week Russian forces bombed a children's and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Horrific images showed pregnant women wading through masses of debris and rubble, while others were carried out on stretchers by rescue workers. At least 17 people were injured in the attack, and this week it was tragically confirmed a mum-to-be and her baby had died. She is believed to have died from crushing injuries to her pelvis. President Zelensky once again called out Russian atrocities as they continue a barbaric campaign targeting civilians and the vulnerable left in warn-torn Ukraine. He said: ""Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity."" The clip shows one building totally destroyed and another badly damaged as wounded patients swiftly evacuate. Children are reportedly buried under rubble after the Russian airstrike but it was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. The world condemned the horrific attack, with Boris Johnson calling it ""depraved"" - as the Vatican even commented saying there was no excuse for such an attack. A drama theatre where hundreds of terrified Ukrainians were sheltering from Russian forces was razed to the ground in an airstrike, it has been reported. Desperate Ukrainians painted the word ""children"" outside a theatre in a hopeful yet futile attempt to deter a Russian attack. The large letters spelling out the Russian script warning came before forces went on to drop a powerful bomb on the theatre that was being used as a shelter for families in Mariupol, Ukraine. The city council said it's ""impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act"" and that efforts were underway to find the identities of the victims - and just how many innocent Ukrainians were slaughtered. They confirmed the central part of the venue was completely destroyed, as was the entrance to an area being used as a bomb shelter. The statement went on: ""It is impossible to find words that could describe the level of cruelty and cynicism with which the Russian occupiers are destroying the civilian population of the Ukrainian city by the sea. ""Women, children, and the elderly remain in the enemy's sights. ""These are completely unarmed peaceful people. ""It is obvious that the only goal of the Russian army is the genocide of the Ukrainian people."" Thirteen Ukrainian shoppers queuing for bread were executed in cold-blood yesterday in the latest horror committed by Russian troops. Shocking claims by America accused the soldiers of shooting people as they queued for bread in the embattled northern city of Chernihiv. It was originally reported that ten people had died but the death toll has since risen. There are growing fears the faltering Russian advance, beset by shocking troop and equipment losses, has led to soldiers picking out innocent civilians. Even before midday yesterday, three bombers were shot down as it emerged 13,800 Russian troops had died in just 21 days of fighting. Within hours a Russian helicopter was blown out of the sky. US embassy officials tweeted: “Today, Russian forces shot dead and killed ten people standing in line for bread in Chernihiv. “Such horrific attacks must stop. We are considering all available options to ensure accountability for any atrocity crimes in Ukraine.” Russian forces have also been accused of blocking humanitarian corridors established to help civilians reach safety. However, after establishing a ceasefire last week to allow for humanitarian rescue vehicles to reach and remove civilians, Russian forces were accused of breaking an agreement to launch an attack. The Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook : ""The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor."" Ukrainian officials went on to say the Russian army ""did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city of Mariupol."" Mariupol city mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said Russian forces continued to bombard areas densely populated by civilians as an estimated 200,000 people tried to flee. Ukraine ’s human rights monitor said Russia used thermobaric and phosphorous bombs. In the first week of the invasion, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova said the Kremlin had used the devastating thermobaric bomb - which is banned by the Geneva convention - during air strikes. The high-power thermobaric weapons vaporise bodies and crush internal organs. They use the atmosphere itself as part of the explosion and are among the most powerful non-nuclear weapons ever developed. Oleksi Biloshytsky, chief of Popasna police, whose town is 60 miles west of Luhansky city, said over the weekend Russian forces used a phosphorous bomb weapon in his area. Using an amalgamation of the words ‘Russian forces’ and ‘fascist’ he said: “It’s what the Nazi called a “flaming onion” and that’s what the Russcists are dropping on our towns. “Indescribable suffering and fires.” A regional governor said Russian soldiers were holding patients and doctors hostage at a Mariupol hospital. Parents have also been forced to leave premature babies in a hospital in the Ukrainian city with around 350,000 people trapped with food and water running out, say reports. He also claimed that around 400 local residents and 100 staff had been rounded up as human shields and are being kept at the hospital in what he called “crimes against humanity”. ""It's impossible to get out of the hospital,"" Mr Kyrylenko wrote in a Telegram post. ""They're shooting hard, we sit in the basement."" He continued: ""Cars can't drive to the hospital for two days already. High-rise buildings are burning around. Russians drove 400 people from neighbouring houses into our hospital. We can't get out."" In hospital three in Mariupol there are premature babies without parents who have been forced to leave, it is reported.",47,4.683200861745776,3.5744062838555846,1.1087945778901918,9

The top Tory blasted the move as a ""desperate attempt"" by Russia to divert attention away from its brutal invasion of Ukraine in what appeared to be a security breach. It was not clear how an imposter was able to reach the Defence Secretary, who travelled to Poland on Thursday for talks on the Ukraine conflict. Mr Wallace has ordered an immediate inquiry to find out how the impostor was able to speak to him. He tweeted: ""Today an attempt was made by an imposter claiming to be Ukrainian PM to speak with me. ""He posed several misleading questions and after becoming suspicious I terminated the call. ""No amount of Russian disinformation, distortion and dirty tricks can distract from Russia's human rights abuses and illegal invasion of Ukraine. A desperate attempt."" The video call was set up after an email, purportedly sent from an aide at the Ukrainian embassy, was sent to a government department and then forwarded to the Ministry of Defence. Mr Wallace was put through on Teams to the ""PM of Ukraine"", who was posing with the country's flag behind him. After initial introductions and thanks for the UK's support, Mr Wallace is understood to have became suspicious as the man started asking questions about British policy and eventually urged the Defence Secretary to shout slogans. The level of sophistication involved in the hoax has convinced Government sources that it was a Russian plot. Senior Ministry of Defence sources fear Moscow may attempt to splice together Mr Wallace's comments in an attempt to embarrass him. Russian pranksters duped the-then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson into discussing the UK's relationship with Moscow back in 2018 by pretending to be the Armenian Prime Minister. It comes as Mr Wallace travelled to Warsaw on Thursday, where he announced that the UK would deploy a medium-range missile system and 100 personnel to Poland to ""protect her airspace from any further aggression by Russia"". Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to “pulverise” Ukrainian cities after getting “bogged down” and meeting “fierce” resistance, Western officials warned. Kremlin troops were “making little bits of progress here and there, but they are not achieving a strategic breakthrough at any point”, they said. Vladimir Putin 's invaders have “taken substantial casualties” and a death toll of 7,000 was “not an implausible estimate”. Military top brass have ordered reservists from “some quite peripheral places around Russia and its borders, which clearly was not part of the original plan”, they added. The redeployments “demonstrate the extent to which Russia has got bogged down”, with morale among its soldiers “very, very low”. Kremlin warplanes have still failed to win the aerial battle with Ukraine’s air force, with the skies “heavily contested” and Moscow fighter planes moving with “considerable caution” to dodge air defences. An official said: “It’s clearly not going the way Russia planned it.” Warning of an intensification of artillery strikes on major population centres, they went on: “The Russian strategy appears to be to bombard city centres to try and pulverise the resistance within them and to encircle them wherever possible. “I would expect that to continue.” Kremlin military planners may be unsure of whether to launch a full attack on the capital, Kyiv, it is understood. “I think there is a question now as to whether Moscow intends to assault Kyiv or not,” one official said. “To do so, with or without bombardment, would be very costly for Russia.” They added: “An ill-judged ground assault on a city as well prepared as Kyiv, with really determined and committed defenders would be a very costly business. “There comes a point where even Russia has to count the cost of casualties.”",7,4.628370641115265,5.94775538624927,-1.3193847451340046,7

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the West had been clear over the response to any aggression on its territory following a bombing near the border with Poland.

Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog As well as huge troop losses Moscow has suffered 430 tanks blown up and yesterday the three bombers were blown out of the skies by midday - two above Odesa and one flying above Chernihiv. The shooting down of three SU-25 bombers means Vladimir Putin’s military has now lost 87 warplanes to Ukraine’s devastating air defences. As many as 1375 armoured vehicles have been blasted and 109 of Russia’s helicopters have been destroyed. The Russian Ka-52 military helicopter was shot down near Mykolaiv yesterday. Ukraine says Putin’s military has lost around 40% of its operational capability - based on a combination of the appalling troop toll and loss of war machinery. But Russian commanders will reinforce numbers by releasing early cadets studying in higher military educational institutions to send them to the Ukraine frontline. Overnight on Wednesday Kyiv special forces had counter-attacked against Russian troops, driving them back 15 miles west of the capital. Plummeting morale among Russian troops has led to hundreds being captured or surrendering to Ukraine’s troops. More than 1,000 have been captured. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency intercepted phone calls from one of Moscow’s troops complaining he and his comrades has no more food, water, fuel or ammunition. Putin’s bloody invasion has been battered by logistical problems - its armoured columns cut off from supply lines as Ukraine’s forces ambushed fuel and supply trucks. A massive security clamp down and curfew throughout Kyiv has limited the ability of Russian spies and Spetsnaz commandos to trigger sabotage attacks. One Russian agent was detained in Kyiv after being seized with pictures he had taken on his phone of critical infrastructure targets. It is believed Kyiv officials had ordered the special operation to protect a vital supply route into the city from western Ukraine. Kyiv regional leader, Oleksiy Kuleba, said Russian forces had intensified fighting in the suburbs and a highway leading west, and across the capital region, “kindergartens, museums, churches, residential blocks and engineering infrastructure are suffering from the endless firing”. But despite Russia’s losses Ukraine is still reeling from horrific suffering of its civilians, who continue to be killed in cold blood by Putin’s military. And the relentless shelling continued, with smoke rising from Kyiv from multiple artillery strikes leaving residential apartment blocks burning. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky went before the US Congress via video and, invoking Pearl Harbour and 9/11, pleaded with America for more weapons and tougher sanctions against Russia, saying: “We need you right now.” In the eastern Kharkiv alone as many as 500 have died, although that figure is likely to double and the horrific toll on children is rising. Ukraine’s second city, just 20 miles from the Russian border, suffered over 50 artillery shells overnight until Wednesday morning. By day 21 of Putin’s barbaric war Ukraine’s Prosecutor General said 103 children have now been killed with many more than 100 injured. Thousands of civilians have been killed and the State Prosecutor’s office is working round the clock to collate details of alleged war crimes by Russian forces. Air-raid sirens sounded throughout eastern and central cities, including Kyiv, which was again hit by a number of suspected cruise missiles. A huge fire burned in Mariupol from near-constant Russian bombing - as America was understood to be preparing to transfer a new anti-aircraft missile system to Ukraine. More than 20,000 civlians were able to flee Mariupol in the biggest evacuation yet from the besieged port. They fled in 4,000 vehicles of which 570 have reached relative safety. The Red Cross has helped evacuate civilians from besieged areas and has delivered 200 tonnes of aid, including medical supplies, blankets, water and more than 5,200 body bags. Nowhere has suffered more than Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov. Local officials say missile strikes and shelling have killed more than 2,300 people. Bodies have been buried in trenches, and more corpses lie in the streets and in a hospital basement. With humanitarian aid unable to get in amid the constant bombardment, people burn scraps of furniture to warm their hands and cook the little food still available. In Ivano Frankivsk in the west sirens blared in the early hours of Wednesday, although the city through which many frontline supplies are transported was not hit. Since the beginning of the invasion, Russia has completely or partially destroyed 3,500 infrastructure facilities in Ukraine, said Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky. Among them - 230 objects of transport infrastructure and 165 objects of life support of the population, such as electric substations and gas pipelines. A staggering 72 educational institutions and 21 health care institutions were also destroyed. Ukraine’s Health Ministry said 43 ambulance has been fired upon by Russian troops since the start of the invasion and 117 hospitals have been hit by shells - seven of them demolished.",47,3.7210835221235574,4.002141892256716,-0.28105837013315815,2

Ukrainian forces that shared the footage from the besieged and devastated city of Mariupol. Decrying the shocking act as a ""murder"", they called on the images to be passed on to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. The footage was reportedly shot in the city of Mariupol, which is located on the north coast of the Sea of Azov, in the contested Donetsk Oblast region, in eastern Ukraine, and it was obtained by Newsflash last night (Tuesday, March 15) after it was released by Ukraine's Azov Regiment.

Across the street, the civilian can be seen calmly walking by without making any attempt to hide or show any aggression. The Russian tank then suddenly opens fire on the civilian, reportedly a man, allegedly killing him instantly as the shell hits the building right behind him, in an explosion of flame and smoke. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog The Azov Regiment said in Ukrainian: ""Cruel footage of the murder of a resident of Mariupol by Russian tankers. ""The elderly man drew attention to himself so that he would not be shot, and Putin's villain shot at a defenceless civilian man. ""This is what the 'Russian world' looks like. ""This evidence must go to the Hague tribunal."" The city of Mariupol has been devastated by the Russian onslaught over the last two weeks, with reports of trapped civilians suffering from ill-health and hunger. Last week, Russian missiles hit the maternity ward, with the horrific images making headlines around the world. The Azov Regiment, also known as the Azov Battalion, is a group of soldiers who were officially incorporated into the National Guard of Ukraine in 2014 after recapturing Mariupol from pro-Russian separatists in June that year. The Azov Regiment began as a far-right, neo-Nazi group which started out as an urban militia and a political party that has since expanded and, through service to Ukraine, has been incorporated into the Armed Forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have capitalised on the presence of this group in eastern Ukraine to announce his so-called ""special military operation"" to ""de-Nazify Ukraine"", painting the whole country with the same brush as this regiment. But on a national level, the political branch of the Azov Regiment failed to win any seats in the Ukrainian parliament. The Azov Regiment is believed to number approximately 1,000 soldiers.It is unclear to what division of the Russian Armed Forces the tank seen in the footage belongs.",47,4.189536204652215,4.8839659638925985,-0.6944297592403839,27

The video, taken in a wooded area dotted with tall trees by someone walking through the forest, is thought to show Moscow's tanks fired upon by Ukrianian anti- armour teams armed with NLAW missiles. Gunfire can be heard from the distance, and the person filming pauses and steps back behind a tree as the gunshots get louder. A bright explosion can be seen in the distance before plumes of smoke waft up into the trees. As the cameraperson pans across the scene, the ground appears to shake from another violent explosion. Two more explosions occur concurrently and the camera zooms in on two spots in the near distance, where there appear to be both flames and smoke. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The video continues to pan to the right, where a tanker can be seen making its way down a path into the forest. Russia has reportedly crossed the river, as the battle for Kyiv gets underway. The Ukrainian military today said it had stopped Russia's attempt to cross the waterway in the town of Moshchun. Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, said his forces also stopped the attack in Irpin. ""The night was quite difficult, but in general we can say that the Ukrainian army counterattacked near Kyiv,” he said. Fighting has been reported on the southwest side of Kyiv, today, as fears rise that a full-scale assault on the Ukrainian capital could be on the horizon. There are fears Putin could launch similar airstrikes as he did on the city of Mariupol and Kharkiv. In Mariupol, a maternity hospital was hit and killed three, including a six-year-old girl. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is still in Kyiv, today said his ""heart breaks at what the occupants have done with our cities, our country, and at what they want to do to our people"", who he said needed ""urgent help"". Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said today that the capital has been turned into a fortress ahead of the Russian assault. He said in televised remarks: ""Every street, every house is being fortified, the territorial defence is joining. ""Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands."" Troops are warning civilians not to stray beyond the outskirts of the city because Russian vehicles had been spotted just a few miles away. If Putin's troops encircle Kyiv, they could shell it as they have done to Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Ukrainian officials say Mariupol continues to be surrounded by Russian forces but is still in Ukrainian control. They said Ukrainian fighter jets and anti-aircraft missile units destroyed four Russian Su-25 attack jets and two Russian helicopters over the past 2 days. It comes as chilling photos from Mariupol showed corpses being discarded in mass grave sites as the death toll in the city grows. This week it was revealed more than 1,200 people have died in the port city, formerly the home of nearly half a million people, since the start of the Russian invasion. Described by rescuers as a humanitarian crisis, authorities have ordered workers to dig 25 metre long trenches as morgues are at breaking point. In tragic scenes, they were seen making the sign of the cross as the dead- wrapped in an old carpet- are pushed into the makeshift mass graves. Forty bodies were dumped in the trench in the cemetery on Tuesday, followed by 30 more on Wednesday. They were said to be both civilians and soldiers",47,3.961820431192421,4.265298547538344,-0.3034781163459228,9

Putin said on Wednesday that the West would not succeed in what he called its attempt to achieve global dominance and dismember Russia. If the West thinks that Russia will step back, it does not understand Russia, Putin said on the 21st day of the war against Ukraine. He claimed that keeping Russia in check was a long-term policy of the West, and that its economic sanctions against Russia were short-sighted. The Russian President said Western countries wanted to hit every Russian family with the sanctions, and accused them of engaging in an unprecedented information campaign against Russia. Putin said the West had effectively declared Russia in default as part of its sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, and that the conflict had merely been a pretext for the West to impose sanctions. ""The West doesn't even bother to hide the fact that its aim is to damage the entire Russian economy, every Russian,"" he said. Putin's defiance comes as ordinary Russians panic buy and scramble for basic goods such as sugar. Shoppers in a Perekryostok store in the north of the capital scrapped for ordinary items that have nearly run out because of Western sanctions. Anna, a local resident who filmed the noisy scuffle, told Podyom media that people behaved aggressively because they have been scared by the empty shelves. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. They fear a potentially grave economic crisis triggered by the punishing sanctions which have seen the rouble currency plunge in value. Anna said: “There were empty shelves - no salt, no sugar, no pasta, no buckwheat, and only expensive rice. “People suddenly saw a cart with sugar and ran towards it. “They attacked this cart, pushing each other away aggressively. “They were grabbing as much as possible for themselves, not leaving sugar for the others. “I wanted to share the horror of it. We must stay human.” This comes as Russia's invasion into Ukraine comes to the end of its third week. In that time, despite initial reports Moscow planned a lightning invasion that would see it take the capital in a matter of days, the Kremlin's forces have run into a number of issues and find most cities still under Ukrainian control. Instead of deposing Volodymyr Zelensky's government, Putin finds his acolytes negotiating with them. This morning, Britain's Ministry of Defence released an intelligence update, on the ongoing invasion and Russia's continued struggles. In the statement released on Twitter, they said: “Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain. “They have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvres. “The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia’s advance. “Russia’s continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvres, further limiting their options. “The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on invading forces.”",7,6.596016760502707,4.432473367147925,2.1635433933547814,8

Horrific scenes of bombed out buildings and street fighting have been played out in recent days as the Russian army shells the city and the Ukrainian residents are ready to battle to the death to keep them out. Desperate attempts have been made to evacuate the city as part of a humanitarian corridor but there remain about 350,000 people still inside Mariupol with resources dwindling. And with the fighting raging, people have been unable to leave hospital, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Ukrainian military in the Donetsk region. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here He also claimed that around 400 local residents and 100 staff had been rounded up as human shields and are being kept at the hospital in what he called “crimes against humanity”. ""It's impossible to get out of the hospital,"" Mr Kyrylenko wrote in a Telegram post. ""They're shooting hard, we sit in the basement."" He continued: ""Cars can't drive to the hospital for two days already. High-rise buildings are burning around. Russians drove 400 people from neighbouring houses into our hospital. We can't get out."" In hospital three in Mariupol there are premature babies without parents who have been forced to leave, it is reported. It comes as Ukraine accused Russia of blocking a convoy trying to take supplies to the besieged city, where the Red Cross said desperate families were being ""suffocated"" as food and water ran out. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said hundreds of civilians managed to leave Mariupol in cars for the second successive day, but the aid convoy trying to reach the port city was stuck at nearby Berdyansk as Russian shelling continued. ""Our side ensures a complete ceasefire,"" she said. ""Russia, as usual, is cynically lying, thinking that people and the world do not see it and do not understand."" Russia denies targeting civilians and has blamed Ukraine for the repeated failure to establish safe passage for civilians and humanitarian convoys since it invaded Ukraine on February 24. Mariupol residents have been without heating, electricity and running water for most of the past two weeks, and at least 200,000 are in urgent need of evacuation, according to official Ukrainian estimates. Vereshchuk said the majority of residents do not have cars, so there was a need for buses to reach the city in convoys so that they can be evacuated. Residents are ""essentially being suffocated in this city now with no aid,"" Ewan Watson, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told a UN briefing in Geneva. The ICRC said on Twitter that ""tens of thousands of families are living under the constant threat of danger"" in Mariupol. ""They're huddled in whatever shelter they can find. They have limited food and water. They're terrified,"" it said. Russian forces agreed on Monday to allow the creation of a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol. The first evacuation convoy then left, after more than a week of failed attempts to do so, but Ukrainian officials were unable to deliver any aid. About 300 civilians have reached the city of Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles from Mariupol, the Mariupol city council said. At the same time about 2,000 cars had left Mariupol and a further 2,000 were waiting to leave, it said. More than 2,500 Mariupol residents have been killed since the Russian invasion, a Ukrainian official said on Monday.",47,3.1505832196102594,5.155486152168235,-2.0049029325579757,29

Major General Oleg Mityaev, commander of the Russian army’s 150th motorised rifle division, was killed as he tried to take the city, Kyiv has said. A picture of the 47-year-old’s corpse was released by Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko. The Mirror has chosen not to publish it due to its graphic nature. He is the fourth Russian general to die in less than three weeks of fighting according to Kyiv. He died alongside seven elite special operations fighters from the feared Dzerzhinsky Division of the country’s national guard, which is under Vladimir Putin ’s direct control. There is reportedly around 20 Russian generals leading the invasion - meaning a fifth have already died in three weeks. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here This major blow to the Kremlin’s forces comes amid a warning from a top Russian airman that his country’s forces have suffered losses on a scale that will “horrify” people. Captain Alexander Garnaev, a famous military test pilot and recipient of the Kremlin’s highest honour, the Hero of Russia award, denounced the “completely incomprehensible” war. He added that the true death toll of the war currently remained a closely-guarded secret. Mityaev’s death follows on from the deaths of three other generals. Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was the first Russian general to die and was reportedly killed by a sniper. Putin confirmed his death in a speech eight days into the invasion. Christo Grozev, executive director of investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, said that confirmation of his death would be a “major demotivator” for Russian troops. Sukhovetsky had reportedly been decorated for his role in annexing Crimea and Russian paper Pravda and graduated from Airborne Command School in 1995. The second general to die was Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, who died in the same week. Ukraine's defence ministry said that Gerasimov was killed outside the eastern city of Kharkiv, along with other senior officers. The ministry also broadcasted what it said was a conversation between two Russian FSB officers discussing the general's death and complaining that their secure communications were no longer functioning inside Ukraine. Then, General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th Combined Arms Army, was killed in fighting on March 11. Moscow has only confirmed the death of one general and has not yet commented on Kyiv’s claims of Mityaev. On top of this, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported the death of another Russian general in his nighttime address but did not name him. On top of continually losing generals, some of Russia's best soldiers have been killed in the fighting so far. A mourning picture was released in Russia showing the photographs of six elite “maroon beret” special forces fighters from the Vityaz Special Purpose Centre of the Dzerzhinsky Division, named after Soviet secret police founder Felix Dzerzhinsky. It was later revealed that a seventh had been slain. Only four have been named. Major Viktor Maksimchuk, 44, was commander of a motorised rifle regiment, who also died in fighting near Mariupol. A father and grandfather, his funeral is due today in Krasnodar region. Mikhail Belyakov, a 30-year-old sergeant and father-of-two from Penza region, was awarded the Order of Courage posthumously. He was killed in Ukraine on 27 February but in common with other announcements of Russian fatalities, they are being made with a time delay of around two weeks. Also killed was Alexey Blinkov, a graduate of the Novosibirsk Institute of National Guard Troops. The fourth SWAT fighter to be named was Maxim Pustozvonov, a native of Samara region. The body of another Russian soldier Aslanbek Mukhtarov was reported to have been found on the battlefield two-and-a-half weeks after he died. Air force pilot Captain Alexey Belkov was killed when his plane was downed. Two others from the same city, Bratsk, in Siberia, who had been moved 3,500 miles to fight in the war - Ilya Kubik, 18, and Pyotr Tereshonok.

In reality, Ukraine continues to fight to the end the third week against a Russia that had reportedly originally planned a lightning invasion of Ukraine that would take the capital in days. Instead, the government Putin and the Kremlin hoped to oust are now negotiating with them, having inflicted heavy losses on Moscow's forces. Russia is thought to be behind the cyber attack, a tool they have long used in their arsenal both inside and out of open warfare. Hacking and cyber attacks from Russia have long been targeted towards its Eastern European neighbours. Air Marshal, and former Director of Operations at the Ministry of Defence, Edward Stringer, told The Mirror Russia was a country that ""let loose its most talented and imaginative criminals and gives them licence will be able to create trouble anywhere in the world.” Despite the threat the attack may have posed, it was quickly caught out by a defiant nation that continues to frustrate and repel Russian attacks. This was far from the first cyberattack of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The night before the first assault took place, when Russian forces surged across the border into Ukraine, experts believe a computer-disabling malware was unleashed on the country. This was apart of Russia's initial offensive. A data-wiping malware was used to target websites, including government sites. However, in response, Ukraine appealed worldwide for hackers to help protect their own digital infrastructure and fight back against Russia virtually. The Guardian reported an estimated 300,000 people signed up to a group on the messaging app Telegram, called 'IT Army of Ukraine'. Ukraine's vice-Prime Minister and Minister for Digital Transformation, called on people to join the war, virtually. He said: ""We are creating an IT army. We need digital talents.

In the latest intelligence update on the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, they highlighted a number of the problems that Putin’s forces had run into. Challenges like the terrain, and transport issues have severely hampered Moscow’s ability to advance across what is the biggest European country by landmass. On top of that, an inability to secure control of the sky has “drastically limited” their ability to utilise jets and limited their options further. On top of that, the military acumen of the Ukrainian forces and the tactics they have used have exploited Russian weakness and inflicted “heavy losses” on Putin’s invading forces. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here In a statement released on Twitter, they said: “Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain. “They have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvres. “The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia ’s advance. “Russia’s continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvres, further limiting their options. “The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on invading forces.” This comes as one of Putin's closest allies has admitted Russia's invasion of Ukraine have not gone to plan. Viktor Zolotov, chief of Russia's national guard and apart of Putin's security council, said progress of the invasion had been slower than expected. He said: ""I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like,"" Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guard's website. ""But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us."" Zolotov has been at Putin's side since before the turn of the century and has spent the last 13 years in charge of his personal security. His comments, made at a church service led by Orthodox Patriarch Kirill on Sunday, have reflected reports from Western intelligence and mark a departure from official Kremlin lines so far. This comes as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine comes to the end of its third week. In that time, Russia has lost four major generals and nearly a dozen high-ranking officers. It has sustained heavier casualties than Ukraine, and lost more tanks than Germany has in its army. It was reported, Russia initially planned a ‘lightning invasion’ that would have seen Putin’s forces sweep the country and take Kyiv in a matter of days. However, now the Kremlin finds itself in protracted warfare against Ukraine’s forces and negotiating with the government it hoped to oust. Russia’s invasion has reportedly been plagued with issues such as low morale and supply issues. A number of videos have circulated on social media, showing Russian vehicles running out of fuel. Russia has maintained the invasion is going to plan, but reports from US intelligence officials have said they have been asking China for military equipment since the beginning of the invasion. After initial failures to conquer Ukraine's cities, Russia has turned to relentless shelling and bombing of civilian targets. The deadly invasion has led to thousands of deaths and has led to over three million refugees having fled from their homes since February 24. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees said, that as of March 15, 3,063,095 Ukrainians had left their homes. Over half of these, 1,857,045, have entered into Poland, the main destination of refugees so far, but it is not known how many intend to stay here, or move in to other countries.

The besieged city’s plight is far from isolated. Reports of dead civilians have poured out of Ukraine; Hospitals bombed, pregnant women and their unborn children murdered by indiscriminate shelling. Reports of the use of thermobaric vacuum weapons - which douse an area with explosive fuel that infiltrates anything not entirely sealed, before detonating the cloud in a huge fireball that sucks up all the oxygen in the area - have emerged from the war zone. With the horror of the war laid bare for the world to see, discussions are already underway about whether Russian president Vladimir Putin has committed war crimes.

The list includes 26 examples of crimes such as the intentional targeting of civilians or non-military objects, including humanitarian or peacekeeping missions. Many of the points stress the illegality of attacking places with no military presence or are undefended. It also includes acts such as faking a truce to attack an enemy, conscripting children, starving civilians, rape, poisoning or using chemical weapons.

The sports car was deposited outside the police station in the city, which has seen half of its population leave in just a week due to Russian bombardment. But, despite that, someone took time out of the war to soup up a posh BMW sports car with Ukrainian flags, emblems and more, and drop it off to the local police. And they even added what looks like a machine gun turret to the back of the BMW 6 Series convertible, The Daily Star reports. Underneath the deadly weapon is a blunt message for the Russian invaders. It reads, in Russian: “Russian warship, go f*** you.” The machine gun added to the car is, apparently, the NSV machine gun. Twitter user @Sanpaku1970 wrote: “The NSV is standard on Russian tanks, probably where this came from. “Makes more sense in a flatbed truck, but perhaps they're goofing off with the mount, before the deluge.” Twitter users joked that this was Germany entering the war, as BMWs are German-made. The car in question is currently worth around £60,000 to buy as new – presumably without guns – according to evo.co.uk. The local police could very well make use of such a weapon-filled car after nine people were killed by a Russian airstrike yesterday. The city is near the much-coveted port city of Odessa and has been the latest target of Russian aggression as the invading army attempts to get to the capital city of Kyiv on foot. Mykolaiv had around 500,000 residents before the invasion, has now lost more than half of its population, according to local reports. A cancer treatment hospital and an eye clinic were both target by Russia on Saturday, too, although casualties from that attack are as yet unknown.",47,3.7598213350470586,4.198718865338825,-0.43889753029176637,10

Vladimir Putin 's forces would then start struggling to hold the ground they have already captured from Ukraine, the senior source said, claiming that Kyiv has Moscow ""on the run"". Russian soldiers have started to buckle under the pressure of Ukraine's resistance to the invasion which was expected to end in days but is now entering its third week. Up to 13,500 Russian troops have been killed, scores of aircrafts shot down and tanks and helicopters destroyed, according to Ukrainian reports. ""It is running out of manpower and running out of energy. As long as we keep pressing, they've got ten to 14 days before reaching their culminating point,"" the UK defence source told MailOnline.

Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Now the Russian army could be just two weeks away from ""culmination point"" while advances across Ukraine have already stopped. President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed that message in an early morning speech to his people. The Ukrainian leader said that his army continues to inflict ""devastating losses"" on Russian soldiers and that soon the number of fallen Russian helicopters will reach the hundreds with 80 warplanes already wiped out. ""Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment,"" he added. ""In 19 days, the Russian army has lost more in Ukraine than in two bloody and years-long wars in Chechnya."" But Russia's method of attack has become more brutal as the invasion is questioned, with cities facing more indiscriminate rocket fire. Ukraine's capital of Kyiv suffered more bombings on Tuesday when apartment blocks caught fire in early morning strikes with the number of casualties unclear. Retired General Ben Hodges, former commanding officer of the US Army in Europe, told MSNBC of Russia's decision to transition to ""a war of attrition."" He said: “They’re smashing cities, putting civilians on the road because of fear of being murdered. ""They need three things to do this and they don’t have those three things – they don’t have the time, they don’t have the manpower, and I don’t think they have the ammunition. ""That means they won’t be able to continue the attack."" The retired general called on The West to speed up the delivery of Ukrainians' capabilities and destroy Russian long-range artillery, rocket launchers and missile sites. “It’s kind of a race, actually,"" he continued. ""If we give the Ukrainians enough, where they can outlast Russia until Russia culminates, then in my assessment, unless something dramatically different happens, it’s about 10 days.” Putin might turn to 'plan B' – non-conventional weapons – as the invasion of Ukraine falters, a leading Russian journalist has said. Kremlin troops have continued to bombard civilians in the besieged cities of Kharkiv and Mariupol with further casualties in Kyiv overnight.

Thundering artillery pounded cities throughout Ukraine as it emerged Russia has now lost 13,500 troops in fighting - 150 in the battle for Mariupol alone. On day 20 of Moscow’s brutal offensive, air-raid sirens blared throughout Ukraine as Vladimir Putin ’s bombers again took to the skies for another salvo. It came as the British foreign office investigated fears three British former military personnel may have been killed on Sunday in cruise missile strikes in west Ukraine. It is believed foreign fighters were penetrated by Russian spies and may have helped Moscow with coordinates for the devastating attack, thought to have killed over 100. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Today Ukraine announced two new laws outlawing collaborators, with a 15-year jail term for anyone caught becoming a turncoat for Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to be making a non-NATO promise to Russia as he admitted Ukraine has to accept it will never be part of NATO. Speaking after video peace talks held by his representatives and Russia he said the negotiations were “pretty good,” and suggested there may be an end to Ukraine’s NATO ambitions. He said: “Ukraine is not a member of NATO. “We have heard for years that the doors were open, but we also heard that we could not join. It's a truth and it must be recognised.” Over the past two weeks, support within the country for Ukraine's entry to NATO has dropped from 76% to 72% because of NATO not closing the skies over Ukraine. Ninety per cent of Ukrainians want a “no fly zone” which would be policed by NATO jets - but this would likely lead to a direct clash between alliance jets and Russian warplanes. But in Ukraine 56% believe that the main goal of Russia's invasion is the complete destruction of the Ukrainian people. And according to local poll and social study organisation Rating Group only two per cent believe Russia is trying to protect the Russian-speaking population. Today air-raid sirens blared throughout Ukraine - even in the west in cities such as Ivano Frankivsk whose airport has been blitzed three times in the past 20 days. Police in the sub-Carpathian town have massively clamped down as they search for Russian spies believed to have infiltrated the quiet town. Locals have been warned to look out for strangers and be suspicious of anyone asking directions or strange questions as they could be interlopers. Sources have told the Daily Mirror the spy agency SBU’s local office believe spies are within the town having rented apartments months before the invasion. It is believed they have sent instructions to their controllers on targets to be hit by long-range missiles, including the military and civilian airport. Ivano Frankivsk is a supply hub for the war effort, sending vital medication, clothing, military fatigues and even bedding to frontline troops. The region has provided as many as 150 volunteer troops who have been shipped to the frontline in Kyiv. Across Ukraine a second wave of mobilised troops is being summoned to fight Russia on the frontline as Kyiv desperately hangs on. Today shortly before dawn large blasts boomed throughout Kyiv as Russia attacked, striking a residential apartment block, killing two as 35 were rescued. Multiple strikes hit the neighbourhood, sparking a huge fire and a rescue effort all over the 15-storey apartment building. Despite the pounding and as Kyiv was warned to prepare for Russia’s brutal strikes Moscow was revealed to have suffered massive casualties. As well as 13,500 dead its forces have lost 81 warplanes, 95 helicopters, 404 tanks and even another Russian General has been killed - the fourth in 20 days. But the Ukrainian civilian cost is immense as heartbreaking figures emerged of at least four children a day being killed by Russian shelling as more than 90 have died. As many as 100 plus children have been injured in fighting- many of them from barbaric Russian shelling. Moscow’s forces have blitzed 400 schools - destroying 59 of them. But Zelensky vowed: “Russia has already begun to understand that they will not achieve anything by war.” Both Ukraine and Russia have expressed hope for peace. Mykhailo Podolyak, aide to Mr Zelensky, said negotiators would discuss ""peace, ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops & security guarantees.” Two people were killed when Russia struck an airplane factory in Kyiv, sparking a large fire. The Antonov factory is Ukraine's largest aircraft plant and produces many of the world's biggest cargo planes. A town councillor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, was killed in fighting and shells fell on the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst fighting. The southern city of Mykolaiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv, suffered intense shelling and blasts echoed around theBlack Sea port of Kherson. Nine people were killed in a rocket attack on a TV tower in the western village of Antopol and in the eastern city of Kharkiv, the remains of a four-storey residential building were seen. Ukraine's military again fought an advance by Russia on Mariupol and the attackers were forced to retreat.

Russia has failed to make the big inroads it is thought they were expecting and are making slow progress in trying to topple the Ukraine regime in Kyiv. They are slowly encircling the Ukraine capital but it is thought now that the inability to make decisive blows means that they will run out of ""manpower and energy"" sooner rather than later. Now, a senior UK defence source is reported to have said that ""Ukraine has Russia on the run"" and the attacker was running out of both manpower and energy. The source told the Daily Mail: ""As long as we keep pressing they've got 10 to 14 days before reaching their culminating point. That's when the strength of Ukraine's resistance should become greater than Russia's attacking force."" A similar view to the Mail source, where Russia will be forced to call a halt to their invasion by May, was held by Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, speaking late on Monday. In a video published by Ukrainian media, Arestovich said the exact timing of a withdrawal would depend on how much resources the Kremlin was willing to commit to the campaign. ""I think that no later than in May, early May, we should have a peace agreement, maybe much earlier, we will see, I am talking about the latest possible dates,"" Arestovich said. ""We are at a fork in the road now: there will either be a peace deal struck very quickly, within a week or two, with troop withdrawal and everything, or there will be an attempt to scrape together some, say, Syrians for a round two and, when we grind them too, an agreement by mid-April or late April."" A ""completely crazy"" scenario could also involve Russia sending fresh conscripts after a month of training, he said. Still, even once peace is agreed, small tactical clashes could remain possible for a year, according to Arestovich, although Ukraine insists on the complete removal of Russian troops from its territory. The war in Ukraine began on February 24 when Vladimir Putin launched what he called a ""special military operation,"" the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a nightly address where he talked of the Russian forces suffering ""devastating"" losses and he tried to get their soldiers to surrender. ""Therefore, I offer you a choice. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive,"" he said. ""If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way you were not treated in your army.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the West had been clear over the response to any aggression on its territory following a bombing near the border with Poland. The Yavoriv military base was targeted in a deadly barrage of missiles on Sunday, only a few miles from the Polish border. People were woken by sirens before the “skies turned red” as missiles landed, killing 35 and leaving 134 wounded. Mr Javid condemned the attack and warned Putin that he could face war with 30 NATO countries if he moved onto their territory. ""If just a single toecap of a Russian soldier steps into NATO territory then it would be war with NATO,"" he told Sky News. In another interview he said ""it's not impossible"" that Russia would launch an attack on Nato territory but he thinks it is ""very unlikely"". The UK and other NATO countries have so far resisted sending troops into Ukraine amid fears it could cause a dramatic escalation in the conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. It comes after a Russian opposition politician said Vladimir Putin will ""destroy the world"" if left unchecked and global leaders should brace for the Kremlin to deploy nuclear weapons. Leonid Volkov, the former chief of staff for jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny, issued the grim warning on Sunday - and said he wanted his fellow Russians to make it clear it was ""not our war"". Mr Javid also accused Russia of committing a war crime by attacking a maternity hospital in Mariupol, with the WHO declaring that 31 atrocities have been committed at health facilities. It emerged on Monday that a mother and baby who were pulled from the rubble have now died. The image of the stricken mum being stretchered away from the destruction sent shockwaves around the world.",4,4.015415756294966,4.381242789922084,-0.36582703362711744,3
2022-03-14,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-kremlin-chaos-amid-cracks-26462804,Inside Kremlin chaos amid 'cracks in regime' and faltering Ukraine invasion,"The Kremlin is said to have been thrown into chaos following a number of blows to Vladimir Putin's regime, as the planned invasion of Ukraine slows. Putin is reported to be furious at the Russian failures so far but the Kremlin has denied asking China for weapons to help. The invading forces have scarcely moved in recent days and the Russian attack is now mostly focused on intense shelling and airstrikes. Efforts to assassinate Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky have failed with a 'hit squad' sent into Kyiv reported to have been thwarted by double agents. Russia has so far lost a number of Russian generals, with General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th Combined Arms Army, killed in fighting on Friday. Kolesnikov was one of 20 major Russian generals who were believed to be leading the Ukraine invasion that has been riddled with tactical errors, according to Western officials. His death will be a blow to Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin who maintains the invasion is continuing to go to plan. They still refuse to call the conflict a 'war'. Kolesnikov’s death follows the killing of Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, who died outside Kharkiv. Follow our live blog for all the latest updates on the war in Ukraine here While Major-General Andrey Sukhovetsky, a top paratrooper in Vladimir Putin's invading forces, is alleged to have been killed by a sniper during a special operation in Ukraine. Sukhovetsky was the first general to die, withPutin confirming his death in a speech eight days into the invasion. Christo Grozev, executive director of investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, said that confirmation of his death would be a “major demotivator” for Russian troops. Sukhovetsky had reportedly been decorated for his role in annexing Crimea and Russian paper Pravda and graduated from Airborne Command School in 1995. Ukraine's defence ministry said that Gerasimov was killed outside the eastern city of Kharkiv, along with other senior officers. The deaths of Russian generals comes after reports a Kremlin spy chief and his deputy haven been placed under house arrest by Putin - who is reportedly blaming his security services for setbacks in the invasion of Ukraine. Sergey Beseda, head of the Federal Security Branch, Russia's intelligence branch, was arrested along with his deputy, Anatoly Bolyukh, an expert claimed. Vladimir Osechkin, an exiled Russian human rights activist also confirmed the arrests. It comes after Russia finally admitted losing its first senior military intelligence officer during the war with Ukraine. GRU spy Captain Alexey Glushchak died in the carnage in the Ukrainian port of Mariupol, although his country has given no details of how he was killed. ""Due to the strict secrecy of the military operation, the circumstances of the death of the Tyumen hero are not disclosed,"" a statement read. Putin could face the threat of being toppled by his own officers and generals, a journalist claimed. Andrei Soldatov, a leading Russian investigative journalist, told Channel 4 News that ""everything now seems to be possible"" when asked if the Kremlin leader, a former FSB agent himself, could be deposed by his own men. In the wake of the invasion, there have been reports that Putin was told by the FSB security service, the successor to the KGB, that Ukraine would capitulate easily and give up. Matt Frei of Channel 4 News asked Mr Soldatov: “Is it possible that some senior generals, especially the ones who are on the front here, perhaps together with some disgruntled officers in the FSB, could turn against Putin to try and dislodge him?” In response he said: ""Obviously, everything now seems to be possible, but we need to remember that Putin is a trained KGB officer. ""He is well aware of risks to his personal security and safety and he has not one but two security services. While chaos appears to escalate within the Kremlin, Ukraine’s Armed Forces estimated that approximately 12, 000 Russian troops have been killed, a staggering 303 tanks, 48 warplanes, 80 helicopters and over 1,000 armoured personnel carriers. It comes as the head of Russia’s National Guard has said that Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine is not going as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, in the strongest public acknowledgement yet that the invasion is not going to plan. Viktor Zolotov blamed the slower-than-expected progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by officials in Russia. ""I would like to say that yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like,"" Mr Zolotov said in comments posted on the National Guard's website. Those comments appeared to be at odds with an assessment made on Friday by Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who told Putin that ""everything is going according to plan"". A column of Russian forces approaching Kyiv are now about 15 miles from the Ukrainian capital, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said this weekend. Earlier, it was reported the Ukrainian army reportedly wiped out Russian armoured vehicles and a command centre. Drone footage appears to show rockets being fired at armoured vehicles in the city of Mariupol - where Russian forces last destroyed a children's hospital in an airstrike. The aerial footage shared on social media appears to shows a BTR-82 APC and KamAZ-63968 'Typhoon' vehicle being targeted successfully.

A Mach 9 “unstoppable” Zircon - or Tsirkon - missile is seen being fired from the Admiral Gorshkov frigate in the White Sea. The footage was revealed amid veiled threats Putin and his top officials could go nuclear if any country intervenes with his invasion of Ukraine. In the early hours of February 24, he warned of “consequences that you have never faced in your history”, evidently alluding to his willingness to use a nuclear strike. At the weekend, in his ongoing decimation of Ukraine, he hit a military facility close to the Polish border, bringing the war to NATO’s doorstep. The Zircon - or Tsirkon - is being rushed into service this year after what Putin has described as successful tests. Russian experts say the missile has “no analogues” in the West. TV Zvezda - a channel owned by the Russian defence ministry - said of the footage: “The Russian Zircon hypersonic missile's stealth features have been disclosed… “The speed of the Zircon hypersonic missile is so high that it prevents the opponent's air defence system from detecting its impact in time. “In fact, its launch will be known only after the target has been hit.” The missile also has “variable trajectory” to avoid detection, viewers were told. “No one will see the missile launch or its flight. They will only see when the missile hits the target,” said the frigate’s commander, first rank captain Igor Krokhmal. “A surface target, a coastal target. I don't think there will be anything to counter this in the next few years.” Putin said in December: “Zircon are our newest missiles fired from the sea at sea targets, and land targets. “The tests were carried out successfully, flawlessly. “This is a big event for our country, a significant step in improving Russia ’s security, in increasing (our) defence capability.” It is now in “serial production”, and he has previously called the weapon “truly unparalleled…in the world”. While the footage is only released now, it is believed to date from December, and possibly had been deliberately held back for later to send chills through the West. At the time, Putin had boasted a salvo launch, but no footage was released. The latest launch coincided with a Kalibr missile launch from the same warship. The Zircon has been hailed by Moscow’s state-controlled TV as Putin’s weapon of choice to wipe out American cities in the event of an atomic conflict. However, its range has been put around 650 miles, although Krohmal has said it can strike at targets at a distance of 930 miles. It will initially be deployed from Russian frigates and later from submarines. Kremlin deputy premier Yury Borisov has said that Russia had outpaced the West in hypersonic weapons - and intends to maintain its lead. He said: “We have broken forward, specifically, in the sphere of hypersonic weapons and (those) based on new physical principles. “We now have serious advantages in this regard over the leading Western countries - and will try to maintain this position.” In Putin’s statement at the start of the war, he said: “A few words to those who might be tempted to interfere in the unfolding events from the outside. ""Anyone who tries to hinder us and... creates a threat for our country and our people must know that the response will be immediate and will lead to consequences that you have never faced in your history. ""We are ready for any scenario. All necessary decisions in this regard have been taken. ""I hope you hear me.”",49,5.3352490708248235,5.763222373164564,-0.4279733023397405,26

Shane Matthews, a former Lance Corporal with the 2nd Battalion Princess of Wales’ Royal Regiment, is currently based in Kyiv and helping to fortify the city against Vladimir Putin ’s approaching soldiers. Despite their military superiority Russia has so far failed to take the capital - one of the Russian army’s key objectives. Shane Matthews, who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told MailOnline he does not believe Kyiv will fall to the invaders. He said: “The Ukrainian artillery absolutely hammered the Russians while I was giving one of my medical lessons. “Apparently the Russians have got no defensive positions in Irpin so the Ukrainian boys are absolutely hammering them, which is good news. “The guerrilla-style tactics being employed by the Ukrainians is something you simply cannot defend against, it’s like the Taliban on steroids.” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine?

He said: “No good comes from British service people or veterans going to Ukraine to be a part of this."" The former Army officer added the British public, especially servicemen and women who have a ""deep sense of wanting to be doing the right thing"", need to know what is going on behind the scenes. He added: ""They need to know there is a lot of people in the Royal Air Force flying a lot of important stuff, not just from the UK but from other European partners forward. ""There are British soldiers in other European countries, mostly Poland, where that stuff (resources) is being received and then what happens next is not for public consumption. “The might of the Russian army is still up against them (Ukraine). They have overwhelming force at their disposal. ""That overwhelming force, unfortunately, looks pretty indiscriminate, we are going to see some brutal things on our TV screens in the days ahead. ""But the torch has been lit for the Ukrainian people and it burns brightly.

As Moscow’s troops continued their armoured advance on Kyiv artillery strikes pounded Chernihiv northeast of the capital, killing nine civilians. Ukraine ’s human rights monitor said Russia used phosphorous bombs in an overnight attack on the town of Popasna in the eastern Luhansk region, calling it a “war crime.” Oleksi Biloshytsky, chief of Popasna police, whose town is 60 miles west of Luhansky city, said over the weekend Russian forces used the weapon in his area. Using an amalgamation of the words ‘Russian forces’ and ‘fascist’ he said: “It’s what the Nazi called a “flaming onion” and that’s what the Russcists are dropping on our towns. “Indescribable suffering and fires.” Further south Russian missiles struck the Sviatoguirsk monastery where nearly 1,000 civilians were sheltering, wounding 30 people, according to Ukraine’s public prosecutor. Over the weekend Ukraine’s intelligence agency accused Russian troops of another atrocity against civilians fleeing through an agreed “safety route.” Ukraine intelligence officials claimed Russian troops had shot at women and children during an agreed evacuation, killing seven, including a child. Kyiv’s Central Intelligence Agency said it happened on Friday as women and children fled the village of Peremoga in the Baryshevsky district towards the village of Ostroluchie. They were walking along a “green” corridor agreed with the Russian Federation, according to the intelligence report and the exact number of wounded is unknown. The survivors were ordered to return to where they had come from and the atrocity did not emerge until late Saturday night. On the same day, it has emerged a woman and a child were shot at a checkpoint in the Kharkiv region and yesterday another child was killed in an attack on a car in the same region. In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops were trying to surround Ukrainian forces, advancing from the besieged port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north. Kharkiv has suffered some of the heaviest bombardments but Ukraine’s forces have fought back repeatedly. British intelligence said Russian forces advancing from Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, were trying to circle around Mykolayiv to drive west towards Odesa. Airstrikes on Mykolayiv killed nine people on Sunday, regional Governor Vitaliy Kim said. In Chernihiv, around 100 miles northeast of Kyiv, firefighters rescued residents from a burning building after heavy shelling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday nearly 125,000 people had been evacuated via “humanitarian corridors” agreed with Russia. Russian troops have destroyed 3,687 Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities so far, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. But latest Ukrainian official figures said Russia has suffered horrific losses in the invasion, now in its third week. They have lost well over 12,000 troops, 74 warplanes, 86 helicopters, a staggering 374 tanks, 1226 armoured personnel vehicles, 600 other vehicles and three boats. In stricken Mariupol, which has endured some of the worst punishment since Russia invaded, efforts to bring food, water and medicine into the port city of 430,000 and to evacuate civilians, were prevented by unceasing attacks. Local officials confirmed 2,187 people have died in the city during the siege, according to the mayor’s office, and the shelling has even interrupted efforts to bury the dead in mass graves. Mr Zelensky said: ""They are bombing it 24 hours a day, launching missiles. It is hatred. They kill children."" Over the weekend he reported that 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers have died in fighting since the February 24 start of the Russian invasion. Thousands of civilians have been killed including more than 80 children who have died. More than 100 children are thought to have been injured, according to Ukraine’s chief prosecutor. Mr Zelensky also accused Russia of employing “a new stage of terror” with the alleged kidnapping of the mayor of Melitopol, a city 119 miles west of Mariupol. After residents of the occupied city demonstrated for the mayor’s release on Saturday, the Ukrainian leader called on Russian forces to heed the calls. “Please hear in Moscow!” Mr Zelensky said. “Another protest against Russian troops, against attempts to bring the city to its knees.” In multiple areas around the capital, artillery barrages sent residents scurrying for shelter as air raid sirens wailed. A convoy of supplies has been spotted travelling into Mariupol protected by a group of Orthodox priests, who bravely used their religious appearance in the hope that Russian soldiers would be less likely to fire on them. The Orthodox clergy members are said to have volunteered to accompany the convoy, which carried 90 tonnes of food and medicine, from nearby Zaporizhzhia and planned to safely evacuate civilians on their return Britain’s Defence Ministry said Russian ground forces that had been massed north of Kyiv for most of the war had edged to within 15 miles of the city centre.

Ukrainian journalist Oleksiy Matsuka posted the picture with the caption: ""Irpin. Mother and son are buried in the courtyard of the residential complex in the parking lot."" Civilians have been fleeing bombs and artillery strikes raining down over the city - which has been bombarded by Russian forces for more than seven days. It is one of several key Ukrainian cities being evacuated amid intensifying shelling. Another image taken in the city today showed Ukrainian troops carrying an elderly woman to safety among the rubble of razed buildings. The woman is seen laying on a stretcher, with two crutches across her body, as the servicemen straddle over collapsed buildings to extract her to safety. Ukrainian authorities have accused the Kremlin of targetting civilians fleeing their homes amid heavy Russian shelling. And the mass exodus currently underway could lead to a worst-case scenario of as many as five million refugees fleeing their homeland for sanctuary, Poland's president warned today. Andrzej Duda told BBC's Sunday Morning show: ""According to experts, in an extreme situation, it could be up to five million people. ""Of course, we are not the only country who is receiving them because Romania, which shares a border with Ukraine, is also getting refugees. Hungary has a border with Ukraine. ""More than half of all refugees who have left Ukraine are in Poland. ""So, if there are five million, just imagine that we get 2.5million."" Meanwhile, a foreign national became another of the growing numbers of civilians slaughtered by Putin's troops. An American journalist has reportedly been shot dead and another injured by Russian forces, according to Ukraine police. The head of Kyiv region police said one journalist had been killed and another injured in Irpin town close to the capital. The journalist had previously worked for the New York Times but was not on assignment. A tweet by Kyiv police read: ""URGENT! In Irpen, the Russian occupiers have just shot the international journalists of the New York Times! ""One killed, one wounded. Now militiamen try to take out the victim from a combat zone."" And now one of Putin's political opponents has predicted the war may spread beyond the Ukrainian border - and that the despot could trigger a nuclear war. Leonid Volkov, the former chief of staff for jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny, issued a chilling warning over the Kremlin's plans and said he wanted his fellow Russians to make it clear it was ""not our war"". Prominent opposition leader Mr Navalny, who has accused Putin of corruption, was poisoned by the Novichok nerve agent in 2020 and later imprisoned on his return to Russia in 2021. Mr Volkov said Putin was ""crazy enough"" to use nuclear weapons as the conflict in Ukraine continues to escalate. He told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""It is now very clear that enormous cost has to be paid to stop this war.""",47,4.126110571962399,3.564890354451576,0.5612202175108227,9

The Maxar pictures include a multispectral view of fires in an industrial area of the Primorsky district. The images also reveal burning apartment buildings on Zelinskovo Street. The United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said: ""There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city. ""Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.""

Russia was feared to be making final preparations to lay siege to Kyiv after gaining ground in its outskirts, with troops said to be less than 15 miles away. But as air-raid sirens and volleys of shelling rang out over the city Ukrainians vowed they will stand up to Russia. The country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, warned Putin would only take Kyiv if he razes it to the ground. Its youngest MP, Sviatoslav Yurah, 26, vowed: “Nobody is going to surrender.” As they prepared to fight, experts warned the battle for Kyiv could lead the Russians to use “irregular weapons”. But Britain last night offered some hope to Ukrainians fleeing their country. The UK Government announced a settlement scheme for refugees with financial help for people in Britain who take them into their homes. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Today, the 17th day of Putin’s senseless and relentless war… So far 353 Russian tanks have been destroyed by Ukraine soldiers. The number of Russian troops killed is estimated to be more than 12,000. In a rousing online speech, Mr Zelensky vowed his country would fight to the end in its defence of Kyiv. But he said: “If there are hundreds of thousands of people, who are now being mobilised by Russia, and they come with hundreds or thousands of tanks, they will take Kyiv. We understand that.” Mr Yurah likened the looming battle to the bloodiest of the Second World War, in which 1.9 million German and Soviet troops died. He said: “This will be their Stalingrad if they want to make it so. Nobody is going to surrender. I can definitely guarantee you that.” Sources said Ukrainian soldiers today blew up a main Russian HQ set up outside Kyiv. Putin’s troops, supported by mercenaries and fighters from Chechnya and Syria, have still failed to take control of any major urban area. But they were pictured moving rocket launchers into position outside the capital. And former British Army colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon warned of an “escalation of horror”. The chemical weapons expert, who advised the UK government after the Salisbury poisonings, said Putin could order indiscriminate attacks on the city. He said: “I fear what is about to transpire in Kyiv will be unwatchable. If things start going badly the Russians will revert to irregular weapons. “They will use thermobaric weapons, which are illegal to fire in civilian areas, white phosphorus – a self-igniting chemical that can burn at upwards of 2,500 degrees – and possibly napalm to set buildings on fire. It will be like Grenfell multiplied by a thousand.” Russian troops were last night accused of shooting dead six women and a child as they tried to leave the village of Peremoha via an agreed humanitarian corridor. Ukraine’s intelligence service said after the attack on Friday “the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back to Peremoha and are not letting them out”. Conditions are desperate in decimated Mariupol, where a maternity hospital and a mosque were shelled. After repeated failed evacuation efforts, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, described the city as “the worst humanitarian catastrophe on the planet”. President Zelensky urged Russia to uphold a ceasefire. He also called for the release of kidnapped Melitopol mayor Ivan Fedorov. In Ivano Frankivsk, air-raid sirens blared all day today. IT student Dima, 19, took cover underground with girlfriend Alina, 16. He told the Sunday Mirror: “To be honest I am very scared of what is happening to Ukraine.” The UN estimates that 2.6 million people have so far fled the country. Under Michael Gove’s new Homes for Ukraine scheme, Britons who offer refugees shelter for at least six months will receive £350 a month. The Levelling Up Secretary said: “I urge people across the country to join the national effort and offer support to our Ukrainian friends.” Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Dragon’s Den star Deborah Meaden said they would be happy to take in a refugee. A website will be launched this week. But Britain was criticised for buying Russian oil. Oleg Ustenko, economic advisor to President Zelensky, said: “It will be sold for money and that money was used by Putin to buy weapons and ammunition that are killing Ukranians.” Meanwhile, British special forces veterans, helping to defend Ukraine in a project funded by a European country, have been ordered to withdraw as UK officials fear their presence could spark political problems. It also emerged Britons who volunteer to fight in Ukraine could be executed on the spot if captured. In a 75-minute phone call today, French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire.

Vladimir Putin has issued orders for his troops to release radioactive waste at the former reactor which he plans to blame on Ukrainian soldiers. By doing so, he hopes to further escalate the conflict - which has already killed or injured at least 1,500 civilians, according to the latest UN estimates. Kyiv's Military Intelligence Directorate claims the Kremlin has been gathering false evidence in preparation of the ""false flag"" mission after the reactor was captured on day one of the invasion, the MailOnline reports. In a statement, the agency said: ""Russian car refrigerators collecting the bodies of dead Ukrainian defenders were spotted near the Antonov airport in Hostomel. ""There is a possibility that they will be presented as killed saboteurs in the Chernobyl zone."" Russian forces plan to use what would be a 'disaster' to further justify the conflict in Ukraine, but there are fears that without the proper knowledge, Russian forces could trigger a chemical leak. Technicians work around the clock to maintain the plant whilst held at gunpoint by the Russian occupying soldiers, the Daily Star reports. Sviatoslav Yurah, Ukraine's youngest ever MP and a former adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's a massive town of millions and if the Russians try to come in they will have quite a fight on their hands - this will be their Stalingrad if they want to make it so."" Millions of refugees have now fled Ukraine, going to neighbouring countries like Poland, Slovakia and Moldova to escape the bombardment from Putin's forces. Russian forces are closing in on Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv in what could be a major turning point in the war so far. Vehicles are advancing on the capital after being held for several days and a military airfield south of the city in Vasylkiv has been destroyed by Russian missiles. Earlier this week, a specialist cancer hospital in Mykolaiv was also hit, luckily killing no one but hundreds of patients receiving chemotherapy were inside at the time. Another ceasefire is expected to be put in place today to allow citizens in major cities to evacuate through humanitarian corridors. However, Russia has been ignoring ceasefires despite pleas from Ukrainian officials. According to the United Nations, the death toll has now reached 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries in Ukraine as of March 10, 26 of those killed were children.",47,3.3954109951546734,3.384169422747574,0.011241572407099554,10

The cruel attack took place today when Moscow’s forces fired on an evacuating convoy of civilians from the village of Peremoha, in the Kyiv region. This caused seven deaths including that of a child. In a statement, the intelligence service claimed: ""After the attack, the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back to Peremoha and are not letting them out of the village.” Russia has denied targeting civilians since it invaded but repeatedly has been proven to attack civilian targets.

Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The seven women and children who Ukraine says died when Russian forces attacked a convoy escaping a village in the Kyiv region on Saturday were not as previously stated in an agreed evacuation corridor, the defence ministry said. Ukraine's intelligence service initially said those who died outside Peremoha had been in a ""green corridor"" agreed withRussia. A defence ministry statement later said people had in fact tried to escape by themselves, ""so they began evacuatingwithout the 'green corridor' agreed by the parties"". This came as France said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not ready to make peace after Emmanuel Macron, the French President, met with him. The invasion continues well into its third week now, after reports that the Kremlin hoped it would be over in days. But now the conflict has spanned into weeks, with most of the country and airspace, not under Russian control. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Moscow intended to send in new troops after his country’s forces had put 31 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups out of action. Whilst difficult to determine Russia’s exact losses, thousands of Russian troops have died and reportedly the Kremlin has lost more tanks than Germany has in use. Zelensky also said that 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed so far in the fighting. He has also recently spoken with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Macron, who in turn spoke with Putin and urged him to consider a ceasefire. However, a Kremlin statement on the 75-minute call made no mention of a ceasefire and a French presidency official said: ""We did not detect a willingness on Putin's part to end the war"". In response to Zelensky’s calls for more Western involvement in peace negotiations, a US state department spokesperson said: ""If there are diplomatic steps that we can take that the Ukrainian government believes would be helpful, we're prepared to take them."" Crisis talks continue between the two slides via video link, Russia’s RIA news agency reported. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that fighting continues northwest of the capital, with the main bulk of Russia’s ground forces 25km from the capital. Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain surrounded and under heavy Russian shelling, it said. Russia’s invasion has been met with nearly universally condemnation and drawn tough sanctions from the west. Moscow’s brutal attacks have trapped thousands of people as the conflict has besieged cities and sent over 2.5million Ukrainians fleeing. Ukrainian officials had planned to use humanitarian corridors from Mariupol as well as towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv, Sumy and some other areas on Saturday. The governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing on Saturday morning though some evacuations were proceeding. The Donetsk region's governor said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into the southern city of Mariupol. ""There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,"" the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. ""Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.""",47,2.8456915738507624,3.951754900421726,-1.1060633265709634,29

Russia has already lost three major generals in less than three weeks of fighting, since the invasion began on February 24. Former RAF Commander Edward Stringer said the presence of these figures so close to the frontline, and their deaths, does not bode well for Russia. On Friday, it was reported that the commander of the Eastern Military District, Andrei Kolesnikov, had died. This came within days of his colleagues Vitaly Gerasimov of the 41st Army and Andrei Sukhovetsky of the Russian Airborne Forces also being killed in combat. The former RAF commander told Sky News: ""Critical reports that three Major Generals – Major Generals don't normally get that close to the front. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here ""If they do, something is going very badly wrong. It shows Russia is stretched to its elastic limit in Ukraine. ""And to try and salvage something from this, the generals are at the front whipping the troops for one last effort. ""If you've lost three generals, and you're claiming you've only lost about 500 troops, something doesn't add up and it suggests things are not going well militarily."" Whilst reports vary, Moscow has only killed around 500 Ukrainian soldiers so far - but lost more than 10,000 of its own troops. This means Russia is losing more troops every day - at least 588 a day. Western intelligence reported that Russia was taken back by the fierceness of Ukraine’s resistance which has seen it lose more tanks than Germany has across its total army. The cities of Kherson, in eastern Ukraine, and Melitopol, in the south, are the only large centres to have been officially taken by the Russians. Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol have been subjected to heavy, relentless shelling, forcing countless to flee, but they have not fallen yet. Russians are thought to have around 20 major generals in theatre in Ukraine. Western officials believe having such high-ranking officers so far forward to the front in the early stages of the invasion is significant. There have been widespread reports of morale among Russian troops is low after two weeks of the war, with footage emerging of allegedly captured soldiers claiming they were not aware they would be deployed to fight. General Andrei Kolesnikov, of the 29th Combined Arms Army, was killed in fighting yesterday. His death followed the killings of Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, who died outside Kharkiv alongside senior officers, and Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky. Sukhovetsky was the first general to die and was reportedly killed by a sniper. Putin confirmed his death in a speech eight days into the invasion. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. Christo Grozev, executive director of investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, said that confirmation of his death would be a “major demotivator” for Russian troops. Sukhovetsky had reportedly been decorated for his role in annexing Crimea and Russian paper Pravda and graduated from Airborne Command School in 1995. The second general to die was Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, who also died this week. Ukraine's defence ministry said that Gerasimov was killed outside the eastern city of Kharkiv, along with other senior officers. The ministry also broadcasted what it said was a conversation between two Russian FSB officers discussing the general's death and complaining that their secure communications were no longer functioning inside Ukraine.",7,5.175343377474717,5.538070863956226,-0.3627274864815089,22

Andrei Kozyrev, who was Boris Yeltsin’s leading diplomat, believes key figures in the Kremlin may be plotting the Russian President’s downfall. It comes as Russian troops edge towards Ukraine's capital Kyiv, with reports overnight stating the bulk of Russian forces are now just 25km from the city following a night of intense fighting. But Mr Kozyrev, who was foreign minister from 1990 to 1996, believes Putin could soon be ousted with an “armed escort either to the grave or to retirement.” This is because, according to Mr Kozyrev, Russian forces are bogged down in Ukraine and the country is isolated due to sanctions. He told The Times: “Many Russian tsars were killed. Many were dismissed one way or the other. “Even in the Soviet Union, there were ways; Stalin was said to have been poisoned, Khrushchev was just escorted out of the Kremlin. “With Putin, I very much expect there to be resistance growing and discontent growing that will be resolved one way or another. “I don’t know which way but Russian history is full of unexpected outcomes.” Speaking about Putin's decision to invade, Mr Kozyrev said: “It’s horrific but it’s not irrational. To understand why the invasion was rational for Putin, we have to step into his shoes.” Mr Kozyrev, who now lives in Miami, believes Putin is not insane, but ""simply wrong and immoral"". It comes as reports suggested Russian forces made progress overnight from north-east Ukraine in their fight to reach the capital Kyiv. In an update on Saturday morning, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said fighting to the north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv continued, with the bulk of Russian ground forces now about 25 kilometres from its centre. Elements of the large Russian column north of Kyiv have dispersed, the MoD added, which it said is likely to support an attempt by the aggressors to encircle the city. Kyiv mayor and former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko believes there are nearly two million people still left in the city that is being attacked on several fronts. He said Kyiv had enough vital supplies for a couple of weeks and supply lines remain open. It is feared the capital could face the same fate as Mariupol which has encircled for days. Mikhail Podoliak, adviser to Ukraine’s hero President Volodymyr Zelensky, said although Kyiv was under siege it was ready to fight. He added: “The defence is well thought out and supply has been adjusted.” Mr Podoliak vowed Kyiv’s defenders – troops and civil defence members – are “charged, focused and professional.” He added: “The full political leadership of the country is in the capital.” Ukraine says Moscow’s forces are killing more civilians than troops in artillery bombardments and air strikes on cities throughout the country. It is believed more than 12,000 Russian soldiers have died in fighting while in excess of 2,000 Ukraine civilians have been killed. The toll on Kyiv’s troops is unknown. Meanwhile, the UK Government is intending to further ramp up pressure on the Kremlin with plans to ban exports of luxury goods to Russia in the latest move to isolate Putin. Details of the plans will be set out in the coming days, Downing Street said. It came as Boris Johnson joined with other G7 leaders on Friday to commit to further increase the pressure on the Russian president’s regime. The group agreed to take steps to deny Russia “most favoured nation” status on key products, which No 10 said would significantly reduce the ability of Russian businesses to export.",47,3.550655397503725,3.0312581483658945,0.5193972491378305,10

Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelensky claims Russian troops had abducted the mayor of Melitopol, a city in southeastern Ukraine. Moscow has not yet commented on the abduction claims. A group of men appear to be seen escorting Ivan Fedorov out of a building and across a square in a CCTV clip shared on Telegram by the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office. The footage - which has been shared widely by the media in Ukraine - is believed to have been taken in the city's Victory Square. Ukraine's parliament has claimed the mayor was kidnapped by a group of 10 armed men who put a plastic bag over his head, Daily Mail reports. President Zelensky has called the alleged abduction a ""crime against democracy"" and said the acts by Russia would be treated as ""terrorism"". He said: ""The capture of the mayor of Melitopol is therefore a crime, not only against a particular person, against a particular community, and not only against Ukraine. It is a crime against democracy itself... The acts of the Russian invaders will be regarded like those of Islamic State terrorist."" Ukrainian officials have claimed that the mayor was kidnapped after he had ""refused to co-operate with the enemy"". Mr Zelensky said Russian forces ""have transitioned into a new stage of terror"". He added: ""They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders. ""Therefore, they have switched to a new stage of terror when they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of the legitimate local Ukrainian authorities. ""The whole country saw that Melitopol did not surrender to the invaders, and this will not be changed by putting pressure on mayors or kidnapping mayors."" In an address on Friday, March 11, Ukraine's President Zelensky described his colleague as ""a mayor who bravely defends Ukraine and the members of his community"". It was later claimed by a Russian separatist prosecutor in Luhansk that Fedorov was being investigated for terrorism offences. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of violating international law by abducting the mayor of Melitopol. Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement: ""The abduction of the mayor of Melitopol is classified as a war crime under the Geneva Conventions and the Additional Protocol, which prohibit the taking of civilian hostages during the war.""

Debate has been rife over whether the pilot really exists, or is a purely mythical figure, but now the Ukrainian military has published a photo of the air ace. The pilot has been pictured flying a MiG-29 but with his face hidden behind a black visor and oxygen mask, meaning doubters are likely to remain. The image was captioned with a threat aimed at Russian pilots, reading: “Hello, occupier, I’m coming for your soul!” When the invasion of Ukraine began, Russia had 1,172 combat-capable aircraft, including almost a hundred 1,700mph Su-35S Flanker fighters, reported the Daily Star. By contrast Ukraine had just 124 combat-ready aircraft, and the most advanced fighter planes available to Ukrainian defenders were the air force’s 36 1980s-era MiG-29 Fulcrums. According to recent reports, a total of 11 Russian aeroplanes has been shot down, along with 11 helicopters, and two drones - while Ukraine has reportedly lost eight aeroplanes and three drones. As yet, the Russian air force has not achieved total air superiority, but even though the Ukrainian defences are bristling with portable anti-aircraft missiles, the numbers are in Putin’s favour. Samuel Cranny-Evans, a Research Analyst at the defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute, said that true or false the idea of the ""Ghost of Kyiv"" is fantastic propaganda. He told the Express : “I think the main thing to note is that as part of an information campaign, it’s very effective. “It does have precedent of course, reporting on German fighter aces for example, or Russian snipers with crazy high kill tallies in WW2 for example.” Mr Cranny-Evans said its possible that there is some truth to the tale but it is impossible to know one way or the other. He said: “Typically, information Warfare should contain a kernel of truth. So, it’s possible there is a ‘ghost of Kyiv’ who has been relatively successful.” President Volodymyr Zelensky has been appealing to NATO to impose a no-fly zone over his country but Western leaders are wary of coming into direct conflict with Russian forces for fear of escalating the conflict into a nuclear showdown. US President Joe Biden has also rejected the suggestion that Poland loans its squadrons of Soviet-made MiG fighters to Ukraine. The US Defence Department’s John Kirby told reporters: “We do not support the transfer of the fighters to the Ukrainian air force at this time and have no desire to see them in our custody either”. He added that Pentagon analysts believed the jets wouldn’t materially improve Ukraine’s chances, but instead would increase the prospects of drawing NATO directly into the fight. As he launched his invasion of Ukraine, Putin warned anyone “who might be tempted to meddle in the ongoing events: whoever tries to stand in our way or create threats for our country … people should know Russia’s response will be immediate and lead you to consequences you have never encountered in your history"".",49,4.340421205509923,4.8264952467930975,-0.48607404128317455,7

The TOS-1A multi-barrelled rockets have a range of five miles and are used in areas of urban resistance in an attempt to cause mass civilian casualties. The catastrophic weapons, usually mounted on a T-72 tank chassis, lead to horrific blasts which can cause wounds and other major physical damage to victims. The Kremlin has opted for the missiles to escalate its war while avoiding the nuclear threshold, according to reports. It is believed they have used them in Syria against Islamic State and have been brought into the war zone in Ukraine. For all the latest updates on the Ukraine invasion follow our live blog here This week, the UK Ministry of Defence confirmed its Russian counterparts had ""confirmed the use of the TOS-1A weapon system in Ukraine"". It added in a statement on Twitter : ""The TOS-1A uses thermobaric rockets, creating incendiary and blast effects."" However, a US defence official said his country could not confirm the use of thermobaric weapons. He told reporters at a briefing: ""We know that they have the launching systems available to them in Ukraine that could be used for rockets that have a thermobaric warhead on them. ""But we cannot confirm that those weapons are in Ukraine and we cannot confirm any examples of use."" On February 24, the day Vladimir Putin announced the invasion, cameras installed on the Belarus-Ukraine border revealed a TOS-1A among other military vehicles entering Ukraine. Days later, more footage began to emerge on social media showing TOS-1As, as well as other heavy artillery, heading toward Ukraine, this time moving south from Russia’s Belgorod region. On February 26, US Senator Marco Rubio tweeted that Russia ""has now deployed TOS-1A launchers to the outskirts of heavily populated areas"". At the end of last month, the TOS-1 was identified near Mariupol, the southern port city which has seen some of the worst bomb strikes since the war began. There were some claims that the missiles were used during artillery attacks on the hotly contested town of Vasylkiv, around 15 miles south of Kyiv. A major explosion had occurred after a fuel farm at Vasylkiv Air Base took a direct hit, leading to such rumours. However, there's no evidence the TOS-1 was used. Also at hand for invading forces are Uragan long range thermobaric Multi Launch Rocket Systems, which have a range of 40 miles. One volley can destroy a square mile of territory. These weapons bridge the gap between nuclear and conventional, avoiding nuclear escalation, but achieving many of the same catastrophic effects. There are also lung-busting thermobaric vacuum missiles which cause an explosion so powerful and so hot that it blows out and then in on itself, sucking all of the oxygen from the immediate area. Russia has already admitted using these Soviet-era weapon-launched rockets which create higher temperatures and more damaging explosions that last longer than conventional blasts. Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova claimed the vaccum bomb has already been used in the invasion, though this has not yet been confirmed and the ambassador gave no indication as to where it had been used. She said earlier this month: ""They used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva Convention."" A CIA study said of the bombs: ""Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness."" The White House Press Secretary said if the ambassador's claims are indeed true, then the act of using them would be a ""war crime"". However, The Guardian was told that the bombs are indeed legal. A senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Dr Marcus Hellyer, said: ""They are not illegal even though their effects can be pretty horrific, because of that effect of creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders."" When Putin announced the invasion of Ukraine on February 20, few expected successful resistance for so long. But as the days have gone on, the Kremlin has resorted to more extreme measures, including heavy bombardment of Ukrainian cities via airstrikes.",49,4.5911754132354625,5.192432943243244,-0.6012575300077811,26

On March 11, Dnipro in the east of Ukraine and the country’s fourth-largest city sustained heavy damage from Russian artillery despite having not come under major attack until this point in the conflict. Russian invasion forces entered Ukraine, the largest country in Europe, from multiple different angles. Troops initially entered from the north via Belarus and western Russia. In the east forces came from the already contested Ukrainian regions of Donestk and Luhansk, while in the south, naval attacks were paired with an invasion from Crimea, which too has been contested since its annexation by Russia in 2014. But now, on day 16 of the invasion, which cities are currently under attack and how far have Russian forces reached according to the latest map data available? Kyiv , the nation’s capital, has been the scene of heightened Russian shelling, with Russian forces thought to be closing in on the city. The 40-mile convoy is thought to have redeployed closer to the city, in what has been interpreted by some as a move to encircle the capital. At the time of writing the city remains free, despite ongoing attacks. President Zelensky is believed to still be in the city despite being at threat from roving assassination squads. The eastern city of Dnipro suffered its first major attack on Friday, March 11. This city holds strategic importance as a means of supplying Ukrainian forces on the eastern front, acting as an artery between the nation’s east and west. Mykolaiv , a strategically important city on the banks of the Pivdennyi Buh River close to the Black Sea, southern Ukraine, is thought to be resisting despite heavy bombardment.

Russian forces have attacked areas to the south of the city but are yet to establish a firm grip. To its east, the city of Kharkiv - the second largest in the country - has been the scene of brutal fighting. Formerly home to 1.4 million people, the city has become a battlefield. Missiles and bombs are now commonplace and destruction across the city is widespread. At the time of writing, however, it is not thought to have fallen to the invaders, as the battle for Kharkiv rages on. Dozens of civilians have been reported killed, with shelling nightly. Mariupol , a southeastern port city on the coast of the Sea of Azov, is now completely surrounded by Russian forces and is under siege from all angles. Residents report being unable to leave and are subjected to brutal Russian shelling and bombardment. Fears of widespread civilian loss of life have continued to grow, as images of bodies being dumped in mass graves have surfaced online, after more than a week of siege. Some 1,200 have been killed there. The northern city of Chernihiv , close to both the Russian and Belarusian borders, has been under heavy bombardment and the scene of fierce fighting. The southern city of Kherson has fallen to Russian forces, but citizens are continuing to resist what Russian state media has falsely described as ‘liberation’. Russian tanks reached the city within five days Chernobyl , the site of the 1986 nuclear power plant disaster, has also fallen under Russian control. Donetsk and Luhansk , eastern Ukrainian cities that have been the epicentre of the pro-Russian separatist movement since 2014, remain under Russian influence.",47,3.864579820632434,3.3217840306371857,0.5427957899952482,6

Fortunately none of the 330 people inside died during the strike near Oskil, in Kharkiv province, eastern Ukraine. The home suffered extensive damage and it is now without heating, electricity or water. Some of the people staying at the home require wheelchairs, although 63 individuals have been evacuated since the bombing. It comes after three people were killed when Russia bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol. Regional official Oleg Sinegubov wrote on Telegram: ""The enemy today hit a specialised establishment for disabled people near Oskil."" He added that 10 people inside the home needed wheelchairs, while 50 had reduced mobility. Another local official, Yuriy Shparaga, wrote on Facebook : ""The Russians have again carried out a brutal attack against civilians. It is a war crime against civilians. ""There is no more heating, electricity and water access (in the home). Luckily, there are no victims."" The victims include a six-year-old child and at least seventeen others were reportedly injured, some of whom included pregnant women. Sergei Orlov, Mariupol's deputy mayor, said: ""I'm absolutely sure they know about this facility and this is their third hospital that they are destroying in this city."" He said a 300-bed hospital dedicated to treating Covid patients had been destroyed by artillery shelling the previous day, along with a blood-collection centre in Mariupol. ""I'm absolutely sure (these are their) targets,"" Mr Orlov added. The World Health Organization says it's verified at least 18 different attacks on health facilities in Ukraine since the invasion began. Russia insists Ukrainian fighters had moved staff and patients out of the hospital and set up firing positions there. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has accused Russia of committing a war crime. It comes after harrowing satellite footage was released showing the impact constant air attacks have had on the southern port city. Private US satellite firm Maxar has released before and after snaps of Mariupol, which has been surrounded by Kremlin troops amid regular air strikes. Extensive damage is seen to the eastern city's civilian infrastructure, including residential homes, high-rise apartment buildings, supermarkets and shopping centres. Zelensky tweeted out footage of the barbaric attack and once again called out Moscow's atrocities in his country. He said: ""Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings!

Alongside pictures of the pregnant woman after the bombing - on which they emblazoned the word “fake” - the embassy wrote: “The maternity house was long non-operational. “Instead, it was used by [Ukrainian] armed forces and radicals, namely the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion. Russia warned the UN Security Council about this three days ago.” In a follow up tweet they added: “It’s the indeed pregnant [Ukrainian] beauty blogger Marianna Podgurskaya. “She actually played roles of both pregnant women on the photos. “First photos were actually taken by famous propagandist photographer Evgeniy Maloletka, rather than rescuers and witnesses as one would expect.” Evgeniy Maloletka is in fact a photographer for respected news agency the Associated Press.

The tweet was reported by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) and has since been removed with a note in its place saying: ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.""

Speaking at a meeting of Russia ’s Security Council, the move comes just over two weeks after the Kremlin’s bloody rampage began. Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu claimed there were 16,000 volunteers in the Middle East who were ready to come and fight alongside Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas-region of eastern Ukraine. He provided no evidence for the claim but Putin said: ""If you see that there are these people who want of their own accord, not for money, to come to help the people living in Donbas, then we need to give them what they want and help them get to the conflict zone."" Shoigu also proposed that Western-made Javelin and Stinger missiles that had been captured by Russian forces in Ukraine should be handed over to the Donbas forces, along with other deadly weaponry.

Shoigu also claimed that the operation was all going to plan, but US intelligence chiefs told lawmakers that Russia has been left surprised by the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.

2022-03-11,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inept-russian-invasion-tactics-leaving-26448417,'Inept' Russian invasion tactics leave military experts baffled,"Russia’s ""inept"" battle tactics during its invasion of Ukraine have left military experts scratching their heads. A number of experts, analysts and academics have lambasted the approach taken by Putin's forces, who have suffered heavy losses with seemingly clueless attack strategies that have seen them often fail to make meaningful inroads into Ukraine ’s urban centres. One particularly baffling example of seeming ineptitude was highlighted when drone footage yesterday showed a column of Russian tanks being picked off one-by-one in an ambush by Ukrainian forces. Military experts and analysts were questioning how and why the Russian tank commanders allowed themselves to walk straight into a death trap, driving down the middle of a main road. Multiple sources have agreed that so far the number of tanks lost by Putin’s army is so great it exceeds the number owned by the entire German army. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here The devastating artillery attacks in Brovary destroyed a number of Russian T-72 tanks and other vehicles. The ambush added to Moscow’s misery that has been compounded by heavier than expected losse, the onset of freezing temperatures and reported low morale among troops. Reports said that Russia ’s 6th tank regiment escaped with minimal casualties but commander Andrei Zakharov was reportedly killed, sending troops into panic mode and the unit into retreat. Franz-Stefan Gady, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that the fight highlighted the danger of not securing urban territory before advancing. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog He said on Twitter : ""Fight shows the danger of not securing urban terrain with adequate infantry plus recon. assets when main elements of a force pass through urban terrain ideally suitable for ambushes."" Rob Lee, a Senior Fellow and military expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said that the ambush displayed “very poor tactics”. He tweeted: ""Very poor tactics displayed by this Russian armored force so close to Kyiv. They're well within range of Ukrainian artillery in Kyiv, they're on an obvious avenue of approach, and they still decided to bunch up like this, leaving them more vulnerable to indirect fire."" Similarly, the Austrian military’s research and development department proved that the column which was ambushed was a part of a larger Russian Battle Tactical Group. They picked out some key points that led up to the ambush. The large group of Russian vehicles, at least 30 tanks, approached Kyiv on a main road in the north-east suburb of Brovary. Given the size of the column, Ukrainian forces would have known it was coming and would have predicted it would take the route. The Russian commanders could have chosen to take a safer route around the densely built up residential area, but chose to simply push on. Ukraine’s forces used a UAV spotter drone to pick the targets out from above, then began launching strikes from a safe distance. Despite the fact that missiles had already hit the road ahead and fields either side, the forces kept to the main road. The column used soviet-era movements, driving the vehicles bumper to bumper as they entered the chokepoint with houses either side. This meant they had only two escape routes, forwards onto Kyiv, or retreating. Ukrainian artillery brought the column grinding to a halt in the village of Skybyn. The vehicles of the column were too tightly packed to move, leaving the Russians sitting ducks to Ukrainian fire. Drone footage shows artillery strikes narrowly missing the tanks, and one of the BTR-82 armoured carriers received a direct strike and explodes in flames. Another flank was also hit and destroyed. This left the column with no choice but a humiliating defeat, with tanks seen driving north-east away from Kyiv. This was but just one example of the poor tactics employed by the Kremlin’s forces that has turned what they planned to be a lightning invasion into a prolonged war. The true scale of Putin’s losses are unknown but Ukraine has claimed that it has killed over 12,000 troops, destroyed more than 350 tanks, 80 helicopters, 125 artillery units, 1,150 personnel carriers and nearly 60 planes. Military tracking website Oryx uses figures based on visual confirmation has suggested over 1,000 Russian vehicles have been destroyed, damaged, left behind, or captured by Ukraine so far.",7,4.357590872003907,5.181432902225185,-0.8238420302212779,27

Some witnesses say this began on Thursday, with two assaults from the east and west that were blocked. Russian vehicles were also seen stopping in the forests of Lub'yanka and in civilian areas of Ozera which could be an attempt to make them less vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks. While those that remain on the highway north of Ivankiv have been spread out, also making them less vulnerable to Ukrainian bombing attacks and artillery fire. The huge convoy was originally pictured with its tanks close together with fears of an imminent and terrifying attack on the capital. Despite the stalling, the fight for Kyiv is already underway according to officials from the Institute for the Study of War. US intelligence suggests that Russian soldiers have advanced to the west of the city, inching three miles closer to the centre. Tanks are just nine miles away from the central government district compared to 13 miles previously, the Pentagon announced on Thursday. Ukrainians have been fighting every inch of ground since the start of the Russian invasion last Thursday.

The Russian military is now believed to be just three miles from the city's limits, a senior US defence official said. A 40-mile long convoy of Russian tanks has been slowly advancing towards the capital as ambush attempts and shelling have been seen on the outskirts. Russian troops launched two attacks in the area - one in the western city of Irpin and another on the east side of Brovary.

Putin's efforts to surround the capital continued today as more fighting has been reported on the southwest side of Kyiv. A full-scale assault on the Ukrainian capital could be on the horizon as there are fears Putin could launch similar airstrikes as he did on the city of Mariupol and Kharkiv. In Mariupol, a maternity hospital was hit and killed three, including a six-year-old girl. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is still in Kyiv, today said his ""heart breaks at what the occupants have done with our cities, our country, and at what they want to do to our people"",who he said needed ""urgent help"". Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said today that the capital has been turned into a fortress ahead of the Russian assault. He said in televised remarks: ""Every street, every house is being fortified, the territorial defence is joining. ""Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands."" Troops are warning civilians not to stray beyond the outskirts of the city because Russian vehicles had been spotted just a few miles away.

As many as 1,200 have died during a brutal nine-day siege leaving more than 200,000 running out of water and food, desperate for evacuation. Grim images have emerged of a 25 metres long long trench being filled with bodies, wrapped in carpets and sacking. Officials try to dignify the appalling scenes by making the sign of the cross before the remains of friends and neighbours, even relatives are pushed into the hole. Today Russian shelling of the key port city - scene of the barbaric bombing of a hospital’s maternity ward - again smashed hopes of civilians evacuating. A window for 200,000 trapped civilians to start fleeing in a humanitarian convoy was smashed by artillery a day after two adults and a child were killed in the city medical centre. Residents have been cowering under fire, and without power, water or food in the Black Sea port city for days whilst repeated ceasefires” were broken by Russian forces. Mariupol is reeling from the Wednesday horror bombing of the hospital which wounded 18 and amongst the three dead, killed a six year-old girl, sparking global disgust. There are escalating fears Vladimir Putin will order commanders to become more ruthless after he sacked eight generals and is said to be furious with his FSB spy agency. Enraged Putin is said to be angry with the FSB for wrongly advising him that Ukraine was weak and ripe for attack- as his military campaign is proving a disaster. Devastating imagery of Moscow’s tanks has also emerged - with five vehicles being targeted as they are ambushed by Ukraine’s defiant anti-tank teams. It is possible some of the tanks were targeted by drones on the outskirts of Brovary, in the Kyiv region this morning, their crews obliterated. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here Another of Putin’s tanks was left abandoned and in flames in the area as his troops pushed on towards the capital, the latest among hundreds of tanks destroyed. Now it is feared Moscow’s troops are increasingly turning on civilian targets to try and force Ukraine’s troops to stop fighting. Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor said Russian aircraft were targeting routes that humanitarian aid was trying to use to enter the city, and along evacuation routes. He said: “We try and try and try, but I’m not sure if it’ll be possible today - or other days. “Airstrikes started from the early morning. Airstrike after airstrike. All the historic centre is under bombardment.” The bombardment, he said, had continued “without any gaps, without any pause”, hitting houses and buildings. He added: “They want to absolutely delete our city, delete our people. They want to stop any evacuation.” Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Russia was deliberately preventing the evacuation of civilians because it had failed to seize the key port city. Zelenskiy accused Russia of carrying out genocide after officials said Russian aircraft had bombed the hospital in Mariupol, burying patients in rubble and breaking a ceasefire deal. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Moscow would look into the incident. Other Russian officials rejected what they said was “fake news, with one saying the hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian troops. But Zelenskiy said in a televised address: “Like always, they lie confidently.” The Wednesday attack wounded 17 people, including women waiting to give birth, doctors, and children buried in the rubble. Bombs also fell on two hospitals in another city west of the capital. Ukraine’s health minister Viktor Lyashko said Russia has already fired on 63 hospitals in his country, killing five doctors and seriously injuring over ten. In Zhytomyr, a city of 260,000 to the west of Kyiv, bombs fell on two hospitals, one of them a children’s hospital, mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn said on Facebook. Some lightly wounded medical experts had struggled to return to their duties he said. Today it emerged the ground shook more than a mile away when a series of blasts hit the medical facility in Mariupol. Explosions blew out windows and ripped away much of the front of one building. Police and soldiers rushed to the scene to evacuate victims, carrying a bleeding woman with a swollen belly on a stretcher past burning and mangled cars. Another woman wailed as she clutched her child. In the courtyard, a blast crater extended at least two floors deep. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Mariupol strike trapped children and others under debris. Mr Zelensky has urged the West to impose even tougher sanctions in Russia. Britain’s armed forces minister, James Heappey, said the strike “is a war crime” regardless of whether it was deliberate. Two weeks into Russia’s assault on Ukraine, its military is struggling after suffering well-over 12,000 deaths among its 150,000-strong attack force.

The news comes as horrifying pictures of mass graves emerge from the besieged city of Mariupol and reports of a the Russian advance slowing throughout Ukraine. Moscow violated an expected ceasefire on Wednesday, continuing heavy shelling on Mariupol, raising questions about whether the latest announcement of humanitarian corridors will be respected by forces on the ground. The Black Sea port city, home to over 400,000 people, has endured days of intense shelling with aid agencies saying humanitarian help is desperately needed as trapped residents are without food, power or water.

The Prime Minister is the most senior figure yet to sound the alarm after concerns about chemical weapons were voiced over the last 24 hours by Western officials, the US, and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. He told Sky News’ new show Beth Rigby Interviews: “I’ll make you one other prediction by the way, which is the stuff you’re hearing about chemical weapons is straight out of their playbook. “They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or the Americans. “And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of… fake story ready to go. “You’ve seen it in Syria, you saw it even in the UK.” Asked if that is what he expects next, the Prime Minister replied: “I just note that that is what they’re already doing - it’s a cynical, barbaric government I’m afraid”. Earlier Ms Truss said she was ""concerned"" that Vladimir Putin may use chemical weapons in Ukraine and if so it would be a ""grave mistake"". She also branded the bombing of a children's hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol a ""war crime"" The PM and Foreign Secretary's chilling remarks came hours after Western officials expressed ""serious concerns"" that Russia could use chemical weapons. Yesterday an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “We’re seeing some of the disinformation come out of Moscow about non-conventional weapons. “We saw this in Syria, the Russians starting that talk when they or their proxies were about to use those weapons there.” Worries are mounting among allied governments after Moscow was seen “setting the scene” for such an attack. Russia-backed Syria was repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons in the country's bloody war, but Russia vetoed a 2017 UN resolution that would have looked into who was responsible. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found people were exposed to sarin gas in 2017 in the Khan Shaykhun area but did not identify who was responsible. A Russian air strike badly damaged a children's hospital in the besieged Ukraniian port city of Mariupol yesterday, burying patients under rubble and injuring women in labour, Ukraine said. The bombing, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called an ""atrocity,"" took place despite an agreed ceasefire to enable thousands of civilians trapped in the city to escape. The city council said the hospital had been hit several times by an air strike, causing ""colossal"" destruction. In tweets branded ""disinformation"" by Downing Street, Russia's foreign ministry claimed there were no patients at the hospital and it was being used by 'Nazi' Ukrainian forces for battle.

He also raised Putin’s attacks on fleeing civilians and a nuclear power station, saying: “All of these are very red lines we don’t want him to cross, and the sooner we tell him the better. “If you ask me who can tell him, I would guess nations who promised to defend us when we gave up nuclear weapons - these people should tell him. “The United States, United Kingdom, and later on China and France who all joined the memorandum.” The UK has refused to back a no-fly zone, saying it could lead to all-out war between nuclear-armed NATO and nuclear-armed Russia.",47,4.428172536593135,2.7064610672510394,1.7217114693420958,7

Around 16 soldiers have been filmed walking through the devastation and it is not clear from the video whether they are part of a larger convoy. Some of the vehicles have the distinctive “V” sign that is used by the Russians while others are camouflaged and parked near trees in an apparent attempt to hide them. A massive 40 mile-long Russian military convoy has been heading south from the Belarus border but it had ground to a halt apparently due to mechanical problems and a lack of supplies. “It’s bad,” one resident who abandoned Irpin told ITN News. “There’s no water, no electricity, nothing to cook with. Horrible. Our guys are saving us and friends are helping us."" The woman said she had travelled 500 miles from the besieged town of Mariupol to Irpin to help care for her grandchildren in the town. She explained“They (my children) left with the babies but they didn’t manage to come back.” The sighting of the Russians close to the capital comes amid claims that they are “tightening the noose” around Kyiv, by a western official who has predicted “horrific” scenes when they arrive. “I think around Kyiv they are continuing to tighten the noose .. this is definitely not over. They are still set on moving in. It’ll be utterly horrific when they do,” they said, reported The Times.

Russian officials had earlier pledged to halt firing so at least some trapped civilians could escape the port city, where hundreds of thousands have been sheltering without water or power for more than a week. Both sides blamed the other for the failure of the evacuation. ""What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals, is afraid of maternity hospitals, and destroys them?"" Zelenskiy said in a televised address late on Wednesday. Zelenskiy repeated his call for the West to tighten sanctions on Russia ""so that they sit down at the negotiating table and end this brutal war"". The bombing of the children's hospital, he said, was ""proof that a genocide of Ukrainians is taking place"". Ukraine's foreign ministry posted video footage of what it said was the hospital showing holes where windows should have been in a three-storey building. Huge piles of smouldering rubble littered the scene. Among the more than two million refugees to have fled Ukraine, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has said that more than half have been children. At least 37 had been killed and 50 injured, it added. The International Committee of the Red Cross said houses had been destroyed all across Ukraine. ""Hundreds of thousands of people have no food, no water, no heat, no electricity and no medical care,"" it said. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, said: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets."" Russia calls its incursion a ""special operation"" to disarm its neighbour and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis.""",47,2.719999891433311,2.29012727623193,0.429872615201381,9

The missile is seen as one of the deadliest on the modern-day battlefield, so much so its use is strictly regulated. The Russian missiles explode at a much higher temperature than most missiles, and their blasts last longer than conventional weapons. They are fired by the TOS-1A, an armoured rocket launcher, which can be used to destroy infrastructure and due the heat it produces it can cause massive damage to internal organs and cause flash burns. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that previous footage had shown Moscow was using the TOS-1A against Ukraine, and if Putin was to use this against civilians it would be illegal. Sebastian Roblin, a military expert, writing for 19fortyfive.com, said: ""A TOS-1 rocket barrage will wipe out everything within the 200-by-300m blast zone."" According to Military Today, the TOS-1A was adopted by the Russian Army in 2001 and is is capable of launching the deadly thermobaric missiles. Defence and national security commentator Charlie Gao described the weapons as ""are very useful weapons for a military that might be going into urban combat with little regard for collateral damage."" This comes as more and more footage emerges of Russia's remorseless attacks on Ukrainian cities and its people. President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted out a video that showed the aftermath of a Russian bombing of a maternity hospital this afternoon. The hospital complex in Mariupol reportedly had children buried under the rubble according to Zelensky. The footage showed the inside of the maternity hospital reduced to rubble, where walls had been blown out and windows shattered. Nearly two weeks after the invasion began, Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine's cities but has failed to take them, or the capital yet. The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol are all surrounded by Russian forces, and subject to some of the most brutal shelling and missile strikes. However, Ukraine's air defences have had ""considerable success"" according to the Ministry of Defence, aagisnt Russian aircrafts. In the weeks since the invasion began on February 24, millions have been forced to flee their homes in Ukraine, into neighbouring nations and Europe. Of the over two million who have fled, almost 1.3million of these have fled to Poland, Ukraine's closest ally, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as of March 8. Hungary, run by long time anti-migration Viktor Orban, had allowed in 203,222 people. Around 100,000 people had fled to Russia itself, with Slovakia, Moldova and Romania each taking a significant amount of people in. Meanwhile, the UK's efforts to help fleeing Ukrainian have been slammed by man as inadequate. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine?

Mr Zelensky posted footage online showing the damage from what he said was a ""direct strike"" on the hospital, with windows blown out and debris strewn through the corridors.

At least 1,170 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the Russian invasion, according to Ukrainian authorities. The United States says it has seen indications that Russia's military is using so-called ""dumb bombs"" - unguided missiles which greatly increase the risk of missing targets. A senior US defence official told Reuters: ""We do have indications that the Russians are in fact dropping some dumb munitions."" Earlier Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the MPs that the Ministry of Defence was looking at whether they could supply anti-aircraft missiles as well as more anti-tank weapons. In Washington, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the strike was ""absolutely abhorrent"", but continued to reject calls from the government in Kyiv for a no-fly zone. ""The reality is that setting up a no-fly zone would lead to a direct confrontation between Nato and Russia, and that is not what we're looking at,"" she told a joint news conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

The US bombings on Japan killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, mostly civilians. Those strikes 77 years ago, which involved strategic nuclear warheads, remain the only occasions nuclear weapons have been used in war. But there are smaller, tactical nuclear weapons designed for use on battlefields. They aim to devastate enemy targets in a local area but without causing a wider, radioactive fallout. The US and Soviet Union developed tens of thousands of the weapons during the Cold War, including artillery shells, anti-aircraft missiles and anti-tank systems. Using a single, nuclear, tactical battlefield weapon would have the same effect as firing hundreds if not thousands of conventional, non-nuclear missiles and shells. But the fear has always been that a state unleashing a smaller, tactical nuke during conflict would cross a line - potentially triggering a full-scale nuclear clash involving strategic weapons. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here A no-fly zone would entail combat fighter aircraft from a coalition of nations denying Russian aircraft, such as fast jets, drones and helicopters, the use of Ukrainian airspace (or part of it). It would require constant surveillance of an area of airspace to detect any incursions into the zone by hostile aircraft. It would also require the coalition aircraft to intercept any incursions. This means that our aircraft would try to escort enemy aircraft out of the zone or, if they refused or attempted to attack us, try to shoot them down. The UK government has firmly rejected involvement in a no-fly zone, as has the US and the NATO leadership on numerous occasions over the last week or so. If, hypothetically, the UK did commit the RAF to supporting a no-fly zone then ultimately if the Russians refused to comply, which is highly likely, their aircraft would have to be engaged with the intention of shooting them down. Unlike previous no-fly zones in places like Bosnia, Iraq and Libya, coalition aircraft would face a well-equipped opponent, raising the chances of them being shot down as well. If a no-fly zone was enforced, which would be a highly complex operation carrying high levels of risk, then Ukraine could be protected from at least some of the bombing it is encountering from the air. However, much of the terrible destruction being wrought on the civilian population is from ground-based artillery which would not be affected by a no-fly zone. An obvious additional benefit would be to boost the morale of Ukraine’s leadership, military forces and civilian population. The West is concerned that in enforcing a no-fly zone, coalition aircraft would have to shoot down Russian aircraft thus escalating the situation, potentially including the use of nuclear weapons by Putin. Even if Putin doesn’t use them, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is concerned that this would trigger a wider European war. Additionally, Putin’s forces present a different order of capability since they are armed with sophisticated air defence weapons. Finally, if a no-fly zone was established, it would be understandable if the Ukrainian leadership then asked coalition aircraft to assist them further by targeting ground-based artillery, essentially taking the West into full-scale war with Russia. If Putin’s military continues its merciless and horrific bombardment of the civilian population, worsening the humanitarian crises and destroying large swathes of Ukraine, then the public and the media in the West may (will?) continue to ask why we are not doing more to support Ukraine. If Russian forces increase control over Ukraine’s airspace, there will come a point, if it has not already been reached, where it will no longer be militarily possible to establish a no-fly zone.",49,3.5571979565996514,3.538163156401918,0.019034800197733404,7

The bombing, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called an ""atrocity,"" took place despite an agreed ceasefire to enable thousands of civilians trapped in the city to escape. The city council said the hospital had been hit several times by an air strike, causing ""colossal"" destruction. The President tweeted: “Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked by Reuters for comment, said: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets."" Ukraine's Foreign Ministry posted footage of what it said was the hospital showing blasted-out windows and piles of smouldering rubble. The Donetsk region's governor said 17 people were wounded, including women in labour. Boris Johnson tweeted: “There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless. “The UK is exploring more support for Ukraine to defend against airstrikes and we will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes.” Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told MPs the UK has delivered 3,615 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, and is looking at supplying anti-aircraft missiles. But he again resisted calls for NATO jets to enforce a no-fly zone, which could involve shooting down Kremlin planes and sparking a full NATO war with nuclear-armed Russia. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the West would be responsible for what unfolds if it failed to send fighter planes to patrol the skies above the war-torn nation. He said: “Russia uses missiles, aircraft and helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. It is the humanitarian duty of the world to respond.” But, speaking in the Commons, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace ruled out a no-fly zone, saying it could hamper Ukrainian efforts to deal with Russian artillery and missiles. Germany said it will not send warplanes to Ukraine, after the US rejected an offer by Poland to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 jets to Ukraine via a US base in Germany. The plan was plunged into disarray after the White House vetoed an attempt by Warsaw to hand over a fleet of MiG-29s to the Ukrainian air force amid fears it would draw NATO into a direct conflict. Western officials have “serious concerns” the Kremlin could go further and unleash devastating chemical weapons after Moscow was seen “setting the scene” for such an attack. Putin could “flatten Ukraine” despite his war ultimately ending in failure, they also believe. A Western official said: “We’re seeing some of the disinformation come out of Moscow about non-conventional weapons. “We saw this in Syria, the Russians starting that talk when they or their proxies were about to use those weapons there.” Russia-backed Syria was repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons in the country's bloody civil war. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found people were exposed to Sarin gas in 2017 in the Khan Shaykhun area but did not identify who was to blame. But Moscow vetoed a 2017 UN resolution that would have investigated who was responsible. Asked if he feared Putin could deploy tactical nuclear weapons, Armed Forces minister James Heappey told LBC: “It is a possibility but it is a very small possibility, even at this stage”. 1 Shutting off Russian banks’ access to the West, with plan to move to full asset freeze on all Russian banks. 2 Sanctions on Russian central bank and financial institutions, already in effect. 3 Preventing Russian firms and the Russian state raising debt in the UK, already enacted. 4 Asset freeze against individual oligarchs, with 15 so far including Putin and Lavrov and more to come. 5 Targeting key strategic sectors including defence with more planned on services and energy. 6 Blocking access to SWIFT, with UK still pushing for a full SWIFT ban against all Russian banks. 7 Banning Russian planes and ships landing in UK, with new laws next week to put this on longer-term footing. 8 Banning export to Russia of ‘dual-use’ items such as electronics that could be used in military computers or weaponry. 9 Setting a £50,000 limit on wealthy Russians’ deposits in UK bank accounts. 10 Extending the above sanctions to Belarus due to its role supporting the Russian invasion. 11 Extending UK-Crimea total trade embargo to the Luhansk and Donetsk ‘People’s Republics’.

Meanwhile the UK is drawing up plans to take 100,000 Ukrainian children into schools, the Education Secretary has confirmed. Tory minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Question Time: “We’re planning for capacity just for the family reunion group of 100,000 children.” It came as audience members and the Ukrainian ambassador slammed the UK’s response for Ukrainian refugees on the flagship debate show. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former PM of Denmark, said: “It must be possible to do it faster because they’re sitting somewhere, they have nowhere to stay… and half, 40% are children.” A British-Ukrainian audience member draped in his country’s flag said: “I don’t know why you’re creating this logistical problem.” Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the current Tory government had failed refugees “time and time again” after a long and proud history. “In the build up to the Second World War, most of Europe turned their backs on the Jewish people who were trying to flee, and in the wake of that we became a country that took thousands of Ugandan Asians, thousands of Vietnamese boat people, thousands of Cypriots,” he said. He added: “Is it the best of Britain? Is it the best we can do? Of course it’s not.”",47,2.59123600581862,3.339453314403451,-0.7482173085848309,7

In his latest rallying cry, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the West would be responsible for what unfolds if it failed to send fighter planes to patrol the skies above the war-torn nation. Speaking through an interpreter, Mr Zelensky stepped up demands for an NFZ - claiming it would help thwart a “humanitarian catastrophe”. In a TV address, he warned: “From the first day of the Russian invasion, Ukraine keeps telling our partners that if you don’t close the airspace over Ukraine, you will be responsible for Ukrainian people’s deaths too. “Russia uses missiles and bombs to kill our people, to target our infrastructure. “This is a responsibility, a moral duty, of the world to help us.” Germany said it will not send warplanes to Ukraine, after the US rejected an offer by Poland - a NATO member - to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 jets to Ukraine via the Ramstein US base in Germany. Plans for Warsaw’s fighter planes to be given to Kyiv were plunged into disarray after the White House vetoed the proposal. President Joe Biden feared it would draw NATO into a direct conflict with Moscow. But Mr Zelensky fumed: “There is a will to provide fighter jets to Ukraine but there is a problem with logistics. “We have got a war, we don’t have time for all these mediations and discussions, it’s not a ping-pong game. “We are talking about people’s lives. Make this decision quickly - please send us the fighter jets.” Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told MPs the UK has delivered 3,615 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, and will soon supply Javelin anti-tank missiles. But he again resisted calls for NATO jets to enforce a no-fly zone, which could involve shooting down Kremlin planes. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Wallace said a change in Russian tactics meant there was a need to examine how to help Ukrainian forces tackle Putin's air force. ""We can all see the horrific devastation inflicted on civilian areas by Russian artillery and airstrike - indiscriminate and murderous,"" he said. ""It is vital, therefore, that Ukraine maintains its ability to fly and to suppress Russian air attack."" Mr Wallace said that ""in response to a Ukrainian request"" the Government was exploring the donation of Starstreak anti-air missiles. He also confirmed 3,615 “next generation, light, anti-tank weapon” missiles had been supplied - up from the previously-announced figure of 2,000 - and ""small consignments"" of the Javelin system would also be sent. But he ruled out a no-fly zone, saying it could hamper Ukrainian efforts to deal with Russian artillery and missiles. He told MPs: “If you had a no-fly zone, the Russians have a massive advantage with shells and missiles and they would not stop in a no-fly zone, whereas the few things that the Ukrainians have to reach the Russians at depth are in the air and I think you'd actually hamper one."" Downing Street insisted it was ""not tenable"" for NATO pilots and jets to shoot down Russian planes. Western officials drew a distinction between sending anti-aircraft missiles and deploying warplanes, saying anti-aircraft systems could only be used defensively. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met with US counterpart Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan in Washington today to discuss further support for Ukraine. In a speech tomorrow, she will call for an end to the West's ""era of complacency"" over Russia, saying the Ukraine invasion represents a global shift on the scale of 9/11. She will argue the West must never again allow ""such aggression to grow unchecked"" and that it must ""double down"" on the Putin regime now. ""If we let Putin’s expansionism go unchallenged it would send a dangerous message to would-be aggressors and authoritarians around the world,"" she says. Ms Truss will say the UK needs to end its reliance on ""authoritarian"" states for energy - prompting No10 to insist that Saudi Arabia, despite its human rights record, was a valuable ""partner"". The Foreign Secretary rowed back on her comments that Brits could go to Ukraine to fight against the Russian army. “I have been very clear that the travel advice from the UK is not to go to Ukraine,"" she said. “There are better ways of helping the efforts in Ukraine, namely donating to the DEC appeal. ""What I said the other week was expressing support for the Ukrainian cause - they are fighting a just war and we’re doing all we can to support them.” RAF F-35 Lightning II jets were deployed to Estonia’s Ämari airbase to carry out “enhanced vigilance activity” on NATO’s eastern flank, the Ministry of Defence said. It added: “They will provide air policing of NATO airspace, further contributing to the security of Europe.” NATO countries have sent arms and vital military gear to Ukraine as its forces try to repel Russian invaders.

The huge convoy of tanks and vehicles has been stuck on roads positioned around 30 miles from Ukraine ’s capital for several days amid claims of mechanical issues and empty fuel tanks. The weapons of death could become tombs for Russian soldiers in the coming days with conditions set to drop to -10C at night - and even colder with the added windchill factor. Putin’s Moscow fighters are not equipped for severe cold war fighting. Former British Army Major Kevin Price told MailOnline the invaders’ tanks will become “40-ton freezers” for those still inside, which will destroy morale. Glen Grant, a senior defence expert at the Baltic Security Foundation, said the Russians inside the convoy may have to surrender to avoid freezing to death. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog He told Newsweek: “You just can't sit around and wait because if you are in the vehicle you are waiting to be killed. ""They are not stupid."" Reports have been heard of Putin’s troops overheard complaining about the war in calls to family and friends back home. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. While the soldiers shiver in sub-zero conditions, the falling temperatures will also cause a nightmare for Ukraine’s refugees. Forced out of their homes by constant Russian shelling, the plummeting conditions could cause the current humanitarian crisis in the country to worsen still further. Some cities, including Mariupol in the south east, currently have no power, water or heat, leading to fears those still inside their ravaged homes could die without help. Yesterday it was reported a six-year-old girl died from dehydration ""alone, weak, frightened, thirsty"" in the besieged city of Mariupol. Her tragic death came after spending days with no water, power or heating supplies. Last week Russian forces cornered the port city with constant airstrikes, leaving residents without energy and water, with no way to evacuate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the child's death this morning in a video address and officials later said her name was Tanya. Likening the humanitarian crisis linked to Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities to that created by the Nazi invasion during World War Two, he said sadly: “In 2022, from dehydration.” The city's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, later said: “Her mother was killed. We don’t know how long the girl was fighting for her life. ""We can’t imagine how much suffering she had to bear. In the last minutes of her life she was alone, weak, frightened, thirsty.” Sky's weather producer Jo Robinson added: ""Overnight lows of -10C are forecast for parts of the east - especially Kharkiv. ""It could feel like -20C at night with the wind chill. ""The cold will be extensive across Ukraine, but the lowest temperatures seem to be in the east. ""It looks like the cold spell will last into the weekend.""",47,5.3330506197975796,4.268393739889042,1.0646568799085374,8

While not always easy to verify, the imagery shows harrowing first-hand experiences, eyewitness accounts and the raw brutality of war. The first of this scale in Europe since 1945, the war in Ukraine is different due to the huge number of people with smartphones leading to an unprecedented amount of content being published. While so much is deeply upsetting, some of it is rousing, with inspirational accounts of bravery and defiance in the face of a vast and terrifying enemy. We take a look at some of the finest images showing the defiance of the Ukrainian people in the face of the Russian war machine. The marriage of Lesya and Valery warmed hearts around the world. Tying the knot near Kyiv, the couple said 'I do' wearing their military uniforms surrounded by fellow fighters. An image of defiant love, it serves as a reminder of the sheer scale of the sacrifice the people of Ukraine are making to defend their homeland, but is also a sign of hope for a better future. With striking similarities to one of the most famous images of defiance of all time - the Tiananmen Square 'Tank Man' - this act of courage standing in front of an armoured convoy came in one of the first days of the war. Regular people have had their lives completely uprooted by the arrival of the Russian military. The UN reports the confirmed deaths of at least 406 civilians since the fighting began on February 24. The evacuation effort has been huge, with reports claiming around two million people have already fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries. The exodus has required a huge effort, with families making harrowing decisions about what to take and what to leave. So far, the UK has granted just 750 visas to Ukrainian refugees. Vitaliy Skakun Volodymyrovych is thought to have blown up a bridge to prevent the advance of a Russian tank column while he was still on it. He is understood to have sacrificed himself for the defence of his homeland in the early days of the fighting. His sacrifice is not alone, with thousands of Ukrainian troops risking their lives to defend their country. New life seems strange in the face of so much death but the birth of Ivan, a baby boy born in the basement of a perinatal centre in Kyiv, is a sign of hope. Agencies report that he was born to the sound of sirens outside as the war raged all around. He was born on March 2, 2022. Ukrainian citizens have flocked to the defence of their country, with regular people now finding themselves learning how to use a weapon. Seen here, a young woman is given a self-defence crash course on the outskirts of Lviv in western Ukraine. All men aged between 18 and 60 are being asked to stay in the country, and some 60,000 expats have returned to Ukraine to fight in its defence. Self-defence courses have been widespread, with Ukrainian citizens having been told by authorities to make Molotov cocktails. The cocktails, which are effectively bombs, are crude but easy to make weapons that cause burning fuel to spill out over a large area when smashed. The weapon has been recommended as it can be made with things easily found in a non-military environment. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has become a figure of defiance and stoicism. He announced he would not leave Ukraine until the fight was done and has made a string of stirring speeches that have earned him plaudits both inside and outside Ukraine. The last confirmed images from the alleged attack on Snake Island, where some reports claim 13 Ukrainian soldiers lost their lives. Their supposed last words over the radio - “ Russian warship, go f**k yourself ” - have become a rousing message of defiance around the world among protestors marching against Russian aggression. Russia denies that the troops were killed, and instead were captured by the Russian army. Neither side has presented verifiable evidence, yet the iconic line uttered by Ukrainian troops has become a rallying cry nonetheless.",7,4.762861982187115,4.216786412169337,0.546075570017778,10

Guard Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Agarkov died alongside fellow paratrooper colonel Konstantin Zizevsky according an announcement on the personal instagram page of Mikhail Vedernikov, the governor of the Pskov Region. Russian Mikhail Vedernikov said the ""paratrooper officers were killed"" as they ""honourably fulfilled their duty, valiantly and courageously defending the security of our country"". Agarkov had served as chief of staff of the 56th ODSHB in Kamyshin before the unit was deployed to the Crimea.

Both Safronov and Glebov were killed when Ukrainian forces recaptured the city of Chuhuiv. Ukraine says its forces have killed more than 12,000 Russian troops since the start of the deadly invasion on February 24 while Moscow has so far confirmed about 500 losses.

Ben Wallace said the estimated number of Ukrainian civilians killed or injured is more than 1,000 - and warned ""worse is likely to come"". Ukraine is facing ""its darkest hour"" but Britain is proving increased defensive support to the country's forces, he said. In a statement to MPs, he said: ""In response to a Ukrainian request, the Government has taken the decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity manned portable anti-air missiles. ""We believe that this system will remain within the definition of defensive weapons but will allow the Ukrainian force to better defend their skies. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine? Sign up to our World News Bulletin here ""We shall also be increasing the supplies of rations, medical equipment and other non-lethal military aid."" The move would mark a significant step up in military support for Ukraine if it is rubber-stamped by the British Government. The UK has insisted it will not put troops on the ground in Ukraine but, along with NATO allies, it will supply defensive support to President Zelensky's troops. The Defence Secretary stressed the Government is ""bound by the decision to supply defensive systems"" and not escalate the war. Western officials say Russia’s military advance remains “very slow” with “minimal progress” over the last 24 hours - partly due to the Ukrainians’ resistance and partly due to logistical and execution problems with Russian troops. But an official said they remain “very concerned about risk of escalation”, with leaders in the Western Balkans “very tense” and worried about “where Russia might go next”. A Western official added the possibility of the UK giving Ukraine Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles was subject to review with no decisions made so far. Officials drew a distinction between anti-aircraft missiles and sending jets - saying missiles can only be used defensively, not offensively. Mr Wallace told MPs that more than 1,000 Ukrainian civilians are believed to have been killed or injured during the Russian bombardment. He added: ""The true figure is expected to be much higher and I'm afraid worse is likely to come. ""It's for that reason that the UK will increase its funding for Ukraine to £220 million, which includes £120 million of humanitarian aid."" The civilian population in Ukraine is suffering ""horrendous hardships"", with more than 200 schools damaged or destroyed and media showing strikes hitting kindergarten, he said. He warned Russia's military campaign will ""get more brutal and more indiscriminate"" and Vladimir Putin has ratcheted up threats against allies of Ukraine. ""But it is my firm belief that our strength to stand up to such bullying comes from our alliances,"" Mr Wallace said. ""We should take strength from the peoples right across Europe who are standing shoulder to shoulder to protect our values, our freedom, our tolerance, our democracy and our free press. That is our shield.""",49,3.539176283413847,5.4291951635130244,-1.8900188800991775,7
2022-03-09,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/inside-apocalyptic-mariupol-childrens-hospital-26426383,Horror attack on maternity hospital leaves children 'trapped under wreckage',"Children have reportedly been trapped under the wreckage after the Russian bombing of a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the country's president Volodymyr Zelensky has said. He shared harrowing footage of the aftermath of the ruthless bombing of the facility with early indications suggesting 17 people have been wounded by the attack. Members of staff and women in labour were among those wounded, officials say. The cameraman is forced to pick their way through the remains, and what's left of flowers can be seen on tables, as walls have been blown out and windows destroyed. Tweeting out the video, Zelensky once again called out Russian atrocities as they continue a barbaric campaign targeting civilians and the vulnerable left in warn-torn Ukraine. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog He said: ""Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity."" The clip shows one building totally destroyed and another badly damaged as wounded patients swiftly evacuate. Children are reportedly buried under rubble after the Russian airstrike but it was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: ""There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless. The UK is exploring more support for Ukraine to defend against airstrikes and we will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes."" Mariupol city council earlier said in a Facebook post that a children’s hospital had been destroyed. ""The destruction is colossal,"" the post read. ""The building of the medical facility where the children were treated recently is completely destroyed. Information on casualties is being clarified."" The battered port city's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov, told the BBC: ""We don't understand how it is possible in modern life to bomb children's hospital."" He says people in Mariupol who managed to escape the hospital are in ""total anger"" and ""cannot believe it is true"". Liz Truss called Russia's attack on maternity and children's hospital 'abhorrent, reckless and appalling'. But the Foreign Secretary ruled out a no fly zone in response to Zelensky's calls, saying the best way to 'protect the skies' is to continue to supply aid to Ukraine. Hours earlier, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that 3,000 babies were without food or medicine. He said the infants could die and begged for for a humanitarian corridor to allow them to leave. At least 516 civilians have been killed since Russia began its invasion on February 24, the UN human rights office has said. Bodies heartbreakingly lie scattered in the streets of Mariupol as Russia continues to bombard the besieged Ukrainian city. The Red Cross say the humanitarian crisis in Mariupol is 'apocalyptic' and worsening by the hour. Hundreds of thousands of residents have been forced to shelter for nearly ten days without water or power. Now experts say we are we starting to see the full impact of Russia's deadly invasion. In what has been called a vision of the future for every city in the war-torn country, the dead are left abandoned more than a week after fighting broke out. Red Cross spokeswoman Ewan Watson said: ""This situation is really apocalyptic for people, it is getting worse, they are running out of essential supplies. “We’ve depleted our stocks. As I said, it stands to reason that people are coming to the end of whatever supplies they had.” Today, Mariupol City Council say another Russian bombing has completely destroyed a children's hospital in the city. More than 2 million refugees have fled their homes into neighbouring countries after Vladimir Putin launched his invasion 14 days ago. Ukraine will continue its attempt to evacuate civilians along safe routes agreed with Moscow, the country’s deputy prime minister last night stated. Iryna Vereshchuk confirmed Ukrainian forces would hold their fire during a 12-hour window from 9am until 9pm local time on Wednesday. She appealed to Russian forces to stick to their “official public commitment” and do the same. Authorities state the routes should allow civilians from Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha to leave. Respected war author Tomi Ahonen says we are now starting to really see Putin's methods - the twisted butchering of civilians deliberately to flex his muscle. He tweeted: ""It is a cruel psychological warfare method, designed to crush hope. To defeat a NATION. Putin creates horrible pressure to the citizens of Mariupol. Then offers them hope. And then DESTROYS that hope. And repeat, and repeat, and repeat. Pure evil."" Later, he added: ""Putin intends to do this to EVERY city he captures, crush all those people in the same way. If they get out alive, their psychological damage is likely to never be fixed. ""He is committing war crimes in front of our eyes, & he doesn't care."" It comes after a girl, six, died from dehydration ""alone, weak, frightened, thirsty"" in Mariupol yesterday after spending days with no water, power, or heating supplies.

Local journalist Oleksiy Sorokin wrote: ""Russia began an attack on Mariupol from the road meant to be used as a humanitarian corridor. ""The road was prior cleared from mines and barbed wire to allow civilians to leave."" It comes as Ukrainians boarded buses to flee the besieged eastern city of Sumy on Tuesday, the first evacuation from a Ukrainian city through a humanitarian corridor agreed with Russia. A separate convoy of 30 buses was also headed to Mariupol to evacuate residents from that southern port, which has been encircled without food, water, power or heat and subjected to relentless bombardment for a week. There have so far been three failed attempts to evacuate desperate people from ruined cities in the last few days as Russian generals continued to fire their guns despite agreeing to stop for several hours. The Red Cross revealed several of the deadly weapons were found on evacuation routes which were to be used by people fleeing to safety. Over the weekend two ceasefire agreements broke down as Ukrainians were leaving, forcing many to return to homes as Russian shells began to rain down. President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously warned to hunt down those who shot at evacuees in his country, saying in a public address: ""A man, a woman and two children.

Last week Russian forces cornered the port city with constant airstrikes, leaving residents without energy and water, with no way to evacuate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the child's death this morning in a video address and officials later said her name was Tanya. ""In 2022, from dehydration,"" he said, likening the humanitarian crisis linked to Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities to that created by the Nazi invasion during World War Two. The city's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, later said: “Her mother was killed. We don’t know how long the girl was fighting for her life. ""We can’t imagine how much suffering she had to bear. In the last minutes of her life she was alone, weak, frightened, thirsty.” He said the child's death was “one of many tragic stories of Mariupol, the city surviving in a blockade for the past eight days”. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog Mr Boychenko said: “Russian invaders have cynically left the city of half a million without water, light, heat and communications. All routes into the city are blocked. All efforts to deliver food and medicine to the residents of the city were blocked by the Russian army.” His statement said the girl had no water, electricity, heating or mobile connection and accuses Russian forces of blocking evacuation & humanitarian deliveries. Mariupol's council last week said in a statement that Russian forces were: ""breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade, as in the old Leningrad"". ""Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying [Mariupol's] critical life-support infrastructure. ""We have no light, water or heat again,"" it added. ""Mariupol remains under fire. Women, children and the elderly are suffering. We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" the statement concluded. The city is home to an estimated 400,000 and is a key target for Russia as its capture would allow Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine to join troops in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed in 2014. The opening of humanitarian corridors have come as a ray of hope for Ukrainians trapped by fighting since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Thirty buses are currently en route to the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol to collect evacuees via a humanitarian corridor to Ukraine-controlled territory, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on television on Tuesday. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbour and arrest leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis"". It denies targeting civilians.

A humanitarian corridor is designed as a demilitarised zone that would allow people out safely, with the aim of reducing the number of civilians killed or wounded by attacks on cities. They are set up as a way of reducing civilian casualties during war. The corridors would effectively be a safe route where Russian forces would hold fire, an idea first requested by French President Emmanuel Macron, according to the Interfax news agency. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the first convoy would start at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) from the city of Sumy. The convoy will be followed by the local population in personal vehicles,"" she said in a televised statement. The Ukrainian authorities have also announced that people living in areas particularly badly impacted by war can apply for a relief payment of 6500 UAH (£165). The first images of the effort to get civilians out of the bombarded city of Sumy have been shared online this morning. Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation."" The United Nations (UN) has reported that around 1.5 million people have fled the country since the invasion started. However, many more people are believed to be trapped by the violence. Russia proposed giving the residents of Sumy, in northeastern Ukraine, and Mariupol, a southern port city, the choice of moving elsewhere in Ukraine on Tuesday, Russian news agencies reported. Other humanitarian corridors proposed by Russia would travel through Russia or Belarus, something Ukrainian authorities have previously rejected.

Several high ranking Russians have been killed so far in Ukraine, including Colonel Konstantin Zizevsky of the 247th Air Assault Regiment and Air Assault Brigade Lieutenant Colonel Denis Glebov. The statement also suggested there were “significant problems” with communication in the Russian army. It follows suggestions generals have been moved to the frontline owing to issues getting through to their officers on the fields. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. Putin previously confirmed the death of Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army, during a speech. Ukraine says its forces have killed more than 11,000 Russian troops since the start of the deadly invasion on February 24 while Moscow has so far confirmed about 500 losses. Neither side has divulged Ukrainian losses. It comes as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is preparing to speak to MPs later today about the Russian invasion while Boris Johnson continues to encourage Western leaders to punish Russia for the invasion. Zelensky will address the House of Commons at 5pm by video link after Speaker Lindsay Hoyle approved a request for a ""historic address"". Last night the Ministry of Defence said Russia continued to target civilian evacuation corridors in Ukraine. The latest intelligence update said: ""Russia continues to directly target evacuation corridors, resulting in the death of several civilians whilst trying to evacuate Irpin.

And tragically it is a similar scene that is repeated across Ukraine as people queue desperately for trains to leave the shelling and the deepening humanitarian crisis. So far the UN has said that 1.7 million refugees have left the country in less than two weeks since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine and it is reported that it could rise to over 5 million in the coming weeks. Others hide in shelters fearing the bombs while food and water runs out and electricity and other energy supplies have been cut in many areas. Sieges and bombings have continued as Ukraine rejected possible humanitarian corridors to Russia and Belarus, but said some limited progress had been made on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians. In the city of Irpin, on the northwest edge of Kyiv, fleeing residents ran with their young children in strollers, or cradling babies in arms, while others carried pet carriers, plastic bags and suitcases. ""It's like a disaster, the city is almost ruined, and the district where I'm living, it's like there are no houses which were not bombed,"" said one young mother, holding a baby beneath a blanket, while her daughter stood by her side. ""Yesterday was the hardest bombing, and the lights and sound is so scary, and the whole building is shaking."" Besides corridors to Russia, Moscow has proposed giving the residents of the Ukrainian cities of Sumy and Mariupol the choice of moving elsewhere in Ukraine, setting a deadline in the early hours for Kyiv to agree, Russian news agencies reported. After the third attempt to ease the bloodshed at talks in Belarus, a Ukrainian negotiator said that although small progress on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians had been made, things remained largely unchanged. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters that Moscow would halt operations if Ukraine ceased fighting, amended its constitution to declare neutrality, and recognised Russia's annexation of Crimea and the independence of regions held by Russian-backed separatists. On the failed humanitarian corridors so far, Dominik Stillhart, of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the BBC : ""So far we have seen, unfortunately, only agreements in principle. ""But they have immediately broken down because they lack precision. They lack the kind of... agreements over times, over roads, over whether people can go out or goods can come in. ""We have a team in Mariupol on the ground. They were ready on Sunday, despite the fact that it was not entirely clear what exactly the agreement was. As soon as they reached the first checkpoint, they realised that the road that was indicated to them was actually mined."" Meanwhile a British-Ukrainian is helping to evacuate refugees across the Polish border using a London black cab saying he is ""doing everything he can"". Roman Tymchyshyn, 31, has already transported around 80 people including pregnant women, disabled elderly people, children and even a nine-month-old baby. He began driving refugees in his black cab across the Polish border on February 28, and has since racked up around 2,169 miles - which is around 300 miles a day. ""My employer is very generous and has allowed me one month's paid leave so I relocated to Ukraine mainly to help people evacuate,"" Mr Tymchyshyn said. ""Until they cross the border or reach their final destination the passengers feel frightened but they are sometimes more relaxed when they are gathered together with different families as I form groups of random people. ""They discuss their stories and cry together about the losses or talk about their family members who have been split up."" Mr Tymchyshyn, who is from Lviv, western Ukraine, travelled back to his birth country with his wife Ulyana Vovk from their home in Portadown, Northern Ireland, after war broke out almost a fortnight ago. After another day of fighting, a Russian strike on a bread factory killed 13 in the town of Makariv in the Kyiv region, Ukrainian officials said, while Russia denies targeting civilians. In the encircled southern port city of Mariupol, hundreds of thousands of people remained trapped without food and water under regular bombardments. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, police said the death toll from the Russian bombardment was 143 since the start of the invasion.

2022-03-08,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-tank-caught-graphic-footage-26415984,Russian tank caught on camera blowing up civilian car killing couple inside,"Horrifying video footage captures the moment a Russian tank opened fire on a civilian car, killing the elderly couple inside. It comes amid fresh calls for the war crimes prosecution of Russian troops, com­­manders and President Vladimir Putin over the targeting ­of civilians. Footage of the incident, seemingly captured by a CCTV camera on the outside of a building, shows a maroon sedan driving into the bottom left corner of the frame, before abruptly stopping. A moment later, a tank careens around the corner toward the sedan and gunshots appear to strike the grassy area beside the road as it curves into the distance. Grey smoke rises above the area between the two vehicles. The tank slows as it continues around the corner before more gunshots are fired directly at the civilian car. It is momentarily shrouded by smoke, which then clears to reveal a shelled car; the bonnet destroyed and the windows shattered. Yet another round of gunfire strikes the left hand side of the car, causing it to jerk back. Pieces of the car fly off and onto the road. Meanwhile, the Russian tank slowly turns around before driving back in the direction it came from. The video, posted by @ArmedForcesUkr, is tweeted with the caption: “Shooting of a civilian car with people. Russian invaders!” Another clip posted to Twitter by a woman named Anastasia Horoshchak, who claims to be a Russian citizen, captured a man walking around the battered car while speaking in Ukrainian. Close-up footage of the car showed the extent of the damage; little glass is left where the windows once were and the bonnet and shell of the doors have been blown off to reveal the mechanics underneath. The man opens the doors to reveal an elderly man in the driver’s seat, with an elderly woman beside him, her head having drooped to rest on his shoulder. Bloody holes can be seen on the man’s body where the gunshots have struck him. On what remains of the windscreen, a yellow disability sticker can be seen. The caption accompanying the video said: “They shot a car with a sign of disability. “Two retirees going home. “Russian peace looks like this???” A tweet from the Kyiv Independent this afternoon said war crimes like those captured in the video were “part of Russia ’s deliberate strategy”. “Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter that Russia holds 300,000 civilians hostage in Mariupol, a city in Donetsk Oblast, and prevents humanitarian evacuation despite agreements with the Red Cross mediation,” it continued. In a video address from an undisclosed location, President Volodymyr Zelensky said a child had died of dehydration in the blockaded southern port of Mariupol, in a sign of how desperate the city's population has become. He pleaded again with western countries to provide air support. He said evacuation buses have been sent to Mariupol, but there was no firm agreement on the route, so ""Russian troops can simply shoot on this transport on the way"". Mr Zelensky accused the International Red Cross of ""forbidding the use of its emblem on our cars"", but did not give details. Buses shown heading out of the city of Sumy and towards Mariupol had signs with a red cross on the side but it is not clear who pasted them there.",47,3.4606925504824644,4.129777057488064,-0.6690845070055995,28
2022-03-08,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-russian-aircrafts-banned-entering-26419672,All Russian aircrafts banned from entering UK air space - or risk being detained,"All Russian aircrafts and jets have been banned from entering UK air space - and can now be detained and have their passengers arrested if they do so. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced the latest salvo action against Russia this evening after he promised: ""We will suffocate Putin's cronies’ ability to continue living as normal while thousands of innocent people die."" In a letter, he wrote: “Russia’s assault on Ukraine is an unprovoked, premeditated attack against a sovereign democratic state. “The UK government has shown there would be massive consequences and a severe cost for any Russian military incursion into Ukraine.” It went on to confirm that the government does not consider it “appropriate” to allow any Russian aircraft to enter UK air space. From February 25, there has been laws preventing Russian aircrafts entering UK air space, but the new move now attaches them to other sanctions already passed by the government, and the criminal offences in response to breaching them. So now, any aircraft registered in Russia, owned by a Russian or a person connected to Russia, or any linked to individuals designated in the sanctions is slapped with the ban. From 5pm this evening, air traffic control could direct Russian crafts to not enter UK air space, and even go a step further, detaining any who break the rules. This ban could affect oligarchs like Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich whose private jets may be refused entry into the country. This comes as the government earlier announced it would ban Russian oil imports by the end of this year. However, the ban would not stretch to gas too. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the transition would ""give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports - which make up 8% of UK demand"". However, the Conservative government did not say if the UK would wean itself off Russian gas as energy costs continue to spiral. Officials insisted Russian gas makes up less than 4% of the UK supply. But, US President Joe Biden went a step further and banned Russian oil and gas imports this afternoon. The move came on the same day Ukrainian president Volodymr Zelensky made a historic address to the House of Commons. He praised Boris Johnson but continued demands for a no-fly zone, and said: ""We will fight to the end."" Zelensky received a standing ovation during his address via video link in which he echoed Winston Churchil and William Shakespeare. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. He listed a devastating day-by-day rundown of Russia's actions in its invasion of Ukraine, from killing 50 children to bombing hospitals and leaving those in Mariupol running out of food. He closed by saying: ""The question for us now is to be or not to be - the Shakespearean question. For 13 days this question could have been asked but now I can get you a definitive answer. It’s definitely yes, to be."" Zelensky has survived three assassination attempts and gave his address live from Ukraine, where it was strictly time-limited to prevent Russians tracking his signal.",47,4.837630053429255,5.277304320246517,-0.4396742668172626,8
2022-03-08,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/nine-russian-generals-killed-war-26417757,Nine Russian generals killed in war as leaked report brands invasion a 'failure',"Nine of Vladimir Putin’s military commanders have been wiped out so far in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The commanders are among the 12,000 Russian troops Ukraine now claims it has killed. It comes as one Kremlin official reportedly described the campaign to subdue the nation as a ""clusterf***"". Major General Vitaly Gerasimov has reportedly been killed in fighting outside Ukraine’s second largest city Kharkiv. The Chief Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine's defence ministry said in a statement Major Gerasimov was killed on Monday, along with several other officers. The Kremlin has not commented on the reports. Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, is the second of Putin’s generals to die in the invasion after Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was taken out by a sniper. The statement read: “Another loss among the senior command staff of the occupying army. “During the fighting near Kharkiv, Vitaly Gerasimov, a Russian military leader, major general, chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 41st Army of the Central Military District of Russia, was killed. ""A number of senior Russian army officers were also killed and wounded."" According to The Sun Online reports, Gerasimov had been awarded a medal for ""capturing"" the disputed province of Crimea in 2014. He had also received medals after leading troops in Syria and through the second Chechen war. Several other top commanders have been killed in recent fighting in Ukraine, including Colonel Konstantin Zizevsky of the 247th Air Assault Regiment and Air Assault Brigade Lieutenant Colonel Denis Glebov. The statement also suggested there were “significant problems” with communication in the Russian army. Putin previously confirmed the death of Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian 7th Airborne Division and a deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army, during a speech. Both Safronov and Glebov were killed when Ukrainian forces recaptured the city of Chuhuiv. Zizevsky was killed in the south of Ukraine. Prior to their deaths, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was killed by a Ukrainian sniper during the fighting for Hostomel Airfield. General Magomed Tushaev died when his Chechen special forces column was obliterated near Hostomel, north-east of the city. Warlord Vladimir Zhonga is also among the dead. Zhonga led the Sparta Battalion, a Neo-Nazi military unit that boasted the backing of the Kremlin. Ukraine says its forces have killed more than 12,000 Russian troops since the start of the deadly invasion on February 24 while Moscow has so far confirmed about 500 losses. Neither side has divulged Ukrainian losses. Today Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to MPs about the Russian invasion while Boris Johnson continues to encourage Western leaders to punish Russia for the invasion. Zelensky received a standing ovation at the House of Commons after Speaker Lindsay Hoyle approved a request for a ""historic address"". Last night the Ministry of Defence said Russia continued to target civilian evacuation corridors in Ukraine. The latest intelligence update said: ""Russia continues to directly target evacuation corridors, resulting in the death of several civilians whilst trying to evacuate Irpin. ""Due to heavy fighting in the town, it has reportedly been without heat, water or electricity for days."" Attempts to evacuate besieged towns and cities in Ukraine have so far failed owing to continuous Russian shelling at would-be evacuees.",7,5.611138218595382,5.9660450098935955,-0.35490679129821334,22
2022-03-08,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-invasion-ukraine-slows-significantly-26419304,Russia invasion 'faltering' fuelling fears civilians being deliberately targeted,"Russia's bloody invasion of Ukraine appeared to falter tonight amid escalating fears Moscow’s troops are deliberately resorting to targeting civilians. Ukraine says 2,000 civilians have been killed and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned of “credible reports of civilians coming under fire ”. It emerged that Russia had bombed a humanitarian convoy in Mariupol and stricken Sumy civilians again came under fire from artillery that killed 21 non-combatants, including two children. By day 13 of Vladimir Putin ’s invasion, Stoltenberg said 38 children had been killed in the fighting, 200 schools destroyed, along with 34 hospitals and 1,500 residential homes. It is feared many more children have been killed by Russian forces. Ukraine claims Moscow has lost more than 12,000 troops in fighting, a staggering 303 tanks, 48 warplanes, 80 helicopters and over 1,000 armoured personnel carriers. Demands for ways to safely evacuate civilians have surged along with intensifying shelling by Russian forces, who have advanced in southern Ukraine but stalled in some other regions. Military sources on the ground have told the Mirror Russian forces may have reached a critical mass point where they may have lost critical momentum and could lose. They have lost their second very senior officer Major General Vitaly Gerimov, 45, in ferocious fighting near the stricken city of Kharkiv, east Ukraine, a major blow to Moscow. Russia is also falling back on recruiting Syrian troops to backfill their invasion, it is believed, sparking fears Ukraine could become a country beset by proxy battles for years. One said: “It is beginning to feel like Russian forces have started flailing about and are becoming increasingly desperate. “They are throwing increasingly long-range missiles at cities, hitting civilians, because they just don’t seem to know what next to do. “They have lost so many air assets to Ukraine’s troops and now they are trying to get into cities - which hugely boosts the need for a higher number of troops. “The attacks just are not coordinated and there are increasing reports of desertions and people being taken prisoner.” Efforts to put in place ceasefires along humanitarian corridors have repeatedly failed amid Russian shelling. Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said as well as killing 38 children Russia had also wounded over 70. The situation is becoming increasingly untenable in the city of Mariupol, which is without water, heat, sanitary systems or phones. Mariupol’s capture could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. An estimated 200,000 people - nearly half the population of 430,000 - hope to flee the port city. Ukraine was also tonight making arrangements to get people out of the suburb of Irpin, although it was not clear if that would be along with one of the five official corridors the Russians promised. Ukrainian officials had pushed back on the proposals as several of the routes would funnel people into Russia or its ally Belarus, which was a launchpad for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the expansion of humanitarian corridors, and more support from the Red Cross, adding that a Mariupol child had died from dehydration. In a video address from an undisclosed location, he said a child had died of dehydration in Mariupol, in a sign of how desperate the city's population has become. He said there was no firm agreement on the route out of Mariupol, so ""Russian troops can simply shoot on this transport on the way"". The president again pleaded for air support from western countries. A senior US official said multiple countries were discussing whether to provide warplanes to Ukraine. Ukraine's armed forces HQ said in a statement that Ukrainian troops are continuing defence operations in the suburbs of Mariupol. The general staff said ""demoralised"" Russian forces are looting in places they have occupied, commandeering civilian buildings like farm hangars for military equipment. Ukrainian defence forces were also involved in operations in Chernihiv and the outskirts of Kyiv, the general staff said. In Kyiv, soldiers and volunteers have built hundreds of checkpoints to protect the city of nearly four million, with sandbags, tyres and spiked cables. Some barricades looked significant, with heavy concrete slabs and sandbags piled more than two storeys high, while others appeared more haphazard, books used to weigh down stacks of tyres. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said: ""Every house, every street, every checkpoint, we will fight to the death if necessary.” It also emerged drunken Russian soldiers shot dead a ten-year-old girl in a village near Kyiv. Anastasia Stoluk died in Shybene, 40 miles north of Kyiv, on February 28, her cousin Anya Stoluk, 18, said. The soldiers refused to allow Nastya's mother, Luba, to go to the cemetery so she was buried in the yard, Anya added. Anya's adoptive mother Vera Dmitrien- ko, 40, said: ""People say that the soldiers just got so bored. They looted all the stores, of course they got a lot of alcohol ... and got drunk and started shooting. “They shot into Nastya's house, she was there with her uncle, and she died immediately. Her uncle was taken to hospital and we still don't have any information from him."" Dmitrienko said soldiers had started shooting after a Ukrainian teenage boy found a gun and fired it in the air. ""The soldiers heard it but since they were so drunk they didn't know where it was from so they just started shooting everywhere they could see. “They shot in four houses and in one of those houses was Nastya,"" she said.",47,3.699027911096588,2.978476248920085,0.7205516621765029,9
2022-03-07,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-humanitarian-corridor-russia-offers-26403534,Putin's humanitarian corridors come under fire for leading to Russia and Belarus,"As the horrific plight of the Ukrainian people continues following the Russian invasion of their homeland, attention has turned to how those fleeing can get out of the country. Russia has come under increasing accusations, including from Ukraine, that its forces have been firing on non-military targets sparking fears about the danger posed to Ukrainian citizens. The United Nations (UN) has reported that around 1.5 million people have fled the country since the invasion started. However, many more people are believed to be trapped by the violence. On March 7, 2022, Russia announced it would be opening ‘humanitarian corridors’ that would allow civilians to flee the violence safely - but what are humanitarian corridors and how has the offer been received by Ukraine and the west? A humanitarian corridor is designed as a demilitarised zone that would allow people out safely, with the aim of reducing the number of civilians killed or wounded by attacks on cities. They are set up as a way of reducing civilian casualties during war. Civilians have been trapped by Russian bombardment, Reuters reports. The corridors would allow a specific, safe route for them out of besieged positions. The corridors would effectively be a safe route where Russian forces would hold fire, an idea first requested by French President Emmanuel Macron, according to the Interfax news agency. The latest offer from Russia includes a corridor from the city of Mariupol, where Reuters report hundreds of thousands have been trapped without food or water and unable to evacuate people wounded by the fighting. The corridors would be opened from the cities of Mariupol, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Sumy. However, the corridors have caused alarm because, according to maps published by the RIA news agency and seen by Reuters, they only lead to two places: Russia and Belarus. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky branded the move as “completely immoral” and blamed Russia for trying to ""use people's suffering to create a television picture"". They added: ""They are citizens of Ukraine, they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine"". ""This is one of the problems that is causing the humanitarian corridors to break down. They seem to agree to them, but they themselves want to supply humanitarian aid for a picture on TV, and want the corridors to lead in their direction."" Speaking on BBC Breakfast The Europe Minister, James Cleverly, said the offer was “cynical beyond belief”, criticising the corridors as ""routes into the arms of the country that is currently destroying yours"".",47,3.4607351096350123,4.009838026616847,-0.5491029169818344,29

Ahead of peace talks this afternoon, a spokesperson for the Russian government outlined what Vladimir Putin wants from the invasion. They said that Russia would ""continue with the demilitarisation of Ukraine"", suggesting the country's army would have be dissolved or reduced significantly for the Kremlin to call the war off. Another demand is that Crimea, which Russian took by force last decade, is recognised by Volodymyr Zelensky's government. The Kremlin also wants Donetsk and Lugansk, where intense fighting has raged between Russian backed separatists and Ukrainian forces for eight years, to officially become independent states. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog Russia's further demands include Ukraine changing its constitution so that it cannot join Nato. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc. ""This is possible only by making changes to the constitution. ""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. ""But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot."" On the topic of the separatist regions, he added: ""This is not us seizing Lugansk and Donetsk from Ukraine. ""Donetsk and Lugansk don't want to be part of Ukraine. But it doesn't mean they should be destroyed as a result. ""For the rest. Ukraine is an independent state that will live as it wants, but under conditions of neutrality."" In the run-up to the Russian invasion, Ukraine repeatedly and emphatically denied Moscow's assertions that it was about to mount an offensive to take back the separatist regions by force. Peskov said the situation in Ukraine had posed a much greater threat to Russia's security than it had in 2014, when Russia had also amassed 150,000 troops at its border with Ukraine, prompting fears of a Russian invasion, but had limited its action to the annexation of Crimea. ""Since then the situation has worsened for us. In 2014, they began supplying weapons to Ukraine and preparing the army for NATO, bringing it in line with NATO standards,"" he said. ""In the end what tipped the balance was the lives of these 3 million people in Donbass. We understood they would be attacked."" While the demands are unlikely to be met - particularly that relating to Ukraine's armed forces - the announcement offers clarity as to what the Russians wants from the invasion, which is now in its 12th day. It has been made two hours before the third round of negotiations are due to begin in the Belarusian city of Brest. The first failed to produce any agreements while the second led to a commitment to produce humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from built up areas. When these corridors were enacted on Saturday and Sunday the Russian forces continued shelling, forcing Ukrainians to run for their lives. One shell strike in Irpin on the outskirts of Kyiv caused the deaths of eight people, including four members of the same family. The speed with which the agreement was cast aside may leave the Ukrainian negotiating team wary of trusting a Russian offer of peace. Today Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba agreed to meet at a forum in southern Turkey on Thursday, the first potential talks between the top diplomats since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu made the announcement in brief remarks to media on Monday, adding he would attend the meeting in the resort city of Antalya. NATO member Turkey, which shares a maritime border with Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea, has been offering to host talks. Ankara has good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv, and has Russia's invasion unacceptable even as it opposes sanctions against Moscow.",4,3.652257319421843,3.524387736674122,0.12786958274772076,25

Over the weekend two ceasefire agreements broke down as Ukrainians were leaving, forcing many to return to homes as Russian shells began to rain down. In one incident which has triggered outrage and widespread condemnation, three members of a fleeing family were killed in a strike as they made their way towards safety. This morning, for a third time, humanitarian corridors have been reopened, potentially offering people a safe passage away from built-up areas. According to various Russian state media outlets all citing Russia ’s defence ministry, the corridors are being set up at the personal request of French President Emmanuel Macron - the French government have denied this. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog They will be opened from the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Sumy, and some appear to involve the evacuation of Ukrainian civilians to Russian cities and Belarus. According to routes published by the RIA Novosti news agency, the corridor from Kyiv will lead to Belarus, which has allied with Russia and allowed troops to gather there prior to the invasion. Civilians who are seeking to flee Kharkiv will only have one corridor leading to Russia. A spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the routes ""completely immoral"" and said Russia was trying to ""use people's suffering to create a television picture"". ""They are citizens of Ukraine, they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine,"" the spokesperson told Reuters. Dominik Stillhart, director of operations for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), explained what has been going wrong with so-called humanitarian corridors. He said both sides had been talking ""for days"", but problems remained confirming the detail of any ceasefire agreement - to allow civilians out of bombarded cities. Stillhart said the challenge was to get the two parties to an agreement that is ""concrete, actionable and precise"". He added that so far there had only been agreements ""in principle"", which had immediately broken down because they lacked precision, regarding routes and who can use them. Illustrating his point, he said some ICRC staff had tried to get out of Mariupol along an agreed route on Sunday, but soon realised ""the road indicated to them was actually mined"". ""That is why it is so important that the two parties have a precise agreement for us then to be able to facilitate it on the ground."" The routes discussed today, which will take Ukrainians in the opposite direction to the vast majority of refugees who are fleeing west, have been criticised by the UK's Europe Minister James Cleverly. He said Russia's latest offer of a ceasefire and an escape route for civilians was ""cynical beyond belief"". Mr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast: ""There is a view that Vladimir Putin believed there was a widespread desire of Ukrainians to be closer to Russia, to be more Russian. ""I think that has been proven to be a complete nonsense by the circumstances we are seeing. ""Providing evacuation routes into the arms of the country that is currently destroying yours is a nonsense."" He added that ""ultimately the most humanitarian thing the Russians could do is end this completely illegal, completely unjustified invasion of Ukraine "". A spokesman for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia's proposal on humanitarian corridors taking refugees to Belarus or Russia was ""completely immoral"". ""This is a completely immoral story. People's suffering is used to create the desired television picture,"" the spokesman said. ""These are citizens of Ukraine, they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine.

In a fiery address on Sunday, Volodymyr Zelensky promised a day of judgement after the deaths of evacuating Ukrainians. The Ukrainian leader spoke following the tragedy in Irpin, where four members of one family were killed when missiles struck. Eight died in the attack overall, including a woman, her teenage son and a primary school-age daughter, plus a family friend. They had been moving down a humanitarian corridor in search of safety before the invading forces broke the ceasefire agreement. “They were just trying to get out of town,"" Zelensky said in a video message. Follow all today's latest updates on the conflict with our live blog ""To escape. The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine. We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war.” Addressing those responsible, he added: “There will be no quiet place on this earth for you. Except for the grave.” “It’s murder, deliberate murder. Instead of humanitarian corridors, they can only ensure bloody ones.” Zelensky went on to vow to ""find every bastard who shot at our cities, our people, who bombed our land, who launched rockets."" Upsetting images emerged following the deadly shell attack on Sunday, with one showing several dead bodies lying beneath a white sheet. Their belongings lay scattered around the street as a group of fighters fought to save their lives. The mayor of Irpin described seeing the four killed “in front of my eyes” when a shell hit. ""It is impudence, they are monsters. Irpin is at war, Irpin has not surrendered,” Oleksandr Markushyn said on Telegram. Hopes that civilians could be moved safely out of cities this morning quickly fell apart when it became apparent the humanitarian corridors only allowed people to move towards Russia or Belarus. A spokesperson for Zelenskiy called the routes ""completely immoral"" and said Russia was trying to ""use people's suffering to create a television picture"". ""They are citizens of Ukraine, they should have the right to evacuate to the territory of Ukraine,"" the spokesperson told Reuters. Dominik Stillhart, director of operations for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), explained what has been going wrong with so-called humanitarian corridors. He said both sides had been talking ""for days"", but problems remained confirming the detail of any ceasefire agreement - to allow civilians out of bombarded cities. Stillhart said the challenge was to get the two parties to an agreement that is ""concrete, actionable and precise"". He added that so far there had only been agreements ""in principle"", which had immediately broken down because they lacked precision, regarding routes and who can use them. Illustrating his point, he said some ICRC staff had tried to get out of Mariupol along an agreed route on Sunday, but soon realised ""the road indicated to them was actually mined"". ""That is why it is so important that the two parties have a precise agreement for us then to be able to facilitate it on the ground.""",47,2.9737992575638494,2.7899941242976936,0.18380513326615588,29

Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine 11 days ago and UK spies are said to have been increasingly certain of Putin's plans after tapping into social media messages. The intelligence services gave the information to Ukraine to help in anticipation of a full-scale invasion, only keeping back some details to protect sources and methods. Putin banned dating apps such as Grindr in 2013 but it is still used and provided a ""treasure trove"" of information for British spies.

The capital Kyiv has also come under heavy if sporadic bombardments with the air raid siren now a regular feature in the city. Blasts were heard overnight in Kharkiv, the second-largest city, Ukrainian media said, while the armed forces said they were conducting defensive operations in the eastern Donetsk, Chernihiv and elsewhere. Ukraine says it has shot down 88 Russian planes so far in the conflict although the Kremlin refuse to acknowledge or admit any significant losses.

Ms Stefanishyna warned Russian forces were shelling hospitals, nurseries and schools, and civilian homes with the situation getting “more and more severe”. With Western officials believing Russian forces are encircling cities to bombard them into submission, Ms Stefanishyna said: “We now see another wave of the fomentation of this terroristic plan of the Russian Federation has started. “Given the strong resistance our Army showed, now the [operation] is done against the civilian population.” It came as a second attempt began to evacuate some of the 400,000 residents trapped in Mariupol, with a temporary ceasefire lasting from noon to 9pm local time. A similar plan had to be abandoned on Saturday after the ceasefire was not fully observed, with both sides trading blame. Speaking to the BBC, she added: “This evacuation should have started yesterday but we didn’t start it because of the shelling that was ongoing throughout the territory… “Today hopefully this agreement will be implemented.” She thanked the West for its support, but warned: “The war is not ending in one or two days - it will presumably be a long-lasting process. We understand nobody should tolerate that.” She added: “It does not look like (it is on) the agenda for the new wave of sanctions to be introduced by the democratic world.""

The schoolboy has been hailed as a 'hero of the night' by Slovakian authorities after he crossed the border. He had just a backpack, a plastic bag, his passport and a telephone number written on his hand, according to the Slovak Ministry of Interior. The report has not been independently verified. ""He came all alone because his parents had to stay in Ukraine. Volunteers took care of him, took him to a warm place and gave him food and drink,” the ministry said. For all the updates on Ukraine-Russia war visit our liveblog The statement, posted on the ministry’s Facebook page yesterday, said that thanks to the information written on the boy’s hand and on a piece of paper that was folded in his passport, the staff at the border were able to get in touch with the boy’s relatives in Slovakia who were then able to come and collect him. “He won over everyone with his smile, fearlessness and determination worthy of a real hero,” the statement said. It is not clear why the boy was unaccompanied with his parents reportedly remaining in Kyiv. The UN estimates that 1.5m people have left Ukraine since the outbreak of war on February 24 - that amounts to about 3.5% of the total population. The majority of them have fled to Poland but other counties such as Hungary, Slovakia and Moldova have also taken refugees. Ukrainian soldiers bolstered defences around Kyiv on Sunday, digging trenches, blocking roads and liaising with civil defence units as Russian forces bombarded the surrounding areas and attacked towns and villages nearby. While the armed forces and civilian volunteers dug in, thousands of people continued to try to flee the city of 3.4 million as fears of a full assault spread. Russia has concentrated its heaviest attacks on the south and east of the country, besieging cities including Mariupol and Kharkiv with artillery fire and air strikes and causing extensive damage and casualties. Kyiv has been spared the worst of the fighting so far, but intense battles have raged in surrounding towns and villages and Russia's defence ministry released footage on Sunday of some of its tracked military vehicles on the move near the capital. Video provided by Ukraine's armed forces taken on Saturday in the Kyiv region, showed Ukrainian efforts to defend the capital, with piles of sandbags and concrete slabs laid across a main road, while Ukrainian soldiers carefully checked passing cars. A smaller road was blocked by metal ""hedgehog"" anti-tank barriers, and machine gun positions had been erected. Molotov cocktails were lined up on the side of the road, as civilians vowed to join the battle to protect Kyiv. ""We are equipped 100%,"" said an unidentified soldier in the footage.

Russia has been dogged by reports of low morale among soldiers realising they have been lied to by the Kremlin, with Britain's top military chief saying it has ""got into a mess"". Ukraine's ministry of defence this morning said it is inflicting ""maximum losses"" on Putin's military as the brutal war goes into its eleventh day. Nevertheless the Russian President, whose actions have turned the country into a pariah state, remains defiant following an hour-long talk with his Turkish counterpart, Tayyip Erdogan. He maintains that Russia would only halt its military operation if Ukraine stops fighting and meets demands, the Kremlin said in a statement. For the latest updates follow our dedicated Russia-Ukraine war liveblog Putin is said to have told Erdogan that the onslaught was going according to plan and to schedule - and that he hoped Ukrainian negotiators would take a ""more constructive"" approach.

It warned of ""the futility of any attempts to drag out the negotiation process"", claiming Ukrainian security forces were using delays to regroup. The Kremlin said: ""It is hoped that during the planned next round of negotiations, Ukraine's representatives will show a more constructive approach, fully taking into account the emerging realities."" The Russian president has been branded a war criminal over reports of civilians being targeted, with the number fleeing Ukraine set to reach 1.5 million today.

Sir Tony Radakin told the BBC's Sunday Morning: ""This invasion is not going well for Russia... It's less powerful than it was 10 days ago. ""Russia cannot continue... So we have to have to have confidence that what we're doing is the right thing"". He added: ""We do know that some of the lead elements of Russian forces have been decimated by the Ukrainian response.” But Sir Tony warned Russian aggression could be ramped up. He said: “I think there is a real risk because Russia is struggling with its objectives on the ground in Ukraine - and we've seen from Russia's previous actions in Syria and in Chechnya - where it will turn up the violence, it will lead to more indiscriminate killing and more indiscriminate destruction.”",7,3.6766179906951106,4.433731140184527,-0.7571131494894163,1

Aerial images show plumes of smoke billowing into the air after a factory and shopping centre in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, was hit by airstrikes earlier today. Civilians ran for their lives across the city today as Russian troops targeted their escape routes. An estimated eight people, including two children, were slaughtered when Russian forces opened fire on citizens trying to flee the city by bus, the city's mayor, Oleksandr Markushin, said. Three more Ukrainians died when Russians shelled a damaged bridge in the city they were using to escape. It is not known exactly how many ­civilians were killed in Irpin, which lies 16 miles northwest of the capital Kyiv, and which has been the target of a Russian ­bombardment in recent days. The UN says 364 Ukrainian civilians have been confirmed killed in fighting, including 20 children, with hundreds more injured, many of them seriously. But there are fears the death toll may be much higher, with the Ukrainian emergency services saying more than 2,000 civilians have died. It came amid reports of Russian losses of 11,000 troops, sparking fears Moscow is planning more ferocious attacks on soldiers and civilians, with increasingly deadly weapons. Russian forces also pounded the key port city of Mariupol. Ukraine officials confirmed a second attempted ­evacuation of the city was smashed by shelling. Fleeing civilians were meant to be given a nine-hour safety corridor. But artillery fire hit the city within seconds of an agreed time for the ceasefire to begin. It came 24 hours after the first failed ceasefire. Interior ministry adviser Anton Garashchenko said: “There can be no green corridors because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom.” It sparked fresh calls for war crimes prosecution of Russian troops, commanders and ­even President Vladimir Putin for targeting civilians. Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko, who represents 200,000 ­residents, said in a video call: “They are destroying us. “They will not even give us an opportunity to count the wounded and the killed because the shelling does not stop.” In the port city, mothers mourned slain children, wounded soldiers were fitted with tourniquets and doctors worked by the light of their smartphones to save lives. Dead bodies lay in the street, ­apartment blocks burned, while ­residents ran out of water and food. Mayor Boychenko added: “The city is in a very, very difficult state of siege.

Soldiers and residents refusing to leave their homes can be seen helping elderly citizens to a bus as they attempt to flee the horror.

One heartbreaking image shows the bodies of a family, killed as they attempted to leave, surrounded by suitcases containing their possessions. A resident has covered them with a blanket, but they remain a symbol of the innocents slaughtered by Putin’s illegal invasion. The sad images confirm Russians are shelling civilian populations, despite assurances they would be off limits from weapon fire. Other images show people looking exhausted as they tread through streets strewn with debris which was once someone’s home or business, as flames lick the sky behind them. Four people, including two children, are also reported to have been shot down as they attempted to leave Irpin today. The catastrophic scenes of destruction are repeated throughout the nation, now in its eleventh day under attack from aggressors Russia. Thousands remain trapped in Mariupol after two ceasefires were ignored by Russians this weekend. A second attempt, which was due to last between 10am and 9pm local time, again failed as evacuees attempting to flee were met with heavy shelling from Russian guns. Around half of the city’s 400,000 population remains in the city. A cease fire had earlier been called on Saturday but was also ignored, putting tens of thousands of lives at risk. Since the invasion started, the coastal city has come under heavy attack. Residents remaining have no power, water or heat as supplies of food and medicine threatens to run out, causing people to starve. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said the planned evacuations were halted because of an ongoing assault by Russian troops. He said: “There can be no 'green corridors' because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom.” The city council said in a statement: “It is extremely dangerous to take people out under such conditions.” Pope Francis said on Sunday he had dispatched two cardinals to Ukraine, saying the Vatican is willing to do everything it can to bring peace. He said: ""In Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing. “This is not just a military operation, but a war that sows death, destruction and misery.""

The loss of 11,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen by day 11 of the invasion has been a massive blow to Moscow, which is now calling up reserves. Defence experts usually calculate invading commanders usually need an advantage in numbers of around three to one to attack a defending force. In house to house combat in inner cities, which is what Moscow is attempting, this calculation can be as many as four to one needed. It is estimated that Russia began the invasion with around 230,000 troops, in Belarus to the north, on the eastern flank and offshore in the Black Sea. That is only a few thousand more than Ukraine ’s entire armed forces, it is believed, but the defenders were better-trained. And by adopting a full-on assault offensive on towns and cities that are well defending by a well-motivated force the Russian troops are now mired in urban combat. They lost the initiative and momentum quickly by allowing supply lines to get cut off and also by being flanked by Ukraine’s troops and militia. In addition they under-estimated Ukraine’s air defences which have remained well-hidden and efficient, bringing down a staggering 44 warplanes. The air defences and missile teams have also shot down 48 attack and troop carrier helicopters in less than two weeks of fighting. The Mirror understand these Ukrainian estimates of the toll on Russia’s armed forces may even be conservative numbers. One headline loss is also the amount of armour taken out by Ukraine’s anti-tank teams, in particular using UK supplied NLAW weapons, destroying 285 tanks. As well as this 447 vehicles have been blown up or disabled by an unrelenting defence from Ukraine’s armed forces and militia. Almost 1,000 armoured vehicles have been destroyed and 109 artillery systems have been wiped out in Ukrainian attacks. On Saturday alone Russia lost four helicopters, five warplanes and one unmanned drone, testimony to western-supplied weaponry given to Ukraine’s forces. Two of Moscow’s warships, bristling with weapons, have also been disabled or destroyed in attacks by the defenders. Many hundreds of Russian troops have been captured, treated if they are wounded and have even been filmed denouncing the invasion as wrong. Some of those found abandoned by their comrades or left behind in attacks had run out of food days ago and were hungry and thirsty. In one shock video some were found to have been given tinned rations that were six years past their sell-by date. And some vehicle crews were captured after simply running out of petrol as the logistics chain of the invasion broke down because of Ukraine’s defences. At a press conference in Kyiv on Saturday, captured Russian troops condemned the mission and called on their fellow citizens to rally against the conflict. Andrey Chuvatarevsky, a soldier who served on a contract basis in the Moscow region, said: ""Russians, do everything possible to stop this war. ""Neither Ukraine nor Russia needs this war. Only Putin needs this war. Try to inform the President, drive the military away from the equipment so that they don’t drive and bomb the civilian population. ""If you take to the streets, the President will decide to withdraw the troops. Then there will be no war."" Fellow captured soldier Mikhail Kulikov warned that Ukrainian children were suffering. The two men were among ten soldiers who spoke at a press conference at Interfax-Ukraine after voluntarily surrendering. Prisoner Dmitry Gagarin told relatives and friends in Russia not to listen to Russian propaganda. ""I would like all the people of Russia to hear that here everything is not like they say on Russian television,"" he said. ""There are no Nazis. Here are ordinary peaceful people who have rallied against one person – Putin, who wanted to be a conqueror."" A Ukraine Armed Forces spokesman told the Daily Mirror: “The enemy has not given up its intentions and continues the offensive operation against Ukraine. This is despite losses in personnel and hardware. “Unable to achieve the goal of capturing the capital of Ukraine in the first few days of the war, the occupation focused their efforts on encircling the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mykolayiv as well as reaching the administrative borders of Luhansk and Donestsk, creating a land corridor to the temporary occupied territory of the Crimea. “The 11th day of the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion continues.”",7,4.33877716841237,3.855879016822442,0.48289815158992777,23

The prisoner of war said he started questioning the Kremlin's orders when he saw World Heavyweight Champion Oleksandr Usyk and former champ Vasyl Lomachenko enlist to defend Ukraine from invading Russian troops. In a video released by Ukrainian officials, the remorseful soldier explained how state media painted Ukraine as a country in need of rescuing from the grip of nationalists and ""Nazis"". He said: ""Literally I'm 100% wrong now. Don't judge too harshly. We were told Ukraine is dominated by fascists... Nazis had seized power. We did not know the situation for sure. ""When we entered this territory I watched the address of your boxers (Olexander Usyk and Vasily Lomachenko). Back home I always loved watching them. ""They said 'we didn't call you here'. I feel shame that we came to this country."" Current World Heavyweight Champion Usyk should be training for the clash of his career against Anthony Joshua, but is holed up in a Kyiv bomb shelter after signing up for the under-siege city's defence unit. Speaking from the bunker on Wednesday, he told CNN “What do you mean why? “It is my duty to fight, to defend my home, my family.” Vowing that he will kill if pushed to do so, he added: ""If they will want to take my life, or the lives of my close ones, I will have to do it. ""But I don't want that. I don't want to shoot, I don't want to kill anybody, but if they will be killing me, I will have no choice."" Usyk is not the only boxer to put his career on hold to fight Putin's army. Several others have done the same, including three-division champion Vasyl Lomachenko, who has been pictured shouldering an M16 assault rifle after signing up to defend his home. . The 34-year-old shared an image of himself carrying a weapon and wearing camouflage army fatigues on social media. Captioning the image, he said: ""The Bilgorod-Dnistrovsky Battalion of Territorial Defense is formed and armed."" The two former boxing world champions Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko also answered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 's call to arms and are now stationed in Kyiv, reports say. As Putin's war machine rumbles on, terrified Ukrainians remain under siege and have been pictured running for their lives to avoid major shelling as Russian forces surround two cities.

One heartbreaking image shows the bodies of a family, killed as they attempted to leave, surrounded by suitcases containing their possessions.

2022-03-06,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukraine-russia-war-two-kids-26400727,Two kids among 8 killed after Putin's forces open fire on fleeing civilians,"Civilians ran for their lives in the city of Irpin as Russian troops targeted their escape route in another horrifying day of ­innocent Ukrainians being slaughtered. Around eight people, including two children, were killed yesterday when Russian forces opened fire on ­residents who were trying to flee by bus, according to the city’s Mayor Oleksandr Markushin. Three more died when Russians shelled a damaged bridge in the city they were using to escape. But the toll of ­civilian victims in Irpin, which lies 16 miles north-west of the capital Kyiv, could be far higher as it has been regularly ­bombarded in recent days. The UN says that, nationally, 364 civilians have been confirmed killed in the fighting, including 20 children, with hundreds more injured, many of them seriously. However, Ukrainian emergency services say more than 2,000 civilians have died. It came amid reports of 11,000 Russian troops killed, sparking fears Moscow is planning even more ferocious attacks on soldiers and civilians, with increasingly deadly weapons. The key port city of Mariupol was also pounded again yesterday. Ukraine officials confirmed that a second attempted ­evacuation of the besieged city was thwarted by shelling. Fleeing civilians were meant to be given a nine-hour safety corridor. But artillery fire blasted the city within seconds of an agreed time for the ceasefire to begin. It came 24 hours after the first failed ceasefire. Interior ministry adviser Anton Garashchenko said: “There can be no green corridors because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom.” It sparked fresh calls for the war crimes prosecution of Russian troops, com­­manders and President Vladimir Putin over the targeting ­of civilians. Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko, who represents 200,000 ­residents, said in a video call: “They are destroying us. “They will not even give us an opportunity to count the wounded and the killed because the shelling does not stop.” In the port city, mothers mourned slain children, wounded soldiers were fitted with tourniquets and doctors worked by the light of their mobile phones to save lives. Dead bodies lay in the street and ­apartment blocks burned, while ­residents ran out of water and food. Mayor Boychenko added: “The city is in a very difficult state of siege. Relentless shelling of residential blocks is ongoing, planes have been ­dropping bombs on residential areas.” In a counter-attack, a Ukrainian special unit of National Guards assaulted Russian troops encircling the city. The attack is said to have killed 30 soldiers and destroyed three Russian tanks and four infantry vehicles. One tank commander surrendered, as other captured soldiers claimed that they were not aware they were being sent to Ukraine when deployed. In another sinister move, more than 100 weapons installations have been spotted being brought into the north of Ukraine, including the TOS-1 multi-rocket flamethrower, capable of wiping out entire buildings. Point-U Tochka missile systems with a range of 75 miles were moving south in Belarus towards the border. Artillery teams also attacked a second nuclear reactor in the second largest city of Kharkiv and the national security service warned it could spark a “large-scale ecological disaster”. Police also reported shelling and air raids in the north-east Kharkiv region, as Starokostiantyniv air base, in west Ukraine, was destroyed. It follows the levelling of Vinnytsia airport, which was hit by eight missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is now preparing to bombard the historic port of Odesa. In a televised address the defiant leader said: “Rockets against Odesa? This will be a war crime.” He went on to demand an ­immediate no-fly zone above Ukraine. He added: “The world is strong enough to close our skies.” Ukrainian soldiers have been digging trenches around Kyiv, which is expecting a major assault soon. The city, along with Zhytomyr, 85 miles west of the capital, is being pummelled by air strikes from Su-35S and Su-25 bombers from Belarus. Last night sources said that troops are also bracing for an assault from Chechen forces in the city of Bucha, 20 miles north-west of Kyiv. And the World Health Organisation confirmed there had been attacks on Ukrainian healthcare facilities. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Gheb­­reyesus said: “Attacks on ­healthcare facilities or workers breach medical neutrality and are violations of international humanitarian law.”",47,2.9903972151830587,2.8485298871118303,0.14186732807122837,9

The 18-month-old boy named Kirill was fatally wounded as Russia shelled the southern city of Mariupol – where thousands were targeted during a supposed ceasefire today. Doctors couldn’t save Kirill – one of the youngest victims of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s cruel war. Devastated mother Marina Yatsko and her boyfriend Fedor wept as they cradled their son’s lifeless body. Hours later, thousands of their fellow citizens came under fire after gathering at agreed evacuation points. Follow all of of today's news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog A seven-hour ceasefire was agreed to allow up to 200,000 to flee along a so-called humanitarian corridor. But the exodus plunged into chaos as Russian forces bombed meeting points and the route to safety, officials said. The evacuation was called off after three hours and thousands returned to bunkers without heat, electricity and, in some cases, water. In other developments on the 10th day of the bloody conflict: In Mariupol, locals abandoned their cars to scramble back to hideaways when it became apparent the bombardment was not going to stop. Some were relying on melting snow for water, said the charity Médecins Sans Frontières. Mariupol, a port city of 400,000 people, has endured indiscriminate shelling as Moscow attempts to link separatist forces in eastern Ukraine with troops in Crimea. Serhiy Orlov, deputy mayor of Mariupol, said the ceasefire lasted barely 30 minutes. He accused Putin of genocide and said: “The Russians are continuing to bomb us and use artillery. There is no ceasefire in Mariupol and no ceasefire all along the escape route. Civilians are ready to escape but they cannot. It is crazy.” Another official said: “When the people organised in evacuation points, they started attack on evacuation points. Not all the city. Just evacuation points.” The Ukrainian parliament said it had been forced to suspend the evacuation “for security reasons” amid reports that Russian troops were using the ceasefire to make advances. A second humanitarian corridor came under fire in the eastern city of Volnovakha, where 15,000 had hoped to flee. Just 400 managed to get out. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which was due to oversee the evacuations, called the chaos “heartbreaking”. Russia’s defence ministry blamed Ukrainian “nationalists” for thwarting the humanitarian corridors. Capital city Kyiv remained under renewed bombardment today. The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy were tonight encircled – though Ukrainian fighters continue to keep hold of them. There was more resistance in the southern city of Mykolaiv, where locals said Russian forces had been pushed back. Regional governor Vitaliy Kim declared Putin’s troops were “destroyed and kicked out of the city”. Armed local police posed with four soldiers captured at a checkpoint. Thousands of women and children, many weeping and numb with exhaustion, arrived in Lviv, in the west, desperate to catch trains and buses out of the country. Hundreds lined up in flurries of snow on the station forecourt, warming themselves on oil-drum braziers or lining up for hot food and drinks served by volunteers. Anna Filatova, who arrived from Kharkiv with daughters Margarita, 18, and Lilly, four, said: “The Russians want to flatten Kharkiv. It was impossible to stay there any more. “The Russians thought Kharkiv would welcome them. But we hate them. We hate Putin.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky today again called on NATO to impose a no-fly zone – which the West has ruled out for fear of triggering all-out war with Russia. Mr Zelensky warned that “all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you”. Ukrainians fleeing into central Europe also pleaded for Western nations to take tougher steps following an invasion that has already created 1.3 million refugees. At the Medyka crossing in Poland, Solomiya Zdryko, 18, begged: “Please close the sky. People are dying.” But Putin – who today made a public appearance marking Tuesday’s International Women’s Day – warned Moscow would consider the move “participation in the armed conflict”. Of Western opposition, he said: “These sanctions being imposed are akin to a declaration of war, but thank God it has not come to that.” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova went a step further, warning London: “Russia will not forget Britain’s desire to co-operate with ultra-nationalist forces in Ukraine and the supply of British weapons to the Kiev regime. “The sanctions hysteria in which London plays one of the leading, if not the main, roles, leaves us no choice but to take proportionately tough retaliatory measures. London has made a final choice of open confrontation with Russia.” Putin also claimed “everything was going to plan”, vowing forces would complete their “special military operation”. Ukrainians in the UK, meanwhile, remain terrified for their folk back home. Mychajlo Barsky, 62, from Coventry, has family in the city of Ternopil, in the west of the country. He shed a tear as he said: “We are dealing with evil. Everyone is scared but we are prepared to fight it out. “There is a real determination in the nation that we cannot let Putin win. We will fight our corner – as we always have.” His musician son Danylo, 31, added: “Even if Russia wins the battle, they will not win the war. We will never accept a pro-Putin president. We do not want that.”",47,3.2053707843356993,3.01775233575802,0.1876184485776795,29

Vladimir Putin ’s troops are attacking Ukrainian cities with ever more shelling and as tanks move in the scenes of devastation are being beamed around the world with buildings razed to the ground. New images from Irpin on the outskirts of Kyiv show dystopian scenes with collapsed apartment blocks and vehicles blown up, while people walk around dazed. In one image a bridge can be seen destroyed from an attack with rubble, twisted metal and cables lying in water and mud. In the foreground is a soldier carrying a baby, oblivious to the destruction all around them. There are many other terrible images from the assault on the town while the pictures have been echoed from other cities around Ukraine. Moscow's attack on Ukraine, the biggest on a European state since World War Two, has created over one million refugees, a barrage of sanctions and fears of a global economic hit and wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades. Ukrainians say their resolve is as strong as ever as fighting continues to rage with Russian troops besieging and bombarding cities in the second week of an invasion that has isolated Moscow - which says its attack is a ""special operation."" Kyiv, in the path of a Russian armoured column that has been stalled outside the Ukrainian capital for days, came under renewed assault, with explosions audible from the city centre. Europe's biggest nuclear power plant had also been seized. The southeastern port city of Mariupol - a key prize for the Russian forces - has been encircled and shelled. There is no water, heat or electricity and it is running out of food after five days under attack, according to Mayor Vadym Boychenko. ""We are simply being destroyed,"" he said. Putin's actions have drawn almost universal condemnation and many countries have imposed heavy sanctions as the West balances punishment with avoiding a widening of the conflict. Moscow denies targeting civilians in Ukraine and says its aim is to disarm its neighbour, counter what it views as NATO aggression and capture leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and its Western allies call that a baseless pretext for a war to conquer a country of 44 million people. More EU sanctions are coming, potentially including a ban on Russian-flagged ships in European ports and blocking imports of steel, timber, aluminium or coal, said Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. The United States is weighing cuts to imports of Russian oil and ways to minimize the impact on global supplies and consumers as lawmakers fast-track a bill that would ban Russian energy imports entirely. In Kyiv's Borshchahivka neighbourhood, the twisted engine of a cruise missile lay in the street where it had apparently been downed overnight by Ukrainian air defences. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said an advance had been halted on the southern port of Mykolayiv. If captured, the city of 500,000 people would be the biggest yet to fall. Russian forces have made their biggest advances in the south, where they captured their first sizeable Ukrainian city, Kherson, this week. Bombing has worsened in recent days in the northeast cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv and Ukrainians have been fleeing west, many crowding into Lviv near the Polish border. James Elder of the United Nations children's agency said doctors in Lviv were preparing a system to identify children in case of mass casualties. ""A green dot means fine over here, a yellow dot means critical support. They are learning a black dot means the child won't make it,"" he said.",47,2.8530436102317527,3.478150087698094,-0.6251064774663413,9

The sound of explosions surrounded people fleeing the city of Mariupol during a five hour ceasefire this morning. Less than two hours into it many had to turn back as it became clear that shelling had continued and fighting had broken out near the evacuation route. ""It's not safe to go by this road because of these fights,"" the city's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC. When it became clear that the ceasefire, which had been bargained overnight, would not hold, people were urged to seek immediate shelter and wait for information.

Follo all of of today's news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog ""The green corridor is (nonsense). I can see cars of people who tried to flee and they are coming back."" Mr Orlov said that fighting had broken out in a town along the road to Zaporizhzhia, where the fleeing citizens had been heading. ""Their shelling stopped for a little time, but then it continues,"" the deputy mayor said, before saying that rockets had been deployed by the Russians. He added: ""We decided to move our citizens back because it is not safe on the street."" An hour before the shelling and gun fire erupted, Russian troops had been urged not to break the ceasefire. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk warned the invading forces not to take advantage of the situation. She said claims that the Russians were moving closer to Ukrainian positions in areas along the evacuation routes were being looked into. ""We are using this channel to evacuate civilians - women and children - as well as to deliver humanitarian cargo to those remaining,"" she said. ""The whole world is watching."" Civilians were meant to have safe access out of Mariupol between noon and 5pm Moscow time (9am and 2pm GMT), Russia's RIA news agency quoted city authorities as saying. Russia had said its troops, which have encircled the Azov Sea port city in Ukraine's south, would stop firing and allow civilians to pass. Russia also said it had planned a ceasefire to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Volnovakha - another besieged city in the south. Médecins Sans Frontières called for a safe route out of the city and said that several members of its staff had been trapped in Mariupol. ""The situation is the same as in recent days,"" they said in a statement. ""This night the shelling was harder and closer. We collected snow and rain water yesterday to have some utility water. ""We tried to get free water today but the queue was huge. We also wanted to get ‘social’ bread but it is not clear the schedule and the places of distribution. ""According to people, multiple grocery stores were destroyed by missiles and the remaining things were taken by people in desperate need. ""Still no power, water, heating and mobile connection. No one heard about any evacuation yet. Pharmacies are out of medicine."" Christine Jamet, MSF director of operations, called today for safe routes to allow civilians to leave the city, including MSF staff and their families: “Civilians must not be trapped in a war zone,” Jamet said. “People seeking safety must be able to do so, without fear of violence”.",47,2.2944991760835625,3.31541910413003,-1.0209199280464674,29

Speaking at a meeting with female pilots on Saturday, Mr Putin said Russia would view ""any move in this direction"" as an intervention that ""will pose a threat to our service members"". ""That very second, we will view them as participants of the military conflict, and it would not matter what members they are,"" he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has pushed Nato to impose a no-fly zone over his country, warning that ""all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you"", as Russian forces batter strategic locations. Nato has said a no-fly zone, which would bar all unauthorised aircraft from flying over Ukraine, could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. His comments came as a ceasefire to evacuate residents from two cities in Ukraine quickly fell apart, with officials saying work to remove civilians had halted amid shelling hours after Russia announced the deal. The Russian defence ministry said early on Saturday it had agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces for Mariupol, a strategic port in the south-east, and the eastern city of Volnovakha. The vaguely worded statement did not make clear how long the routes would remain open. But a short time later, Mr Zelensky's office said the ceasefire had already failed. Deputy head of his office Kyrylo Tymoshenko said: ""The Russian side is not holding to the ceasefire and has continued firing on Mariupol itself and on its surrounding area. ""Talks with the Russian Federation are ongoing regarding setting up a ceasefire and ensuring a safe humanitarian corridor."" Russia breached the deal in Volnovakha as well, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk told reporters. ""We appeal to the Russian side to stop firing,"" she said. Russian outlet RIA Novosti carried a Russian defence ministry claim that the firing came from inside both communities against Russian positions. The struggle to enforce the ceasefire shows the fragility of efforts to stop fighting across Ukraine as people continue to flee the country by the thousands. Mr Zelensky said: ""We are doing everything on our part to make the agreement work. This is one of the main tasks for today. Let's see if we can go further in the negotiation process."" Mariupol had become the scene of growing misery amid days of shelling that knocked out power and most phone service and raised the prospect of food and water shortages for hundreds of thousands of people in freezing weather. Pharmacies are out of medicine, Doctors Without Borders said. The head of Ukraine's security council, Oleksiy Danilov, had urged Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the older adults to flee the fighting, calling them ""question number one"". Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts continue as US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in Poland to meet the prime minister and foreign minister, a day after attending a Nato meeting in Brussels in which the alliance pledged to step up support for eastern flank members. Aeroflot, Russia's flagship state-owned airline, announced that it plans to halt all international flights, except to Belarus, starting on Tuesday in the wake of Western sanctions imposed on Russia. The country's aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, had recommended that all Russian airlines with foreign-leased planes halt passenger and cargo flights abroad to prevent the aircraft from being impounded. But as the United States and other Nato members send weapons for Kyiv and more than one million refugees spill through the continent, the conflict is already drawing in countries far beyond Ukraine's borders. Russia continues to crack down on independent media reporting on the war, also blocking Facebook and Twitter, and more outlets say they are pausing their work inside the country. And in a warning of a hunger crisis yet to come, the UN World Food Programme says millions of people inside Ukraine, a major global wheat supplier, will need food aid ""immediately"".

The evacuation of thousands of people from the war-torn city in the south east of Ukraine was due to start this morning, with Moscow promising to stop attacks to allow them to leave. Instead, more distressing reports have emerged from the port city. Its people have suffered near constant shelling for days on end, leaving them without power, heating, power or lights in near freezing conditions. Virtually cut off from the rest of the world, people have to rely on rainwater from gutters to quench their thirst whilst there is little that can be done for their hunger. Several grocery stores have been destroyed by missiles. Those left standing have been emptied of food and medicine by desperate people trying to survive. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Aid agencies have tried to deliver food such as bread but dare not stay still for fear they would be killed by Russian shells. The nightmare was promised to be nearly at an end today as the Kremlin and Ukraine agreed some of its half a million population could leave through a “humanitarian corridor”. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. Instead the attacks never abated leaving the city’s mayor Vadym Boychenko no choice but to cancel the evacuation, fearing it would leave more dead. He said thousands of people had gathered for safe passage out of the city and buses were departing when shelling began. He added: ""We value the life of every inhabitant of Mariupol and we cannot risk it, so we stopped the evacuation.” The mayor earlier said they have no way of knowing how many people have died in the city and he has no idea if his family have so far survived. It comes as the United Nations estimates 12 million people in Ukraine and four million fleeing to neighbouring countries in the coming months will soon need humanitarian aid. Earlier Mariupol resident Maxim, 27, told the BBC how he had videos of smoke from explosions near the city centre. He said: ""We can hear missiles and see smoke coming from buildings around us ""Our apartment building is full of people now because everyone is fleeing the shelling into the city centre. ""Some people have come from the left bank district and they said it was a total disaster there and there were bodies in the streets.” Médecins Sans Frontières called for a safe route out of the city and said that several members of its staff had been trapped in Mariupol.

Any initiative from the parties that gives civilians a respite from the violence and allows them to voluntarily leave for safer areas is welcome. “As a neutral and impartial humanitarian intermediary, we stand ready to help facilitate the safe passage of civilians once the parties have reached an agreement and that its terms are strictly humanitarian for the ICRC to be involved. “So-called humanitarian corridors or other measures aimed at providing respite to those affected by conflict must be well planned and implemented with the agreement of the parties to the conflict. “Regardless of whether humanitarian corridors are implemented in the coming days, parties must continue to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure under international humanitarian law both for those who choose to leave and those who remain.”",47,3.375771873048992,2.6392717617662105,0.7365001112827816,8

About 50 mothers and their infants cowered in cramped conditions in the basement of a maternity hospital in Odesa. Heartbreaking footage showed babies –just hours and days old – being nursed and laid out in cradles by their anxious mums. The sobering video was posted online by Ukrainian journalist Oleksiy Matsuka. Nina Sorokpoud, of the kids’ charity Unicef, said: “Mothers with newborns are hiding from shelling and air attacks in a small space of the maternity hospital bomb shelter in Odesa. “Tens of healthcare facilities came under attack last week as fighting escalates around Ukraine. ""Ukraine children need peace from the day they are born.” Hospitals in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol have all come under fire from Russian troops. Two Ukrainian maternity hospitals were reportedly attacked by Russian missiles. Ukraine’s foreign ministry posted a video appearing to show troops destroying a facility hospital in Zhytomyr. First deputy minister of foreign affairs Emine Dzhaparova said: “Russian armed forces keep attacking maternity wards, kindergartens, orphanages, hospitals."" One hospital has set up a neonatal intensive care unit in a basement. Doctors have warned a lack of specialist drugs and medical equipment mean some tots born in dangerous conditions will not live. Heartbreaking scenes of tiny tots being cared for in makeshift shelters have been shared by medics throughout the invasion of Ukraine. On the second day of the assault, staff from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Children’s Hospital moved twelve newborn babies to safety downstairs to avoid Putin’s missiles. Dr Denis Surkov, 51, chief of the neonatal unit at Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Children’s Hospital said of the bunker: “This is the neonatal intensive care unit. In a bomb ­shelter. “Can you imagine? This is our reality.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky previously said: “'What kind of war is being led against Ukrainian children in kindergartens? Who are they? “Are they also neo-Nazis from kindergartens? Or are they NATO soldiers that put Russia in danger?” Last weekend one woman gave birth to a baby girl while hiding in a shelter amid fears of falling bombs. Hanna Hopka, a Ukrainian democracy campaigner, said of the birth: “Mia was born in shelter this night in stressful environment bombing of Kyiv. “Her mom is happy after this challenging birth giving. “When Putin kills Ukrainians we call mothers of Russia and Belarus to protest against Russia war in Ukraine.

Heartbreaking photos show mothers sitting with their chronically ill kids in the converted train wagon, transformed for medical transport. They were being treated at a Kharkiv hospital prior to the Russian invasion - which has been targeted for heavy shelling by Vladimir Putin's military. As the bombs dropped, they were whisked away via Mosciska, on the war-torn country's western border, to Przemysl in neighbouring Poland on Thursday. A series of photos show the remarkable operation, which has helped ensure the extremely vulnerable patients don't miss out on much-needed treatment. For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our liveblog One mum hugged her brave little daughter as she sat on her knee and clutched a Minnie Mouse cuddly toy, while others crouched over their children on flat beds covered in plastic sheeting. In some sections of the wagon, parents sat in regular train seats with their children next to them, often also receiving medical assistance or sleeping. Other snaps show tanks of oxygen and medical staff preparing treatments and monitoring patients. But, amazingly, many of the children are seen smiling despite everything they've been through and such uncertainty going forward. Predominantly Russian-speaking Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, has been caught in heavy shelling since the start of the invasion on February 24. But as piles of rubble line its streets and despite it being so close to the border with Russia, the city has remained in Ukrainian control. It comes Putin bizarrely insisted tonight that Russia is not bombing Ukrainian cities - despite US estimates suggesting at least 500 missiles have been fired by Moscow. The lying Russian President has overseen the constant shelling of the neighbouring country, in which both military and civilian structures have been targeted, and thousands killed. Today, 100 people are feared to have been buried under rubble after an apartment block near the capital Kyiv was struck, while a cluster bomb attack killed 49 in Chernihiv. Putin, whose aggressive propaganda campaign back home has attempted to persuade his people that invading troops are simply undertaking special drills, cannot stop lying in face of unfathomable atrocities. Speaking on a call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday evening, he dismissed reports of Moscow-led attacks on apartment buildings, schools and hospitals as ""fake"". The Kremlin said after the call that ""alleged ongoing air strikes of Kyiv and other large cities are gross propaganda fakes"".

Yesterday, in a bizarre televised rant, Putin said Ukrainians were using civilians as human shields - but presented no evidence to back it up - then vowed to never back down from his attack. Putin had also said his troops were heroes and that the operation, so far, was going to plan. That's despite intelligence suggesting he had expected to quickly conquer Kyiv within 48-hours - but over a week later the city is still holding him off. However, as his progress appears to be running behind, it has only led to more sadistic strategy - essentially bombing major cities relentlessly in the hope they will bow down. The port city of Mariupol, on the Black Sea in the south, is being ""simply destroyed"" by artillery, its mayor has warned. Its residents have gone days without water, while electricity has also been cut and food is running drastically low amid regular air strikes. Officials have begged the Kremlin for a ceasefire, at least long enough so they can evacuate their citizens. It comes as Russian state communications regular Roskomnadzor restricted access to Twitter after also blocking Facebook today. The regulator said there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020, including restrictions in recent days on state-backed channels like RT and the RIA news agency. The move is a major escalation in an ongoing confrontation between big tech companies and Russia, which has in recent years issued a slew of fines and hobbled services through slowdowns. Major tech companies have faced pressure to respond to the February 24 invasion, which has led to economic sanctions against Moscow by governments around the world.

Former PM Gordon Brown said a new tribunal should be set up to deal with the Russian leader’s actions. It comes after Putin’s forces almost sparked a nuclear disaster with an attack on an atomic plant. Boris Johnson branded the assault “reckless”. British police are helping a war crimes probe into Putin. And a $1million reward has been put up for his arrest. Ukraine came close to a horrific nuclear disaster after Vladimir Putin ’s forces attacked Europe’s biggest atomic power plant. The strike on the ­Zaporizhzhia plant sparked fears of a ­radioactive catastrophe as a blaze raged for hours in part of the vast site. Putin was accused of “nuclear terrorism” over the terrifying assault. It came as Moscow continued its merciless bombardment of innocent families, amid reports soldiers were raping local women as they maraud through the country. Russian businessman Alex Konanykhin, 55, offered a $1million reward for Putin’s arrest as occupied apartment blocks, schools and ­administrative buildings were again targeted by shells today. And Deputy PM Dominic Raab warned the attacks will get “ever more barbaric” as Moscow increases its stranglehold on Ukraine. The attack on Zaporizhzhia in the south late on Thursday killed three guards. Emergency crews were blocked from putting out the inferno for four hours. The assault, which comes 36 years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Soviet Ukraine, was branded a “war crime” by the US. It came after a fierce firefight to seize authority of the power station. Boris Johnson branded the attack “reckless” and said it had “threatened the ­security of the whole of Europe”. The PM revealed Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky phoned him to declare “an attack on a nuclear power plant or an explosion at a nuclear power plant are clearly a matter of our common European health and safety”. He added: “We remember what happened with Chernobyl, the ­radioactive clouds spread over the whole continent. “I am concerned about how we stop a disaster, there are other Ukrainian plants and there are other Ukrainian radioactive nuclear waste sites.” Ukraine’s energy minister German Galushchenko said: “This is real nuclear terrorism. “They shelled directly to the station. They know what they did.” Russian forces last night surrounded the site, although the Ukrainian workers who maintain the control room have been able to carry on. ­Fortunately, there was no radioactive leak after the attack and fire, ­International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi revealed. But he described the situation on the ground as “fragile” and “unstable”. And Mr Raab warned there is unlikely to be any let-up in Russian attacks, after commanders became frustrated that the invasion was not at the rapid pace they had hoped for. He said: “I’ve said that we can expect that, after the stuttering start to this campaign, that Putin would resort to ever more barbaric measures as he gets frustrated. And that is the next phase that we all need to be alert to. He claimed economic sanctions on Russia are “starting to bite”, but admitted Britain and allies need to “bed in and have the strategic stamina for the long haul”. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned Moscow will likely bring in “heavier weaponry” as the brutal conflict intensifies. He accused Russia of dropping cluster bombs and predicted more death and destruction. Mr Stoltenberg said: “We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law.” Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russian troops of raping Ukrainian women. He said: “We have numerous cases.” With Russia becoming increasingly isolated, Mr Konanykhin revealed he would pay out the $1million (£756,000) from his own fortune for the “arrest of Vladimir Putin as a war ­criminal under ­international laws”. He put up a mock Wanted: Dead or Alive poster online. Mr Konanykhin, in exile in the US, insisted he was not asking for people to kill Putin but wanted him “brought to justice”. The southern city of Mykolaiv today came under heavy fire. Russian forces also moved within striking distance of the centre. Shells, rockets and artillery also continued to rain down on Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol, Footage emerged of the charred wreckage of a block of flats in Chernihiv, showing bloodied bodies strewn on the ground. The siege of Mariupol, in the south, stayed in place, despite claims humanitarian corridors would be set up to allow civilians out. The city has been without power, water, or heating for three days. Local ­officials claim Russian troops are also stopping food getting in the wreckage of charred, bombed-out buildings. If Russia can take Mariupol, then large parts of Ukraine’s army dug into trenches in the Donbas region are in danger of being cut off. Kyiv’s government today announced that more than 2,000 ­civilians have been killed. But the figure is undoubtedly much higher as it has been impossible to access some of the worst-hit places. Officials said 9,200 Russian soldiers have lost their lives and hundreds of tanks, almost a thousand armoured vehicles and dozens of helicopters and jets have been destroyed.

As the dust settled on a shocking overnight attack on Europe’s biggest nuclear power station - prompting fears of a radioactive disaster - Putin’s forces unleashed their massive firepower on another Ukrainian city - Mykolaiv, in the south. Yet despite outraged condemnation of the nuclear assault at a meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels tonight, there was no let-up. The demolition of occupied apartment blocks, schools and administrative buildings with shells, rockets and artillery in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol was unabated. New footage of the charred wreckage of a block of flats in Chernihiv emerged online, showing bloodied bodies strewn on the ground. With Russia becoming increasingly isolated as global sanctions bite, entrepreneur Alex Konanykhin, 55, who served under Putin’s predecessor Boris Yeltsin, said in social media posts that he would pay out money from his own fortune for the “arrest of Putin as a war criminal under international laws”. He put up a mock ‘Wanted: Dead or Alive’ poster on his LinkedIn and Facebook pages, stating that Putin was not the real President of Russia because he “murdered his opponents”. After Facebook banned the post, Konanykhin, who lives in exile in the US, insisted he was not asking for people to kill Putin but wanted him “brought to justice”. Konanykhin’s offer comes ten days after Putin approved the Russian invasion of Ukraine by declaring the Russian-occupied eastern states of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. Russian soldiers engaged in a fierce firefight to seize authority over the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant late on Thursday night. The attack sparked a blaze in a block just outside the main reactor buildings. Three guards were killed in the offensive, branded a “war crime” by the US, and emergency crews were prevented from putting out the raging fire for four hours. Russian forces now surround the site, although the Ukrainian workers that maintain the control room have been able to carry on. Prime Minister Boris Johnson branded the action “reckless”, saying it had “threatened the security of the whole of Europe”. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, explained later that the attacks on Zaporizhzhia did not impact the safety systems of its six reactors. He added that there had been “no release of radioactive material”. However Mr Grossi, who says he hopes to travel soon to the decommissioned Chernobyl disaster site in northern Ukraine soon, went on to describe the situation on the ground as “very fragile” and “very unstable”. Ukraine’s energy minister German Galushchenko described the attack as “real nuclear terrorism”. “They shelled directly to the station - they know what they did,” he said. Ukraine’s government today announced that more than 2,000 civilians have been killed. It also said that 9,200 Russian soldiers have lost their lives … along with hundreds of tanks, almost a thousand armoured vehicles, and dozens of helicopters and jets. However the civilian death toll is undoubtedly much higher as it has been impossible to access some of the worst-hit places. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed there is evidence Russia has been using banned cluster bombs in its invasion, “in violation of international law”. The Russian siege of Mariupol, in the south, stayed in place, despite claims that humanitarian corridors would be set up to allow civilians out. Mariupol has been without power, water, or heating for three days, and local officials say Russian troops are also stopping food getting in the wreckage of charred, bombed-out buildings. If Russia can take it, then large parts of Ukraine’s army dug into trenches in the Donbass are in danger of getting cut off. At the same time, they moved within striking distance of the centre of Mykolaiv. But Ukraine’s military did reportedly manage to pull off some successes. Two Russian jets were downed near Volnovakha, in the east near Donetsk, while Ukrainian special forces also ambushed two of the Kremlin’s tank columns at Hostomel and Brovary, leaving large numbers of troops dead and destroying vehicles. In Melitopol, another strategically important city in the south, hundreds of people - many with national flags of Ukraine and blue-and-yellow ribbons - attended a rally to protest against the invasion. A local activist said about 2,000 people were chanting “Glory to Ukraine!” and “Death to enemies!” and also singing Ukraine’s national anthem in Victory Square. They came out on the streets even though the city was occupied by Russia in the first few days of the invasion. Although calls for a ceasefire have so far produced no respite from the fighting, Ukrainian and Russian officials are expected to hold their third round of talks this weekend. The first round of talks saw officials from both sides meet on the Ukrainian border with Belarus - with little breakthrough. In the second meeting between officials in Belarus on Thursday, Russia agreed to the need for temporary ceasefires in humanitarian corridors to allow people to escape. But Ukraine said this outcome wasn’t the result it was hoping for.

It comes as Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, one of tyrant Vladimir Putin ’s major targets, came under renewed attack today with explosions heard in the city centre, which is now practically deserted as people flee advancing forces. A massive convoy of vehicles stretching for around 40 miles continues to be stalled on the road leading to the city, amid concerns it is regrouping for a major attack. Experts say around 15,000 troops are part of the armoured group which are believed to be waiting for supplies before launching an offensive on Kyiv.

President Volodymyr Zelensky pledged to 'find every b***ard' who attacks Ukrainians after Russian shelling killed the family. The image was taken in Irpin, 16 miles north-west of Kyiv, as civilians desperately fled the area on Sunday. Despite Russia attacks across the country, Ukrainians are continuing to resist and troops even recaptured the city of Chuhuiv on Monday. Vladimir Putin's bombing of populated areas is an effort to break morale, according to the UK government. Ukraine's defence ministry said: ""The eleventh day of the heroic confrontation of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion began. ""Armed Forces and units of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine are fighting fierce battles to maintain certain borders. ""The opponent, suffering losses, is making constant attempts to avoid direct fire contact with our troops."" Ukraine said Russia is losing 1,000 troops a day in its invasion. In its latest update on the Russian invasion, Ukraine said: The Ukraine conflict could last “months if not years” and Vladimir Putin could resort to even “more brutal” attacks, Dominic Raab previously warned. The UK’s Deputy Prime Minister appeared to suggest “anyone” taking the Russian President’s illegal orders should be tried for war crimes, not just the leader himself. Ukrainians trying to flee their city during a ceasefire had to seek shelter after Russian forces continued shelling. The sound of explosions surrounded people fleeing the city of Mariupol during a five hour ceasefire on Friday. In the first week of the Russian invasion of Ukraine enemy troops failed to take control of several key sites, but took its first city amid severe shelling leaving dozens dead and more injured. Russian forces also seized Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest power station, on Friday in heavy fighting as fierce battles continue to be raged for control of several key cities around Ukraine. Capital Kyiv, one of tyrant Vladimir Putin ’s major targets, has been under constant bombardment with explosions heard in the city centre, which is now practically deserted as people flee advancing forces. The 20,000 person town of Trostyanets in the north of the country fell on Friday evening, the governor of Sumy Oblast said. A massive convoy of vehicles stretching for around 40 miles continues to be stalled on the road leading to the city, amid concerns it is regrouping for a major attack.

Dmytro Kuleba accused Vladimir Putin ’s forces of committing sex attacks as they invaded cities. He said there were “numerous” cases of women being targeted. Speaking to the Chatham House foreign affairs think-tank via a video link, he said: ""When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities - and we have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities - it's difficult of course to speak about the efficiency of international law. “But this is the only tool of civilisation that is available to us, to make sure that in the end, eventually, all those who made this war possible will be brought to justice, and the Russian Federation, as a country that committed an act of aggression, will be held accountable for its deeds.” Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie teamed up with then Foreign Secretary William Hague in 2014 to raise awareness of how rape was used as weapon of war. The pair hosted aN End Sexual Violence in Conflict global summit in London, bringing together officials from more than 100 countries. Mr Hague said at the time: “This is a subject that the world did not want to talk about for a long time. ""We have moved a long way in the last two years in getting the world to talk about what was a taboo subject, and now we have to follow it with action.” Gordon Brown, who spoke at the same event, called for Vladimir Putin to face a Nuremberg-style war crimes tribunal. The former Prime Minister said the Russian premier should be held to account for atrocities committed as his forces invade Ukraine. Writing exclusively for the Mirror, he said: “I call on all European countries who believe that aggression must never pay to support the creation of this tribunal so that justice is done by the embattled people of Ukraine and justice can be seen to be done by them.” The ex-Labour leader also addressed the Chatham House think-tank panel, where he insisted putting Putin in the dock was “a realistic option”. He added: “This act of aggression by Russia, deplored in the strongest terms this week by the UN General Assembly, cannot go uninvestigated, unprosecuted and unpunished. “But there is a serious gap in international law. Since Russia is not party to the statute of the International Criminal Court, this crime of aggression cannot, as things stands, be investigated by the prosecutor.” Moscow pulled out of the ICC in 2016. Charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide can be brought against Russia even though it is not a signatory. However, the crime of aggression cannot be prosecuted against people from a non-ICC state - unless the UN Security Council makes a referral. That cannot happen because Russia is one of the Council’s five permanent members and has a veto. Even if Putin was charged, he would need to be arrested by a state that is signed up to the ICC - so if he never left Russia he would be highly unlikely to be arrested. But Mr Brown said that trying Putin was “a realistic option”. International human rights QC Philippe Sands todl Chatham House: “When Charles de Gaulle an dothers met in London in january 1942 it must have been unimaginable that ever Nazi leaders like Hermon Goerring and others would find themselves in the dock, and yet three years later that is what happened.” 1 Shutting off Russian banks’ access to the West, with plan to move to full asset freeze on all Russian banks. 2 Sanctions on Russian central bank and financial institutions, already in effect. 3 Preventing Russian firms and the Russian state raising debt in the UK, already enacted. 4 Asset freeze against individual oligarchs, with 15 so far including Putin and Lavrov and more to come. 5 Targeting key strategic sectors including defence with more planned on services and energy. 6 Blocking access to SWIFT, with UK still pushing for a full SWIFT ban against all Russian banks. 7 Banning Russian planes and ships landing in UK, with new laws next week to put this on longer-term footing. 8 Banning export to Russia of ‘dual-use’ items such as electronics that could be used in military computers or weaponry. 9 Setting a £50,000 limit on wealthy Russians’ deposits in UK bank accounts. 10 Extending the above sanctions to Belarus due to its role supporting the Russian invasion. 11 Extending UK-Crimea total trade embargo to the Luhansk and Donetsk ‘People’s Republics’. But still no date, due to concerns about protecting Ukrainians still there. 12 Sanctions on all members of Russian Parliament and Russian National Security who voted in support of invasion. Still in progress despite EU acting already. For more information click here. He added: “Who knows? But it’s not impossible.” Speaking to the think-tank via video link from what appeared to be a vehicle in Kyiv, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that while Ukraine was “fighting against an enemy much stronger than us, we have international law on our side”. Backing the tribunal, he added: “This is the only tool of civilisation that is available to us, to make sure that in the end, eventually, all those who made this war possible will be brought to justice, and the Russian Federation, as a country that committed an act of aggression, will be held accountable for its deeds.” Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said Putin risked ending up in prison. Asked whether he saw the conflict ending with the Russian president ""imprisoned for war crimes"", he said: ""I think it is a very real risk that he must now contemplate. ""Beyond his personal situation, every commander operating in Ukraine, or indeed Moscow, when they are faced with illegal orders, whether it is to target civilians or otherwise, attack illegal or unlawful sites, they now know the ICC is investigating and the chief prosecutor Karim Khan is, I believe, travelling to Ukraine. ""They must now know that they face the very real risk of ending up in the dock of a court and, ultimately, in a prison if they follow through on those illegal, unlawful orders.""",45,4.647108176720359,5.635883289418589,-0.9887751126982307,19
2022-03-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukrainian-troops-blast-russian-attack-26385728,Dramatic moment Ukrainian troops blast Russian attack helicopter out of the sky,"A Russian attack helicopter is blown out of the sky and crashes into a reservoir below in harrowing footage from the first days of the invasion of Ukraine. The video showed the heavily armed helicopter falling out of the sky after coming under heavy fire from the ground. Moments later, the aircraft smashed into the water. It is not known if the pilot or anybody else aboard survived the impact. Other choppers flying in close formation also took hits from the barrage of bullets, but managed to stay airborne. The hardware is known as the Alligator and is believed to be Russia ’s most sophisticated attack helicopter, drawing comparisons with the USA’s infamous Apache. First made in 1996, it is capable of destroying armoured ground targets as well as personnel and is regularly deployed as a surveillance platform for other vehicles. For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our liveblog As the invasion got underway last week squadrons of the aircraft were filmed flying towards capital Kyiv in chilling scenes. Joseph Dempsey, a research associate for defence and military analysis for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter : “Ka-52 Hokum B attack helicopter in apparent forced landing after suffering damage, reportedly North West of [Kyiv].” The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. It comes amid accusations Vladimir Putin risked causing a 'nuclear apocalypse' by attacking Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, early this morning. Russian troops opened fire on the station and eventually overpowered local troops. The Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) of Ukraine posted on Telegram: ""Putin might create a nuclear apocalypse as a result of potential catastrophe on South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant in Zaporizhzhia."" Russia denied it was responsible for the attack, claiming it had held the area since the second day of the invasion. Instead it said the attack was by Ukrainians. Russians are fleeing their country amid fears Vladimir Putin’s fury will turn on his own people and close the borders, leaving them unable to escape his tyranny. Trains full of desperate people lugging heavy luggage travelling from St Petersburg have pulled into Helsinki railway station this week. The route is the only available option for people wanting to travel between Russia and an EU country by rail.

2022-03-04,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/what-shelling-russia-nuclear-plant-26301088,Shelling in war explained as Russian shells set fire to nuclear power plant site,"The Russian shelling of Ukraine has continued in cities with news last night that a nuclear power plant was targeted by invading troops. A fire broke out at the site of Zaporizhzhia power plant in Energodar, southern Ukraine. The plant is the largest of its kind in Europe and any potential explosion there has been described as being worse than ""ten times worse than Chernobyl"". However, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service later reported the fire was in a building outside the plant and has since been extinguished. When war broke out, Russian forces were expected to sweep through Ukraine far quicker than they have done. Instead, their advance of the capital of Kyiv is 'slowing' - according to recent reports - and they have also failed to take Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, only around 20 miles from the Russian border. With this occurring, there appears to have been a trend in which Russian forces are attempting to break resistance by increasing their shelling on key parts of Ukraine, leading to civilians being indiscriminately attacked. The tactic has been widely used by Russian forces, so what is shelling? Shelling is a tactic in warfare that involves firing large ‘shells’ full of explosives at your enemies. The definitions surrounding the words point to exactly that. Shelling is defined by the Oxford Learners’ Dictionary as “the firing of shells from large guns”, while a shell is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as “a container, usually with a pointed end, that is filled with explosives and shot from a large gun”. In other words, shelling is also often known as artillery fire, big guns launching huge projectiles at enemy positions from far away. Reports of the continued shelling on Ukrainian cities suggest that Russia is launching bombs indiscriminately, rather than just targeting military positions. As a result, Ukraine's State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have died since war broke out. This has not been verified and the UN human rights office said it had recorded 227 deaths, with 525 injured. The tactic can be particularly brutal and indiscriminate because, with the shot fired often from a large distance and packed with high explosives, they can easily hit people and things they weren’t intended for. Kyiv and Kharkiv have seen particularly intense shelling, as have the cities of Mariupol and Chernihiv. Despite ensuring casualties would be avoided, Vladimir Putin's armed forces have resorted to the devastating shelling of Ukrainian cities, driving an estimated one million people across the border in neighbouring Poland, Romania, Hungary and Moldova. The shelling of Kharkiv has led to much of the cities landmarks being targeted, including the opera house, Freedom Square, university and city hall. The International Criminal Court has launched an investigation into Putin's shelling of Ukraine, including the alleged use of banned cluster bombs. A video verified by Reuters showed that the surroundings of the Zaporizhzhia power plant were also bombed by a 'volley of shells' as the mayor of nearby town Energodar saw ""continuous enemy shelling"". Zaporizhzhia is key to the energy supply of surrounding towns, and while there are no indications that the plant's functions have been affected - no reports of an increase in radiation have emerged - Russian control of the plant is ideal for the invaders. Outrage and condemnation of the attack were seen across the globe, as people feared another nuclear disaster should the plant be heavily damaged. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the assault on the plant, which is now under Russian control, as 'reckless'. The University of Sydney's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, David Fletcher, said in a statement: ""The real concern is not a catastrophic explosion as happened at Chernobyl but damage to the cooling system which is required even when the reactor is shut down."" Ukrainian authorities have since said ""nuclear safety is now guaranteed"".",47,2.882898188616186,4.440139430252494,-1.5572412416363082,11

Multiple videos showing ill-prepared military units 'out of fuel' have been circulating online and in one video a nationalist decided to make the most of the opportunity, as The Express reports . In one video the man approaches and rolls down his window before asking what the soldiers were doing - and the Russian troops replied: ""Waiting for diesel."" The driver then mocks the soldiers, saying he would love to help and offers: ""I can tug you back to Russia !""

Camilla and Prince Charles visited the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral, in London, and listened to people from the war-stricken country tell harrowing stories of how lives have been torn apart since Vladimir Putin gave the order to invade, a week ago. She told the wife of the Ukraine ambassador that she was “praying for you”, said reports. The Duchess was reduced to tears talking to representatives from the 70,000 or so Ukrainians living in this country. Her spokesman reportedly said last night: ""No one could fail to be moved by the appalling scenes of Ukrainians fleeing their homes and the duchess wanted to help in whatever way she could."" Charles also emphasised the fighting spirit of the Ukrainians to defend their country, paying tribute to their “extraordinary bravery and fortitude” reported the Daily Mail. A humanitarian crisis is unfolding in Ukraine with the United Nations now saying that more than one million refugees have fled the country since the Russian invasion began a week ago. There have been long queues at borders with women and children along with foreign nationals leaving while men aged 18 to 60 are obliged to remain in the country. It comes following claims that the first major city has fallen to the Russians with Vladimir Putin’s troops now on the ground in Kherson and they have forced their way into a council building. The Black Sea port of Kherson, a southern provincial capital of around 250,000 people, is strategically placed where the Dnipro River flows into the Black Sea. Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday it had captured Kherson but several hours later an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy responded the Ukrainian side was continuing to defend the location. Late on Wednesday, Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said Russian troops were in the streets. ""There were armed visitors in the city executive committee today,"" he said in a statement. ""I didn't make any promises to them... I just asked them not to shoot people."" He called on civilians to walk through the streets only in daylight and in ones and twos. In other incidents, bombing in Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people, has left its centre a wasteland of ruined buildings and debris. Russians have shelled the city of Izyum, some 120 km south east of Kharkiv, killing six adults and two children, Ukraine's parliament said. An explosion also rocked the Kyiv railway station during the night, where thousands of women and children were being evacuated. An interior ministry adviser said the blast was caused by wreckage from a downed Russian cruise missile, not a direct rocket strike. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

The city is still reported to be under Ukrainian control despite sustained Russian attacks in the form of airstrikes. Russian troops have not had as much success as it was feared when war broke out. Historically, Kharkiv is culturally important as well, described by Britannica as ""one of the most important cultural and educational centres of Ukraine"". A hub of writers and developments in the arts developed there during the 19th and 20th centuries despite Soviet rule. This is not the first time the city has seen war and it changed a number of ties during World War Two when it was occupied by German invaders.

Along with Mariupol, Chernihiv and the capital of Kyiv, the main cities of Ukraine are strategically important and are likely to see more of the fighting - Kharkiv is only 20 miles from the Russian border The city appears to be important strategically too as it is well connected, with highways to both Moscow and Kyiv, as well as Crimea. As the second-largest city in Ukraine and with a population of around 1.4 million people before war broke out, it has a major airport. Taking Kharkiv could be key to the Russian advance on Kyiv, which is now reported to be stalling, due to what the UK Ministry of Defence today described as ""staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion"".

Yesterday Mr Macron denounced ‘the lies’ spread by the Russian government to justify a war in Ukraine, while saying he would continue to lobby Mr Putin for a ceasefire. While also speaking to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr Macron blamed the hostilities on Mr Putin. ""It is alone, betraying his international commitments one by one, that President Putin chose this war,"" Mr Macron said in a nationwide TV address. ""This war is not a conflict between the West and Russia, as some would like us to believe. ""There is no NATO base in Ukraine. These are lies. Russia is not aggressed; it is the aggressor."" In turn, Mr Putin said his forces were conducting a ‘special military operation’ aimed at disarming Ukraine and capturing the ‘neo-Nazis’ running the country. The news come as Russia's bombardment of Ukraine intensifies, with residential districts reduced to rubble even as defiant Ukrainian President Zelensky insists the capital will not fall.

Attempts to seize both cities have failed so Kremlin forces have instead resorted to heavy bombing, causing thousands of civilian casualties. The city of Kherson has been taken by Russian troops but elsewhere the invaders have met with fierce Ukraine resistance. Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed since President Vladimir Putin sent his troops over the border on February 24, while Russia itself has been plunged into isolation never before experienced by an economy of such size. According to figures from the United Nations, more than 1 million refugees had fled the country in just seven days. Today has brought with it the announcement that Ukraine would call for Ukrainian corridors for its besieged citizens at peace talks with Russia - which began this afternoon. Negotiations began between the Russian and Ukrainian sides at about 3pm today. Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia posted a picture on Facebook of himself preparing to board a helicopter for talks. He did not say where. ""The minimum programme: humanitarian corridors,"" he said. Neither side has suggested it was expecting breakthroughs after a first round of talks held in Belarus on Monday led to no progress. Despite an initial battle plan that Western countries said was aimed at swiftly toppling the Kyiv government it describes as dangerous nationalists who threaten its security, Russia has captured only one Ukrainian city so far - the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson, which its tanks entered on Wednesday.",47,3.332605461910647,2.5901598424841916,0.7424456194264555,29

In televised comments, Putin made a series of allegations against the defending forces for which he did not provide evidence, including that they were holding foreign citizens hostage and using human shields. His confidence comes despite reports suggesting intel showed he planned to take Kyiv within 48 hours, but a week later his troops still continue to held back from the capital.

Major-General Andrey Sukhovetsky, 47, was the deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of the Central Military District. There has been no official announcement over his death but a military source confirmed: “This is true. Sniper.” His funeral back in Russia is scheduled for Saturday. Russia has admitted to 498 deaths in the Ukraine “special military operation” - but the figure is almost certainly higher. He is the most senior known casualty, and a blow to Putin in another sign his war effort is not going to plan.

On the first day of the war, an assault by airborne forces just outside Kyiv was met with strong resistance from the Ukrainians. Defenders shot down a number of the Mi-8 troop-carrying helicopters during the assault. Sergey Chipilyov, of the All-Russian Union Airborne Forces Union of Russian Paratroopers, posted: ""With great pain, we received the tragic news about the death of our friend, Major-General Andrey Aleksandrovich Sukhovetsky, in Ukraine during a special operation. “We express our deepest condolences to his family.” Until 2021, he headed the Novorossiysk 7th Guards Airborne Assault Mountain Division, which specialised in combat in mountainous areas.

The soldier was in the city, on Ukraine's south coast, to negotiate a Ukrainian surrender with residents after encircling the city. He reportedly spoke with Konotop Mayor Artem Semenikhin and presented an ultimatum - surrender or fight. Speaking from the city centre of Konotop after the Russian soldiers had left, Semenikhin could be heard asking residents which option they wanted - to this, the Ukrainians responded: “Fight, of course”.

2022-03-03,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ukrainian-city-mariupol-surrounded-russians-26380847,Ukrainian city surrounded by Russians with echoes of bloody siege of Leningrad,"A Ukrainian port city being catastrophically bombed round the clock by Russian forces is in danger of becoming 'like Leningrad', according to officials. Mariupol, on the Black Sea, is under constant bombardment from Kremlin airstrikes, with vital civilian infrastructure cruelly targeted in an effort to force the southeastern city into submission. The then-Soviet city of Leningrad, now called St Petersburg, saw a protracted Nazi siege during World War 2, resulting in 1.5million people killed over two years. Dramatic maps show how invading troops have closed in, after shelling left citizens without water and in a blackout after the power was cut. Supplies are also unable to enter and people cannot evacuate. For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our live blog As well as missiles raining in, bloody street clashes are also taking place on the outskirts. Russia has already taken Kherson to the southwest, as well Melitopol to the east. ""They are breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade, as in the old Leningrad,"" the council said in a statement. ""Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying [Mariupol's] critical life-support infrastructure. ""We have no light, water or heat again,"" it added. The council went onto say it was seeking to create a humanitarian corridor for Mariupol, as well as trying to restore infrastructure. ""Mariupol remains under fire. Women, children and the elderly are suffering. We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" the statement concluded. The city is home to an estimated 400,000 and is a key target for Russia as its capture would allow Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine to join troops in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed in 2014. One resident said the people are ""terrified"" after two days of no water and food is running low. IT developer Maxim said he filled up his bathtub with water before it was cut off. He told the BBC today: ""The shelling started again at six this morning. ""The city was completely black overnight, there was no source of light apart from the explosions. ""It was quiet for a few hours but then at dawn it started again. We can hear it now from every direction. We are terrified."" Mariupol's deputy mayor Sergiy Orlov said 15 main power lines are now down, with only the natural gas supply left. Yesterday he described how whole districts have been levelled with the city surrounded by invading forces as artillery rains down. He said medics could not even get in to retrieve the dead as the Kremlin unleashed ""medieval"" tactics. ""We are near to a humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said. ""Russian forces are several kilometres away on all sides. ""The Ukrainian army is brave and they will continue to defend the city, but Russia does not fight with their army, they just destroy districts...We are in a terrible situation.""",47,2.9759206828465596,2.3678288950870647,0.6080917877594949,29

Ukrainians have vowed to defend their country, with many deciding to stay and fight against Russia. The country's president Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Russia ’s murderous aerial assault on the city of Kharkiv this week. He said: “Russian forces brutally fired on Kharkiv from jet artillery. It was clearly a war crime. There will be an international tribunal. “No one in the world will forgive you for killing peaceful Ukrainian people.” Here, we look at how Vladimir Putin's invasion plan is going. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Even though the Russian advance from the north has slowed in recent days, Kyiv continues to face multiple attacks from the air. A series of loud explosions rocked those sheltering in basements this morning. The city’s main TV tower was also hit in an attempt to cut access to information. Hostomel Airport has been the scene of fierce fighting and has changed hands multiple times in the past few days, according to the Institute for the Study of War. Russian forces arrived near Obolon on the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday and clashes in north-western Kyiv were reported at the weekend – but so far, Russian tanks and armoured vehicles have not been seen in the capital. The most rapid advance on Kyiv has come down the west of the Dnieper river via Chernobyl, with the Russians taking control of a large area to the north and west of the capital. However the 40-mile-long column of Russian tanks and troop vehicles has stalled and the MoD said the main body of the Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 19 miles from the centre. Military experts say the unexpected resistance has caught Russian planners unawares, with insufficient food, water and fuel supplies. There have also been mechanical problems with the tanks. Russian troops are now advancing on the capital from the west after coming from the north, but are still thought to be 40 miles away. Analysts believe Putin wants to choke the Ukrainian economy by seizing its biggest port, Odesa. It is through the picturesque city that Ukraine exports grain and minerals such as iron ore to Europe. General Sir Richard Barrons, an ex-British military chief, has said to lose Odesa would be like the UK losing Dover. Ukrainian forces noted Russian Black Sea Fleet’s landing unit, consisting of four ships accompanied by three missile boats, heading “in the direction of Odesa”. Dnipro, on the Dnieper river which divides Ukraine, is of huge strategic importance. Over the last week many Kharkiv residents have fled there, but now it is thought Dnipro will be a main target. Air raid sirens have sounded almost continuously at night. Roads and buildings are being fortified and hundreds of armed volunteers are manning barricades and roadblocks on the edge of the city. Ukraine’s second-largest city has come under ferocious aerial bombardment in recent days. Dozens have been killed and hundreds more seriously injured, including in a missile strike on the city’s central Freedom Square. Although the Ukrainian military has retained control of Kharkiv, Russian paratroopers landed in the outskirts on Wednesday to conduct a raid on a military hospital, and an Indian student was reportedly killed while buying groceries. Close to the ultimate goal of Kyiv, the Russian military is desperate to subdue its second city neighbour, which has a population of 1.5million. By doing this, they will be able to close in on the capital on another front. The onslaught on Mariupol has been one of the most brutal inflicted on Ukraine since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. An incessant attack with artillery, rockets and air strikes has completely obliterated parts of the city, according to local officials, and left hundreds of bodies in the ruins. Russia’s determination to seize Mariupol stems from a desire to link Donetsk and Luhansk with Crimea, which Russia has controlled since 2014, and to effectively cut Ukraine off from the sea. General Sir Richard Barrons, former commander of the Joint Forces Command, told Sky News that would be “a crippling blow to the Ukrainian economy”. Russia’s capture of Black Sea port city Kherson is of huge strategic importance to the invaders as well as a blow to Ukraine’s dogged defiance. By taking the regional capital and other cities, Putin’s troops will be able to cross the Dnieper River and advance on Kyiv from the south. Crucially, army commanders will be able to link up the two main offensives. Kherson holds the region’s fresh water supply, which the Russians could then use in Crimea. The invaded city’s mayor Igor Kolykheav said Putin’s forces had taken over a council meeting, and imposed a curfew on residents. He urged the Russians to not attack civilians, claiming there are no more soldiers in the city.",47,2.9005438803071555,2.197062750567255,0.7034811297399006,10

Negotiations took place between the Russian and Ukrainian sides this afternoon, with a humanitarian corridor to evacuate citizens agreed by 5.30pm. The announcement came just hours after the news that Ukraine would call for such corridors for its besieged people. It came as Moscow faces increased pressure from western countries to cease its intense bombardment of Ukraine, which has forced a million civilians to flee in just over a week. Ukraine’s presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak has said the two sides will work in conjunction to provide humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians as well as provide food and medicine to the worst-hit areas. Podolyak was reportedly happy with the corridors, though tweeted after the agreement was reached to say the results Ukraine needed were “not yet achieved”. Meanwhile, Russian invasion forces continued to surround and rain missiles on Ukrainian cities, with an airstrike on an apartment block in Chernihiv killing 22 civilians earlier today. Speaking to Express.co.uk, Dr Samuel Ramani, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies and International Relations tutor at the University of Oxford said the corridors may not be quite what they seem. He said: “I’m very sceptical that this phrase humanitarian corridor is nothing more than a euphemism. “What ended up happening in Syria in 2019, following the creation of corridors, was massive aerial bombardment and a renewed state of near siege. “This led to malnutrition and basically the destruction of lives up to three million people.” Dr Ramani referred to the Syrian government's creation of similar “corridors” with the help of the Russian Government back in 2019, with the aim of safely evacuating civilians. However, these corridors ended up being an excuse to shell cities, with the corridors soon becoming branded “death corridors”. Discussion of the corridors comes after another day of fierce fighting around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine. The battle came as Vladimir Putin claimed Ukraine is using civilians and foreigners as ""human shields"" - while his forces bomb densely-populated areas. The outrageous claim followed a day of continued attacks on cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv, which have suffered intense damage.

Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said in online posts today that the forces had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, after entering in tanks. Earlier, Mr Herashchenko said Russian troops were stepping up efforts to seize control of the power plant. The plant's workers live in the nearby town of Energodar. It comes as Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, some 100 km north of Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Kremlin troops stormed the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster on the first day of the invasion. Fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the area in the north of the country may have led to damage at the facility, although these reports are yet to be independently verified. Earlier this afternoon, crowds of brave Ukrainians formed a human barricade in front of Zaporizhzhia, lining the road leading to the plant in a bid to prevent Russian troops from seizing it. The move of defiance came after Kyiv warned Russia risked creating “a new Chernobyl” if it went ahead with an attack. And this morning the UN nuclear watchdog voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Zaporizhzhia, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. According to Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant - which housed six of the country’s 15 reactors. Anton Gerashchenko, the interior ministry official, said in a Facebook post: “Russian generals – change your minds! Do not create conditions for the new Chernobyl! ""Radiation knows no nationalities, one does not spare anyone! Go around the Energodar and Zaporizhzhya.” Ukraine had requested that the IAEA declare a 30km safe zone around Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants. News of gunfire in the worrying new battleground comes as Vladimir Putin has today claimed Ukraine is using civilians and foreigners as ""human shields"" - while his forces bomb densely-populated areas. The outrageous claim came during a day of continued attacks on cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv, which have suffered intense damage.

The look on his face is one of complete devotion. The maternity unit was a makeshift ward hastily set up in a dingy Kyiv bunker. Outside is the shelling, death and destruction brought on this boy’s country by the blood-stained hands of Vladimir Putin. But not even the atrocities of conflict would prevent this father from experiencing that most precious of moments: holding your infant child for the first time. To have brought life into the world when so many are dying around you will have made this small act of humanity all the more poignant. For most parents this will have been a time of unparalleled joy. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog You ask yourself all the familiar questions: Will they take after their mother or father? What will they be like when they grow up? This young father will not even know if his family will survive Putin’s slaughter. But there is no stronger symbol of hope than the arrival of a new life. Today, Russia’s foreign minister warned World War Three “will be nuclear, and devastating” as Kremlin forces closed in on Kyiv Sergei Lavrov issued the chilling threat as Vladimir Putin’s troops encircled the Ukrainian capital and paratroopers landed in the north eastern city of Kharkiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the invaders “have an order to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all”. NATO bolstered air defences on the alliance’s eastern flank as tensions mounted. US F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jets were deployed to Lithuania, while E-3A Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System spy planes flew sorties over eastern Europe. Western leaders fear that if Putin’s military overruns Ukraine, he could quickly target Baltic states which form part of the 30-member NATO alliance. Veteran diplomat Mr Lavrov warned of escalation between Russia and NATO, claiming “a Third World War will be nuclear, and devastating”. Kyiv is braced for Russian forces to lay siege to the city after they failed to conquer the country in a week. A 40-mile long convoy thought to include 15,000 Kremlin troops was edging closer to Kyiv tonight. Residents fear soldiers will try to starve them into submission. Soldiers have already entered Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following days of intensive bombardment. A Russian-fired cruise missile struck a local council building, according to the region’s deputy governor - hours after paratroopers landed in the city earlier today. A rocket reportedly struck a regional police department building and part of Karazin University. At least 21 people were killed and 112 wounded in shelling, according to the city’s mayor. Mr Zellensky said: “Russian forces have today cruelly targeted Kharkiv with artillery fire. “This is a peaceful place, peaceful suburbs … the Russians knew where they were shooting.” Authorities were examining reports of a possible Russian rocket attack or artillery fire on the airport at Ukraine’s Black Sea port city of Odessa. Latest intelligence suggested Russian forces had moved into the centre of Kherson in south Ukraine. Reports claimed it was completely surrounded, and Ukrainian officials insisted the battle was continuing. But the Russian defence ministry said: “Negotiations are ongoing between the Russian command, the administration of the city and the region to address issues of maintaining the functioning of social infrastructure facilities, ensuring law and order and the safety of the population.” Mr Zelensky said a missile strike which hit a Holocaust memorial in Kyiv was “beyond humanity”. The Babyn Yar memorial commemorates the massacre of more than 33,000 Jews by Nazi troops in Kyiv during the Second World War. “Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital, about our history,” Mr Zelensky said. “But they have an order to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all.” Eyewitnesses told of desperate scenes at Dnipro railway station as people tried to flee. Crowds packed onto station steps, in ticket halls and on platforms - surging forward when trains arrived as they battled to squeeze aboard. But, eight days after they launched their offensive, Russian commanders were assessing their lack of progress and why they failed to meet their initial objectives. Mr Zelensky claimed nearly 6,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first week of the invasion - though the Russian defence ministry put its death toll at 498, with 1,597 wounded. More than 200 Russian soldiers have been taken captive by Ukrainian forces, according to the Ukrainian defence ministry. A spokesman also claimed 198 Russian tanks, 29 planes, 846 armoured vehicles and 29 helicopters had been destroyed. Western military experts believe Moscow is now focusing on aerial and artillery bombardment of cities rather than the kind of lightning, mobilised, armoured advances originally planned by the Kremlin. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace feared Moscow would now “carpet-bomb cities - indiscriminately in some cases”. He added: “What you have seen is the Russian pause on the outskirts and then ruthlessly pummel these cities with artillery and then hope to break the city.” The Cabinet Minister praised Ukrainian resistance for slowing the Russian advance. “The Russians are considerably behind their schedule, by days not hours, and that leads to stresses on their logistical supply chains,” said Mr Wallace. “That’s why you have seen some of these columns fairly grind to a halt. “They have also been surprised by the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.” More than 2,000 civilians have died since the invasion began, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service - though the death toll has not been independently verified. Mr Zelensky and Boris Johnson spoke by phone, with the Prime Minister condemning the “abhorrent attacks on Ukraine in the recent hours and days”, No10 said. The Ukrainian leader said defensive aid sent by the UK “had been vital in holding back Russian forces”, Downing Street added. The PM promised further support and weapons for forces resisting Moscow’s onslaught. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir - both former world heavyweight boxing champions - called for more help from allies so Ukraine could defend itself. Wladimir said: “It’s never enough. “There’s huge demand because infrastructure is partially destroyed by the shelling that is happening all over the country in the different cities. “It’s absolutely not enough and we definitely need to support and help - financial support, military equipment support, medical support.” His brother added: “Everyone has to be involved. It’s war not against Ukraine, it’s war against (all) civilians and it’s war against democracy. “We need support - support from the whole world.”",47,2.9149923368843695,3.070781043043434,-0.15578870615906437,10

Vladimir Putin unleashed a 15-hour artillery bombardment on the southern port city of Mariupol, while Kharkiv saw heavy shelling as Moscow troops continue their rampage towards capital Kyiv. Sergiy Orlov, the deputy mayor of Mariupol, on the Black Sea, said whole districts have been levelled with the city surrounded by invading forces as artillery rains down.

The second city of Kharkiv saw a rocket striking a university building and police station in the early hours of Wednesday morning, followed by the city council. For days it has been brutalised with missiles as Russia grows more and more desperate to claim a major scalp. With plans to move through the country quickly before taking Kyiv within 48-hours when war was declared last Thursday fallen flat, Putin has changed tack. Analysts have warned Russia, having suffered heavy losses against a much inferior military, is likely to begin surrounding cities and bombing them into submission. Ukraine estimates it has seen 2,000 civilians killed. If Mariupol falls, the thousands of defending troops in trenches along the frontline with Donetsk will be exposed, while Chernihiv, in the north east, and Sumy, in the east, could then follow suit. Russia today gave the town of Konotop the ultimatum ""surrender or be destroyed"". The strategic port city of Kherson in the south appears to have already fallen to the invaders after more heavy bombing with tanks seen rolling through the streets. While Zaporizhzhia, home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has also been surrounded. Ukraine's interior ministry had warned of a ""nuclear catastrophe"" if it was hit. ""An accident can happen like at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant or the Fukushima nuclear power plant,"" a ministry adviser said. ""Russian generals - think again! Radiation does not know nationalities, does not spare anyone."" Airstrikes, meanwhile, hit the HQ of the 95th Ukrainian armed forces brigade in Zhytomyr to the west of Kyiv.

Vladimir Putin ’s forces are bombarding Ukrainian cities despite worldwide condemnation and strict sanctions which are threatening to cripple the economy. There have been continual reports of destruction from Russian missiles with buildings blown up and heavy military and civilian casualties. But the Russians have not been able to take a major city and are slowly encircling Kyiv with a 40 mile military convoy on its way. Russia 's defence ministry urged Kyiv residents to flee and said it would strike unspecified areas used by Ukraine's security services and communications. Russia describes its assault on Ukraine as a special operation, not an invasion seeking territory. Ukraine is still showing considerable resolve to repel the invasion while hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the war-torn country with women and children allowed to leave but men aged 18 to 60 must remain. And images have emerged showing the desperation of people, some with young children, trying to get out of Kyiv as they tried to find space on a train. There have also been long queues and chaos at the Ukraine border as people look to escape to Poland and other neighbouring countries. Russian troops have not had the immediate breakthrough that they are believed to have expected but they remain a massive force and are causing considerably damage. Kyiv's mayor published a video showing the moment when a tall TV antennae in the city was engulfed in flames, apparently hit by a rocket. West of Kyiv, in the city of Zhytomyr, four people, including a child, were killed on Tuesday by a Russian cruise missile, a Ukrainian official said. Elsewhere, rocket strikes on the centre of Kharkiv killed at least 21 people, regional governor Oleg Synegubov said. Similar strikes that killed and wounded dozens in Kharkiv the previous day involved cluster bombs, experts said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before meaningful talks on a ceasefire could start, as a first round of negotiations this week had yielded scant progress. ""It's necessary to at least stop bombing people, just stop the bombing and then sit down at the negotiating table,"" he said. Ukraine has called on the NATO alliance to implement a no-fly zone - a request rejected by Washington, which fears stoking a direct conflict between the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Washington and its allies have instead sent weapons to Kyiv, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the United States had agreed with partners to convene a task force ""to freeze and seize the assets of key Russian elites"". The move ""will inflict financial pain on the powerful individuals surrounding Putin and make clear that no one is beyond our collective reach,"" Yellen said in a statement following a Tuesday call with Group of Seven officials.

The victorious villagers who captured the vehicle said the Russian soldiers fled like ""rats"" abandoning the anti-air battery. The video was filmed near the city of Bashtanka in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv Oblast on March 1. Boris Filatov, 49, mayor of the city of Dnipro, shared images of the burning Pantsir-C missile system on social media, claiming that farmers seized and destroyed the vehicle and that it cost around £11.3 million. He added that villagers had described how the Russian soldiers were forced to run across the ""Ukrainian fields like rats"". Filatov said: ""I usually cannot stand victorious scene, sabre-rattling and hat throwing. War is terrible grief, but these people (farmers) cannot be defeated.

2022-03-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russias-most-deadly-weapons-thermobaric-26355727,Russia may have used some of its most deadly weapons like horrific vacuum bomb,"Russia's military is one of the most advanced forces on Earth and includes some terrifyingly deadly weapons. One, known as a thermobaric vacuum bomb, is of particular concern, even as Vladimir Putin places his deterrent troops - which includes nuclear weapons - on high alert. When Putin announced the invasion of Ukraine last week, few expected successful resistance for so long. As fierce resistance continues, it appears Putin's troops are resorting to more extreme measures, including heavy bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Russian forces struck Independence Square in central Kharkiv on Tuesday morning, causing a huge explosion. Having promised that civilians would not be targeted, reports seem to indicate that indiscriminate bombing is taking place as Putin attempts to grind down Ukrainian resistance. The shelling has also caused a wave of migration westwards, as desperate families seek shelter outside of the country. As there appears to be a link between ongoing resistance by Ukrainian armed forces and the lengths Putin will go to destroy it, there is concern that more deadly weapons will be used. One of the weapons there is most concern about is the vacuum bomb, which sucks in oxygen to create a high-temperature explosion. Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova claimed the bomb has already been used in the invasion, though this has not yet been confirmed and the ambassador gave no indication as to where it had been used. She said: ""They used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva Convention."" Vacuum bombs are known as some of the most deadly non-nuclear weapons in existence. They suck in the surrounding air, creating a massive explosion and blast wave said to be capable of vaporising human bodies. A CIA study said of the bombs: ""Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness."" The White House Press Secretary said if the ambassador's claims are indeed true, then the act of using them would be a ""war crime"". However, The Guardian was told that the bombs are indeed legal. A senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Dr Marcus Hellyer, said: ""They are not illegal even though their effects can be pretty horrific, because of that effect of creating a vacuum and sucking the air out of the lungs of defenders."" Evidence that Russia plans to actually use its nuclear weapons is currently non-existent and there are no indications whatsoever that Russia will use them in future. Upon announcing his invasion, Putin said: ""People should know Russia's response will be immediate and lead you to consequences you have never encountered in your history."" Some experts took this to mean that the threat of nuclear weapons is ""on the table"" at least. Fiona Hill is a former presidential adviser and wrote a biography of Putin. Speaking to Politico, she said: ""Basically, what President Putin has said quite explicitly in recent days is that if anybody interferes in Ukraine, they will be met with a response that they’ve ""never had in [their] history."" And he has put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert. ""So he’s making it very clear that nuclear is on the table."" Joachim Krause, academic director of the Institute for Security Policy at Germany's Kiel University, told Fortune: ""It's psychological warfare, but we have to see what's really coming out of this."" Cluster bombs scatter smaller munitions over a wider area. Amnesty International claims these were used in an attack on a pre-school in Okhtyrka, Northeastern Ukraine. It said: ""A 220mm Uragan rocket dropped cluster munitions on the Sonechko nursery and kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka in Sumy Oblast."" Three people were reportedly killed in the attack, including one child, with another child injured. Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International's Secretary-General, said: ""There is no possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school."" Putin claimed that civilian casualties would be avoided when his invasion into Ukraine began, but appears to have used cluster bombs on the city of Kharkiv, according to experts.",45,4.900523313339123,3.7842179965487888,1.1163053167903345,26

Russian officials said their forces are preparing to launch attacks on the ""technological centres of the Ukrainian Security Service and the 72nd main PsyOps centre in Kyiv"". The statement read: ""We urge Ukrainian citizens who are being used by nationalists to carry out provocations against Russia, as well as Kyiv residents residing near relay stations to leave their home."" Officials claimed the strikes are being carried out to ""prevent information attacks against Russia"". Putin's government is still denying it has invaded Ukraine and continues to claim it is carrying out a special operation. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that in response to a request by the heads of what he calls ""the Donbass republics"" he had made a decision to carry out a special military operation in Ukraine. The Russian leader stressed that Moscow had ""no plans of occupying Ukrainian territories"". Russian Defense Ministry claims that their troops are not targeting Ukrainian cities, but are limited to surgically striking and incapacitating Ukrainian military infrastructure. It also states that ""there are no threats to the civilian population"". Despite Russia's claims, Ukrainian 10-year-old Polina was killed alongside her mother and father by Russian troops while in a car in Kyiv on Saturday. Dad Anton and wife Svetlana Zapadynskaya died, along with their middle daughter. Their eldest daughter Sofia and youngest son Semyon were critically wounded and are now fighting for their lives.

The soldier explained that he was no longer in Crimea nor in training sessions. ""What kind of a parcel mama can you send me? What are you talking about? What happened?"" he asked. Britain's UN Ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward was among those at the UN to accuse the Kremlin of launching ""indiscriminate attacks against men, women and children"" and violating international humanitarian law. She warned that Ukraine is on the brink of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" at an emergency meeting of the Security Council. ""Missiles have rained down on Kharkiv, with cluster munitions hitting residential areas and injuring residents,"" she added. ""Disruption to supply chains has caused food shortages in Kramatorsk. ""The reckless bombing of an oil depot in Vasylkiv has unleashed toxic fumes in nearby communities.

The UK's permanent UN representative told the Security Council that ""hundreds of civilians had been killed as a result of the Russian invasion"" and seven million people had been displaced, with the figure ""rising exponentially"". Mr Kyslytsya told the council that Kyiv was ""sitting within Russian crosshairs right now"" and that 352 people, including 16 children, had been killed as of Monday in the fighting. He accused Moscow troops of attacking hospitals and ambulances in a determination to ""kill civilians"", adding ""there is no debate. These are war crimes."" But Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian UN permanent representative, said his country's armed forces did ""not have the goal of occupying Ukraine or harming the local population"". The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he plans to open an investigation ""as rapidly as possible"" into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed Mr Kyslytsya's statements in a late-night address on Monday. In a video posted to social media, the leader said that in five days Russian forces had launched 56 missile strikes and 113 cruise missiles in Ukraine. He added: ""Today, Russian forces brutally fired on Kharkiv from jet artillery. It was clearly a war crime. ""Kharkiv is a peaceful city, there are peaceful residential areas, no military facilities. Dozens of eyewitness accounts prove that this is not a single false volley, but deliberate destruction of people. ""The Russians knew where they were shooting.""

Under-siege President Zelensky released a social media video in which he slammed Russia’s murderous aerial assault on the city of Kharkiv. It came on a day dozens of UN diplomats in Geneva spoke for the world by turning their backs on Russian minister Sergei Lavrov and walking out during a video address from Moscow. Mr Zelensky said: “Russian forces brutally fired on Kharkiv from jet artillery. It was clearly a war crime. There will be an international tribunal. “No one in the world will forgive you for killing peaceful Ukrainian people.” Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Claims that Russia is committing war crimes are mounting, with growing international calls for the attacks on Kharkiv to be investigated. The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan said there was “reasonable basis” to believe war crimes had been committed and that he plans to open an investigation “as rapidly as possible”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the scenes “absolutely sickening”. “It has that feel to me of an atrocity committed deliberately against a civilian centre,” he said while visiting British troops in Estonia. He added: “I cannot think of a time in international affairs when the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, has been so obvious.” His Estonian counterpart Kaja Kallas warned: “What we are seeing in Ukraine is really very horrifying – to see what kind of steps they are taking, and now they are escalating this crisis.” Latvian PM Arturs Krisjanis Karins said: “Putin’s army is now starting to target civilians. It may be an act of military desperation but I think by all accounts this amounts to a war crime, this targeting civilians, killing women and children, targeting housing – this is not acceptable by any standard.” The White House confirmed it was studying whether “barbaric tactics” Being reported were war crimes. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey urged Britain to support Mr Khan’s ICC probe, with evidence difficult to gather during a war. He said: “He will need resources and technical experts, which Britain can supply.” Mr Johnson was full of praise for popular Mr Zelenski, who had also urged MEPs in Strasbourg to accept Ukraine into the EU. Wearing a green military T-shirt, the president said his country was fighting to protect European values. He raised his fist as he received a standing ovation after saying in his video address: “Do prove that you are with us, do prove that you will not let us go, and then life will win over death, and light will win over darkness.” The parliament said it would look at the request for EU candidate status. Speaking earlier in Warsaw, Poland, Mr Johnson said: “I marvel at his coolness under fire, his bravery, his invincible good humour. I think he is mobilising the world against the horror of what is happening.” The admiration was in stark contrast to the shunning of Russia’s Mr Lavrov at the United Nations Human Rights Council. As he began his statement, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told delegates it was “full of disinformation” and did not deserve their attention. Accusing the Russian President of having “blood on his hands”, she said: “The consequences of Vladimir Putin’s unjustified aggression are horrific. “Russian troops are laying siege to peaceful cities, tanks are tearing through towns while missiles barrage homes and hospitals, Putin is murdering Ukrainians indiscriminately. There is blood on his hands. “Putin is violating international law and human rights on an industrial scale and the world will not stand for it.There are no shades of grey.

One breathtaking video emerged of citizens performing a drive-by attack in a car, hurling plastic-filled petrol bombs at a Russian “electronic warfare” truck, screaming blood-curling and celebratory oaths. Another plucky Ukrainian, a farmer, was filmed by laughing locals mocking Putin’s troops as they watched him tow away a Russian armoured personnel carrier - using his tractor. But despite the amazing spirit and bravery of Ukraine, rising numbers of civilian deaths over the last two days were an ominous sign that frustrated Russian commanders are resorting to even more lethal tactics. Russia still has more forces to throw into the fight even though President Vladimir Putin faces worldwide condemnation and international sanctions for his actions. Between 2,000 and 4,0000 killer mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner Group, armed with a 24 man hit-list for assassinations is also moving in on Kyiv. Target number one is Ukraine’s hero leader President Zelensky and two additions earmarked for a grim end are Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko and his fellow boxing champ brother Wladimir. Both sports stars have publicly rallied Ukrainian civilians to join them in fighting for the civilian defence forces. It is believed Ukraine’s cities have been hit with cluster munitions, Multi Launch Rocket Systems and even banned Vacuum bombs. Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said similar strikes killed and wounded dozens in the previous day. He warned: “The rubble is being cleared and there will be even more victims and wounded,” as President Zelenskiy branded the strikes “terrorism.” Philip Reeker, the US Charge d’Affairs to the UK warned “medieval tactics are certainly what we can expect.” “That is exactly what President Putin and the Russian military have in mind.” In another chilling move Belarus joined Putin’s assault as thousands of its troops poured into the northern area of Chernihiv, on day six of the invasion of Ukraine. Pictures released by U.S. satellite company Maxar showed Russian tanks, artillery and fuel trucks stretching for 40 miles to the north. The huge column had travelled 30 miles towards Kyiv in the past day and was believed to bracing to encircle Kyiv - and grind it down, starving its people. President Zelensky warned: “For the enemy, Kyiv is the key target. “We will neutralise them all.” Some residents in the capital of 3 million people are sheltering in underground metro stations at night. There are long lines for fuel and some products are running out in shops, but by day the city is still holding out, with a semblance of ordinary life on the streets. Russian troops fired artillery at Kyiv, Kharkiv and the southern port city of Mariupol overnight while Ukraine side shot down Russian military planes around the capital, Ukrainian authorities also reported 70 soldiers killed in a rocket attack in a town between Kyiv and Kharkiv. The south eastern city of Mariupol was believed to be totally besieged by exhausted Ukrainian forces and citizen warriors who were still holding out. They have come under appalling missile attacks and infantry assaults from Russian marines. In Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the Kremlin would press its attacks until it achieves its goals. Britain’s MoD said in an intelligence update that the Russian advance on Kyiv had made little progress in the past 24 hours due to logistical problems. But it warned of a shift in Russian tactics that could worsen the plight of civilians. It said in a statement: “The use of heavy artillery in densely populated urban areas greatly increases the risk of civilian casualties.” Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst at RUSI think tank in London, said Russia was falling back on tactics that would involve far more intense bombardment of Ukrainian cities. He said: “The Russian army is an artillery army primarily, and it looks like they are shifting into war-fighting mode. “The failure of the Russians to achieve their goals quickly has galvanized Ukraine resistance to them. Really what we are seeing now is the Russian military shifting gears.” Kharkiv, a mainly Russian-speaking city of 1.5 million people near the Russian border, has borne the brunt of attacks since Monday. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian losses included 5,710 personnel, 29 destroyed and damaged aircraft and 198 tanks. Pictures from Ukraine have shown burnt-out Russian tanks and bodies on the road where they have been attacked by Ukrainian defenders. Putin’s forces could try to starve Ukrainians and “crush” their resistance, the country’s ambassador to Britain warned yesterday(TUES). Kyiv’s envoy to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko warned Ukrainians were struggling to access cash as tanks besiege major cities. Asked about the potential for a “food crisis” and looting, he told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee: “They will try to crush the will of the Ukrainian people to resist. “We see problems with cash for example - people just running out of cash and they have interruption in their services. “The terminals won’t be working and we will have to come up with some military solution to the distribution of food.” He admitted Ukraine had to “pump up all the food we can until the routes are blocked”. Mr Prystaiko told MPs of the humanitarian plight facing brave citizens remaining in major cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv rather than flee. “These people have to be fed and so far they have everything - they have communications, they have electricity, they have water,” he said. “But we see that these infrastructure objects (are) starting to be targeted specifically.” Mr Prystaiko said Putin was facing a “lack of progress”, with civilians meeting his tanks with “Molotov cocktails from their cars” rather than the “flowers” he dreamed of. “The support and resilience is going so much against his plans and in Russia themselves start asking questions, ‘What are we doing?’,” the ambassador said. “I believe they might … try to block our cities, try to soften political position, try and maybe ... some riots in Ukraine, because of the lack of food, against the Government.” Asked how Ukrainian forces were coping as they battled invaders, Mr Prystaiko said: “Our armed forces are trying their best. “People are signing up for territorial defence and for reserves.” “We have plus 100,000 people in forces. We have some issues with equipping them and arming them, but this is just logistical, we will cover it.” He also accused Moscow of plundering Ukrainian water to supply Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014. “They have already started stealing water from the major rivers,” he said. “They blew up a dam which was covering a canal from a neighbouring area to Crimea.” Despite Kremlin soldiers again assaulting sovereign territory, Ukrainian medics were treating wounded Russian troops, he said. “We have found the softness in our hearts to treat Russians (who are) wounded and we are keeping them and we promised everybody they will be treated in our hospitals along with our own people and then be returned to Russia after war is over,” said Mr Prystaiko.",47,3.5958626592678407,3.085477570790882,0.5103850884769585,28
2022-03-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/you-need-know-war-crimes-26361031,All you need to know about war crimes as Russian invasion of Ukraine continues,"Ukraine has accused Russia of committing ""war crime"" after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of the country, destroying buildings and killing innocent civilians. The country's president Volodymyr Zelensky spoke after a missile hit the centre of Kharkiv. He also condemned a rocket attack on the city of Kharkiv on Monday which killed at least nine people. Mr Zelenskiy said: ""This is terror against the city. There was no military target on the square … No one will forgive, no one will forget."" He added: ""This attack on Kharkiv is a war crime. This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation. After that, Russia is a terrorist state … We demand full responsibility for terrorists in international courts."" Here is everything you need to know about war crimes - from the history of the International Criminal Court to its work. The ICC was established in 2002 under the Rome Statute, which was agreed at a conference in the Italian capital in July 1998. It was set up to prosecute individuals and their commanders accused of crimes in cases where nations are unable or unwilling to hold their own trials. Based in The Hague in the Netherlands, its remit extends to war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. Its website currently lists 16 investigations and 46 defendants. The Geneva Conventions set out the rules of war - what is acceptable when states fight each other. Conduct not sanctioned by the Conventions could constitute war crimes. According to the ICC they can involve “serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflict”. The International Committee of the Red Cross says “violations are serious, and are war crimes, if they endanger protected persons (e.g. civilians, prisoners of war, the wounded and sick) or objects (e.g. civilian objects or infrastructure) or if they breach important values”. Bombing obviously civilian targets such as blocks of flats, schools and hospitals are examples. The ICC’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan today said there was ""reasonable basis"" to believe war crimes or crimes against humanity had been committed by Russian forces during the invasion. Instances he could examine include a tank driving over a car - apparently deliberately - on Friday in Kyiv. Another example could include the bombing of a residental apartment block in Kharkiv in which three children were killed. Some of the most infamous war crime prosecutions of recent years stemmed from the civil war unleashed by the breakup in the Balkans. But cases were heard by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia because the ICC did not exist. The hearings, including into Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, demonstrated the need for a permanent court. Radovan Karadžić, a Bosnian-Serb former politician who served as the President of Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War, was convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes by the Tribunal. He was jailed for 40 years. Last May it was announced he was being transferred to a British prison to serve the rest of his sentence.",45,4.215845844339736,5.47598640833431,-1.2601405639945744,14
2022-03-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/moment-man-stops-russian-tank-26358987,Man 'stops Russian tank with bare hands' as unarmed Ukrainians confront soldiers,"Footage has emerged on social media of unarmed Ukrainian citizens confronting the Russian army - and even stopping their tanks with bare hands. Russia continues to take heavy military losses as its invasion of Ukraine continues into its sixth day today. And now a second country has entered the war - with Ukraine's lawmakers and Latvian ministers confirming that Belarus has sent troops to join the Russian onslaught. The Kremlin today confirmed troops have entered Kherson - a strategically important city beside the Dnieper River. Moscow has warned that troops will continue to pound Kyiv with airstrikes, telling Ukrainians earlier today to prepare for shelling. But elsewhere in the country, it appears Russians are meeting fierce resistance - even from unarmed civilians. In a series of clips shared by the BBC, everyday citizens can be seen challenging armed soldiers and standing in front of tanks trying to enter their hometowns. In one video, a man standing in front of a massive Russian tank tries to stop it with his bare hands. As he does, the tank pulls to a halt before the man slaps the bonnet and walks off. In another clip, a man pulls up beside a a Russian armoured vehicle and asks: ""Are you guys broken down?"". Soldiers respond, saying they've run out of fuel, before he jokes: ""Can I tow you back to Russia?"". Another shows a crowd of civilians cheering and whistling after a military vehicle bound for their town turns around. ""They haven't let the tanks into town, they turned them around"", one man says. In more videos of resistance, a Russian man who says he lives in Ukraine is seen blasting a pair of soldiers. ""You have your country and we have ours"", he says. Meanwhile Putin's war machine rumbles along, with footage from earlier today showing rockets hitting a civilian apartment block. It comes after Putin was accused of breaking international law by using deadly vacuum bombs. The bombs suck in energy from the surrounding area to generate extreme temperatures when it explodes. They are also capable of vaporising human bodies. It comes as Russia's defence ministry warned Ukrainians of looming airstrikes in Kyiv. Russian officials said they are preparing to launch ""high-precision strikes"" against ""technological centres of the Ukrainian Security Service and the 72nd main PsyOps centre in Kyiv"". The statement reads: ""We urge Ukrainian citizens who are being used by nationalists to carry out provocations against Russia, as well as Kyiv residents residing near relay stations to leave their home."" Earlier today Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was filmed raising his fist in solidarity as EU leaders gave him a standing ovation. Zelensky told the European Parliament that Ukraine was 'paying the ultimate price to defend freedom' during the video call. He told the EU lawmakers: “Do prove that you are with us. ""Do prove that you will not let us go. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness. Glory be to Ukraine.”",47,3.9194446342447087,2.8909673867622843,1.0284772474824244,28

The devastating blast took place just minutes after the Kremlin warned all Ukrainians to flee the region. It saw reverberations spreading far and wide, with Ukraine's adviser to the interior ministry squarely pointing the finger at Moscow. Footage circulating on social media shows thick plumes of black smoke spilling from the site in the district of Dorogozhychi - while air raid sirens reminded residents to race to bomb shelters. It is unclear if the tower was directly hit. Ukraine's official advisor to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Anton Herashchenko, confirmed the tower's signal had potentially been disrupted. Work will be done to restore any lost signal, according to local media. It comes as Vladimir Putin's devastating invasion showed no signs of slowing, with his government pre-warning those living near the hulking intelligence structure to evacuate. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog The attack happened a few hours after diplomats staged a mass walkout as the United Nation's Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov delivered a speech. According to Russian state-owned TV, the Ministry of Defence is planning further strikes on Ukrainian intel and Military Relay Facilities in Kyiv. Such strikes aim to prevent ""information attacks"" on Russia, says the Kremlin. In a statement issued this afternoon, the Russian defence ministry said it was planning to hit targets in Kyiv. Russian officials said their forces were preparing strikes on the ""technological centres of the Ukrainian Security Service and the 72nd main PsyOps centre in Kyiv"". The statement read: ""We urge Ukrainian citizens who are being used by nationalists to carry out provocations against Russia, as well as Kyiv residents residing near relay stations to leave their home."" Officials claimed the strikes are being carried out to ""prevent information attacks against Russia"". Putin launched a special military operation in his former fellow Soviet nation last week after supposedly responding to a request by the heads of so-called People's Republics in the Donbass border regions. They had been occupied by Moscow-backed separatists days before. He had said some Moscow troops - which numbered nearly 200,000 lying in wait on the Ukrainian border - would move across the border and act as peacemakers. Almost immediately after his TV address in the early hours of last Thursday, air raids began across Ukraine with the invading forces moving in on the capital over the weekend. Devastating air assaults and ground attacks have ensued on opposing military forces and civilians, including children, as the war rumbles into its sixth day. The Russian leader has always stressed that Moscow had ""no plans of occupying Ukrainian territories"". Though this has been contested by western powers who are aiming to heavily sanction Russia and cripple its economy. It is understood Putin had intended to move in and quickly take Kyiv within 48 hours, an alleged plan which if true has spectacularly failed. Russian troops are yet to take a major city or solidify any hold on those areas they have taken amid bloody combat. Both sides have suffered heavy losses.",47,3.936462277363237,3.3259234453778954,0.6105388319853415,28

The attack was in Okhtyrka in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region on Monday, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said on Facebook. Video footage shows the devastation at the scene, with piles of rubble, a burnt out building and car. Russia faces increasing isolation over its invasion of Ukraine, with fierce resistance on the ground denying President Vladimir Putin decisive early gains despite heavy shelling and a huge military convoy outside the capital, Kyiv. ""Barbaric rocket attacks and MLRS (multiple launch rocket systems) of peaceful cities are evidence that they are no longer able to fight armed Ukrainians,"" Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Facebook. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog Ceasefire talks between Russia and its southern neighbour held on Monday failed to reach a breakthrough and negotiators have not said when a new round would take place. ""What I think is pretty certain is Russia is off their timeline. I think they thought that within 72 hours they'd hold Kyiv,"" US Republican Senator Marco Rubio said after a classified briefing with top Biden administration officials. But fighting on several fronts was taking a toll. More than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency, setting off a refugee crisis as thousands await passage at European border crossings. Public health experts say Ukraine is running low on critical medical supplies and fears of a wider public health crisis are growing as people flee their homes and health services and supplies are interrupted. Washington has ruled out sending troops to fight Russia or enforcing a no-fly zone as requested by Ukraine, fearing an escalation between the world's top two nuclear powers. But, the United States and its allies have instead promised military aid to Kyiv, as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned the capital was under constant threat. A stream of companies pulling out of Russia is expected to grow today. Oil companies Shell, BP and Norway's Equinor have said they would exit positions in Russia, which relies on oil and gas for export earnings.",47,3.054835218167129,3.061986072534172,-0.007150854367043102,10
2022-03-01,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ruthless-warlord-who-led-gay-26354341,Ruthless warlord who led 'gay purges' in Chechnya killed fighting for Russia,"A despotic general who ruthlessly rounded up and killed LGBT+ people in an act that became known as the “gay purge” has been killed in the fighting in Ukraine. Magomed Tushayev, who was a military boss under the command of hardman Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, was killed in fighting at the Hostomel Airport, a key Russian target not far northwest of Kyiv. Tushayev previously led the 141 motorised regiment of the Checnyan National Guard and his death was confirmed by a spokesperson for Ukrainian president Vlodomyr Zelensky. Anti-LGBT+ purges were first reported in the southern Russian republic back in 2017 and reportedly involved kidnappings, torture and extrajudicial killings. Under the leadership of the infamous Kadyrov, who recently said Vlaidimir Putin needed harsher tactics in Ukraine, Tushayev was key in the persecution of LGBT+ people. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates The general was specifically implicated in playing a role in the 2021 kidnapping of activists and gay man Ibragim Selimkhanov, who was kidnapped from a Moscow subway station and bundled into a car and then a plane before he was flown to Grozny, Chechnya’s capital. He later questioned Selimkhanov, who then miraculously escaped back to Moscow. Tushayev's death came only a day after Kadyrov boasted his forces had not suffered a single loss. He said: “As of today, as of this minute, we do not have one single casualty, or wounded, not a single man has even had a runny nose. “The president (Putin) took the right decision and we will carry out his orders under any circumstances.” Chechen authorities always denied that an anti-LGBT+ crackdown occurred in the region. Yet at a Council of Europe meeting last year the suppression of gay people in Chechnya was described as ""the single most egregious example of violence against LGBTI people in Europe that has occurred in decades"". The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. This comes as Russia continues its push to try and seize key Ukrainian cities. In an intelligence update released this morning, the Ministry of Defence said that the Russian advance on the Ukrainian capital had made little progress overnight due to continuing logistical difficulties they believed. However, there have been reports of a huge 40 mile long convoy of Russian armour heading for Kyiv which may shift the balance of the fight in Putin’s favour. Throughout the night, Russian forces increased their bombardment of north Kyiv, and in the vicinities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Alongside that, a failure to seize control of airspace of Ukraine has seen Moscow’s forces shift to night time operations in an attempt to reduce their losses. As the invasion enters its sixth day, there have been warnings that Putin may turn to increasingly barbarous tactics to take control of Ukraine.",47,2.8486454063032505,4.310452512393401,-1.4618071060901507,8

Local reports indicate that a column of 33 Belarusian units has entered the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, north of the capital Kyiv. Only yesterday did peace talks between Ukraine and Russia take place on the border of Belarus and Ukraine, and the latest development comes only hours after Belarus said it would not be joining the fight. The Ukrainian Parliament confirmed the development: ""Belarusian troops have entered Chernihiv region. The information was confirmed to the public by Vitaliy Kyrylov, spokesman for the North Territorial Defense Forces. More details later."" Belarus has denied the claims, but has said it is sending troops to the Ukrainian border to stop 'provocations'. When war broke out, it was suspected that Russia's military - three times the size of Ukraine's - would be able to quickly take over the country without resorting to help from its allies. So why has Belarus invaded Ukraine? For real-time updates of the Russian war in Ukraine, follow the Mirror's live blog here Belarus is very much under the influence of the Kremlin with the two presidents having very close ties, though currently denies claims of an invasion. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, a vocal supporter of Putin, has previously earned himself the moniker of Europe's ""last dictator"" due to his uncompromising crushing of dissent by protestors, jailing innocent civilians and attempting to control the press. The election result in 2020 is heavily disputed and led to a mass crackdown on country-wide protests, with protesters outraged their basic right to vote had been so badly violated. While protestors took to the streets, Vladimir Putin gave Lukashenko his full backing both economically and politically, saving his presidency. As a result, Lukashenko is now in the debt of the Russian president. The Belarusian leader was once hailed as a hero of his country, but is now arguably in charge over little more than a proxy Russian state. As a result, now that the Russian troops have been met with such fierce resistance by Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, it appears Russia is looking for extra help in its mission to dominate the country. In the same way Putin views Ukraine, the Russian leader believes Belarus's cultural ties makes the country Russian. Similar to Ukraine, it is a former member of the Soviet Union. Experts believe that without a pro-Russian government in Minsk, Putin would also turn his troops to Belarus in the same way he has now done in Ukraine. As his pressure has increased, Belarus has been forced to do the bidding of the Russian president and the country has renounced its non-nuclear status, meaning that Russia can move nuclear weapons there.",7,3.238237551199765,3.0672547458428774,0.1709828053568878,10

2022-02-28,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/4-options-vladimir-putin-could-26351246,4 options Vladimir Putin could be considering as Ukraine resists Russian attacks,"Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine has rumbled into its second week but things are not quite going to plan. The Russian President and former KGB agent is understood to have been left ""humiliated"" after his goal to conquer his neighbours in 48 hours failed. Instead, his troops have been met with a plucky and brutal resistance, suffering their share of heavy losses on the ground despite moving in on Kyiv rapidly. The capital, as well as Kharkiv and Zhytomir, are under continued air strikes this evening as the first round of peace talks ended. The two sides met on the Belarusian border while invading forces clashed with opposing troops and civilians on a fifth day of conflict. In a worrying sign, Russia's defence ministry said its nuclear missile forces and Northern and Pacific fleets had been placed on enhanced combat duty. Click here to follow the Mirror's live blog on the Russia/Ukraine conflict Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, has said this evening he has signed a request to join the European Union, urging members to fast track the country on board. It comes as Russia faces deepening isolation and economic turmoil as Western nations, united in condemnation of its assault, attempt to cripple it with an array of sanctions. Ukraine's allies also increased weapons transfers in support, with Finland agreeing to ship 2,500 assault rifles and 1,500 anti-tank weapons. While Ukraine's resistance appears stronger than first anticipated, evidence points towards the Kremlin troops continuing to overmatch their opponents, according to expert Professor John R. Deni. The research professor of joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational (JIIM) security studies at the US Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute, told Al Jazeera : “I think the evidence points to continued Russian overmatch of Ukraine in terms of both capabilities and capacity. ""US officials have reported that somewhere between 50 and 70 per cent of available Russian forces have been committed so far, meaning there is still lots of nearby Russian military power left to commit.” However, the lack of progress has raised questions. Prof Deni added: ""In terms of the operations, there are some anomalies that do not make sense to me, including the inability of Russian forces to successfully and conclusively establish air dominance over Ukraine, the inability of Russian forces to retain control and exploit the capture of the Antonov International Airport outside Kyiv, and the evident difficulty Russian forces are experiencing in term of coordination."" Nevertheless, it still remains widely accepted that it's a case of if rather when the Ukrainian capital falls to the Moscow onslaught. The two sides met on the Belarusian border today for the first round of peace talks. The content and exact position they are in, thus far, has not been made public but discussions did last for several hours, and included two breaks, according to reports. Negotiators are returning to Moscow and Kyiv, respectively, for consultations before further rounds. Russian delegation head, Vladimir Medinsky, said the two sides had “agreed to keep the negotiations going.” It would appear Putin's endgame would be to either install a puppet government, with the country under his control, or potentially leave Zelensky in charge but with his powers largely stripped and Moscow absorbs Ukraine under something of a neo-Soviet regime. Putin has said his aim is to ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" his neighbours, suggesting he wants to neutralise them as a threat and take revenge for a largely misplaced wrongdoing. Putin has ordered Russia's nuclear deterrent forces raise their alert status to the highest level. It is the first time nuclear weapons have been readied since the Yom Kippur war in 1973 - though such devastating weapons have not actually been deployed since 1945. Russia’s Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that the West had taken “unfriendly actions” towards Moscow. He also added Western sanctions were “illegitimate” and so Russia had put its nukes on “a special regime of duty” - though it's clear exactly what that means. Dr Matthew Harries senior research fellow at the defence think-tank Rusi told iNews : “Any use of a nuclear weapon by Putin would be ruinous for him. ""It could be Russia is planning a brutal escalation in Ukraine and this is a ‘keep out’ warning to the West. Or designed to show that Putin will not allow himself to be removed from office."" He said there is a risk, however, of such threats being misjudged leading to ""escalation through brinkmanship"". Putin warned last week on announcing the special military operations, before things quickly moved into full-scale invasion, that there would be unthinkable consequences for any nation standing in his way. Dr Harries said if the Russian leader interprets certain types of Western assistance to Ukraine's war effort as constituting ""direct military intervention"" this could trigger deliberate deployment of nuclear weaponry. “The risks of nuclear escalation from Russia’s invasion are real and should be taken seriously. This has been known from the outset and is a primary reason why the West is not intervening directly with military force,"" he added. Putin knew when he invaded Ukraine that Russia's military dwarfs that of his former Soviet colleagues. He also knew NATO wouldn't send in troops to help, due to a fear of escalating a world war and because Ukraine is not a member state. While European dependence on Russian oil and gas means countries like Germany would think twice about imposing harsh sanctions. And so with that in mind, Putin appears to have aimed at a swift defeat of Ukraine while riding out any western sanctions. But that hasn't been the case so far. If figures coming out of Ukraine can be believed, he has already lost thousands of military personnel, and has failed to take any major cities or even comfortably fortify the areas that have fallen to him. History has shown the idea of holding onto power and control in a defeated nation can prove far more difficult than actually successfully invading it. The Ukrainians have shown in their brave refusal to back down that installing a puppet government and trying to have his way, will not be an easy task should he win. If he gives up, without making any grounds in Ukraine, it will be a humiliating defeat. He will likely be ostracised almost entirely by the West and his regime could be forced to collapse. Russia would have to continue dealing with the sanctions placed on it, without its prize, too. But in that regard it may be fairly well-placed to ride them out, according to one expert. Stanford University expert Kathryn Stoner told Politico Russia could "" weather the already stiff sanctions"" due to its strong independent back bone.

In the clip they are heard shouting as they chuck the homemade explosives - also called petrol bombs - from their car at the larger armoured vehicle before flames erupt. It comes after Ukraine's Ministry of Defence began instructing its citizens to use the incendiary weapons in the fight against invading Moscow forces. A how-to picture guide poster also released by the ministry points out which parts of different military vehicles should be targeted in such attacks. The bombs are packed with grated plastic and filled with petrol and are like hurling napalm as they stick and burn, destroying tyres, while occupants can choke.

Over the weekend, volunteer fighters were seen patrolling with guns and making the 'cocktails' on live TV in the city of Dnipro - 243 miles southeast of capital Kyiv. They could be seen gathering around a box of shredded flammable polystyrene, stuffing it into glass bottles before topping them up with fuel and cloth to ignite. The furious citizens sang out derogatory chants and profanity about Russian President Vladimir Putin in unison. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made several calls to action, urging his people to fight for freedom. He ordered all men ages 18-60 to stay and fight and has been arming citizens with weapons. He too has stayed in Kyiv despite claiming he is the Kremlin's ""number one"" target and fears for his family's life. Putin's war has rumbled into its second week but things are not quite going to plan. The Russian President and former KGB agent is understood to have been left ""humiliated"" after his goal to conquer his neighbours in 48 hours failed. Instead, his troops have been met with a plucky and brutal resistance, suffering their share of heavy losses on the ground despite moving in on Kyiv rapidly. The capital, as well as Kharkiv and Zhytomir, are under continued air strikes this evening as the first round of peace talks ended. The two sides met on the Belarusian border while invading forces clashed with opposing troops and civilians on a fifth day of conflict. In a worrying sign, Russia's defence ministry said its nuclear missile forces and Northern and Pacific fleets had been placed on enhanced combat duty. Zelensky, meanwhile, has said this evening he has signed a request to join the European Union, urging members to fast track the country on board.",7,2.994789137232186,2.74698456208363,0.2478045751485558,28

Russian forces and pro-Kremlin saboteurs have allegedly been marking buildings with the chilling messages to aid Vladimir Putin ’s troops. It comes as Russia continues its attack on Ukraine, with Putin having ordered part of his nuclear forces to be on enhanced combat duty in an alarming escalation of tensions. Alarming images show apartment buildings in Kyiv with red crosses on their roofs, presumably marking them for airstrikes. According to Sun Online reports, footage shared on Twitter allegedly shows a pro-Russian marking the location on a high-rise residential building, to allow Moscow’s forces to target it for maximum impact. Authorities in Kyiv are urging its citizens to be vigilant for any suspicious symbols or marks. Click here to follow the Mirror's live blog on the Russia/Ukraine conflict ""Residents of high-rise buildings that have access to the roof, please urgently check the roof for signs,"" the Kyiv local Government said on social media. ""Tags on wood can be either painted or covered with reflective tape,"" another warning said. Residents are being urged to smear such signs with dirt, knock them down, or otherwise cover the marks up. Other sinister gadgets believed to be being used by Russian forces included homing transmitters allowing enemy weapons to silently pinpoint specific targets - which Ukrainian authorities say are appearing on significant road intersections. A video shared on social media depicts a mysterious transmitting item with a green flashing light, which was reportedly captured by Ukrainians from the Russians. A caption reads: ""Footage of the device that is used by Russian saboteur units in Ukraine. ""The light-emitting object has been retrieved by Ukrainian forces. ""These are beacons that are used for either airstrikes, artillery strikes or for the landing of Russian troops."" Suspicious activity has been reported by Kyiv residents on social media, with footage of people appearing to place marker pins and UV signs being widely circulated. A Ukrainian news agency has also shared a short video filmed from a high rise, showing a figure appearing to mark a gas pipe on the side of an apartment building. A caption accompanying the video reads: ""Warning! The saboteurs placed many marks around the city. ""In particular, ballistic. And today Kyivans filmed how gas pipes are marked on apartment buildings. ""Be vigilant! As soon as you see this, contact the police immediately!"" Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv’s mayor, has urged residents to remain vigilant for any potential symbols springing up to guide Russian missiles and report suspicious activity they do see. He has also accused Ukrainian collaborators of ""treason"" and threatened to jail anyone who helped Putin’s invaders. Other suspected markers are small reflective tags, which were believed to have a similar effect to an aircraft transponder, in reflecting and amplifying any radar pulse that hits it to stand out among the rubble. Police have urged residents in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv to use backlights or UV lights to help them detect fluorescent paint. These markings were used by Russian agents who had infiltrated the city to direct missile strikes, they said. Warnings about the old school war tactics come as satellite imagery has highlighted a large deployment of Russian ground forces including tanks moving in the direction of Kyiv. The images released by Maxar Technologies Inc showed a deployment comprised of hundreds of military vehicles. The convey was situated northeast of the Ukrainian city of Ivankiv and contained fuel, logistics and armoured vehicles including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery. Russian artillery bombarded residential districts of Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv on Monday, killing possibly dozens of people, Ukrainian officials said. Moscow's invading forces however met stiff resistance from Ukrainians on the fifth day of conflict. The attacks took place while Russian and Ukrainian officials met on the Belarusian border, but their talks made no breakthrough. Russia also faced deepening isolation and economic turmoil as Western nations, united in condemnation of its assault, hit it with an array of sanctions that rippled around the world.",47,3.2514533466258855,2.797991138628135,0.4534622079977506,28

Some of the harrowing images are heartbreaking. Most of them are so horrifically graphic they cannot be published here. But their parents insist the world should see what Vladimir Putin is doing to their families. And it was claimed the Russian army are even using controversial banned cluster bombs - one hit a kindergarten killing two adults and a child. Another exploded in Kharkiv today. Some of the most shocking scenes were filmed with the permission of doctors. A six-year-old girl was killed while she was wearing her pink unicorn pyjamas. The unnamed girl died when a shell hit her parents’ apartment in Mariupol. Despite frantic efforts to save her, she died. During the rescue attempt, a doctor in blue medical scrubs, pumping oxygen into the girl, looked directly into the video camera capturing the scene. He shouts angrily: “Show this to Putin. The eyes of this child, and crying doctors.” A woman, believed to be her mum, is carrying the girl’s slippers, a pompom scarf and bobble hat. Then the girl’s dad, holding his lifeless child’s hand, as the paramedic performs CPR on her tiny body. He is crying while covered in blood. A team of doctors then carry her into the hospital. Seven doctors work on her body, which is still being gripped by her praying father. The final image shows the child alone on a gurney in an empty ward, having been declared dead. She and 15 others have paid the ultimate price. Another 112 have been injured - some with life-changing injuries. The Deputy Mayor of Kyiv shared a photo of an 11-year-old girl named Polina, who was killed while in a car with her family. She was in her last year of primary school and died while trying to escape the capital in a car with her parents. Her younger brother and sister were taken to hospital, where they are in intensive care. The mayor said: “Her name was Polina. She studied in the 4th grade of school in Kyiv. “This morning on Teligi her and her parents were shot by Russian DRG.” Elsewhere, seven-year-old Alisa Hlans was killed in the cluster bomb attack that hit the kindergarten in Okhtyrka. Amnesty International said cluster bombs - which contain multiple lethal explosive submunitions - were being used. Secretary general Agnes Callamard said: “There is no possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school.” She tweeted: “Cluster munitions kill child and two other civilians taking shelter at a preschool in Ukraine. “This attack bears all the hallmarks of Russia use of this banned and inherently indiscriminate weapon, and shows flagrant disregard for civilian life.” Another boy was killed when a block of flats caught fire after being shelled in Chuhuiv, a small town outside Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv. Children including those diagnosed with cancer were moved to the basement of Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital Fighting was fiercest in the eastern city of Kharkiv. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Kyiv’s interior minister said Russian troops had bombarded residential areas with Grad missiles, saying: “Dozens have been killed and hundreds wounded! “The whole world must see this horror! Death to the occupiers!” While fighting continued across the country the expected massive Russian air blitz did not take place. Kyiv was fairly quiet overnight but there is a huge Russian build up of tanks 20 miles to the north. Chernihiv in the north-east faced heavy shelling from Russian troops overnight, but remained in Ukrainian hands. Mariupol residents said the port city on the sea of Azov was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. The Ministry of Defence tweeted an intelligence update on the situation. It said: “The bulk of Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. “Heavy fighting continues around Chernihiv and Kharkiv however both cities remain under Ukrainian control. “Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance. “Despite continued attempts to suppress details of the conflict from the Russian population, the Russian Armed Forces has for the first time been forced to acknowledge suffering casualties.” One female Ukrainian MP - Kira Rudik, the leader of the Voice party in the parliament - said she was confident she could shoot a Russian soldier if one came to her home. She said: “I don’t have any plans to leave. This is my city, this is my country, and I plan to defend it for as long as will be needed. “There is no chance that some Russian crazy dictator would be able to push me away from where I live and where I love.” Rudik is one of many who have taken up the offer of arming themselves, with military forces looking to bolster key positions. She said: “We received rifles in the Ukrainian parliament and for the last couple of days I was training to use it, so right now I’m pretty confident I would be able to shoot somebody if they come to my home. “I assembled a resistance crew which now consists of 15 people, and we were able to stand up for ourselves and help our army patrol the streets.” Tonight it emerged Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly killed on Snake island are still alive, according to a statement posted on Facebook by Ukraine’s naval services. “We are very happy to learn that our brothers are alive and well,” the statement said. It continued: “The sailors rebuked twice the attacks of the Russian invaders but could no longer continue to protect the island.” Ukrainian officials said approximately 5,300 Russian troops have been killed and claimed that 191 tanks, 29 fighter jets, 29 helicopters and 816 armoured personnel carriers have been destroyed by Ukraine’s forces. The United Nations’ refugee agency said 422,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries.",47,4.1484270845957445,3.3626060001429985,0.785821084452746,0

More troops have joined the shifts at Russia's nuclear missile forces, Northern and Pacific fleets, where they have increased preparations for ""combat duty"", according to Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. The move was in line in a new order from Putin on Sunday, February 27, Russian news agency Interfax, reports. The Russian leader ordered his military command to put Russia's deterrence forces - which include nuclear arms - on high alert,citing what he called aggressive statements by NATO leaders and Western economic sanctions against Moscow. Putin has reportedly blamed statements by Liz Truss, the UK Foreign Secretary for the nuclear threat. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin that ""shifts on duty at the command posts of the Strategic Missile Forces, the Northern and Pacific Fleets, and the Long-Range Aviation Command began to carry out combat duty with reinforced personnel"", Interfax reports. Liz Truss has backed Brits travelling to Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion calling it a ""just cause"". Responding to Peskov’s accusation, an ally of Truss told The Sunday Times: “Nothing Liz has said warrants that sort of escalation. It’s clearly designed to distract from the situation on the ground in Ukraine."" The latest move by Putin has been condemned by Western leaders with the United States describing it as an escalation of the situation. A senior U.S. defence official said it was ""putting in play forces that, if there's a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous."" Russian forces have come up against tough Ukrainian resistance after launching a full scale invasion last week. Putin has justified his attack, claiming he is liberating Ukraine from ""neo-Nazi"" rule which threatens Russia's security - a charge Kyiv and Western governments say is baseless propaganda. The Russian leader has been described as ""delusional"" by his own people who have taken to the streets of St Petersburg in protest. Western intelligence also suggested last week that Putin had ""greatly"" underestimated the challenge of invading, believing he would conquer the capital in two days. Instead Russian troops have reportedly suffered 'heavy' casualties as the UK defence ministry said that they had failed to take control of Ukrainian airspace over the weekend. Passionate Ukraine civilians have responded to calls from their President, Volodymyr Zelensky and have taken up arms as they prepare to fight for their country and freedom.

Follow all the updates on our live blog Civilians were warned they risked being 'liquidated' if they stepped outside. The Times reports that a source close to The Wagner Group, which is run by one of Putin's closest friends, said between 2,000 and 4,000 mercenaries are operating across the whole Ukraine with the 400 in the capital having slid into Kyiv via Belarus. It is hoped that peace talks, set to get underway today, may begin to de-escalate the war although there are also fears Belarus could soon send troops into Ukraine, backing their long-time ally Russia. But it is not known how serious Russia are about the talks or what their demands will be five days after invading Ukraine following weeks of troop build up along the border. The Wagner Group mercenaries are in contact with the Kremlin are awaiting a signal before unleashing bloodshed on the streets, The Times says, with a hitlist that contains Zelensky and 23 other figures including the prime minister, the cabinet, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir, both popular former boxing champions. After Moscow invaded last week, Zelensky addressed the nation, claiming that Russian special forces were in the capital searching for him as “target No 1”. However when he was offered the chance to flee by America he said: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” Boris Johnson has said Britain will do all it can to get more arms to the beleaguered Ukrainian military as Russian forces continue to threaten Kyiv. The Prime Minister spoke again on Sunday evening to President Zelensky who told him the next 24 hours would a ""crucial period"" for his country. Russian and Ukrainian forces have again been engaged in heavy fighting ahead of the widely expected assault on the capital. Earlier, Mr Johnson dismissed a dramatic announcement by Vladimir Putin that he was putting Russia's nuclear forces on heightened alert as a ""distraction"" from the failure of his troops to breakthrough in Ukraine. President Putin sent shock waves through Western capitals with his instruction on Sunday to his top military leaders to put the strategic nuclear deterrent on a ""special regime of combat duty"".

According to British and Ukrainian defence sources, Putin believed he could capture the capital city of Kyiv and four other major cities within 48 hours of launching the invasion. He was confident that President Volodymyr Zelensky would surrender and sign Ukraine over quickly, The Times reports. Unfortunately for Putin, Russian troops have faced fierce resistance from Ukrainian troops and citizens. Ukrainian diplomat Dymytro Tetriakov, first secretary at the embassy in London, told The Times that Russia's invasion hasn't gone according to plan because Ukraine ""is our soil, our families, our homes."" Follow all the updates on our live blog He added that the Ukrainian people and military, with support from their allies across the world, had ""no fear"". Ukrainian forces have so far surpassed expectations by preventing Russia from gaining control of their airspace. They also blew up tanks, armoured vehicles, and brought down cruise missiles sent from Russia with a comparatively tiny army. Ukraine only has 196,600 troops against Russia's 900,000 but have so far slowed the invading forces. Russia has suffered heavy casualties as the invasion enters its fourth day, with The Economist reporting on Friday that the Russian army has had more casualties in 24 hours than in eight years fighting in Syria. The Kremlin is yet to acknowledge any widespread casualties or issues with the invasion. Some reports have also claimed that Russian soldiers are now refusing to fight. Taras Kuzio, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, said today: ""Ukrainian News Channel 24: 5,000 Russian soldiers in staging area in Russia, North of Kharkiv, have revolted and are refusing to attack Ukraine."" Kuzio also claimed that reports from the front lines near Crimea showed ""1/2 of Russian soldiers have turned over their equipment to the Ukrainians, again refusing to fight."" There seems to widespread anger against Putin in Russia over the invasion, with many Russians protesting in Moscow while some government employees have resigned as a result. These reports were followed Russian soldiers yesterday (February 27) advanced into the city centre of Kharkiv but were pushed back by local forces and later captured. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv Oblast, said that the soldiers had been taken into custody by the Ukrainian army. He said: ""The Russian soldiers, who were taken captive, talk about total extortion and demoralisation, they have nothing to do with the central command, do not understand and do not know their further actions. ""Since the beginning of the attack on Ukraine they do not receive food and water, the technology has no fuel supplies."" Around 22,000 Ukrainian troops have been trained by the British Army since 2015, which could explain their ability to hold their own against Russia – especially if Russian troops are ""very green"". Kevin Price, a former major who served 20 years with the British military, told The Times that the soldiers advancing were inexperienced in comparison to Ukrainian forces who have massively improved in recent years. He added that the current military strategy does not make much sense, asking: ""Is Putin just throwing in a whole bunch of youngsters to the fight to get the sense of what Ukrainian forces are like, and holding back the more battle-ready troops?""",7,3.102536392009972,3.2324520338292717,-0.1299156418192995,10

The Washington Post, citing an unnamed US official, said that Belarus was preparing for a troop deployment that could begin as soon as today. Belarus's armed forces include nearly 45,000 military personnel, according to local media, and it is thought that those deployed to Ukraine could be sent to the Kyiv or the Zhytomyr areas. Belarusian opposition media has launched an anti-war campaign, including a video from former high-ranking Belarusian airborne commander Valeriy Sakhashik.

Riho Terras, who is also the former defence chief of NATO member Estonia, tweeted: ""Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days. “The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered."" He also claimed the reports shows that the Russian military doesn't have a ""tactical plan"" to take Ukraine. Mr Terras added that Putin's invasion plan relied on “sowing panic among civilians and armed forces and forcing [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky to flee"". Mr Terras also shared an image of what appears to be an intelligence report that is in Russian and wrote: ""Putin is raging. He was sure it would be a cakewalk.” US Defense officials yesterday said Russian forces are growing increasingly frustrated at the Ukrainian resistance. Images show civilians taking up arms to fight alongside Ukrainian forces, making Molotov cocktails and blocking roads. Mr Terras, citing the intelligence report, said the Russian military has enough rockets only for three or four days. He said the intel report said that ""there are not enough weapons"" as fresh sanctions imposed on Russia are hoped to cripple the country's economy and force Putin to withdraw his troops. Mr Terras said the war was costing £14.9billion a day and added: ""If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. “Because they have no money, weapons, or resources.” He also added that Putin is currently in his ""lair in the Urals"" and has brought Russian oligarchs with him so they couldn’t flee the country. It comes as Putin today praised his special forces for “heroically carrying out their military duties” in his Ukrainian invasion. Zelensky has since stood firm in his position to not back down as he refused to enter negotiations with the Russian government. This morning he said the Kremlin said a delegation has arrived in Homel, Belarus for talks with their Ukrainian counterparts. Zelensky said: ""If there had been no aggressive action from your territory, we could talk in Minsk... other cities can be used as the venue for talks. ""Of course we want peace, we want to meet, we want the war to end. Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku - we've offered them to the Russians.

The MEP tweeted: ""The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered. ""The Ukrainians must avoid panic! . "" Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance.""

But the UK Defence Secretary says the invasion failed to achieve its targets on the first day and that the attacking forces had lost 450 men. Kremlin soldiers are closing in on Kyiv on only day two of the Russian invasion. In the early hours of this morning, the capital city was pummelled by missile strikes that left plumes of smoke rising above the city, and residential blocks and homes in ruin. Air raid sirens sounded as many residents fled to underground bomb shelters for the night as missiles struck the city around 4am local time. And now, as fighting has reached the outskirts of the city, it will increase worries that the capital of 2.8million people, known as the ‘mother of Russian cities’ will fall into Moscow’s hands. However, despite Russia's advances, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he thought the invasion was failing to achieve its aims. Speaking to Sky News, he said: ""Our assessment as of this morning is that Russia has not taken any of its major objectives, in fact it is behind its hopeful timetable. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates “They’ve lost over 450 personnel and… one of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite Spetsnaz has failed to be taken, and in fact the Ukrainians have taken it back.” The UK was not alone in that assessment, the Ukraine defence ministry echoed Wallace’s claims. Outside the northern city of Chernihiv, Ukrainian troops halted the Russian march, and fighting continues outside the city according to the country’s Ministry of Defence. The country’ Ministry of Defence said that it thought Russia had failed to achieve its day one objectives and had been met with “fierce resistance” across all fronts. Speaking about the nighttime barrages, Ukrainian interior ministry advisor Anton Gerashchenko said: “Air defence of Kyiv shot down missiles fired by the invaders. We stand.” He also claimed a Russian warplane was shot down by Ukrainian air defence forces and fell in the Darnytskyi district near a residential house. The deputy head of Ukraine ’s defence ministry said there had been six major explosions. The secretary of state also added that it was believed Russia intended to take the entire country, but there have been some questions raised how it intends to maintain this control. He added: “I certainly think what Putin is doing is deeply irrational. I certainly think he has gone full tonto, that’s what I said the other day talking to some soldiers. “But that’s no comfort to the people of Kyiv.” Speaking to BBC Breakfast later on, he confirmed that no British troops would be sent in to fight. He said: “No. We are not going to be sending British troops to fight directly with Russian troops. “We’re going to hold the line in NATO. We’ve always supported Ukraine’s application to NATO over the last 15 years, not every country has wanted them to join. “That would trigger a European war, because we are a NATO country.” In the Black Sea, there were claims that 13 border guards had been killed in a Russian missile strike on strategic Snake Island, near the mouth of the Danube, after refusing to surrender to Putin’s forces.

Lay down the arms, and give up - or else you will be bombed. “I repeat: I am a Russian combat ship, give up your arms and surrender, or else you’ll be bombed.” The defiant reply from the Ukrainian border guards said: “F*** off Russian combat ship.” Seconds later the border guard base on the island was hit by a blitzkrieg, according to Ukrainian interior ministry advisor Anton Gerashenko. He said: “I heard two explosions. It was either cruise or ballistic missiles…. “Then the missile and artillery strike began. 13 Ukrainian border guards died. “Perhaps the brave hero who told them to F off just like Zaporozhian Cossacks said to enemies of Ukraine in the past also died. “Eternal glory to the Heroes! Shame and death to the Russian occupiers!”",47,2.9563015515761406,3.270046942144845,-0.31374539056870443,10
2022-02-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/disguised-russian-special-forces-killed-26327804,Moment Ukrainian troops lie in wait for Russian invasion only 5 miles from Kyiv,"Brave Ukrainian troops are positioned on the streets of capital Kyiv ready to block Russian invaders. A striking image shows soldiers preparing for battle as the government calls on civilians to help drive Vladimir Putin's forces out of the country. Earlier today attackers who seized two Ukrainian army trucks and dressed in enemy uniforms to launch an assault on the city were killed, officials announced. Civilians have been urged to target invaders using petrol bombs, with Ukrainian men aged between 18 and 60 barred from leaving the country and told to take up arms. This morning Ukrainian deputy defence minister Anna Maliar said enemy troops had driven two Ukrainian army trucks into Kyiv, followed by a convoy of military trucks. In a Facebook post she said the Russians were “moving at speed"" to the centre of Kiev, adding: “They will surely be destroyed.” Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates Less than an hour later she said that the convoy had been stopped. Fierce fighting is now taking place on the streets of Kyiv. Footage was posted on Twitter by journalist Alexander Khrebet purportedly showing a dead Russian troop in a Ukrainian uniform. Mr Khrebet wrote: ""Russian troops dressed up like Ukrainian military uniforms eliminated in Obolon district, Kyiv."" It is the latest in a string of claims that Russian forces have been donning the uniforms of peacekeeping and Ukrainian forces. The National Police yesterday claimed that Putin's troops had used the insignia of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as they bore down on cities across Ukraine. A statement said: “Columns of Russian tanks entered the Luhansk region at the borders of Krasnaya Talovka, Milove, and Gorodishche. The enemy insidiously placed white vehicles with OSCE symbols at the front. Fighting is currently underway there."" Meanwhile Mayor Ruslan Serpeninov, of Sarny, Rivne, told residents that Russian sabotage and reconnaissance units were wearing Ukrainian police and military uniforms after crossing from Belarus, the Daily Beast reports. The government called on civilians to report any movement of enemy equipment and to fight back against Vladimir Putin's forces. It also warned ""peaceful"" citizens not to leave their homes as cities endure heavy shelling from Russian forces. An official government Twitter account this morning said: ""We ask citizens to inform about the movement of equipment! ""Make Molotov cocktails, neutralise the occupier! Peaceful residents - be careful! Do not leave the house!"" Last night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 137 civilians and military personnel had been killed on the first day of the Russian attack. Mr Zelensky described those who died as ""heroes"" in a video address in the early hours of the morning. He added that 316 people had been wounded, although the true number is likely to be far higher. Describing the invaders, the Ukrainian president said: “They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven."" Mr Zelensky said the Russian military's claim it is not targeting civilian areas is ""a lie"". Attacks have continued through the night with homes wiped out by Russian missiles. Vitaly Klitschko, mayor of capital city Kyiv, said at least three people were injured when a rocket hit a multi-storey apartment building in Ukraine's capital on Friday, starting a fire. The Mirror's chief reporter Andy Lines, who is in the Ukrainian capital, said this morning: ""I had to be evacuated twice to an underground car park after air raid sirens sounded. ""I watched several Ukrainian armoured personnel carriers race through one of the city’s main thoroughfares which was deserted. ""Thousands continue to flee west to escape the incoming Russian forces."" Higher than usual gamma radiation levels have been detected in the area near the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, after it was seized by the Russian military, according to Ukraine's nuclear energy regulatory agency. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate said on Friday that higher gamma radiation levels have been detected in the Chernobyl zone, but did not provide details of the increase. It attributed the rise to a ""disturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the air"". Ukrainian authorities said that Russia took the plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle on Thursday. A Ukrainian MP said “that’s exactly why I’m looking at my AK-47 in front of me” when he was asked about the Russia invasion closing in on Kyiv. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Sviatoslav Yurash said he was readying to fight the Russians himself if necessary with his own gun. Kyiv citizens have been urged to make their own molotov cocktails as part of the defence of the capital. Yurash said: ""This is a full-scale invasion intending to destroy the Ukrainian state and take it over. “We will fight with everything we have and all the support the world can provide us. ""We are arming people who will be taking that fight to the Russians in every way. “We are a nation of 40 million people and we are not going to just stand idly by as Russia does as it wants all across its borders."" Martial law has been announced in Ukraine following the invasion in the early hours of Thursday. In a statement the interior ministry said: “The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine reports that due to the imposition of martial law in Ukraine, a certain category of citizens is temporarily restricted from leaving Ukraine. “In particular, male citizens of Ukraine aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine. Such a rule will apply for the period of martial law. We ask citizens to take this information into account.”",47,3.2881962220081298,3.3907185413364953,-0.10252231932836553,10

The Sky News crews had been reporting from the southeast of the country when shells dropped from the sky. The dramatic clip shows Sky correspondent Alex Rossi scrambling for cover with his camera crews as the shelling descended in the coastal city of Berdyansk, just 50 miles from strategically vital city of Mariupol. After getting to safety in a nearby building, Alex told viewers: ""It just shows how quickly things can change here. We were outside filming. ""[It was] really calm. There had been shells that had come in this morning. But again, it had gone quiet, everything felt very, very normal. Follow our live blog of the Russia Ukraine conflict here ""We’ve just had to come in here to take cover because there’s been incoming mortar fire."" Mariupol is the most important Ukrainian port in the Azov Sea but mainly handles smaller ships between 3,000 to 10,000 tonnes deadweight, the Mail reports. But the city appears to have come under attack by Russian forces as Putin attempts to cripple the Ukrainian economy by destroying the vital shipping route. The port alongside others connected to the Avoz Sea is a major exporting route for goods such as wheat, barley and corn to Mediterranean importers including Turkey, Italy, Cyprus, Egypt and Lebanon. Russian troops have already been deployed to guard the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, launch strikes on key airbases and surrounded Kyiv on three sides as they attempt to take the city. Fears have been raised about increased levels of radiation after Russian forces took over the Chernobyl exclusion zone and disturbed the top soil, kicking up radioactive dust. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. But Russia has refuted Ukrainian officials claims that there has been any increase in gamma radiation. Speaking in a televised statement this morning, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was Russia's ""number one target"" and feared he would be abducted in an effort to topple the country's political system. He said: “According to our information, the enemy marked me as target number one, my family as target number two. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state. We have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv.” Zelensky is in hiding but claimed he was still in Kyiv last night as he resists fleeing his capital. “I am staying in the government quarter together with others,” he said.",47,4.324750329854645,2.094363443930271,2.2303868859243736,8
2022-02-25,Mirror,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/how-many-people-died-ukraine-26328492,Death toll in Ukraine rises as troops and civilians killed in brutal Russian war,"When Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, he signed the death warrants of thousands of people. As fighting continues to rage, Ukraine refuses to surrender to Russian troops in cities all over the country. Around 10 million people are believed to have fled their homes, including 3.5 million who have left the country altogether. Missiles have crashed into residential buildings causing large parts of cities like Kharkiv, Mariupol and the capital of Kyiv to be destroyed. Putin's aggression has had huge consequences, with peace on the continent of Europe shattered and sanctions seemingly the only answer without a full-scale world war breaking out. Ukrainians can only hope said sanctions by NATO states and the EU will help their cause, while protesters on the streets of Moscow and Saint Petersburg risk jail to protest their disgust. Thousands have already died, including soldiers on both sides and hundreds of civilians, but the exact death toll is not entirely clear, despite a supposed 'leak' by pro-Kremlin Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) says 925 civilians have been killed and another 1,496 wounded in Ukraine. Of these, 75 are believed to be children and these are the most recent figures posted by OHCHR on March 20. The actual death count is likely to be much higher than this. In terms of soldier casualties, this figure is heavily disputed. Both sides have an incentive to suggest that their figures are a particular number and it is widely believed, based on various reports, that the Kremlin has not posted the true death toll and casualty lists. However, pro-Putin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda briefly published a toll yesterday in which it cited the Russian Ministry of Defence as a source, saying that 9,861 Russian soldiers had been killed and 16,153 injured since the invasion of Ukraine. The general conclusion from a number of reporters is that either the site was hacked, or the information was leaked onto the site and quickly removed. The site administrators have since said: ""On March 21, access to the administrator interface was hacked on the Komsomolskaya Pravda website and a fake stuffing was made in this publication about the situation around the special operation in Ukraine."" So far, Moscow has confirmed 498 soldiers dead, though this was only as recent as March 2. US intelligence reports recently put the figure at around 7,000, while the Ukrainians claimed it is around 14,000. As for Ukrainian troops, a March 13 estimate by Ukraine put the death toll of its soldiers at around 1,300. Fighting in Ukraine continues to be fierce in some parts and Ukraine has Kremlin intends to use chemical weapons in the country in the south of the country. In the capital, the closest Russian troops are now reported to be roughly 15 miles from the city centre. There is also real concern that the Putin intends to use them himself. The bombing of civilian areas has been indiscriminate and Russian troops have not shied away from raining down bombs on the heads of innocent people. Russia is currently accusing Ukraine of having biological weapons, to which US President Joe Biden said the claims may be a sign 'clear evidence' of Russian war crimes. He said: ""[Putin’s] back is against the wall and now he’s talking about new false flags."" The Pentagon has said there is also 'clear evidence' of Russian war crimes.",47,5.171113516944416,3.5258316118870057,1.6452819050574106,5

The bloody image of Helena has been one of the most noticeable during the Russian invasion of Ukraine so far. It shows the 53-year-old teacher bloodied and bandaged after she was badly injured during a Russian bombardment of the northern Ukraine city of Chuhuiv. During the relentless missile strikes on the city, Helena was hurt by shards of glass that cut open her head. She was photographed bandaged up outside a burnt out apartment building that had also been the victim of Russian bombings. This became one the iconic pictures of the early hours and days of the Russian invasion, and was a precursor for the violence and death that would follow. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates Her injuries were down to the ongoing Russian missile strikes on cities which have been ongoing since the invasion first began. A number of cities and major urban centres and air bases have been targeted. In Kyiv, residens were pictured taking cover underground in bomb shelters to escape the deadly blasts. The capital is also now the site of increased conflict as Russian forces move closer and closer, with reports that Russian special forces are already inside. Ukrainian troops have set up in the centre of the city along with armoured vehicles and support, awaiting Russian forces. MPs have also been given weapons, one of the clearest indications that the fighting will reach the capital’s heart sooner rather than later. Since then, hundreds have died on both sides, with the invading Russian forces suffering the heaviest casualties. As of last night, at least 450 Russian troops had been killed, but the figure would have risen since then. Around the same time, Ukraine had suffered 137 casualties and 316 injuries. As the invasion continues into its second day, there are more and more reports of gunfire and conflict from the outskirts of and within Kyiv. Ukraine continues to fight invasion four front, and has been successful in repelling and holding up Russian forces on some occasions. Outside Helena’s city of Chuhuiv, Ukraine forces held up the Russian advance and kept it from entering into the city. Fighting continued outside the city. Chaos continues across Ukraine as many have tried to flee their homes in face of the oncoming invasion. On the morning of the first invasion, thousands could be seen trying to leave Kyiv by car, clogging up the roads out of the city. Since then, a number of countries have committed to taking in Ukrainian refugees and the Moldovan President Maia Sandu confirmed they had received 4,000 refugees in the first day only.",47,2.6292465212764884,1.926153506731487,0.7030930145450014,10

Even now more Chechens are deploying from their hometown Grozny, escalating fears the battle for Ukraine will turn into an horrific bloodbath. Among the Chechen battalions are believed to be special forces kill squads deployed to focus on key members of the Ukrainian government with President Volodymyr Zelensky target number one. One British military source told the Daily Mirror: “These Chechen forces are tough, battle-hardened and utterly ruthless. Follow our live blog of the Russia Ukraine conflict here “They are likely to have little regard for civilian lives as they focus on their mission.” There are now believed to be more than 200,000 Russian troops in Ukraine as waves of Moscow’s tanks poured into the region as reinforcements. So far more than 1,000 Russian troops have been killed by a ferocious Ukrainian resistance but Moscow’s special forces are already inside the capital. The battle for Ukraine’s cities is about to become a bloody insurgency as men and women civilians have been handed firearms to defend their homeland. Men aged between 18 and 60 years of age are being called up to resist the Russian onslaught as Kyiv’s airport fell to Moscow’s forces.

Experts fear Kyiv could fall within two days unless Ukraine’s troops can hold the line and protect the government from being toppled by the attackers. A battalion of Chechen forces were spotted hiding within dense forests outside Kyiv but are now believed to have started to close in on embattled Kyiv city. These tough fighters were recruited by Putin’s commanders to form militia units and enforce Moscow’s will in Chechnya after troops became bogged down in conflict. Russia has pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital after unleashing air strikes on cities and military bases, particularly in the eastern city of Kharkiv. It has sent troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order. Explosions sounded before dawn on Friday in Kyiv and gunfire was later heard near the government quarter. Ukraine’s president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his government and cause massive casualties. The Russian military said it had seized a strategic airport just outside Kyiv and cut the city off from the west. The Ukrainian military said a group of Russian spies and saboteurs had been seen in a district of Kyiv about three miles north of the centre. Elsewhere in the capital, soldiers established defensive positions at bridges, and armoured vehicles rolled down the streets. Earlier, the military said that Russian forces had seized two Ukrainian military vehicles and some were heading towards the city to try to infiltrate under the guise of being locals. President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to global leaders for even more severe sanctions than those imposed by Western allies and for defence assistance. He said: ""If you don't help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.” Mr Zelensky said he is the number one target for the invading Russians but that he planned to remain in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said they lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world's worst nuclear disaster. Mr Zelensky said in a video address that 137 ""heroes"", including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded. He concluded an emotional speech by saying that ""the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.""",7,3.0055211956546497,1.7033798666852482,1.3021413289694015,10

It is claimed that the huge military vehicle was being driven by Kremlin troops when the horror crash happened. Incredibly the driver, said by witnesses to be an elderly man, survived the shocking ordeal in the under-siege Ukrainian capital. The widely shared clip shows the tank, believed to be a Strela-10 anti-aircraft vehicle, swerve across the road into the car, which was driving in the opposite direction. After remaining still with the crushed vehicle beneath it for nearly 20 seconds, the tank then slowly reverses back into the road, leaving a wreckage in its wake.

Witness Viktor Berbash, 58, told AFP news agency he had rushed out of his home after hearing gunfire. He continued: ""I saw an armoured vehicle and there was automatic fire.

These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: ""Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher."" It comes as Ukraine's President accused Russia of 'state terrorism' on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv. It has escalated fears the fight for Ukraine will turn into a horrific bloodbath. A source told the Mirror: ""They are likely to have little regard for civilian lives as they focus on their mission.” Putin has given a chilling warning to the West that an attempt to stop or interfere with Russia's invasion of Ukraine would lead to ""consequences never encountered in your history"".",7,1.4062221449394476,2.8041423907983787,-1.397920245858931,8

A new video shows a Kremlin warship warning Ukrainian border guards on the strategic Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender or be bombed. An officer on the warship delivered an ultimatum saying: ""I am a Russian military ship. I repeat, I am a Russian military ship. ""I am proposing you put down your arms immediately to avoid bloodshed and unjustified deaths int he worse case you will be hit with a bomb strike."" They then repeated the message, demanding acknowledgement. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates When given the ultimatum from a Moscow warship demanding surrender, the border guards defiant response came by radio, they said: “F*** it as well. Russian warship go f*** yourself!” Ukraine said that the men were killed in the gunfire however Russia claimed today that the men, and others on the island, are all alive and unharmed. ""All border guards died heroically but did not give up. They will be awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine posthumously,"" Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky said. Snake Island sits about 30 miles (48 kilometers) off the southern tip of the Ukrainian mainland in the northwestern Black Sea. It's about 185 miles (300 kilometers) west of Crimea, the Ukrainian territory that Russia annexed in 2014. Russia has consistently attempted to play down or minimise the full-scale invasion and denied targeting civilians in their bombing campaign in Kyiv, despite significant evidence otherwise. A statement from the Russian defence ministry, known for sewing disinformation, said: ""In the area of the Zmeiny (Snake) Island, 82 Ukrainian servicemen laid down their arms and voluntarily surrendered to a unit of the Russian Armed Forces. “At present, they are being asked to sign a refusal to take part in hostilities. “In the near future they will be returned to their families”. Ukraine officials say that 13 men were all slaughtered in a hail of missile fire. In the moments before the attack, the border guards said: “They struck there and also there [with their missiles], '' says one. He asks: “They try to scare us, or what…? “So far nothing is destroyed. “Cannot understand what they’re doing, most likely trying to scare us. ""They strike the rocks.” Soon afterwards the men were reportedly killed in a huge strike from the warship, but Russia maintain they are alive and kept as prisoners. This comes during the second day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as it is confirmed Russian forces have reached towns only 15 miles outside of Kyiv. As Moscow’s forces continue their push towards Kyiv it is unsure what Putin’s plans are, whether they intend to turn Ukraine into a vassal state, or not. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and the Ukraine Ministry of Defence both said that despite all of this, the invasion failed to achieve its day one objectives. On top of that, Russia has suffered at least 450 casualties so far in the conflict.",47,3.918466864382308,3.9602890185837096,-0.04182215420140167,23

The government called on civilians to report any movement of enemy equipment and to fight back against Vladimir Putin's forces. It also warned ""peaceful"" citizens not to leave their homes as cities endure heavy shelling from Russian forces. An official government Twitter account this morning said: ""We ask citizens to inform about the movement of equipment! ""Make Molotov cocktails, neutralise the occupier! Peaceful residents - be careful! Do not leave the house!"" This morning Ukrainian TV showed instructions on how to make Molotov cocktails, which are bottles containing flammable liquid like petrol which are set alight and hurled at the enemy. The country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said 137 civilians and military personnel had been killed on the first day of the Russian attack. Mr Zelensky described those who died as ""heroes"" in a video address in the early hours of the morning. He added that 316 people had been wounded, although the true number is likely to be far higher. Describing the invaders, the Ukrainian president said: “They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven."" Mr Zelensky said the Russian military's claim it is not targeting civilian areas is ""a lie"". Attacks have continued through the night with homes wiped out by Russian missiles. Vitaly Klitschko, mayor of capital city Kyiv, said at least three people were injured when a rocket hit a multi-storey apartment building in Ukraine's capital on Friday, starting a fire. The Mirror's chief reporter Andy Lines, who is in the Ukrainian capital, said this morning: ""I had to be evacuated twice to an underground car park after air raid sirens sounded. ""I watched several Ukrainian armoured personnel carriers race through one of the city’s main thoroughfares which was deserted. ""Thousands continue to flee west to escape the incoming Russian forces."" Higher than usual gamma radiation levels have been detected in the area near the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, after it was seized by the Russian military, according to Ukraine's nuclear energy regulatory agency. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate said on Friday that higher gamma radiation levels have been detected in the Chernobyl zone, but did not provide details of the increase. It attributed the rise to a ""disturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the air"". Ukrainian authorities said that Russia took the plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle on Thursday. A Ukrainian MP said “that’s exactly why I’m looking at my AK-47 in front of me” when he was asked about the Russia invasion closing in on Kyiv. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Sviatoslav Yurash said he was readying to fight the Russians himself if necessary with his own gun.

Explosions ripped through the city last night as the second day of the Russian invasion saw missiles launched at Kyiv. In a video statement released before dawn, Volodymyr Zelensky wore a military t-shirt as he told that his family's lives are at risk by Russian ""sabotage groups"" who had moved into the city last night Russian tanks already crossed the border yesterday morning and Putin's troops are in a fierce battle on the outskirts of the capital, according to local media. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates He said: “According to our information, the enemy marked me as target number one, my family as target number two. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state. We have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv.” Zelensky is in hiding but claimed he was still in Kyiv last night as he resists fleeing his capital. “I am staying in the government quarter together with others,” he said “We have been left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of Nato membership? Everyone is afraid.” Ukrainian officials claimed that a number of residential districts had already been hit by dozens of missile strikes on Kyiv, yesterday evening. Footage released on social media showed the moment explosions ripped through the city as flaming debris and ash fell from the sky. Some suggested that the footage showed a Ukrainian aircraft shot down by a Russian anti-air battery, while other reports claimed the blast was a launch by Ukrainian forces as they intercepted a Russian missile or plane. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said in a tweet: “Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv. Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one.” Speaking on Friday a spokesman for Russia's defence ministry told a briefing that Putin's troops have already destroyed 118 Ukrainian military infrastructure sites. Anton Hereshchenko, an adviser to the interior ministry, confirmed that an airfield just outside Kyiv had fallen into Russian hands after an 'intense battle' The Times reports. The Antonov airfield in Hostomel, 14 miles north of central Kyiv had been taken by Russian paratroopers, he claimed, who are seeking to use it to send further troops into the capital. He told reporters via text message: “Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued.” Officials in the US have claimed their intelligence shows 160 missiles have been launched against Kyiv by Russian forces so far. President Zelensky reported that some 137 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and hundreds more injured in the first day of battle. Russian newspaper Pravda reported that Ukrainian forces had blown up a bridge near Ivankiv in a bid to stop Russian troops which have descended on three fronts in an effort to encircle the city. The paper said the move was “important as Ivankiv is halfway from the border to Kyiv. After that, it becomes possible to attack Kyiv via Vyshhorod”. Now new satellite images have pictured Russian military vehicles as they crossed a pontoon bridge over the Pripyat River as they seized Chernobyl during the first day of the invasion yesterday. Elsewhere, a Russian missile strike hit a Ukrainian border post in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhya, killing and wounding some guards, the border guard service told Reuters. The region has no land border with Russia but lies on the coast of the Azov Sea shared by the two countries. Huge swathes of refugees have gathered at checkpoints along Ukraine’s western border with Poland, as they attempt to flee their country.

Despite admitting to have a “rudimentary knowledge” of the weapon, the MP said “these are skills you pick up very fast when you’re fighting for your life.” He claimed there were Ukraine citizens “gathering in plenty” at recruitment stations, ready to fight as well. This all comes on the second day of the Russian invasion. Throughout the night the Ukrainian capital was bombarded with Russian missile strikes. Air raid sirens sounded across Kyiv and many took shelter int underground bomb shelters. Pictures emerging from the capital showed smoke plumes rising above the capital and fire from the missile attacks. Burnt out residential buildings and damaged homes were snapped as well, showing the toll the invasion is quickly taking on the capital. And now there are reports that Russian troops are fighting outside the capital, as UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Moscow intends to conquer the entire country. However, despite Putin’s advances, Russia has already lost 450 troops, and both Ukraine and the UK have said they failed to achieve their objectives on the first day of the invasion. Speaking to Sky News, he said: ""Our assessment as of this morning is that Russia has not taken any of its major objectives, in fact it is behind its hopeful timetable. “They’ve lost over 450 personnel and… one of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite Spetsnaz has failed to be taken, and in fact the Ukrainians have taken it back.” Outside the northern city of Chernihiv, Ukrainian troops halted the Russian march, and fighting continues outside the city according to the country’s Ministry of Defence.

Shocking footage shot in Melitopol, in the south east of the war-torn nation, showed heavy fire close to the hospital before explosions in the building. The site then immediately starts to burn before more gunshots are aimed at the centre - used to help those suffering with cancer - leaving dozens of bullet holes. The footage was shot by a mobile phone and later pans to the right, showing a large red cross on the face of the building confirming it to be a hospital. Sharing the footage, Ukrainian journalist Christo Grozev said on Twitter : “Terrible.” Another confirmed the location, writing: “Geolocation of footage showing heavy fighting in Melitopol in Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine. “The building attached is marked on its front as a hospital and the building seen is listed on Google Maps as the Oncology Center.” It comes amid claims of Russians shelling another hospital elsewhere in the country during the first hours of the invasion. Other sites seemingly being targeted include an orphanage and a school. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter: “Consider this: Putin has launched a massive war of aggression in Europe during a still raging pandemic. “On top of that, Russians bomb Ukrainian hospitals now. This is beyond evil. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.

These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday.

In stirring scenes one man stood in the way of tanks and tens of thousands of assault rifles were handed out to Ukraine’s brave civilians. All over Ukraine people prepared to rise up against Vladimir Putin’s invaders, even studying government advice on making petrol bombs. Ukraine’s civilian struggle started as its people prepared to back the country's courageous troops who have fought ferociously to defend its cities. The Mirror can reveal Russia has deployed over 10,000 battle-hardened Chechen fighters to Ukraine - some of them crack Spetsnaz troops - to bolster the battle for Kyiv. More Chechens are setting off for war from their hometown Grozny, escalating fears the battle for Ukraine will be a bloodbath. Ukraine’s forces are putting up a tough defence as 80 of Moscow’s tanks are thought to have been wiped out, ten warplanes, seven helicopters and more than 500 Russian vehicles. As many as 2,800 Russian troops have been taken out of the battle, among them 1,000 dead and the rest either captured or injured. It is believed Russia is calling up the Chechens to help seize Kyiv as the Russian advance appeared to falter throughout Ukraine. Among the Chechen battalions are special forces kill squads deployed to focus on key members of the Ukrainian government with President Volodymyr Zelensky target number one. He said today: “We are not afraid. We are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid of Russia.” Russian special forces were closing in on Kyiv’s centre tonight as an eerie silence fell on Independence Square, scene of the 2014 riots that sparked war in the east. A staggering 18,000 machine guns have been handed out to Kyiv’s citizens as they prepare to join troops in defending their city. Information on how to make a molotov cocktail petrol bomb, provided by Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, was put out on social media. Ukraine’s citizens are now being encouraged to start the bloody insurgency they had always planned if Russia came for them. Gunfire and explosions could be heard today towards the city centre as Russian forces bore down on the government offices. Tonight Zelensky and his aides were sheltering in an underground bunker after he announced he believed his wife and children are target number two. He said his family, architect wife Oleana, 44, and two children Aleksandra, 17 and son Kiril, nine, were also sheltering but did not reveal their location. Zelensky added: “My family is not a traitor but a citizen of Ukraine. According to our information the enemy marked me as the number one target. My family is the number two goal. “They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the Head of State.” One British military source told the Daily Mirror: “These Chechen forces are tough, battle-hardened and utterly ruthless. “They are not above beheadings and they are likely to have little regard for civilian lives as they focus on their mission.” There are now believed to be more than 200,000 Russian troops in Ukraine as waves of Moscow’s tanks poured into the region as reinforcements. Evidence of the Russian ferocity was seen in a horrific video of an armoured vehicle running over a moving civilian vehicle, then reversing over it. The driver, a man, survived after being dug out of the wreckage. In other horror imagery, a man’s body was collected by troops after he was shot dead randomly by a passing Russian vehicle. Ukraine’s resistance has been far more robust than Vladimir Putin appears to have predicted but Moscow’s special forces are already inside the capital. Local civilian men were seen brandishing AK47s and walking off to war to defend the city, having been called to arms by the authorities. As many as 80 Russian tanks have been destroyed, seven helicopters and a staggering 516 Russian military vehicles have been disabled. The death toll of Ukrainian forces reached 337, although the toll of civilians is not known. More than 100,000 Ukrainians have been displaced from their homes, officials revealed tonight. The battle for Ukraine’s cities is about to become a bloody insurgency as men and women civilians are being handed firearms to defend their homeland. Men aged between 18 and 60 years of age are being called up to resist the Russian onslaught as Kyiv’s airport fell to Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s military was fighting bitterly to defend their cities, such as Kharkiv, to the east and just 20 miles from Russia. But experts fear Kyiv could fall within two days unless Ukraine’s troops can hold the line and protect the government from being toppled by the attackers. Chaotic scenes were seen at Kyiv train station as thousands tried to flee the capital and the Russian forces advancing on them. A battalion of Chechen forces were spotted hiding within dense forests outside Kyiv but are now believed to have started to close in on embattled Kyiv city. These tough fighters were recruited by Putin’s commanders to form militia units and enforce Moscow’s will in Chechnya after troops became bogged down in conflict. Russia has pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases, particularly in the eastern city of Kharkiv. It has sent troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order. Explosions sounded before dawn on Friday in Kyiv and gunfire was later heard near the government quarter. Ukraine’s military used armoured vehicles and snowploughs to defend Kyiv and limit movement, and said Russian spies were infiltrating the city. Russia’s military said it had seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv that would allow it to quickly build up forces to take the capital. It claimed to have already cut the city off from the west - the direction most of those escaping the invasion are heading in, with lines of cars snaking towards the Polish border. An intense fire broke out on a bridge across the Dnipro River dividing the eastern and western sides of Kyiv, with about 200 Ukrainian forces establishing defensive positions and taking shelter behind their armoured vehicles and later under the bridge. Ukraine’s president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his government and cause massive casualties. Zelensky pleaded with Moscow to hold talks, and with western powers to act faster to cut off Russia’s economy and provide military help. He warned Russian President Vladimir Putin would not stop at Ukraine and now represents a major threat to the rest of Europe. He said: “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine. “When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.” The Russian military said it had seized a strategic airport just outside Kyiv and cut the city off from the west. The Ukrainian military said a group of Russian spies and saboteurs had been seen in a district of Kyiv about three miles north of the centre. Elsewhere in the capital, soldiers established defensive positions at bridges, and armoured vehicles rolled down the streets. Earlier, the military said that Russian forces had seized two Ukrainian military vehicles and some were heading towards the city to try to infiltrate under the guise of being locals. President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to global leaders for even more severe sanctions than those imposed by Western allies and for defence assistance. He said: “If you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.” Mr Zelensky said he is the number one target for the invading Russians but that he planned to remain in Kyiv. Ukrainian officials said they lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. Today Ukraine said it had recorded increased radiation levels from the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant, a day after the site was captured by Russian forces, due to military activity causing radioactive dust to rise into the air. The still-radioactive site of the 1986 nuclear disaster lies some 100 km (62 miles) from Kyiv. Experts at Ukraine’s state nuclear agency said the change was due to the movement of heavy military equipment in the area lifting radioactive dust into the air. Mr Zelensky said in a video address that 137 “heroes”, including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded. He concluded an emotional speech by saying that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.” Around 200 Ukrainian special forces were killed later by Russian forces as they took Hostomel airport outside Kyiv. The invasion began early on Thursday with a series of missile strikes on cities and military bases, and quickly followed with a multi-pronged ground assault. Troops rolled in from several areas in the east, from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and from Belarus to the north. After Ukrainian officials said they lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, Russia said it was working with the Ukrainians to secure the plant.",47,2.1866758087577183,3.272376316424944,-1.0857005076672257,10

Follow the latest updates on the Ukraine and Russia situation in our live blog A harrowing clip shows a missile fired at the building before it partly erupts into a ball of flames. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russain shelling of a hospital was ""beyond evil"". He said in a tweet: ""Consider this: Putin has launched a massive war of aggression in Europe during a still raging pandemic. ""On top of that, Russians bomb Ukrainian hospitals now. “This is beyond evil. The only moral choice any government can make now is to support Ukraine by all means."" Kuleba accused Russia of war crimes after earlier reports of attacks on orphanages and nurseries. He promised Ukraine would send evidence of the attacks to The Hague. ""Today’s Russian attacks on a kindergarten and an orphanage are war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute,"" Dmytro Kuleba tweeted, referring to the agreement that established the International Criminal Court. ""Together with the General Prosecutor’s Office we are collecting this and other facts, which we will immediately send to the Hague. ""Responsibility is inevitable."" The kindergarten appears to be flying a Ukrainian flag above its doors. The claim came as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow has called a ""special military operation,"" moved in on the capital city of Kyiv. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putin's troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nation's army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous. On Sunday, February 27, Ukraine's health minister reported that at least 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than 1,000 wounded. On March 1, Ukraine claimed to have killed 5,710 Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently verified but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than 500 civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least 136 people have been killed, including 13 children, a UN report showed on Tuesday.

The Far East superpower is said to be keeping close watch on the Kremlin’s brutal and deadly invasion of its southern neighbour. Ukraine confirmed earlier today that 137 civilians and military personnel had been killed in the country during the first day of the assault, with more than 300 wounded in the fighting. Far from the frontlines, Putin took a call from China’s President Xi Jinping, Aljazeera reports. According to state broadcaster CCTV, XI said: “[The] “situation in eastern Ukraine has undergone rapid changes … [and] China supports Russia and Ukraine to resolve the issue through negotiation.""

This evening the nation abstained voting in the United Nations Security Council draft resolution that condemned Russia for invading Ukraine. Other world leaders have heavily criticised Russia's invasion, amid warnings of heavy sanctions on the Kremlin.

Civilians have been urged to target invaders using petrol bombs, with Ukrainian men aged between 18 and 60 barred from leaving the country and told to take up arms. This morning Ukrainian deputy defence minister Anna Maliar said enemy troops had driven two Ukrainian army trucks into Kyiv, followed by a convoy of military trucks. In a Facebook post she said the Russians were “moving at speed"" to the centre of Kiev, adding: “They will surely be destroyed.” Boris Johnson earlier condemned Russia for unleashing a “tidal wave of violence” on Ukraine , warning Putin would achieve “pariah status”.

Following a fiery address by Vladimir Putin last night, troops and tanks rolled in over the north and south borders and shells were launched into cities. Blasts and explosions rang out in cities including capital Kyiv overnight before harrowing photos of casualties began to emerge this morning. As Western countries prepare to respond to the invasion, this is how invasion broke out overnight and turned into war. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates on the conflict. Hours before the invasion began, the President of Ukraine made a televised address imploring Russia not to attack. ""We know for sure that we don’t need the war,"" he said. ""Not a Cold War, not a hot war. Not a hybrid one. But if we’ll be attacked by the (enemy) troops, if they try to take our country away from us, our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. ""Not attack, but defend ourselves. And when you will be attacking us, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces."" At 6am Moscow time (3am GMT), the Russian President said that his troops would 'demilitarize' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine. He urged Ukrainian service members to lay down their arms and go home, before warning that clashes between the two sides was now 'inevitable'. ""To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside - if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,"" he said. At around 5am local time the first missiles began to fall on military facilities across Ukraine. Cities have also been targeted, with a huge explosion ringing out in Kyiv and the eastern city of Kharkiv being hit. Ukrainian soldiers have been photographed inspecting a shell in Kyiv, which was a non-targeted projectile according to some reports which contradict Russian claims that its only using high-precision missiles. Photos from the scene show rubble spread across the the road in the capital after a military building there was hit. In Donbas, which is in the separatist Donetsk region, a man was seen weeping above the body of a person thought to be his son apparently killed in one of the strikes. Later on a blast rang out in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk in the west of Ukraine, with reports suggesting that the airport there had been targeted by missile strikes. Officials have said an attack on a military unit in Podilsk, outside Odessa, killed six people and wounded seven. An apartment block in Chuhuiv in the north east has been completey gutted by a blast which knocked out all the windows and tore down its balconies. According to analysis by Bellingcat, the apartment block was likely hit by mistake due to its proximity to a nearby airport. The Russian military pushed further into Ukraine from the north and south as the missiles rained down. Interfax reported that soldiers had landed in the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol in the south east and and Odessa on the Black Sea. Troops atop a column of military vehicles entered Ukraine from a border crossing with Belarus to the north, CNN reported at around 6.48am local time. ""Russia conducted strikes on our military infrastructure and our border guards. There were blasts heard in many cities of Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Zelensky said hours after the shelling first began. ""We’re introducing martial law on the whole territory of our country. “A minute ago I had a conversation with President Biden. The US have already started uniting international support. ""Today each of you should keep calm. Stay at home if you can. We are working. The army is working. The whole sector of defence and security is working,” he added. “No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything. We will win over everybody because we are Ukraine.” Just before 5am GMT, around the time President Zelensky declared martial law, the UK's PM condemned the attack and pledged to support Ukraine. ""I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelensky to discuss next steps,"" he tweeted. ""President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively."" At 7.30am the PM chaired a meeting of Cobra ahead of an address to the nation and statement to the Commons later today. Ukraine’s military has said it had destroyed four Russian tanks on a road near the eastern city of Kharkiv, according to Reuters. It claimed to have killed 50 troops near a town in Luhansk region and downed a sixth Russian aircraft, also in the country’s east. Russia has denied reports that its aircraft or armoured vehicles have been destroyed. Ukraine’s border guard service said that three of its servicemen had been killed in the southern Kherson region and that several more were wounded. Whizz Air, a Hungarian airline which typically has many services into and out of Ukraine, has said it will be stopping these flights as Ukrainian airspace is shut down. ""Due to the current events in Ukraine and the airspace closure, Wizz Air regrets to inform our customers that the airline must temporarily suspend all flight operations in the country,"" it said. Up until now, commercial routes out of the country had been available to those hoping to leave. Airline Ryanair has also suspended flights to Ukraine, for at least the next two weeks. Ryanair said: ""Due to the closure of Ukrainian airspace overnight, and the apparent invasion by Russian forces all Ryanair flights to/from Ukraine have been suspended for at least the next 14 days. After holding a meeting with his minister this morning, at around 9am GMT Volodymyr Zelensky made a plea for any Ukrainians with military experience to joint the country's defence. The government will provide weapons to people who want them, he said, before urging people to donate blood to help injured hospitals. Ukraine has now severed diplomatic ties with Russia, the president confirmed. ""We will fight for our country and we will support our country in the squares of each town,"" he said. The UK's PM has called for the allied Western forces to meet as soon as possible. ""This is a catastrophe for our continent,"" he tweeted. ""I will make an address to the nation this morning on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I will also speak to fellow G7 leaders and I am calling for an urgent meeting of all NATO leaders as soon as possible."" His comment came shortly after a siren was heard in the Polish town of Medyka, according to Reuters. The town acts a border crossing between Poland, a Nato member, and Russia. EU leaders will hold an emergency meeting later today to discuss further sanctions on Russia, with the leaders will be considering ""massive and severe consequences"".",47,2.574058174019843,1.7427734876338625,0.8312846863859804,10

Thousands of people have been seen trying to flee the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv this morning after Russia missile strikes began against the city. Roads have been gridlocked as citizens try to escape the full-scale invasion. Others have waited in long queues for buses or took shelter in subway stations and basements as they desperately prepare to flee the capital and Russia's airstrike assaults. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, General Sir Richard Shirreff, a retired Army officer, said any incursion into Nato territory would bring Britain into direct involvement in the conflict. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates ""There is no surprise and there is profound sadness and a sense of appalling horror at what is about to unfold for the people of Ukraine,"" he said. ""And I think we have to assume that this is not Russia biting off a chunk of Ukraine - for example, establishing a land corridor in Crimea - but a full-blown military offensive to occupy Ukraine."" Aircraft flying to or from UK airports are being ordered to avoid Ukraine airspace after the crisis in the country intensified. Wizz Air cancelled its flights between Luton Airport and the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Lviv on Thursday. Ryanair and Ukraine International Airlines – the other carriers which fly between the UK and Ukraine – are also expected to suspend those routes. The lack of flights will make it harder for British nationals to evacuate from Ukraine to the UK. In Ukraine, horrifying photos have shown Ukrainian firefighters arrive to rescue civilians after an airstrike hit an apartment complex in Chuhuiv, Kharkiv Oblast. One harrowing photo showed a man mourning a body while in tears with debris strewn from the airstrike. It's also been reported that a Ukrainian border guard has died as a result of a rocket shelling from occupied Crimea. State Border Guard Service said Russia had fired arms on them from occupied Crimea onto Preobrazhenka village, Kherson Oblast. Ukraine Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has called on all Ukrainians who are able to hold a weapon to mobilise, and people only need a passport to join their ranks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is chairing emergency Cobra talks and is set to reveal more sanctions against Russia when he addresses MPs later. He's already said the UK will respond decisively to Russia's ""unprovoked attack"" on Ukraine and will make an address to the nation this morning. The PM has also confirmed he will speak to the other G7 leaders and is calling for an urgent meeting of all Nato leaders as soon as possible. And Sir Richard said it is ""entirely plausible"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be aiming to revive the Soviet Union, adding that if Russia puts ""one bootstep"" into Nato territory, the entire alliance will be at war. Asked whether Britain might be expected to take part directly in the current military confrontation, he said: ""Absolutely there is a possibility that we as a nation could be at war with Russia, because if Russia puts one bootstep across Nato territory, we are all at war with Russia. Every single one, every single member of the Nato alliance. ""Article 5 (of the Nato alliance) says an attack on one is an attack on all, so we need to change our mindset fundamentally, and that is why I say our defence starts in the UK on the frontiers of Nato.""",47,2.945420078341758,1.7000621062135484,1.2453579721282095,7

World leaders have condemned President Putin for invading Ukraine, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying ""diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure"". In a chilling video, President Putin appeared to threaten nuclear strikes should the West try to attack Russia in retaliation.

Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine is ""putting up a real fight"" but added some places are proving difficult to defend. ""We are defending our land,"" he said. Boris Johnson condemned Russia for unleashing a ""tidal wave of violence"" against Ukraine without provocation or credible excuse, labelling the invasion as an ""attack on democracy and freedom"".

Reports of attacks on key strategic points such as airbases and military facilities have been widespread, with loss of life thought to have taken place on both sides. There are videos and images to boot, with footage of helicopters and troops in action flooding the internet. But sharing harrowing evidence of the fighting isn’t the only role the internet will play in the conflict. Digital technology can itself be a weapon, with cyber attacks an increasingly common part of 21st-century warfare. A cyber attack can come in many forms and be carried out for many reasons, from crime to warfare. IBM, one of the largest computing firms in America, said: “Cyber attacks are unwelcome attempts to steal, expose, alter, disable or destroy information through unauthorised access to computer systems. “In addition to cybercrime, cyber attacks can also be associated with cyber warfare or cyberterrorism, like hacktivists. Motivations can vary, in other words. And in these motivations, there are three main categories: criminal, political and personal.” The firm says there are a number of different ways cyberattacks can be carried out, from phishing and malware to those that find weaknesses and poison systems from the inside and give the hacker control. For more information on the types of cyber-attacks out there, visit the National Cyber Security Centre. On the morning of Thursday February 24, large-scale cyber attacks were aimed at the Ukrainian government website. Websites for Ukraine ’s defence, interior and foreign ministries were all targeted, leaving them slow or unresponsive. Another attack was reported to have hit the Ukrainian government the day before. The type of attacks that have been used against Ukraine direct junk traffic at the sites leaving them unusable, the Independent reports. The UK government said the same type of attacks, known as distributed denial of service (DDoS), were also carried out on the Ukrainian banking system on February 15 and 16. They said the attacks “involved the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate”. Speaking about the banking attacks, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The attack showed a continued disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty. This activity is yet another example of Russia ’s aggressive acts against Ukraine. “This disruptive behaviour is unacceptable – Russia must stop this activity and respect Ukrainian sovereignty. We are steadfast in our support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.” Cyber attacks are not unheard of in the UK, and could feasibly take place were a hacker able to navigate the defences of businesses and government. They can vary in scale and intention, with attacks affecting British business and interests not uncommon. In November 2021, Sky News reported that the number of cyberattacks on the UK had reached a new high, with a number of attacks believed by GCHQ to have come from countries including Russia and China. The publication reported that the UK had to deal with 777 attacks over the course of the year, two of which were described by the director of GCHQ, Jeremy Flemming as ""two of the most serious global cyber incidents we've seen in recent years"". In the past, cyber attacks have been known to target the NHS and Microsoft. It has since been reported that UK firms have been warned to prepare for fallout from cyber-attacks surrounding the Ukraine conflict, the Guardian has said. British officials are reportedly concerned about ‘spillover’ from the conflict, which was demonstrated by the attacks on the banks last week.",20,5.222923171252777,4.862762214979963,0.3601609562728143,13

Fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the area in the north of the country may have led to damage at the facility, although these reports are yet to be independently verified. Large parts of Chernobyl were closed to the public for decades after a nuclear power reactor melted down there during the Soviet Union's reign in 1986. ""Advisor to Ukrainian interior ministry says Russian forces entered Chernobyl and that fighting there destroyed a nuclear waste storage facility,"" NBC's Richard Engel tweeted this afternoon. This was initially reported, but was later clarified due to a mistranslation. He added shortly after: ""Clarifying: advisor says heaving fighting MAY disturb nuclear waste."" Click here to follor our live blog with the latest updates After a two-hour fight Russian forces were reported to be in control of the facility and have taken hostages. An adviser for the Interior Minister of Ukraine, Anton Gerashchenko said today, according to LBC: ""The invaders from the territory of Belarus have moved into the Chernobyl AES Zone. ""The National Guardsmen, who guard the collectors of unsafe nuclear radioactive waste, are fighting hard. ""If the invaders artillery hits and ruins/damages the collectors of nuclear waste , radioactive nuclear dust can can be spread over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the country of the EU!"" The President of Ukraine took to Twitter to say Russian forces are trying to seize the zone. ""Russian occupation forces are trying to seize the #Chornobyl_NPP,"" tweeted Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated. Reported this to @SwedishPM. ""This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe."" It comes after President Vladimir Putin said allies of Ukraine who try to interfere with his attack will ""face consequences greater than any you have faced in history"", in what was a chilling warning. Air sirens have been heard across the city centre, reports the Mirror's Andy Lines from Kyiv, as residents try to flee for safety. Five Ukrainians have also lost their lives after a military plane was shot down. Photos also showed a radar station that Russia had bombed on outskirts on Mariupol. Terrifying footage also showed a number of Russian helicopters swarming towards the Ukrainian capital as they fired missiles at an airport. Western officials believe Russia intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban area but are yet unclear whether that will mean occupying the whole country, for which Russian forces don't yet appear to be ready. The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday that the situation in Ukraine was quickly deteriorating after Russia's invasion and pleaded with neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking protection. Poland is one country currently preparing hospitals to help Ukrainians who have been injured in the conflict. The nation had prepared a list of 120 hospitals where Ukrainians could be treated. Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine is ""putting up a real fight"" but added some places are proving difficult to defend. ""We are defending our land,"" he said. Earlier, Boris Johnson condemned Russia for unleashing a ""tidal wave of violence"" against Ukraine without provocation or credible excuse. ""It is an attack on democracy and freedom in East Europe and around the world,"" he said in a statement before addressing the country again this evening. ""This crisis is about the right of a free, sovereign independent European people to choose their own future and that is a right that the UK will always defend.""",47,2.7736272856440483,2.3213926767809245,0.4522346088631237,10

The capital, known as the ""mother of Russian cities"" has been under fire from missiles since the early hours of this morning. As Vladimir Putin’s forces swept westwards across the country, from the Russian-backed-separatist areas in the east, the city has come under more and more fire, with increasing reports of explosions from the area. It comes as a Russian helicopter was shot down in an air attack on a key Ukraine defence airport just outside Kyiv. Two attacking gunships were shot down as they approached Ukraine's capital city. They were destroyed near the Gostomel airport, an important airbase in Kyiv Oblast, the region surrounding, but not including the capital. More shocking footage shows further Russian air support heading towards the capital as Moscow’s army makes a final push on Kyiv. The latest clash between the two armies indicates that Russia is close to entering the capital city. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates The footage shows plumes of black smoke from Gostomel as Russian helicopters close in on the explosion site. Not long after, reports emerged from Ukraine that the Russian army had entered Kyiv Oblast. Inside the city, shocking footage and photos have showed the plight of thousands of Ukrainians trying to flee the city. Traffic jams have stretched along roads and motorways as they sort to escape this morning before the Russian army swept in. This all comes on the first day of the Russian invasion into Ukraine. What began in the early hours of this morning may soon be over if the Russian forces can seize the capital. Even in the face of the Russian forces, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky spoke defiantly this morning, promising to fight Russia every step of the way. As he shared photos taken from his office window which showed plumes of smoke over the capital, he earlier said that weapons would be available to every Ukrainian who wanted them. The invasion has been met with international condemnation from across the globe, however, before nations like Britain or America can introduce further sanctions against Russia, they may have taken Kyiv. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced sanctions for three individuals and five Russian banks. But speaking at midday today in a rare message to the British public and world, Johnson said: “Our worst fears have now come true and all our warnings have proved tragically accurate. “President Putin of Russia has unleashed war in our European continent. He has attacked a friendly country without any provocation and without any credible excuse. “Innumerable missiles and bombs have been raining down on an entirely innocent population.” He went on to add that Putin had unleashed a ""tidal wave of violence"" against Ukraine. ""Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.”",47,1.6947868870284009,1.786777946080065,-0.09199105905166416,10

Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg today said there will be “even more” soldiers “in the coming days and weeks” to protect the alliance of 30 nations, including Estonia and Latvia. He said today: “What we see now is a full fledged invasion of Ukraine from many, multiple directions, we see air, land and naval forces taking part…This is extremely serious.” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson slammed Russia’s ""tidal wave of violence"" which he described as an ""attack on democracy', saying the UK ""will always defend"" Ukraine's rights to sovereignty. Mr Johnson said: ""Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure."" But there is no suggestion that NATO troops will actually put boots on the ground in Ukraine, despite the invasion. Meanwhile, the unfolding war has prompted fresh questions about the size of the British Army and ongoing cuts to troop numbers. Here are some common questions answered on troop numbers in Britain, Russia and the NATO forward groups. As of 1 October 2021, the “trained strength” of the British Army is 77,526 personnel, 29,688 in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, and 29,913 in the Royal Air Force. That gives a total of 137,127 in the UK Armed Forces. This total will however be cut by around 2,000 to achieve a smaller Army as envisaged in ‘Defence in a Competitive Age’ command paper. The target is to cut the Army, which has already been slashed back, by nearly 5,000 to 73,000. The Navy and RAF would increase in size slightly, to 30,450 and 31,750 respectively. Infantry, the “close combat” troops at the “core of the Army” - some of whom are stationed in Estonia to protect NATO allies, are falling by a fifth. Tory ministers admit their numbers will drop from 24,940 in 2010 to 19,400 in 2024/25. Overall Army numbers are being cut as part of a long-term plan by the UK government to ‘modernise’ the military. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has claimed: “We will have a modernised fleet, it will have a modern soldier and I think it will be really quite exciting.” He added with investments in new technology, including to counter cyber-attacks, the Armed Forces can do “what it says on the side of the tin rather than boasts about having lots of people and actually equipment that is 20 years out of date”. But General Sir Richard Sherriff, a former deputy supreme commander of NATO Europe, told the BBC : “We in this country must recognise that our security starts not on the White cliffs of Dover but it starts in the forest of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. “That means we must really man the ramparts in Eastern Europe as an alliance. We should mobilise our forces such as we’ve got. ""I’m afraid the cupboard is pretty bare after the cumulative defence cuts over the last decade plus.” Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey told the Commons: “By the time of the next election we will have the smallest Army in 300 years.” Russia's army has about 280,000 personnel and its combined armed forces total about 900,000, according to Reuters. Its 2,840 battle tanks outnumber Ukraine's by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). A US intelligence assessment in December suggested Russia was amassing a force of up to 175,000 troops near Ukraine. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday that 165,000 Russian ""combat troops"" are ""on the edge"" of Ukraine, spread between ""more than 110 battalion tactical groups"". Western officials believe Russia intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban area. But they are unclear whether that will mean occupying the whole country, for which Russian forces do not yet appear to be ready. Likewise, Western officials are unclear whether Vladimir Putin intends Russia to rule Ukraine directly, or to replace the government in Kiev with a more favourable puppet regime. Western intelligence suggests Russian forces spilled over Ukraine’s border from multiple directions including from Russia to Donbas, from Belarus and from occupied Crimea. There was a cyber-attack on Ukrainian financial institutions last night, and a large number of missile strikes on Mariupol port this morning but no amphibious attack in the opening hours. Not all of the estimated 165,000 Russian troops that were amassed near the borders have yet invaded. But Russian special forces are thought to be flooding into Ukraine to soften up resistance, officials believe. The UK contributes troops to NATO battlegroups, which as of last March stationed around 5,000 personnel at bases in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (more below). Britain leads the battlegroup in Estonia and was due soon to have around 1,800 troops there, after it promised to double the number of UK forces in the country. As of March 2021 the UK had 828 troops in Estonia - including one armoured infantry battalion with main battle tanks and armoured fighting vehicles. The UK also had 140 troops in Poland - a Light Cavalry Squadron from the Royal Dragoon Guards, as part of a US-led force. Latvia’s battlegroup is led by Canada while Lithuania’s is led by Germany. These figures are likely out of date. US president Joe Biden said tonight: “Over the past few weeks I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to Nato. On Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action… I authorised the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s Eastern flank allies - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania.” He added: “Now I’m authorising additional US force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including US base forces… put on standby weeks ago.” NATO’s ‘forward presence’ troops have been stationed in member countries Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. NATO allies are also co-ordinating financial sanctions against Russia, while the UK and other allies are sending defensive lethal weapons and military support to Ukraine. However, Ukraine is not a NATO member - despite Putin’s claims that the alliance is expanding - and therefore is unlikely to have Western troops on the ground. This is a crucial distinction, because Article 5 of NATO’s charter - that all 30 member countries must respond to an attack on one member - only applies to member states. Speaking to the BBC on January 30, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg ruled out sending NATO ""boots on the ground"" in Ukraine. Again today he said there were no plans to do so. Asked on January 30 if we could see a scenario where NATO troops fight Russian troops in Ukraine, he replied: ""No. We are focusing on providing support to Ukraine."" He added: ""We have to distinguish between NATO allies and Ukraine. ""Ukraine is a partner. We provide support. We help them with modernising their defensive security institutions, NATO allies as the United Kingdom, United States, Canada are providing training. Thousands of Ukraine soldiers have been trained."" UK Defence Committee member Tobias Ellwood has said NATO forces should have been placed in Ukraine but “we blinked” and failed to do so.",7,0.0,0.0,0.0,7

The building bursts into flames before a large cloud of dark smoke rises over the central Ukranian city. Cruise missiles, guided bombs and GRAD rockets have taken out targets in cities across Ukraine. They have been aimed at airfields, military bases, ammo caches and command posts, but have also hit a least one civilian apartment block.

The Russians appear to be making attempts to control the skies above Ukraine by taking out airports, among them Chuguyev airport near Kharkiv in the country's east. Airspace above Ukraine was shut down overnight, leading carriers including Ryanair and WhizzAir to halt services in and out of the country. Ukraine claimed that six Russian jets were shot out of the sky over the eastern Donbass region. Kyiv said that 50 Russian troops were killed in the attack. Russian strikes on airports do not appear to have been entirely successful, with an apartment block close to a runway in Chuhuiv in the north east seemingly hit by mistake. It was completely gutted by the blast which knocked out all the windows and tore down its balconies. Overnight deep thuds were heard in cities including Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city which sits on the eastern border. Footage reportedly taken in Hostomel, close to Kyiv, shows at least eight attack helicopters flying close to the ground as smoke rising around them. Missiles can be seen being fired off them into the ground below. Ukrainian officials said a Russian helicopter landing attempt was under way at the Hostomel military airport just outside Kyiv at around 11.30am GMT. Separate footage shows explosions hitting Svatove, a city in the east of Ukraine. Reports said the missiles had hit 'near' a warehouse storing Ukrainian army equipment. In addition to the air assault, ground forces have rolled in from Belarus, Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk. The attacks overnight has led Kyiv to declare a state of emergency across the country and to urge citizens to donate blood. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov on Thursday said that anyone who is ready and able to hold a weapon can join the ranks of the territorial defence forces, as the police said they would distribute weapons to veterans. Dmytro Kuleba, minister of Foreign Affairs for Ukraine, condemned the strikes early this morning. ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,"" he tweeted.

It has now been claimed other vehicles crossed the border from Belarus marked with an ""O"". The ""Z"" symbol has already become a telling image of the early stages of the invasion. Various theories about the menacing markings have been aired since the symbol was spotted on Russian tanks and trucks which have entered eastern Ukraine. “It would suggest final preparations are complete,"" a military source explained. “It’s vital that any attacking force can be distinguished, particularly from the air where Russian forces will have complete control. “The Ukrainians have very similar tanks and vehicles and will want to reduce the risk of friendly fire,” they told The Sun. But Russia analyst Rob Lee believes the symbols may refer to ""contingents of the invasion force assigned to Ukraine regions"". Others, however, simply believe the Z stands for ""Zorro squad"". It could refer to a new unit or the whole invasion army. Putin has told allies of Ukraine who try to interfere that they will ""face consequences greater than any you have faced in history"", in a chilling warning, thought to be hinting towards his country's massive nuclear arsenal.

And Russian-backed separatists are also claiming to have taken control of two in the Luhansk region, reported RIA. At the same time the Ukraine government has said that shelling has caused one dead and one wounded in Brovary in the Kyiv region. That death toll is almost certain to rise significantly as the day goes on. Missile attacks have hit major cities and troops have landed on the south coast of Ukraine, said officials, while the country has been hit by continual cyber attacks that downed government websites yesterday. Footage shows people leaving Kyiv in droves with chaotic scenes on roads packed full of cars as people flee. Residents in the city are being told to ""not panic"" and remain at home unless they have essential jobs, said the government. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction"" with his attack on Ukraine and that the UK and its allies would respond ""decisively"". The PM said on Twitter: ""I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps. ""President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. ""The UK and our allies will respond decisively."" Shortly before 10am the PM called for an emergency Nato meeting ahead of his address to the nation later today. ""This is a catastrophe for our continent,"" he tweeted. ""I will make an address to the nation this morning on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I will also speak to fellow G7 leaders and I am calling for an urgent meeting of all NATO leaders as soon as possible."" US President Joe Biden has called Russia's decision to commence a military operation in eastern Ukraine an ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"". He added the Putin had ""chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering"". Heartbreaking images of the early toll and loss are already emerging from the country showing the death and injury already inflicted. Photos circulating online show one woman's body lying in the street surrounded by blood and a man weeping above a corpse in rubble. Another shows a woman's bloody injuries in the same city. Ukrainian military command centres in the cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv have been attacked by missile strikes, the Ukrainska Pravda news website cited a Ukrainian interior ministry official as saying on Thursday. Regular blasts have been heard from the Ukraine capital Kyiv and the sound of gunfire came from near to the main airport of Boryspil in Kyiv. Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk have launched large-scale strikes against Ukrainian forces along the line of contact, Russia's Interfax news agency cited a separatist spokesman as saying. Amid the global condemnation, the EU's chief executive said she would present ""massive"" sanctions to the bloc for approval on Thursday February 24. She said: ""(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin is responsible for bringing war back to Europe."" She promised that new EU sanctions would block Russia's access to ""key technologies and markets"" and the Union would also freeze Russian assets in Europe and halt Moscow's access to European financial markets. ""We will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise... These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and on their ability to finance the war."" There are reports that Russian forces have destroyed or rendered unusable the Ukrainian navy, that included an amphibious landing from a tanker and helicopter aircraft took place near Odessa. Russia is targeting Ukraine's military infrastructure, air defence, and air forces with high-precision weapons and is not attacking Ukrainian cities, Russia's RIA news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying. Passengers and staff are being evacuated from the airport, said the Ukraine government. Whizz Air and Ryanair have stopped flights into and out of the country as its airspace is closed. Have you been caught up in the conflict? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk Russia has launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and is targeting cities with weapons strikes, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet. ""Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes,"" Kuleba said. ""This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now."" The Mirror's Andy Lines in Kyiv said: ""I watched a huge red and orange glow to the north of the city as a Russian missile hit its target. ""The first muffled bangs started shortly after 5am local time. I heard seven or eight but nothing appeared to be aimed at the city centre."" A the same same time video footage on social media taken in Mariupol, around 30 miles from the Russian border, shows what seems to be plumes of smoke rising amid explosions. There have been also been sounds of explosions in other cities including Kharkiv and Odessa. ""For more than 70 years, we have avoided large-scale war in Europe. With his illegal invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has tragically brought decades of general peace to an end,"" said US senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""Now the US and our NATO allies must stand united and resolute against Putin's efforts to renew the Russian empire at the expense of the Ukrainian people."" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she condemns the ""appalling, unprovoked attack"" on Ukraine. ""I strongly condemn the appalling, unprovoked attack President Putin has launched on the people of Ukraine,"" she tweeted. ""We stand with Ukraine and we will work with our international partners to respond to this terrible act of (aggression)."" Putin has told the Ukraine army to lay down their arms in the area. It comes as Vladimir Putin said that Russia will carry out a special military operation in the Donbass and he has called on all Ukrainian soldiers to ""immediately"" lay down their weapons and go home, according to the Tass new agency. He claims that Russia is acting out of self-defence and told the Ukrainian military that their ""fathers and grandfathers"" didn't fight so they could help ""neo-nazis"". In a televised address early on Thursday morning, Putin said the action comes in response to threats coming from Ukraine. He added that Russia does not have a goal to occupy Ukraine, but said the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian ''regime''. Putin said Russia has been left with no choice but to defend itself against what he said were threats emanating from modern Ukraine. Putin also made an appeal to the Ukrainian military: ""I urge you to immediately lay down your weapons and go home. All servicemen of the Ukrainian army who fulfil this demand will be able to freely leave the combat zone and return to their families."" The scope of the Russian military operation in Ukraine was not immediately clear. A Reuters reporter in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, heard explosions which sounded like artillery shelling in the distance soon after Putin had finished speaking. Putin said Russia would respond instantly if any external force tried to interfere and that Moscow would try to de-militarise and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine. ""Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine,"" said Putin. Earlier US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he believes Russia will invade Ukraine within hours after separatists on Wednesday asked for Russian help to repel ""aggression"" and as explosions rocked the breakaway eastern city of Donetsk. Putin has said this week that he wants to take the important Azov sea port of Mariupol which deals with around half of Ukraine's steel and mineral exports, it is reported. Blinken told NBC News he expected Russian forces would attack Ukraine overnight although he still held out hope for diplomacy to pull Europe back from the brink of war. ""Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken said in an interview, adding he could not be precise about time or place. A pro-Ukraine rally was held in Mariupol on Tuesday night where people gathered to protest in the face of a Russian invasion, waving Ukraine flags. Separatists have requested help from Russia in the east of Ukraine and hours after the plea on Wednesday, at least five explosions were heard in the separatist-held eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk on Thursday morning. Four military trucks were seen heading to the scene, but the cause of the explosions was not known and it is feared that it was being used as ""false flag"" by separatists to give Russia an excuse to invade. Convoys of military equipment including nine tanks were seen moving towards Donetsk on Wednesday from the direction of the Russian border. Shelling has intensified in the east, where Putin has recognised two separatist regions as independent and ordered the deployment of what he called peacekeepers, a move the West calls the start of an invasion.",47,0.0,0.0,0.0,7

The attack, described by Boris Johnson as a ""vast invasion"", began early on Thursday with a series of precision missile strikes and air strikes followed by ground troops crossing the border. The first targets included Ukrainian air defences, designed to ensure Russia's aerial superiority in the conflict. Western officials have reported forces moving crossing over from Belarus, where they have been engaged in large scale exercises, and from Russian-occupied Crimea. Click here to follow our live blog covering all the conflict's updates They are also said to have moved into the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine where President Vladimir Putin has recognised to the two breakaway ""republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk. So far, officials say that it is unclear whether he intends to take control of the entire country. However they believe that his objectives include the capital Kyiv and the port city of Odesa as well as joining up Crimea, which he seized in 2014, with the Donbas. Ukrainian forces have been putting up resistance, with reports that at least one Russian warplane has been brought down. However analysts believe that the combination of aerial superiority, precision munitions and artillery firepower gives Moscow's forces a marked military advantage. The Russians are able to mass their troops in particular locations supported by overwhelming firepower whereas the stretched Ukrainians are trying to defend a large territory. Ahead of the invasion there were reports of cyber attacks overnight on a number of Ukrainian financial and government institutions, amid widespread suspicions that they were carried out in support of the attack. Officials believe that Russian special forces are now active inside Ukraine conducting operations to soften resistance in ahead of the main conventional forces advance. There are particular concerns now about the prospect of an assault on Kyiv, a city with a population of more than 2.8 million. In the past, such as in the Chechen capital Grozny, Russian forces having shown they are willing to use overwhelming firepower if they cannot achieve their objectives quickly, potentially resulting in large-scale civilian casualties.",7,0.0,0.0,0.0,6
