2022-01-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secretary-state-antony-blinken-abc-us-open-talking/story?id=82154018,"US open to talking with Russia about missiles, troop exercises: Secretary of State Antony Blinken","Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the United States was open to discussing limits on missile deployments and troop exercises in Europe during talks with Russia this week over Ukraine. ""There are confidence-building measures, there are risk-reduction measures, all of which, if done reciprocally, I think can really reduce tensions and address concerns,"" Blinken told told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. And after Russia sent troops to help quell unrest in neighboring Kazakhstan, Blinken did not rule out that events there could come up in talks -- even though Russia has ruled that out. He criticized Kazakhstan's president ordering security forces to shoot to kill protesters. ""That is something I resolutely reject,"" Blinken said. ""The shoot-to-kill order, to the extent it exists, is wrong and should be rescinded."" Delegations from the U.S. and Russia planned to hold talksSunday night and Monday in Geneva, kicking off a critical week of diplomacy between Moscow and the West over Russian President Vladimir Putin menacing neighboring Ukraine. Blinken said it may be possible ""to address whatever legitimate concerns Russia may have."" For example, he said, ""there may be grounds for renewing"" the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, from which the Trump administration withdrew and which the U.S. accuses Russia of violating. ""Similarly, there are agreements on the deployment of conventional forces in Europe, on things like the scope and scale of exercises, that, if adhered to reciprocally -- that is, Russia makes good on its commitments, which it's repeatedly violated -- then there are grounds for reducing tensions, creating greater transparency, creating greater confidence, all of which would address concerns that Russia purports to have,"" Blinken said. Stephanopoulos pressed, ""So you're willing to address troop levels, you're willing to address missile deployments, you're willing to address training exercises?"" Blinken said the United States was ""not looking at troop levels."" ""When it comes to the deployment of forces and troop levels, we're not looking at troop levels,"" he said. ""To the contrary, if Russia commits renewed aggression against Ukraine, I think it's a very fair prospect that NATO will reinforce its positions along its eastern flank, the countries that border Russia. ""But when it comes to, for example, the scope and scale of exercises,"" he continued, ""things that were dealt with in the conventional forces in Europe treaty that Russia's been in violation of, those are things that we can look at."" The U.S.-Russia negotiations are expected to be followed by talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and more discussions between the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday. The U.S. will participate in those talks, too. As President Joe Biden has threatened in the past, Blinken promised ""massive consequences"" for Russia if it invades Ukraine -- promising they would go beyond those that the West imposed on Russia after it annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 -- saying the U.S. and European allies have coordinated on ""economic, financial and other consequences."" But when asked by Stephanopoulos whether he thinks Putin has already made the decision to take control of the Ukraine, Blinken noted he wasn’t sure yet. ""It's clear that we've offered him two paths forward,"" Blinken said. ""One is through diplomacy and dialogue. The other is through deterrents and massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression against Ukraine. And we're about to test the proposition of which path President Putin wants to take this week."" And the secretary of state tempered expectations about quick results. ""I don't think we're going to see any breakthroughs next week,"" Blinken said. It would be ""very difficult"" to ""make actual progress,"" he said, as long as ""there's an ongoing escalation, when Russia has a gun to the head of Ukraine with 100,000 troops near its borders, the possibility of doubling that on very short order."" ""If we're seeing de-escalation, if we're seeing a reduction in tensions, that is the kind of environment in which we can make real progress and, again, address concerns, reasonable concerns on both sides,"" Blinken said.",,,,7
2022-01-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-us-russia-diplomatic-talks-kick-off-amid/story?id=82134600,Week of US-Russia diplomatic talks kick off amid Ukraine tension,"Delegations from the U.S. and Russia will hold talks Monday, kicking off a critical week of diplomacy between Moscow and the West over Russian President Vladimir Putin menacing neighboring Ukraine. Ahead of the negotiations, a senior Biden administration official said the United States was open to discussing limits on missile deployments and troop exercises in Europe. For weeks now, Russia has massed nearly 100,000 troops along Ukraine's borders and sharpened its rhetoric to blame Kyiv, the U.S., and NATO for provoking a conflict -- heightening fears in Washington and beyond that Putin is laying the pretext for a full-scale invasion. Russia has denied that, but under the threat of war, it has issued a list of demands in two draft treaties last month that would remake Europe with greater Russian influence -- its most profound challenge to the post-Cold War landscape in three decades. While U.S. officials have said many are nonstarters, like barring Ukraine from NATO membership, President Joe Biden is trying to challenge Moscow on its premise, saying the U.S. and NATO are willing to negotiate if Russia de-escalates tensions. But whether Russia is really willing to engage and walk back from the cliff of conflict - or whether Putin already intends to finish a job he started in 2014 with his seizure of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and his start of a war in eastern Ukraine - is an open question, especially after Russia deployed troops to quell protests in Kazakhstan. ""We believe there are areas where we can make progress if Moscow is realistic in its approach. We can't be sure until the talks take place -- that's the nature of diplomacy,"" said a senior State Department official. On Saturday, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that the U.S. and Russia may be able to find agreement on the topics of missile deployments in Europe and the size of troop exercises on either side of Russia's borders with NATO members. Specifically, the official said, Putin does not want offensive missile systems placed in Ukraine, and Biden has already made clear to Putin that ""the United States has no intention of doing that."" The U.S. was also open to discussing the future of certain missile systems in Europe, in the context of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, from which the Trump administration withdrew and which the U.S. accuses Russia of violating, according to the official. And as troop deployments have ratcheted up tensions in eastern Europe, the official said the U.S. would consider restrictions on troops exercises near the borders Russia shares with NATO members. ""We are willing to explore the possibility of reciprocal restrictions on the size and scope of such exercises,"" the official said, ""including both strategic bombers close to each other's territory and ground-based exercises, as well."" The U.S. would consult its allies and partners before making any commitments related to their security interests, the official said, adding that any commitments would have to be reciprocal -- meaning the U.S. and Russia would ""need to make essentially the same commitment."" The official said bilateral negotiations would primarily take place Monday would there would ""likely"" be an ""initial conversation"" on Sunday night. If Russia and the U.S. are not able to make progress, and if Russia moves ahead with an attack on the former Soviet state, Biden has threatened high-impact sanctions from the U.S. and its allies, including the G7, the European Union, and NATO, as well as NATO deployments to its eastern members and additional arms to Ukraine. But the president has made clear the U.S. will not send troops to defend Ukraine, leaving the ball ultimately in Putin's court. The New York Times on Saturday reported that, if Russia further invades Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies were considering ""cutting off Russia’s largest financial institutions from global transactions, imposing an embargo on American-made or American-designed technology needed for defense-related and consumer industries, and arming insurgents in Ukraine who would conduct what would amount to a guerrilla war against a Russian military occupation, if it comes to that.” The White House's National Security Council declined to comment on the report. After Monday's one-on-one meetings, NATO will hold a meeting with Russia Wednesday -- its first in two and a half years amid icy tensions -- and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a critical Cold War-era forum that has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine, will convene Thursday. Those other two rounds of talks are equally important in defusing tensions, according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has consistently reiterated the administration's line that they will decide ""nothing about Europe without Europe"" -- adopted from an old Polish saying. ""What's happening in Ukraine is not only about Ukraine. It's part of a broader pattern of destabilizing, dangerous, and often illegal behavior by Moscow,"" Blinken said in a firm speech Friday, rejecting Russia's version of recent history. ""If Russia has legitimate concerns about our actions, the United States, our NATO allies, our OSCE partners are willing to hear them and to try to address them -- if the Kremlin is prepared to reciprocate regarding its own dangerous and destabilizing behavior."" Even after two calls between Biden and Putin in December, U.S. officials are still uncertain if Putin is bluffing and seeking concessions from the U.S. and NATO. But they have said repeatedly they will not compromise on key issues, including Ukraine's security and its potential membership in the alliance. That deep gulf makes it unlikely that Monday's meetings will yield any immediate results -- beyond more talks -- especially because the U.S. has said it will only negotiate on issues between it and Russia, not the threats around Ukraine. ""Hopefully it will result in identifying a few bilateral issues where there is enough common ground to continue discussions and ultimately address together,"" said a second senior State Department official. ""Our hope is that we can follow up this meeting relatively quickly."" When the Russian delegation raises what it has cast as the threat from Ukraine, as it has done publicly now for weeks, the U.S. will listen, the official added, ""because we are wanting to have a dialogue with them."" But ""we are not going to talk above the heads of our European allies and partners,"" they added. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will lead the U.S. delegation in Geneva, Switzerland, accompanied by Pentagon and White House National Security Council officials and the top U.S. diplomat for arms control, Bonnie Jenkins. Arms control is one area where U.S. officials have expressed some optimism that they could find common ground with Russia, especially after two previous rounds of talks between Sherman and Jenkins and their counterparts. The day-long talks Monday will be followed by a meeting Wednesday between Russia and NATO -- the first since July 2019. Sherman will lead the U.S. delegation there -- a sign the meeting is equally important to the Biden administration as Monday's one-on-one sessions, according to the first senior State Department official. But even as the administration has repeated its ""nothing about Europe without Europe"" mantra, some European officials have expressed concern about the U.S. and Russia meeting without them. ""There are not two actors alone. It is not just the U.S. and Russia. If we want to talk about security in Europe, Europeans have to be part of the table,"" said Josep Borrell, the E.U.'s top diplomat, during a visit to Ukraine Wednesday. Concerns were particularly heightened Friday after an NBC News report said the U.S. is weighing removing some troops from eastern Europe in exchange for Russia pulling its troops back; what critics cast as appeasement to Putin's threats. But the Biden administration called the report ""erroneous,"" with a third senior State Department official saying they are not weighing troop cuts to Europe, will not discuss U.S. troops in Poland and the Baltics with Russia, and are not compiling a list of potential troop cuts for the talks. State Department officials went even further -- warning U.S. allies that after Monday's talks conclude, Russia is likely to lie about what took place in the meetings. ""We fully expect that the Russian side will make public comments following the meeting on Monday that will not reflect the true nature of the discussions that took place. We would urge our allies and partners to view those comments with extreme skepticism and to continue their ongoing discussions and coordination with the United States,"" the first senior State Department official said. With tension and distrust so high, and expectations low, the administration is being warned not to concede any ground to Putin's negotiators after Moscow has escalated the situation to a crisis point. ""The war talk in Moscow may be a sort of psychological operation to soften up the West, frighten West Europeans, and divide Putin's western adversaries so that a lesser Russian attack -- seizing another slice of Ukraine rather than a full-scale invasion, or stationing Russian forces along the Polish frontier, or 'mere' cyber attacks and physical sabotage in Kyiv -- is greeted with relief and thus accepted,"" wrote Daniel Fried, a retired U.S. ambassador who served as the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, ambassador to Poland, and top sanctions official. Threading that needle between addressing ""whatever is legitimate in Moscow's long litany of grievance"" and pushing ""back against Putin's aggression and pretentions to resume Russia's domination of Europe's eastern half"" will not be easy, Fried added. But it is a critical moment in the future of the international system the U.S. midwifed in the 20th century, with the lives of many on the line, especially Ukrainians. ""The people of Ukraine has been fighting this war for seven years now, and we know how to fight and we know how to win,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told ABC News last year. ""This is our land, our soil, and we will be defending it. But it's much easier to defend it when you have friends and allies in the back."" ABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed reporting.",,,,16
2022-01-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-russia-talks-end-progress/story?id=82180475,"US, Russia talks end with 'no progress': Here's what you need to know","U.S. and Russian officials held over seven hours of talks Monday, but the two sides did not negotiate or appear any closer to a resolution over heightened fears that Russia will attack its neighbor Ukraine. In dueling press conferences after the talks, the top U.S. and Russian diplomats said their meetings were constructive, as they now move on to a second round at NATO's headquarters on Wednesday. But while U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman urged caution and praised the ""frank and forthright"" tone, her counterpart, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, warned the U.S. is moving too slowly and not taking seriously Moscow's key demands. Whether that sets the stage for genuine negotiations, or whether Russian leader Vladimir Putin is seeking a pretext for war, remains unclear, as Russia pushes to reclaim its Soviet sphere of influence and present its clearest, most fundamental challenge to European security in three decades. Ryabkov said it is impossible for any progress to be made until the U.S. gives legal guarantees Ukraine and Georgia will never join NATO. ""We are fed up with loose talk, half promises. Ukraine and Georgia will never -- never ever -- become members of NATO,"" Ryabkov told reporters afterward, reiterating Russia's top demand, laid out last month in two draft treaties. ""We do not trust the other side. We need ironclad, waterproof, bullet-proof, legally binding guarantees. Not safeguards -- guarantees."" He has said ""no progress"" was made on Russia's central demands and warned the U.S. is failing to understand the urgency of the situation. Even as he denied the approximately 100,000 Russian troops on three sides of Ukraine's borders are preparations for an invasion, Ryabkov again warned Ukraine could spark conflict with a ""provocation,"" ""Enough is enough. The station now is so dangerous and so precarious that we cannot afford any further delays,"" he added. But Sherman made clear that the U.S. will not bend on what it sees as a key principle -- that countries like Ukraine can make their own decisions about joining an alliance. Instead, she said the U.S. offered ""preliminary ideas"" on how to ease tensions and promote transparency between the world's two largest nuclear powers, including reducing missile deployments or military exercises. ""We certainly urged Russia to deescalate, to create an environment that is conducive to the diplomatic track, but we will see,"" she told reporters, While the two sides gained ""a better understanding of each other and each other's priorities and concerns,"" she said, they weren't engaged in negotiations just yet: ""We're not at a point where we're ready to set down texts and begin to go back and forth."" ""We must give diplomacy and dialogue the time and space required to make progress on such complex issues,"" she added, saying the U.S. would ""move as expeditiously as we possibly can,"" but that, ""Negotiations on complex topics like arms control cannot be completed in a matter of days or even weeks."" In contrast, Ryabkov struck a tone of urgency, adding, ""In the coming days there will be more full clarity whether another round will take place, if yes, in what format."" After the NATO-Russia meeting Wednesday, there will be a third round of talks Thursday at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Cold War-era forum that has deployed a war monitor in eastern Ukraine as Russian-led forces battle the Ukrainian government. That war, which has killed approximately 14,000 people and counting, is one way Moscow continues to destabilize its neighbor Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has sought closer ties to the West since protests toppled a pro-Russian oligarch president in 2013. After that revolution, Russia seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and launched the war in the eastern provinces known as Donbas. But the movement of approximately 100,000 Russian troops, along with heavy equipment, has sparked deep concerns about a possible full-scale invasion. Sherman said Monday it was still unclear what Putin had decided but called on Russia to return those forces to their barracks away from Ukraine's borders. Russia has complained for decades about NATO’s expansion to include countries that Moscow dominated as the Soviet Union. Now it has argued that Ukraine has moved too close to the alliance, arguing that NATO military advisors and equipment provided to help Ukraine defend itself in its war with Russia mean it is becoming a de-facto part of it. In 2008, NATO adopted a resolution that stated Ukraine and Georgia would one day become part of the alliance, but there is little support among Western countries for that to happen quickly. Russia views having forced the U.S. to talk about its concerns around Ukraine is an important victory in itself. Ryabkov at the talks suggested that had given grounds for some optimism. ""I don’t consider the situation hopeless,” he continued. “I think the usefulness of the talks in Geneva is mainly that, for the first time, we were able to talk about issues that before existed, but as if behind the scenes.” But he said Russia wants NATO to use its next summit in Madrid this year to renounce the 2008 resolution that opened a path for Ukraine and Georgia to join, a demand that has been seen as a non-starter by the U.S. The U.S. has floated ideas to increase transparency and reduce suspicions between the two sides, including reductions on the deployment of nuclear missiles and other weapons -- although Sherman said the U.S. will not negotiate on the deployment of its forces in Europe, saying it's an issue for only the U.S. and its allies to discuss. ""We will go through all of the discussions this week. We will reflect on them all. I expect that incorporating those, talking with our partners and allies at NATO, at OSCE -- we will then have further conversations with the Russian government and decide on the best way forward,"" she said. For Russia, however, that rejection of NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia, another former Soviet state where Russian forces currently occupy parts of the country, does not bode well for a diplomatic solution. The question is: If the U.S. and NATO hold firm on that line, will Moscow accept anything else instead, or will its forces attack? An agreement is still ""possible,"" Ryabkov said, but ending NATO's expansion is ""an absolute imperative.""",,,,27
2022-01-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-rejects-russian-demands-security-guarantees-latest-round/story?id=82226913,NATO rejects Russian demands for security guarantees in latest round of talks,"A new round of talks between Russia and NATO countries aimed at averting a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine have again ended with little progress, with the two sides still at an impasse over Russia's demands for security guarantees. Russia met with 30 NATO member states at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, the second of three diplomatic meetings organized this week in Europe between Russia and Western countries amid fears raised by Russia's massing of 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border. In Wednesday's talks, NATO offered Russia to hold a series of meetings to discuss arms control and other confidence building measures in an attempt to persuade it to lower tensions around Ukraine. The alliance's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said it had proposed talks on limiting missile deployments and troop exercises as well as how to improve communication and transparency. He told reporters afterward that Russia said it needed to time to consider the offer, but it had not rejected it out of hand. ""We are ready to sit down,"" Stoltenberg told journalists. ""And we hope Russia is ready to sit down and hold these meetings."" But NATO unanimously rebuffed Moscow's core demands for formal guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will pull back its forces from countries in Eastern Europe that joined after the Cold War. Russia and the United States held talks on Monday in Geneva where Moscow pressed those demands and which the U.S. rejected as impossible. NATO and the U.S. said they would never compromise on what they called the alliance's ""core principles,"" after Russia's negotiators, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin, presented the same demands again at Wednesday's meeting. ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who led the U.S. delegation, said after the meeting, calling them a ""non-starter."" But while Russia's key demand was again rejected, the door to a diplomatic solution remains open, U.S. and NATO officials said. ""There was no commitment to deescalate, nor was there a statement that there would not be,"" Sherman added, even offering some praise for the Russian delegation for sitting ""through nearly four hours of a meeting where 30 nations spoke -- and they did -- which is not an easy thing to do. I'm glad they did it."" She and Stoltenberg said Russia now had a choice to make whether to engage with dialogue, saying she hoped the Russian negotiators would now go back to President Vladimir Putin and they would choose ""peace and security."" Russia made the sweeping demands over NATO in two draft treaties in December after building up troops close to Ukraine for months. That buildup, along with bellicose rhetoric and plans for ""internal sabotage,"" according to U.S. officials, raised fears that Putin may be preparing to launch a renewed attack on the country after he seized Crimea and launched a separatist war in 2014. Russia has denied it is planning to attack Ukraine, despite the buildup on its border. Amid the diplomatic efforts, it staged live fire exercises on Tuesday with 3,000 troops and hundreds of tanks in three regions neighboring Ukraine. The U.S. and NATO have hoped that Russia might accept more modest offers, such as limiting missile deployments and troop exercises. But Russia's negotiator, Grushko, insisted again Wednesday that Russia could accept nothing less than the guarantees on Ukraine and NATO, calling it ""imperative."" No progress on arms control or confidence-building measures could be made without progress on Moscow's core demands, he told reporters afterward. Grushko said Russia was now waiting for NATO and the U.S. to send written responses to the Russian proposals and that it would then make a decision on how to proceed. Russia has complained for decades about NATO expansion into countries formerly dominated by Moscow under the Soviet Union. The Kremlin now alleges that NATO assistance to Ukraine means the former Soviet country is becoming a defacto part of the alliance. The U.S. and NATO say Moscow's demand is an attempt to reimpose its Soviet-era sphere of influence on Eastern Europe and that it violates a fundamental right for countries to choose their security alliances. Grushko said deescalation was ""absolutely possible,"" but he warned that the alliance's enlargement into Eastern Europe had become ""unbearable"" for Russia, warning if Russia felt threatened it would use ""military means."" ""We have a range of military-technical measures that we will use if we will feel a real threat to our security,"" Grushko said. ""And we already are feeling it, if they are looking at our territory as a target for guided, offensive weapons. Of course, we cannot agree with that. We will take all necessary measures in order to fend off the threat with military means, if political ones don't work."" But Grushko also spoke positively about the talks, saying for the first time he believed Russia had ""managed to convey to the members of the alliance that the situation is unbearable."" Stoltenberg said Russia could not have a veto over Ukraine joining the alliance, saying Russian claims to feel threatened by Ukraine were also wrong. ""Ukraine is a sovereign nation. Ukraine has the right to self-defense,"" he said. ""Ukraine is not a threat to Russia. To say that Ukraine is a threat to Russia is to put the whole thing upside down."" Western officials have been trying to understand whether the threat of a Russian attack on Ukraine is real or a bluff to strengthen Moscow's hands as it makes its demands. Sherman suggested that remained an open question, perhaps even for the Kremlin itself. ""Everyone, Russia most of all, will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext,"" she said. ""And they may not even know yet."" While the buildup, including the new live-fire exercises Wednesday, could still be a negotiating tactic, some Western officials and independent experts also worry that Russia might be engaging in the talks intending for them to fail, so as to use that as a pretext for a military intervention. ""The United States and our allies and partners are not dragging our feet. It is Russia that has to make a stark choice: deescalation and diplomacy, or confrontation and consequences,"" Sherman said. ""If Russia walks away, however, it will be quite apparent they were never serious about pursuing diplomacy at all."" On Thursday, the talks will move to a third round at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Cold War-era forum that includes all of the continent's countries, the U.S. and Canada and several in Central Asia. Those talks are expected to yield even fewer results, with 57 member states participating in an open dialogue. The Kremlin has suggested it will make a decision whether it is worth continuing talks following this week's meetings. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday said Moscow did not ""see a substantial reason for optimism"" so far but that for now it was not drawing any conclusions.",,,,27
2022-01-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-accuses-russia-fabricating-pretext-invade-ukraine/story?id=82267027,US accuses Russia of 'fabricating a pretext' to invade Ukraine,"After a week of high-stakes diplomacy, the U.S. on Friday accused Russia of ""fabricating a pretext"" to invade its neighbor Ukraine. It's another sign that the ""drumbeats of war"" are getting louder, in the words of one U.S. ambassador, after three key meetings this week to defuse tensions raised by Russia massing approximately 100,000 troops on its borders with Ukraine. But whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will act on a long-held desire to consume Ukraine, or whether his posturing is a bluff to strengthen Moscow's hand and therefore its influence, is still an open question, according to senior U.S. officials. A ""massive"" cyberattack against Ukrainian government sites on Friday sparked new fears that the very kind of sabotage plot that U.S. officials have described could already be underway. ""Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine,"" a U.S. official said Friday. U.S. intelligence has ""information that indicates Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine,"" the official added, saying the group was trained in urban warfare and the use of explosives. The alleged plot would begin several weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which he attacked in 2014 by annexing Crimea and fomenting a war in its eastern provinces known as Donbas. That conflict has killed as many as 14,000 people in the last eight years, with artillery and sniper fire still exchanged weekly between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-led separatists. Not long after, White House press secretary Jen Psaki spelled out the U.S. accusations in public. ""We are concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion in Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes, should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives,"" Psaki told reporters at her daily briefing. ""As part of its plans, Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, and we've seen this before. She repeated the U.S. official's assertion that Russian action could occur sometime between the middle of this month and mid-February. ""We have information that indicates Russia has already pre-positioned a group of operatives to conduct a false flag operation in eastern Ukraine,"" Psaki continued. ""The operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia's own proxy forces. Our information also indicates that Russian influence actors are already starting to fabricate Ukrainian provocations in state and social media to justify a Russian intervention and sew divisions in Ukraine."" The Kremlin dismissed the accusations, saying no proof has been presented. ""All these statements still have just the character of hearsay and haven't been confirmed by anything,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state news agency TASS. The buildup since last fall of nearly 100,000 Russian forces, with potential plans for as many as 175,000, according to U.S. officials, has heightened fears of a full-scale invasion or new attack. In addition to the troops, Russia has stationed artillery systems and electronic warfare systems, according to U.S. ambassador to the OSCE, Michael Carpenter. ""The drumbeat of war is sounding loud, and the rhetoric has gotten rather shrill,"" Carpenter said Thursday after the third and last round of talks with Russia. ""We have to prepare for the eventuality that there could be an escalation."" That rhetoric - accusing Ukraine of abusing human rights and increasing belligerence - has dominated on Russia-language social media, according to the U.S. official. In December, it increased roughly 200 percent to nearly 3,500 posts per day, they said, in order ""to justify a Russian intervention and sow divisions in Ukraine."" That appeared to include a ""massive"" cyberattack against Ukrainian government sites on Friday. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said theirs and other sites were temporarily down, with a message posted on the site by the attackers, address to ""Ukrainians!"" ""All your information will become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future,"" it said in part. Andrei Yermark, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said later Friday that approximately 90 percent of sites have been restored and that critical infrastructure was not affected. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, and Yermak said the country's security service was investigating now. ""Of course, we have some thoughts,"" he added, saying this kind of attack was ""one of the potential parts of the destabilization"" that officials have warned about. With partners like the U.S. and the U.K., ""We will be ready to answer to this attack and continue to work with our partners to protect,"" he said. Psaki said President Joe Biden was briefed about the cyberattack against Ukrainian government sites, but held back from naming who might be behind it. ""We don't have attribution at this time, and I can't point to any more specifics … I would just note that we will take necessary and proper steps, of course, to defend our allies, support our partners, and support the Ukrainian people, but we're still assessing that at this point in time,"" she said.

2022-01-14,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-massive-cyberattack-hits-government-websites/story?id=82262888,Ukraine says 'massive cyberattack' hits government websites,"Ukraine said Friday a “massive cyber attack” has knocked offline the websites of most of its government ministries. The websites of the government’s cabinet office, the foreign ministry, emergency services minister, as well as the ministries of energy, education, agriculture and several others, were down on Friday, according to Ukrainian media. The country’s public services platform Diia, which holds Ukrainians’ tax numbers and COVID-19 vaccination certificates, was also hit. A message was posted on the targeted websites reading, “Ukrainians! All your personal data will be uploaded onto the general web. All data on your computer will be destroyed, it will be impossible to restore them. All your information will become public, be afraid and expect the worse. This is for your past, present and future.” Ukraine’s government has not said who is behind the attack. It comes amid fears of a Russian invasion of the country, as Moscow has massed around 100,000 soldiers at the border, and follows warnings from Ukraine and the United States that Russia might launch cyberattacks amid the tensions. A day earlier, talks between Moscow and NATO countries aimed at averting a possible Russian military attack concluded with no progress, with Russia saying they were reaching a “dead-end.” Ukraine’s government did not say whether the attack had caused damage beyond taking down the websites. “As a result of a massive cyber attack, the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies are temporarily down,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. “Our specialists are already working on restoring the work of IT systems, and the cyber police opened an investigation.” The message posted on the affected websites included a list of historical grievances. “This is for your past, present and future. For Volyn, for the OUN UPA [Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists/Ukrainian Insurgent Army], for Halychyna, for Polissya and for historical lands,” it read. The two groups named in the post refer to Ukrainian nationalist partisan fighters that collaborated with the Nazis during the Second World War. Russia frequently accuses Kyiv’s government of embracing fascist groups. On Friday, the European Union’s top foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, said the bloc’s political and social committees as well as its cyber units would meet to try to assist Ukraine. “We are going to mobilize all our resources to help Ukraine to tackle this cyberattack. Sadly, we knew it could happen,” Borrell was quoted as saying by Reuters at an E.U. foreign ministers meeting in Brest, France. “It’s difficult to say [who is behind it]. I can’t blame anybody as I have no proof, but we can imagine.” Russian officials on Thursday suggested the talks with the U.S. and NATO countries this week were at an impasse, since Western countries are refusing to accept Moscow’s key demands for binding guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance pull back troops from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. The U.S. and NATO have rejected those demands as “non-starters.” Russia’s lead negotiator, deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov, on Thursday said he saw no grounds for more talks in the near future as long as the U.S. and NATO were refusing Moscow’s key demands. But Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said the country will now wait for written responses from the U.S. and NATO, which it expects next week, before deciding next steps. Russia has denied it has any plans to attack Ukraine. It warned that if the U.S. and NATO fail to give security guarantees, it will take alternative measures that will have unspecified consequences for European security. Lavrov on Friday told reporters that Russia would not wait endlessly for the U.S. to accept Russia’s security demands on NATO. “Our patience is at an end,” he said at a pre-scheduled press conference in Moscow",,,,17
2022-01-15,https://abcnews.go.com/International/talks-make-progress-russian-attack-ukraine-analysis/story?id=82273678,"After talks make no progress, is Russian attack on Ukraine more likely?: Analysis","A week of high-profile diplomatic talks between the West and Russia have not dispelled fears that Russia may be preparing to attack Ukraine. Experts, who for months have been trying to understand whether Russia's troop buildup near Ukraine is a negotiating ploy or preparations for a real attack, say the question appears to have become: will Putin use force or not? On Friday, the Biden administration intensified its alarms, warning it believes Russia is ""preparing for an invasion of Ukraine…should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives."" The White House accused Russia of ""pre-positioning"" operatives to be ready to stage a ""false-flag operation"" in eastern Ukraine that would justify a Russian attack. Russia has denied it is preparing to attack Ukraine, but has threatened it may use unspecified ""military technical measures"" if its demands are not met. The concern is that after massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine over the last year, Russia in December made extraordinary demands, insisting on security guarantees that NATO will never allow Ukraine to become a member and that the alliance pull back troops from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. It made the demands in two draft ""treaties"" handed to the Biden administration and NATO. The U.S. and NATO called the demands a non-starter. But in the three sets of talks this week, Russia did not budge from its core demands. Again and again, its negotiators repeated it will accept nothing less than the NATO security guarantees. While expressing interest in the U.S. offers to discuss arms control, Russian officials said it was impossible to make progress on those areas without the guarantees. The U.S. and NATO in the talks were equally uncompromising in rejecting those guarantees, saying they cannot yield on core principles. The talks seem at an impasse. Russia's lead negotiator, deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov, on Thursday said the efforts had approached a ""dead-end."" Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said it is now waiting for written responses from the U.S. to Russia's treaties, after which Putin will decide next steps. The U.S. as well as some analysts have worried Russia was engaging in the talks all along with the expectation they would fail, allowing it to then claim it had no choice to use force after diplomacy failed. Some now said the talks' outcome proved that was the case. It is also possible that the consequences the Kremlin has referred to could be less than an attack on Ukraine, such as deploying missiles closer to Europe, or making its military build up near Ukraine more permanent. Ryabkov in an interview Thursday even refused to rule out deploying Russian weapons to Cuba or Venezuela, something the U.S. quickly dismissed as ""bluster."" But independent analysts say Russia is continuing to build up its forces near Ukraine. Open source researchers this week said there is evidence troops and equipment from units based in Russia's far east are now moving west. Conflict Intelligence Team, an open source group that tracks Russian military movements, said it has found a growing number of videos posted to social media that appeared to show long trains carrying tanks and other military vehicles traveling through eastern towns. Rob Lee, an analyst based at Kings College London's Department of War Studies, told ABC News on Thursday equipment that was being moved. ""It doesn't look routine,"" Lee said. ""It doesn't make that much sense that you'd see this many videos of things moving unless there was something else going on."" He said it was impossible to say definitively yet whether the Russian forces' destination was the border with Ukraine, but added that was ""the most likely explanation."" Most analysts have said they still don't believe Putin has made a final decision on whether to launch an attack. But what comes next seems to be in the Russian president's hands. ""For the moment, the next step is up to Putin,"" Lawrence Freedman, a professor also at the Kings College War Studies Department wrote in a post Friday. After this week's talks, it appears diplomacy seems to have failed to satisfy the Kremlin's objectives.",,,,17
2022-01-17,https://abcnews.go.com/International/north-korea-launches-4th-missile-test-weeks/story?id=82303889,North Korea launches 4th missile test in 2 weeks,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles toward the East Sea Monday morning, its fourth test in less than a month. “South Korea’s military detected two projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles launched into the East Sea to the northeast from the Sunan Airfield in Pyongyang, North Korea, around 08:50 a.m. and 08:54 a.m.,” South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff told reporters Monday. The missiles traveled about 236 miles and reached an altitude of about 26 miles, said South Korea’s military, which was analyzing details of the launch. It was the fourth missile launch this year, following two self-claimed hypersonic missile tests on Jan. 5 and Jan. 11 and last Friday’s short-range ballistic missile that the secluded regime’s state news agency, KCNA, claimed was launched from a rail car. Pyongyang’s consecutive showcases of its military capabilities came as the United States discussed sanctions on North Korea’s nuclear program. “North Korea probably believes they pulled out a response from the U.S. by firing hypersonic missiles in the new year because the U.S. acted with new sanctions,” Moon Keun-sik, a military expert at the Korea Defense and Security Forum, told ABC News. “North Korea claims that ballistic missile test-launch is a part of the training, but it also acknowledges that their action is a UN violation.” North Korea has said its weapons development is a rightful act of self-defense. The country blames the U.S. for escalated tensions. “The DPRK's recent development of new-type weapon was just part of its efforts for modernizing its national defense capability. Nevertheless, the U.S. is intentionally escalating the situation even with the activation of independent sanctions, not content with referring the DPRK's just activity to the UN Security Council,” KCNA said on Friday, citing North Korea’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson. North Korea expressed open discontent about the sanctions imposed last Wednesday on North Korean individuals and entities who support the country's ballistic-missile program. “We could say that the situation has escalated as the United States took out the sanctions card in response to North Korea's recent missile test launch,” Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korean studies at Seoul-based Dongguk University, told ABC News. “Through missile experiments, Kim Jong Un intends to highlight North Korea’s presence while the United States is mainly taking care of Ukraine issues, and at the same time maintain solidarity among their people.” Some experts saw the recent tests as planned drills on North Korea’s side. Kim Jong Un announced at the 8th Party Congress in January 2021 that the country planned to strengthen its weapon systems, including hypersonic missiles. “Pyongyang’s missile tests will take rounds and rounds for the next three years, not mainly intended to send a political message, which is only part of the motivation,” Bong Young-shik of Yonsei University told ABC News. “It would be a mistaken belief to think that the North Korea military can be bought out with massive immediate concessions because North Korea is moving on its own schedule by military capability.” Analysts in South Korea agreed that North Korea was following its own schedule to ramp up military capabilities in a time when there's a slim chance of negotiating with other countries in person. “North Korea is in the direction of enhancing the technical completeness of their missile program and knocking on the United States, trying to persuade them they should reach out to North Korea in any way,” Kim told ABC News. It isn’t the first time North Korea has scaled up in its weapons experiments. Back in 2019, North Korea fired over 20 short-range ballistic missiles between May and November.

2022-01-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/extremely-dangerous-moment-top-us-diplomat-travels-ukraine/story?id=82329712,"In 'extremely dangerous' moment, top US diplomat travels to Ukraine, to meet Russian counterpart","Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling to Ukraine, Germany, and Switzerland this week - a sign ""perhaps that diplomacy is not dead,"" a senior State Department official said Tuesday. As Russia continues to mass troops and military equipment near Ukraine's borders, including now in allied Belarus, the U.S. and European countries have become increasingly concerned the Kremlin may be preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine. But Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva on Friday, keeping the door to diplomacy open. ""This is an extremely dangerous situation. We're now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday -- a sharp rise in the United States' rhetorical warnings that Russian lead Vladimir Putin may attack his neighbor. Before sitting down with Lavrov, Blinken will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in his second visit to Kyiv as secretary - one week after CIA Director Bill Burns visited - and travel to Berlin for a summit with his German, French, and British counterparts. Months of Russian troop buildups and bellicose rhetoric led to a series of high-stakes diplomatic meetings last week. But the one-on-one U.S.-Russia talks, a summit between NATO and Moscow, and a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ended inconclusively. Putin laid out his demands in two draft treaties last month, including that Ukraine be barred from joining NATO and that the Western military alliance pull its troops out of Eastern European member states. But for weeks, the U.S. and NATO have called those nonstarters, instead offering to negotiate on other issues like arms control or military exercises and threatening massive sanctions if Russia attacks Ukraine. Russia has denied that it plans to invade Ukraine, where its troops have led eastern forces in a war against the government for eight years now and continue to occupy the peninsula Crimea. It has warned that if its demands aren't met, it will respond with ""military technical"" measures. Rather than tensions defusing, the threat of conflict seems to be rising, engineered by Russian moves. The Kremlin has begun moving troops into Belarus, Ukraine's neighbor to the north, for military exercises next month, including troops from its far east, Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed Tuesday, saying the exercises were designed to prepare Russian and Belarusian forces to ""thwart and repel a foreign aggression."" ""This is neither an exercise nor normal troop movement,"" the senior State Department official told reporters. ""It is a show of strength designed to cause or give false pretext for a crisis as Russia plans for a possible invasion."" A second senior State Department official went further later on Tuesday, calling into question whether the Belarusian government of strongman Alexander Lukashenko is really in charge and accusing the Kremlin of ""preying"" on his vulnerabilities with this ""concerning"" troop deployment. ""Over time, Lukashenka has relied more and more on Russia for all kinds of support, and we know that Putin doesn't give that support for free. ... There is no escaping that having dedicated his 27 years in office to claiming to be the guarantor of Belarus's sovereignty and independence, Lukashenka has increasingly shown that he will trade it all in order to stay in power,"" the senior official said. The bold accusation seems to be a sign of deep U.S. concern that Putin is making another power move here - this time to deepen his influence in Belarus. But the U.S. clearly sees it as a way for Moscow to more easily attack Ukraine, too - with Kyiv hundreds of miles closer to Belarus's borders than to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The deployment gives ""increased capability for Russia to launch this attack - increased opportunity, increased avenues, increased routes"" against Ukraine, the second senior State Department official said. Last Friday, the White House also said the U.S. had intelligence that Russia had positioned operatives trained in urban warfare and explosives for a possible ""false-flag"" operation that could also been used as pretext for an invasion - something the Kremlin denied as ""complete disinformation."" Blinken and Lavrov spoke Tuesday and agreed to meet Friday in Geneva, where U.S. and Russian delegations met last week. Their meeting will be another attempt to deescalate tensions, but it's unclear what new ground there is to tread. ""It is still too early to tell if the Russian government is genuinely interested in diplomacy, if it is prepared to negotiate seriously in good faith, or whether it will use discussions as a pretext to claim that diplomacy didn’t address Moscow’s interest. I just can’t judge that now, but I do understand the desire on our side to test that hypothesis,"" the first senior State Department official said. Before traveling to Switzerland, Blinken will be hosted by Zelenskiy in Kyiv, days after a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers visited and vowed continued U.S. support too, including arms. ""As we speak there are additional U.S. supplies that are being sent to Ukraine to make sure that they have what they need to fight back,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told ABC News. Blinken's visit comes on the heels of CIA Director Burns's last week, a senior U.S. official confirmed to ABC News. Burns also met with Zelenskiy and with his intelligence counterparts to discuss current assessments of the risk to Ukraine, the official said. In between Kyiv and Geneva, Blinken will meet German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock for the second time this month, with the new German government critical to the strength of any potential sanctions if Russia invades. Blinken and Baerbock will also meet their French and British counterparts in a show of diplomatic solidarity. There had been some signs of cracks in that unity, however, especially over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The project would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany, sidestepping Ukraine and removing a key source of revenue for Kyiv, which has pressed the U.S. to sanction the German company constructing it. But Biden has refused to do so, saying relations with Germany would suffer. Amid intense international pressure, Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz indicated Tuesday that he would be prepared to halt the pipeline if Russia attacks Ukraine - another signal of the costs Moscow would face if it moved ahead. ""If Russia does launch an attack on a sovereign country that borders NATO countries, it is likely that NATO will significantly increase its military activities, funding, and even membership - everything Russia claims to be trying to avoid,"" said Mick Mulroy, former deputy secretary of Defense and a retired CIA paramilitary officer. That could include Nord Stream 2's end and increased U.S. arms and training to Ukraine, too - with Mulroy adding, ""Russia could end up in a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in Ukraine, which they will soon regret.""

2022-01-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/inside-diplomatic-dash-stop-russian-attack-ukraine/story?id=82348839,Inside the diplomatic dash to stop a Russian attack on Ukraine,"The U.S. will keep pursuing diplomacy to prevent a Russian attack on Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Ukrainian leaders in a last-minute visit to the capital, Kyiv, on Wednesday. The visit, which included President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was meant to send a strong signal to Russia ahead of Blinken's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday -- a critical sit-down after the White House warned Russia could attack ""at any point"" now. With approximately 100,000 troops massed near Ukraine's borders, including now in neighboring Belarus, Russia has demanded the U.S. and NATO bar Ukraine from joining the military alliance and pull back troops from Eastern European member states. If not, Russian leader Vladimir Putin has threatened ""military technical"" consequences, even as his government denies it is planning to invade. Eight years after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and amid its slow-motion annexation of eastern provinces known as the Donbas, Blinken urged Ukrainians to unify and promised continued U.S. support. ""Don't let Moscow divide you,"" Blinken said during a press conference with Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, adding, ""As you stand up to efforts to divide, to intimidate, to threaten, the United States stands with you resolutely in your right to make decisions for your own future, to shape that future as Ukrainians for Ukraine."" As a critical part of that effort, President Joe Biden approved $200 million of military aid to Ukraine, a senior State Department official confirmed Wednesday. That brings total U.S. military assistance in the last year to over half a billion dollars -- $650 million in total, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, patrol boats, ammunition, medical equipment and more. Biden approved the package late last month and used an authority to bypass arms control regulations to swiftly provide aid in an emergency, according to congressional sources briefed on the aid. But the State Department had not confirmed the tranche was approved, even after it was reported in the media last week. There were fears that it would anger the Russians during three rounds of high-stakes talks -- between the U.S. and Russia, NATO and Russia, and at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, one of Russia's top negotiators during those talks, criticized giving U.S. arms to Ukraine again on Wednesday -- something Moscow has complained about as it casts its much smaller neighbor as a threat. ""We underline the necessity of ceasing boosting the war-like Ukrainian regime with arms deliveries, training assistance, the development of plans and their implementation in erecting military bases, conducting training events and a lot else that represents a direct threat for us,"" Ryabkov said, according to Russian news agencies. The defensive weapons the U.S. has provided would do little to push back against Russia's overwhelming military power. Some analysts have suggested Russia may be considering an attack on Ukraine now before the former Soviet state's military grows stronger, its democracy and economy become more stable, and its relations fall into greater alignment with Western Europe and the U.S. ""We have been providing defensive assistance to Ukraine consistently, including deliveries that are taking place in just the last few weeks alone,"" Blinken told reporters, declining to provide details or even mention the $200 million. Kuleba added that Ukraine is ""very strong"" now and praised the Biden administration for its ""very good cooperation... in the area of military assistance."" ""We know that the United States stands with us not only in the area of security but also in supporting our internal strength,"" he added. But Republican lawmakers in Washington urged Biden to do more, including sanctioning Russian officials and providing more lethal arms to Ukraine before a potential Russian attack, not after one. Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Biden's administration ""is about three months behind where they should be at this time"" and too focused ""on what the U.S. would do after Russia invades, not what are they going to do to stop Russia from invading."" A bipartisan group of lawmakers met with Biden Wednesday morning, including senators who just returned from a congressional delegation to Kyiv. Both the White House and Republican senators described it as constructive and informative, with Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-S.D., saying Biden ""listened attentively. He shared a lot as well."" Fighting in the Donbas has killed some 14,000 people and counting, with tensions periodically flaring as Russian forces or the local separatists they lead exchange artillery or sniper fire with Ukrainian troops. The gray-zone conflict has kept Ukraine on a war footing with fears that Russia could eventually annex the region, where it has given out Russian citizenship to residents. A bill urging Putin to recognize the Russian-controlled regions as independent was proposed in the Russian parliament Wednesday. The U.S. also said it has intelligence that Russia has positioned operatives trained in urban warfare and explosives in Ukraine for potential ""false-flag"" operations that would give it pretext to attack. The Kremlin denied that was true, calling it ""complete disinformation,"" but NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday there is ""a significant Russian presence of intelligence officers or operatives inside Ukraine"" who are ""trying to undermine the government, the authorities and also absolutely possible that they are also planning for different incidents, accidents, false flag operations."" A cyberattack on Ukrainian government websites Friday may have been part of that strategy as well, according to Ukrainian officials. Andriy Kuzmich, a senior Ukrainian government cyber official, called it ""the largest cyberattack on Ukraine in the last four years, at least in scale,"" although it's unclear if Russian government or non-state actors were responsible. The U.S. has not made any attribution yet. Amid all the threats and warnings, both sides seem to believe the door is still open to diplomacy with Blinken and Lavrov's Friday meeting. The Kremlin said the U.S. proposed the sit down. Russian officials have said they are growing impatient with the series of meetings, with Ryabkov saying Wednesday they will not ""wait endlessly."" ""We are not prepared to get bogged down in the usual diplomatic, bureaucratic hoopla... We need a clear and direct answer, moreover in written form,"" they said. On that last request, the U.S. and Russia are also at odds. The Russian Foreign Ministry published two draft treaties in December, laying out its demands about NATO, Ukraine and more -- many of which U.S. officials said were ""nonstarters."" But their demands to receive a response in writing are also for now being rejected. ""I won't be presenting a paper at that time to Foreign Minister Lavrov. We need to see where we are and see if there remain opportunities to pursue the diplomacy and pursue the dialogue,"" Blinken said in Kyiv. ""We're taking stock of the conversations [last week] and will pursue this on Friday in Geneva, and I suspect I'll have more to say then."" Before traveling to Geneva, Blinken will stop in Berlin on Thursday to meet Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz and foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and hold a joint meeting with her and their British and French counterparts -- again projecting unity against Moscow. Russia has been using its own alliances to strengthen its hand, speculating that it may position troops near the U.S. in two key Latin American ally countries, Venezuela and Cuba, and move forces into Belarus for joint military exercises. Those troops, which first began arriving over the weekend, have alarmed U.S. officials, who have said it gives Russia another launchpad to attack Ukraine -- and one that's hundreds of miles closer to Kyiv. A senior State Department official warned Tuesday that Russia is seizing power in Belarus and questioned how involved strongman Alexander Lukashenko was in the decision to bring in Russian troops. But some argue that all of these escalations -- Russian troop movements, bellicose rhetoric, draft treaties -- are about Putin creating leverage from a weak hand to project strength and protect himself. ""It just takes my breath away to watch how Putin pulls this on the American establishment again and again: threaten to escalate - negotiate - pull back; threaten to escalate - negotiate - pull back,"" Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny told TIME from prison, the magazine reported Wednesday. ""Instead of ignoring this nonsense, the U.S. accepts Putin's agenda and runs to organize some meetings. Just like a frightened schoolboy who's been bullied by an upperclassman,"" added Navalny, who was poisoned by Russian agents and imprisoned upon his return to the country.

2022-01-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-escalates-pressure-russia-approving-arms-accusing-plot/story?id=82373499,"US escalates pressure on Russia, approving new arms and accusing it of plot against Ukraine","Ahead of a key meeting on Friday between the U.S. and Russia, the Biden administration on Thursday pushed a full-scale campaign to pressure Moscow as Russian leader Vladimir Putin weighs a possible attack on its neighbor Ukraine. The U.S. approved its NATO allies in the Baltics to provide additional arms to Ukraine, including critical anti-aircraft missiles that escalate U.S. support. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned four Ukrainian officials it accused of working with Russian intelligence, including to form a new government backed by Russian occupying forces. The State Department blasted a Russian disinformation campaign it said was part of its ""pretext"" to invade Ukraine and ""divide the international reaction to its actions."" One day before his sit-down with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried to push back on Russia's narrative and make clear just how high the stakes are in the standoff. ""It's bigger than a conflict between two countries. It's bigger than Russia and NATO. It's a crisis with global consequences, and it requires global attention and action,"" the top U.S. diplomat said in Berlin, hours after meeting his German, French, and British counterparts to coordinate a response. That coordination has had tremendous doubt cast on it after President Joe Biden said Wednesday that the NATO alliance was not united about how to respond to aggression from Russia that fell short of an all-out attack on Ukraine -- an uncomfortable truth that U.S. and NATO officials have tried to paper over for weeks. After the White House scrambled to clean that up, Biden himself clarified on Thursday, ""If any -- any -- assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion. But -- and it will be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I've discussed in detail with our allies."" But the challenge remains of what the U.S. and its allies will do if Russia attacks Ukraine with the same gray-zone tactics it has used for the last eight years, as it annexed Crimea, launched a war in eastern Ukraine, and began a slow-motion annexation of those provinces. That war, which has killed approximately 14,000 people, rages on in fits and starts on the frontlines -- and in cyberspace. Ukrainian government websites were hacked in """"the largest cyberattack on Ukraine in the last four years,"" a Ukrainian cyber official said Wednesday, and Moscow has launched a ""disinformation storm"" portraying Ukraine as the aggressor and trying to ""build public support for a further Russian invasion,"" a senior State Department official said Thursday. The Kremlin's campaign to destabilize its smaller, democratic neighbor allegedly includes spies on the ground, collecting information and even plotting to form a new Ukrainian government. ""Russia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control Ukraine’s critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force,"" the U.S. Treasury said in a statement. The U.S. has sanctioned two sitting members of Ukrainian parliament, Taras Kozak and Oleh Voloshyn, who it accused of furthering a plot by the FSB, Russia's main security agency and the successor of the KGB. The agency, which Biden said Wednesday has forces on the ground in Ukraine, is ""destabilizing the political situation in Ukraine and laying the groundwork for creating a new, Russian-controlled government in Ukraine,"" Treasury added. In the face of that effort, the U.S. is hoping that transparency can undercut any pretext Russian operatives or their Ukrainian colleagues may create -- just as the White House last week accused the Kremlin of positioning operatives trained in urban warfare and explosives and planning a possible ""false-flag"" operation. Russia has denied that, calling it ""complete disinformation."" It has said repeatedly it does not plan to attack the former Soviet state, even as Putin warned that his demands, including barring Ukraine from joining NATO, be met or Russia will take ""military technical"" measures. The U.S. is taking its own military measures, approving the transfer of more weaponry to Ukraine -- this time from Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, a State Department spokesperson confirmed, while declining to say what weapons exactly. But a Lithuanian Ministry of Defense source told ABC News the country was given the green light to transfer to Ukraine Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger portable surface-to-air missiles. The Baltic state wanted to send the weapons even earlier, but because they were originally U.S. provided, it needed American approval, which only came during consultations Wednesday, the source said. Stingers are a kind of man-portable air-defense system, or MANPAD, where an individual soldier can carry the weapon and use it to down fighter aircraft. Javelins, which the Trump administration provided after the Obama administration had refused, have become an important weapon for Ukraine to pierce Russian-made tanks, which could come rolling across the border in an invasion . Ukraine's military capacity still pales in comparison to Russia's overwhelming military superiority, and it's unclear how many missiles are being provided. Lithuania has only 54 of the missiles in its inventory and only eight launchers from which to fire them from, meaning the amount provided to Ukraine will likely be even lower. Still, Stinger missiles in particular represent a symbolic threshold that previous administrations had not crossed. While some lawmakers have called for providing them and even more advanced weapons like a missile defense system, others have warned going too far could provoke Putin. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who was in Kyiv earlier this week as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation, said Thursday that in this ""very fragile time... it would not be helpful to give Putin an excuse to invade Ukraine, so I think we've got to be very thoughtful about how we address some of these issues like a missile system,"" like the advanced Patriot missile system. Russia has already warned that it sees any Western weapons provided to Ukraine as a threat, especially after the U.S. announced $200 million in new military aid ($650 million total over the last year) and the United Kingdom announced it provided anti-tank missiles. Russia, however, has warned that it sees any Western weapons provided to Ukraine as a threat. ""We underline the necessity of ceasing boosting the war-like Ukrainian regime with arms deliveries ... and a lot else that represents a direct threat for us,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday. But Blinken pushed back on that Thursday in a major speech, disputing the Russian narrative and making clear Moscow is the aggressor. ""On its face, that’s absurd. NATO didn't invade Georgia, NATO didn't invade Ukraine - Russia did,"" he said, adding NATO neighbors account for six percent of Russia's borders and have 5,000 allied troops in those countries, while Russia has massed 20 times that around Ukraine. There has been tense speculation about whether Putin will attack Ukraine, with Biden saying Wednesday he believes the strongman leader will ""move in."" But Blinken said Thursday the U.S. still believes he has not made up his mind yet, but added his animus towards Ukraine has long been known. ""He's told us repeatedly - he's laying the groundwork for an invasion because he doesn't believe that Ukraine is a sovereign nation,"" Blinken said. That argument has been a key part of Russia's disinformation ecosystem, which has been in overdrive in recent weeks, according to senior State Department officials. Russia's military and intelligence entities have deployed 3,500 posts per day in December -- an increase of 200 percent from November -- as they seek to ""create conditions conducive to success of attempted aggression in Ukraine and elsewhere and to divide the international reaction to its actions,"" a senior State Department official told reporters. ""These are not just public statements from Russia's MFA accounts ... These are broader campaigns using shell companies, false names, and layers to conceal the real backers and their intentions,"" a second senior State Department official said, calling it ""a war on truth."" Russia must pull back its propaganda campaign in addition to its troops on Ukraine's borders, the official added, echoing previous U.S. calls for de-escalation to give diplomacy a shot. Whether or not diplomacy has a shot will be tested again Friday in Geneva, where Blinken and Lavrov will meet. A senior State Department official said earlier in the week that the meeting itself is a sign the door to diplomacy remains open, but the two sides continue to talk past each other. The two diplomats will ""discuss draft agreements on security guarantees,"" Russia's embassy in Washington tweeted Thursday - a reference to its demands that NATO bar Ukraine from joining and pull back forces from Eastern European member states. But U.S. officials have repeatedly called those ""nonstarters,"" and Blinken said Wednesday in Kyiv he would not be ""presenting a paper"" to Lavrov in response. That has raised fears that Moscow is simply using diplomatic talks to see them fail - yet another pretext before an attack. But regardless of whether there's a full-born assault, Russia has now effectively shaken Ukraine once again. Its president Volodymyr Zelenskyy tried to reassure the nation late Wednesday, even pushing back on the U.S. warnings that the threat is more urgent.

2022-01-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-putin-meet-resolve-standoff-ukraine-blinken/story?id=82394819,"Biden, Putin might meet to resolve standoff over Ukraine, Blinken says","Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin might meet in an effort to resolve the standoff over Ukraine and the threat of a Russian invasion. ""If it proves useful and productive for the two presidents to meet, to talk, to engage, to try to carry things forward, I think we're fully prepared to do that,"" Blinken said in Geneva, Switzerland, after holding talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. There were no breakthroughs in their meeting, he said, but the two sides have agreed to return to their capitals and hold consultations before meeting again -- keeping the door to diplomacy open after weeks of heightened tensions over Russia's massive troop buildup near Ukraine's border. Later, speaking with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" -- asked whether it would take a summit to resolve the situation -- Blinken confirmed the U.S. was open to that idea. ""That's certainly something we're prepared to do. Right now, the plan is to take stock of where we are next week after we share some ideas with Russia,"" Blinken told ABC News. Those ideas will be a written response to Russia's two draft treaties, released publicly in December, where Moscow demanded that the U.S. and NATO bar Ukraine from joining the Western military alliance and pull troops back from Eastern European member states. Those two demands are ""nonstarters,"" U.S. officials have said, but after repeated Russian requests for a written response, Blinken confirmed Friday that the U.S. will provide one before he and Lavrov meet again. ""There are certain issues and fundamental principles that the United States and our partners and allies are committed to defend. That includes those that would impede the sovereign right of the Ukrainian people to write their own future. There is no trade space there - none,"" Blinken told reporters. That disagreement has left three previous rounds of talks last week to end inconclusively -- between the U.S. and Russia, NATO and Russia, and at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. But Russia has dismissed more talks with European countries, instead seeking direct engagement with the U.S. -- and to create a rift between the U.S. and its NATO allies. Blinken said after Friday's high-stakes meeting that he would return to Washington to consult Biden, members of Congress, and allies and partners. ""Based on our discussion, I believe we can carry forward this work of developing understanding agreements together that ensure our mutual security, but that's contingent on Russia stopping its aggression toward Ukraine,"" he said. But that's unlikely to happen any time soon. Russia now has some 100,000 troops massed on three sides of Ukraine, including in Crimea, the peninsula it annexed in 2014, and Belarus, Ukraine's neighbor to the north where strongman Alexander Lukashenko has increasingly relied on Russian support to prop him up. Lavrov did not commit to pull those troops back, but said again that Russia is not going to attack Ukraine. He urged Blinken to focus on Russia's security proposals rather than the heightened tensions over Ukraine, he said at his own press conference afterwards. ""I haven't heard any point today that would justify the American position on what is happening on the Russian-Ukrainian border. Only concerns, concerns, concerns,"" Lavrov told reporters, calling the State Department's stated concerns about Russian actions ""blatant lies."" Despite that brusque tone, Blinken said the two sides left the meetings with a ""better understanding"" of each other's positions - calling it ""not a negotiation, but a candid exchange of concerns and ideas."" Whether that means Russia is engaging in good faith, or whether Putin still continue to destabilize Ukraine and even launch an attack, remains unresolved. ""It's ultimately going to be President Putin who decides what Russia will do,"" Blinken told ""Good Morning America.""",,,,27

The call was with the leaders of the European Commission, European Council, NATO, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, according to the White House, which said they planned to ""discuss diplomacy, deterrence and defense efforts"" as well as what would constitute potential sanctions against Russia. It lasted 1 hour and 20 minutes, the White House said. The White House said after the call that Biden and European leaders ""reiterated their continued concern about the Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders"" and also discussed ""preparations to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia for such actions as well as to reinforce security on NATO's eastern flank."" The statement, though, didn't explicitly mention the possibility of the U.S. sending more troops to the region. ""The leaders underscored their shared desire for a diplomatic resolution to the current tensions and reviewed recent engagements with Russia in multiple formats,"" the statement from the White House said. Biden's official @POTUS Twitter account also tweeted a photo of him in the Situation Room for the meeting, with the caption: ""Today, I spoke with European leaders in response to Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's borders. We discussed our joint efforts to deter further Russian aggression, such as preparations to impose severe economic costs on Russia and reinforce security on the eastern flank."" Earlier, at the end of opening remarks at a meeting on economic competition, Biden said the U.S. and its European allies had ""total unanimity"" on Ukraine. ""I had a very, very, very good meeting. Total unanimity with all the European leaders,"" the president said. The Pentagon announced Monday that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had placed around 8,500 U.S.-based troops on ""heightened alert"" for rapid deployment to assist NATO if needed. No decision to deploy them had been made, though, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, who noted that the U.S. could also offer troops already stationed in Europe. Asked if those troops could be sent directly to Ukraine, Kirby indicated there had been no change to when Biden said last month, that sending troops to the country was ""not on the table."" Kirby said there had been ""no decisions"" about moving the fewer than 200 U.S. troops who are already in Ukraine out of the country; those service members have been training members of the Ukrainian military. He said the personnel included ""additional brigade combat teams, logistics personnel, medical support, aviation support, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as transportation, and maybe even some additional capabilities after that."" Biden's administration has developed a range of options as it seeks to reassure European allies while deterring Russia, including sending more U.S. troops to the region, a U.S. official told ABC News. But the official stressed that ""no decisions have been made"" yet, and the White House denied there had been any shift in strategy. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned that the U.S. response to a possible Russian invasion could result in a cyberattack launched against the U.S. by the Russian government or its proxies. The New York Times, citing unnamed Biden administration officials, reported Sunday that over the weekend, senior Pentagon officials presented the president several options about moving American military assets closer to Russia. One choice, the Times reported, involved sending 1,000 to 5,000 American troops to Eastern European countries. A senior Russian member of parliament on Monday said Russia would ""give a relevant response to the escalating threats,"" in response to the Times' article. ""Obviously, Russia will not let such actions slide,"" Andrei Kartapolov, the chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday declined to confirm the specifics of the Times' report -- or provide a timeline for Biden to make a decision on sending troops -- but said the U.S. strategy had not shifted. ""We've always said we would reinforce our allies on the eastern flank"" of NATO, she said. ""And those conversations and discussions have certainly been part of what our national security officials have been discussing with their counterparts now for several weeks."" Biden has, in fact, publicly threatened to send more troops to eastern Europe if Russia's President Vladimir Putin escalated the situation militarily. ""We're going to actually increase troop presence in Poland, in Romania, et cetera, if in fact he moves, because we have a sacred obligation in Article 5 to defend those countries,"" Biden said Wednesday, referring to the principle of collective defense enshrined in the NATO treaty. The president met with national security advisers on Saturday while he was at Camp David, the White House said. NATO on Monday outlined several steps that its member nations had taken to deter Russia from invading, including deploying troops and ships. The Kremlin, which has denied Russia plans to invade Ukraine, said Monday that NATO's latest statement about deployments ""leads to the further escalation of tensions."" ""Please note that all of that is not happening because of what we, Russia, do,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""This is happening because of the actions of NATO and the United States and the information they release."" On Sunday, the State Department Department ordered diplomats' families Sunday afternoon to depart the U.S. embassy in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, amid heightened fears of a Russian attack on the country. In an updated travel advisory issued later Sunday, the State Department confirmed the drawdown and urged U.S. citizens in Ukraine to consider departing the country now using commercial flights. And on Saturday, the British government accused Moscow of ""looking to install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv as it considers whether to invade and occupy Ukraine."" Russia's foreign ministry denied that was the case. Psaki on Monday threatened a response if Russia moved forward with such a plan. ""Reports of this kind of plotting are deeply concerning,"" she said. ""If acted upon would constitute a severe escalation, and certainly there would be consequences.""

2022-01-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-put-forces-standby-amid-fears-russian-attack/story?id=82437821,NATO to put more forces on standby amid fears of Russian attack on Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine -- Amid deepening anxiety over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States announced it's pulling out diplomats' families and some staff from its embassy in the country. Meanwhile, NATO announced it was putting extra forces on standby. As Russia continues to mass tens of thousands of troops close to Ukraine's borders, NATO said the alliance was sending a small number of ships and fighter jets to Eastern Europe to strengthen its ""deterrence"" presence there and reassure its eastern members, Denmark is sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 warplanes to Lithuania. At the same time, France is ready to send troops to Romania under NATO command, and Spain is considering deploying fighter jets to Bulgaria, NATO said in a statement. The Netherlands has agreed to send two F-35 jets to Bulgaria and has put a ship and land-based forces on standby for a NATO response force, officials said. ""NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance,"" NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. The NATO announcement coincided with a report in The New York Times that the Biden administration may be preparing to send up to 5,000 American troops to Eastern European members of the alliance. The White House and the Pentagon have not confirmed the report, though the administration has previously said sending more U.S. troops to Eastern Europe is on the table if Russia attacks Ukraine. NATO on Monday said the ""United States has also made clear that it is considering increasing its military presence in the eastern part of the Alliance."" The steps to boost NATO's readiness came as the U.S. State Department announced Sunday it was ordering the families of its diplomats at its embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv to leave the country over security fears. The State Department said it has also authorized non-emergency staff at the embassy to depart voluntarily. The United Kingdom on Monday followed suit, with its Foreign Office saying some embassy staff and their dependents would be withdrawn ""in response to the growing threat from Russia."" Ukraine's government criticized the U.S. evacuation calling them ""premature"" and ""excessively cautious."" ""While we respect right of foreign nations to ensure safety & security of their diplomatic missions, we believe such a step to be a premature one & an instance of excessive caution,"" Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's foreign ministry, tweeted. Ukrainian officials are unhappy with the message the evacuations send by suggesting that a Russian invasion could be imminent. In general, they are much more skeptical that Russia is planning to launch a major attack and worry that western countries risk helping Moscow by exaggerating the risk and spreading panic. Privately, American officials acknowledge there is a gap between the Ukrainian and U.S. assessment of the level of threat. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. official told ABC News this weekend that Ukraine was ""p----- off"" over the evacuations. A senior State Department official on Sunday insisted the embassy drawdown did not undermine America's commitment to Ukraine, saying they were just ""prudent precautions"" given the heightened fear of a Russian attack. The official said the decision was ""based on this military buildup, based on how we see these developments,"" calling it the ""right moment."" Those leaving the embassy will do so on commercial flights, the State Department has said, indicating it is not an emergency evacuation. The State Department were scarred by the chaotic evacuation of Afghanistan, where thousands of Americans were stranded after the sudden Taliban takeover there caught the U.S. off guard. Officials are anxious to avoid a similar situation in Ukraine, should the worst happen. Russia has repeatedly insisted it has no intention of attacking Ukraine. However, its military buildup continues near Ukraine's eastern border and now in Belarus, where trainloads of Russian tanks and artillery have been arriving for joint exercises there. A top commander of Russian-controlled separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine on Monday also accused Ukraine's military of preparing to launch an offensive against the separatist areas. The U.S. and Ukraine are concerned that a false claim of a Ukrainian offensive against the separatists could be used as a pretext for Russia to launch an invasion. Eduard Basurin, the head of the militia of the separatists' self-declared 'People's Republic of Donetsk' (DNR), in local media warned it ""firmly recommends the enemy to give up its criminal intentions,"" promising the Ukrainian army ""will suffer irreparable damage, after which it will not be able to recover."" Ukraine's government has insisted it will not launch any offensive and there is no evidence Ukraine is preparing to.",,,,17

""If he were to move in with all those forces, it would be the largest invasion since World War II. It would change the world,"" Biden told reporters at an unannounced stop at a local business in Washington. Asked about what would lead him to deploy the troops staging nearby, Biden said that depends on ""what Putin does or doesn't do"" but he repeated that American forces would not move into Ukraine. ""I may be moving some of those troops in the nearer term, just because it takes time,"" Biden said, adding it's not to be ""provocative"" but to reassure NATO allies whom have reasons for concern. ""We have no intention of putting American forces, or NATO forces, in Ukraine. But we -- as I said -- they're gonna be serious economic consequences if he [Putin] moves,"" Biden added. Asked whether the risk of an invasion is increasing, decreasing or steady, Biden compared assessing Putin's intentions to ""reading tea leaves."" ""The fact that he continues to build forces along Ukraine's border from Belarus, all the way around, you'd say, 'Well that means that he is looking like he's trying to do something.' But then you look at what his past behavior is and what everyone is saying on his team, as well as everyone else, as to what is likely to happen.

Kristina Kvien, the embassy's charge d'affairs, made the remarks after standing in the bitter cold with a Ukrainian deputy defense minister to receive a 79-ton delivery of American military aid at Kyiv's Boryspil Airport, intended to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. The U.S. State Department on Sunday ordered diplomats' families to leave and authorized non-emergency staff to depart if they choose, in light of the threat of a possible Russian invasion, as Moscow masses over 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders. Ukraine's government has criticized the decision, calling it ""premature"" and ""excessively cautious."" The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Germany have since followed suit in various forms, but the majority of European countries have said so far they do not believe such a step is warranted. Kvien told ABC News the decision on the partial evacuation was taken out of an ""abundance of caution"" given the scale of the Russian build up. ""The decision was made because right now Vladimir Putin and Russia have built up such military might on the border that they could take an action any day now,"" she said. ""And with that in mind, we felt that out of an abundance of caution, we had to make sure that our embassy families were safe. So that was the basis for a decision."" Kvien said Russia had built up so many troops it ""means that Russia could do anything at any moment."" ""It's like a gun to the head of Ukraine,"" she said. ""And we don't think that Ukraine should have to live with a loaded gun to its head."" Ukrainian officials have publicly disagreed with the U.S. assessment that a Russian attack could take place at any moment. A deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, on Tuesday said the number of Russian troops at the border currently is ""not enough for a full-scale invasion."" In general, Ukrainian officials are more skeptical that Russia will really go through with a major attack and in recent days they have become increasingly vocal in contesting the picture coming from the U.S. that an attack is imminent. The head of Ukraine's national security council, Alexey Danilov, on Monday told the BBC that ""the number of Russian troops is not increasing in the way many people are presenting it"". Ukrainian officials instead have suggested they believe Russia's build up is currently intended to destabilize Ukraine with the threat of attack, including by undermining its economy. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in video addresses has urged Ukrainians not to panic and that the threat of invasion is not worse now than when Russia began the conflict in 2014. Kvien said she believed Ukraine's government views the threat seriously. ""I do think that President Zelenskyy is taking the threat very seriously, and he is being careful to make preparations as needed,"" she said. ""They've been living with Russian threats for a long time. So I would say that they are just a bit more, 'sang froid' as they say, in French. But that doesn't mean that they don't take them seriously,"" she said. The U.S. military aid shipment landing on Tuesday was the third to arrive in a week, part of a $200 million security aid package approved to help Ukraine defend itself and deter Russia. The delivery included 276 Javelin anti-tank missiles, over 800 SMAW-D shoulder-fired ""bunker buster"" missiles, 170, 000 rounds of 50-caliber ammunition, as well as bomb disposal suits. Kvien said the weapons demonstrated the U.S.' ""absolute, rock-solid support"" for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S. is still seeking to avert a Russian attack through diplomacy. Russia has demanded guarantees from the U.S. that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will pull back forces from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. The U.S. has already ruled that out but has proposed discussing other security issues, such as limits on missiles deployments and military exercises. Kvien repeated there are ""some areas"" that the U.S. is able to talk about with Russia to try to address its concerns, such as ""arms control, better transparency in terms of military exercises,"" but she reiterated that Ukraine's choice to try to join NATO was not on the table. She said she hoped Putin would choose to take the path of diplomacy. ""I think that it's the only reasonable path. I think it's the only path that ultimately will lead to a more secure Europe, which Mr. Putin says he would like to have,"" she said. Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the quantity of 50-caliber ammunition in the U.S. military aid shipment that arrived Tuesday. It was 170,000 rounds not 170 pounds.",,,,7

From President Volodymyr Zelenskyy down, the Ukrainian government has tried to urge calm, with senior officials making clear in recent days they don't see the risks now as any more heightened than over the last eight years of Russian-stoked conflict in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar, for example, said the number of Russian troops massed on Ukraine's borders ""are not enough for a full-scale invasion."" Instead, Russian leader Vladimir Putin is using the troop build-up ""primarily to politically blackmail the West and pressure Ukraine,"" she wrote in a Facebook post. ""Russia's tactical goal is provoke integral divisions in our society, sow fear and panic, to destabilize the internal situation,"" she added. Ukrainian concern that fear and panic could spread, sending Ukraine's economy spiraling or creating political turmoil, has started to create divisions between the U.S. and Ukraine -- despite efforts on both sides to make clear they stand united against any Russian aggression. ""All is under control. There are no reasons to panic,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address to his country Monday night -- but the speech spent more time on COVID-19 than Russia. Some of the steps the U.S. has taken in recent days, some in Kyiv fear, are playing into Moscow's playbook -- stoking fear and panic. That includes the State Department's decision to draw down the U.S. embassy, ordering diplomats' families to evacuate and authorizing non-emergency staff to depart if they choose. State Department spokesperson Ned Price called it a ""prudent precaution,"" but his Ukrainian counterpart, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko criticized it as ""a premature one and an instance of excessive caution."" ""The Russian Federation is currently taking active efforts to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. A large amount of misinformation, manipulation, and fakes are spreading in Ukrainian and international media in order to cause panic among Ukrainians and foreigners, intimidate business, and undermine the economic and financial stability of our state. In this situation, it is important to soberly assess the risks and stay calm,"" Nikolenko added. Just four countries have followed the U.S., to varying degrees -- the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Germany. ""We cannot allow ourselves for that to happen - that our economy falls. If people cross into a state of panic, that is a dangerous situation for our country, and it will be far easier to then manipulate us, and that is Russia's goal,"" warned Aleksey Danilov, a top Ukrainian national security official. Some economic damage is already apparent. Yields on Ukrainian sovereign Eurobonds in U.S. dollars suddenly shot up to 11-14% on Jan. 14 and have risen even higher since -- losing Ukraine access to the international financial market, according to Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Stockholm Free World Forum. ""Ukraine's emerging economic problems are entirely due to the shadow cast by the threat of a dramatic escalation in Russian military aggression,"" Åslund wrote for the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. The White House and State Department defended the administration's decisions and rhetoric, denying that drawing down the embassy, putting 8,500 U.S. troops on alert, and warning of an ""imminent"" threat have escalated the situation. ""I will let others assess, but there are 100,000 troops -- Russian troops -- on the border of Ukraine and no clarity that the leader of Russia doesn't intend to invade. That sounds pretty dangerous to me,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday. But 100,000 is not enough for an invasion, according to Malyar and the top commander for Ukraine's forces on the frontlines. Lt. Gen. Oleksander Pavlyuk told ABC News last week that Ukraine had assessed Russian had 127,000 troops in total, although the U.S. still says approximately 100,000. Either way, Ukraine's own army is approximately 200,000 strong now, and many more Russian troops would be needed to invade a country the size of Texas. The number of Russian troops is also ""not increasing in the way that today many are representing,"" Danilov, who serves as secretary of Ukraine's national security council, told the BBC in an interview Tuesday. ""Is it unpleasant for us? Yes, but for us, it's not news. If for someone in the West that has become news, well, I'm sorry."" Still, Psaki denied there was daylight between Washington and Kyiv, adding, ""We are in constant contact with Ukrainians to reiterate our support, to convey updates on shipments of supplies, military equipment -- something that's been happening over the last several days."" Nikolenko too highlighted that military cooperation, praising ""its proactive diplomatic position and for strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities, including the provision of weapons and equipment."" Asked about the differences, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine Kristina Kvien denied there were any. In an exclusive interview Tuesday where a shipment of U.S. Javelin anti-tank and other weapons was being unleaded, she told ABC News, ""President Zelenskyy is taking the threat very seriously, and he is being careful to make preparations as needed."" The Ukrainian people have ""been living with Russian threats for a long time, so I would say that they are just a bit more 'sang-froid' as they say in French. But that doesn't mean that they don't take them seriously,"" added Kvien, the embassy's chargé d'affaires. In Kyiv, there is calm, if at least more talk now about the threat of a Russian attack -- whether across the border, in cyber space, or through continued efforts to destabilize Ukraine's government and economy. ""This looks and feels different … It certainly has people a lot more alert, especially if you watch the news all the time,"" said Reno Domenico, an American businessman who has lived in Ukraine for 15 years. But he said the cafes remain full, and people are out shopping because, ""People don't panic, and panic is a bad thing. You make bad decisions when you panic."" After the U.S. Embassy urged Americans to consider departing immediately, Domenico said more people started talking about the possibility. While everyone should have a plan, he added, his is to stay put for now. ABC News's Patrick Reevell contributed to this report from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Desiree Adib from New York.",,,,26
2022-01-26,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-diplomacy-ukraine-ball-court-blinken/story?id=82485448,Russia maybe 'not serious' about diplomacy on Ukraine but ball in its court: Blinken,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at the State Department on Wednesday, confirmed the U.S. had delivered a written response to Moscow security demands as Russia amassed troops on its borders with Ukraine. ""Today, Ambassador Sullivan delivered our written response in Moscow. All told, it sets out a serious diplomatic path forward, should Russia choose it,"" Blinken said. ""The document we’ve delivered includes concerns of the United States and our allies and partners about Russia's actions that undermine security, a principled and pragmatic evaluation of the concerns that Russia has raised, and our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground,"" he continued. ""This is not a negotiating document,"" Blinken said, adding that President Joe Biden was ""involved from the get-go"" and had signed off on it. ""The ball is their court,"" he added, referring to the Russians. Russia had said it would not continue talks until Moscow had the responses in hand, and Blinken announced after meeting in Geneva last week with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the U.S. would oblige, which some argued might be seen as a U.S. concession. But Blinken denied that, saying the U.S. did not change its positions in the paper, but ""reiterated what we said publicly for many weeks and, in a sense, for many, many years."" That includes rejecting Russia's key demands, laid out in its own draft treaties last month, that NATO bar Ukraine from joining the Western military alliance and that NATO pull back troops from its Eastern European member states, who were formerly Soviet states. ""There is no change. There will be no change,"" he told reporters. ""I can't be more clear -- NATO's door is open, remains open, and that is our commitment."" Blinken and Lavrov will speak in the coming days once Russia has reviewed the U.S. response, the top U.S. diplomat said. While there are fears that Russia is using the diplomatic exchange as pretext to attack Ukraine, saying diplomacy failed to address their concerns, Blinken said the U.S. would not be the one to end talks, even as it prepares sanctions and readies NATO deployments. ""You may be right, that Russia is not serious about this at all. But we have an obligation to test that proposition, to pursue the diplomatic path,"" he said. ""The point is we're prepared either way."" Blinken's comments follow Biden saying Tuesday there could be some U.S. troop movements in the ""nearer term"" -- and that he would consider personally sanctioning Russian President Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine -- a day after 8,500 American forces were put on ""heightened alert"" in the region. But in Ukraine, leaders have offered a different assessment from that put forward by the White House that a full-scale Russian attack is imminent. During a news conference on Wednesday, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said they believe Russia’s forces are currently “insufficient” for a full-scale invasion and that right now the Kremlin is seeking to destabilize Ukraine with the threat of attack and other means, not yet actually launching one. In a televised address to the nation Tuesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged people to stay calm about the threat of a Russian attack and said there was work in progress to bring about a meeting between him and the leaders of Russia, France and Germany. ""Protect your body from viruses, your brain from lies, your heart from panic,” Zelenskiy said. The White House and State Department have defended the administration's decisions and rhetoric, denying that drawing down the embassy, putting 8,500 U.S. troops on alert, and warning of an ""imminent"" threat have escalated the situation. Asked on Tuesday about the criticism from Kyiv that the U.S. is giving into Russia's playbook, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price denied the U.S. created a ""panic."" ""We have been clear about our concerns. We have been clear about the depth of those concerns,"" Price said. ""Given what we're seeing on Ukraine's borders, what we're seeing in what should be an independent sovereign country of Belarus, with the Russian military buildup there, what we're seeing with preparations for potential hybrid operations -- all of this is cause for concern, but certainly no one is calling for panic.""",,,,17

While the F-15's weeklong deployment to Estonia to join fighter jets from Belgium had been in the works for a while, Thursday's arrival in Lithuania of four Danish F-16 fighters for a similar mission was a more recent decision by Denmark tied to the rising tensions over Ukraine. Though small in scope, Denmark's deployment of the additional aircraft and a ship to the Baltic Sea sends a message to Russia about the willingness by NATO countries to demonstrate their military capabilities and commitment to NATO partners during a crisis. The deployments also highlight NATO's existing presence in eastern Europe and the Baltics, prompted by Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea, and how any military movements are being viewed through the prism of the crisis with Ukraine, no matter the size of the deployment. Since Ukraine is not a member of NATO, the alliance has no security commitment to Ukraine should Russia invade, but it is intent on assuring the security of neighboring NATO countries. On Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that while diplomatic efforts continue to try to defuse the crisis with Russia ""we are also prepared for the worst."" Stoltenberg also said this week's announcement by the Pentagon that 8,500 troops in the United States had been placed on heightened alert demonstrated ""demonstrates the strength of the NATO alliance."" On Monday, the Pentagon announced that most of the troops had been placed on shortened ""prepare to deploy orders"" in case they were needed for the 40,000 man NATO Response Force was activated on short notice to respond to a crisis. . That same day Stoltenberg had detailed the movement of small numbers of ships, airplanes, and troops by Denmark and other NATO countries to eastern Europe and the Baltics. Ironically, it was Russia's 2014 takeover of Crimea that prompted NATO and the U.S. to initially rotate more robust military forces into eastern Europe and the Baltics. That includes Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland where in recent years NATO has positioned four battlegroups consisting of 4,000 multinational troops, including American forces. Separately Russia's annexation of Crimea led the United States to establish high-profile troop rotations in eastern Europe, currently there are 5,000 American forces carrying out training Poland. Both the U.S. and NATO have been very public with any new or potential military call-ups or deployments to message to Russia that the alliance remains strong and has the capability of quickly reinforcing member nations that request assistance. That messaging can include disclosing military planning and procedures that are not normally made public. The Pentagon's top spokesman acknowledged on Tuesday that publicly announcing that 8,500 American military on heightened alert and on shorter ""prepare to deploy orders"" was not customary for the U.S. military. ""It's not typical that we talk about it as much as we've been talking about it,"" John Kirby told reporters. Kirby also noted that the 8,500 troops on alert have not received orders to deploy and that the thousands of American troops already stationed in Europe were more likely to initially resource the NATO Response Force should it be activated. The public messaging about military readiness is in line with the very public warnings to Russia by President Biden and American allies that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have severe economic consequences for Russia. ""Although ""strategic ambiguity"" is an essential part of our international diplomacy, in this case, Russia needed to have a strong and unified message from the U.S. and NATO,"" said Mick Mulroy a former deputy assistant of defense and an ABC News national security contributor. ""The Pentagon has also been very forthcoming on all its activities,"" he said. ""This is likely in an attempt to avoid any misinterpretation of their actions."" Mulroy that Russia should do the same particularly with more than 100,000 ground troops on Ukraine's borders. ""Without constant communication, this situation could lead to a conflict in which every nation involved, and even those that are not, is negatively impacted,"" he said.",,,,27
2022-01-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-russian-forces-move-ukraines-cities/story?id=82534587,Pentagon says enough Russian forces to move on Ukraine's cities,"The nation's top defense officials, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said Friday that Russia now has amassed enough military forces to move on Ukraine, possibly even its largest cities. Both leaders urged Moscow to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis with Ukraine and reassured NATO allies that the U.S. was ready to help reinforce NATO nations bordering Ukraine. Austin told reporters that Russian military forces have ""progressed at a consistent and steady pace"" for months as the Kremlin has deployed forces to Crimea and along Ukraine's border, including in Belarus. ""We don't believe that President Putin has made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine. He clearly now has that capability, and there are multiple options available to him,"" Austin said. ""Including the seizure of cities and significant territories"" or ""provocative political acts like the recognition of breakaway territories."" Milley, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, said the Russian government has amassed more than ""100,000 ground forces, air forces, naval forces, special forces, cyber, electronic warfare, command and control, logistics, engineers and other capabilities along the Ukraine border."" Asked if this threat feels different from years past, Miley said, ""This is larger than anything in scale and scope in the massing of forces than anything we've seen in recent memory."" Milley added that given the array of forces and the amount of firepower the Russian military has amassed a Russian invasion would be catastrophic for Ukraine, causing ""a significant amount of casualties."" ""You can imagine what that might look like in dense urban areas, along roads and so on and so forth. It would be horrific. It would be terrible,"" he said. ""And it's not necessary, and we think a diplomatic outcome is the way to go here."" With 8,500 U.S. troops in the U.S. on ""heightened alert"" this week to head to the region, Austin said, ""If NATO activates its Response Force, these troops will be ready to go."" ""Putting our forces on a shorter string enables us to get there in a shorter period of time,"" said Austin. He explained that the decision to announce the heightened alert status reflected the focus ""on making sure we're ready to live up to our commitment to NATO. ""Conflict is not inevitable. There is still time and space for diplomacy,"" Austin continued. ""The United States, in lockstep with our allies and partners, has offered Russia a path away from crisis and toward greater security in the Department of Defense will continue to support those diplomatic efforts."" ""We're focused on reassuring our allies and that's what this is all about,"" said Austin. ""In terms of trusting Putin, I don't think this is about trusting Putin. This is about our allies trusting us."" He also said the U.S. remains committed to sending financial security assistance to Ukraine and holding a united front with NATO allies. ""As we've made clear, in addition to the significant economic and diplomatic costs that Russia will incur, a move on Ukraine will accomplish the very thing Russia says it does not want a NATO Alliance strengthened and resolved on its western flank,"" Austin said. ""The United States will contribute to NATO's response forces, and we will coordinate with our NATO allies, and we will make sure that they have the capabilities that they need to defend themselves."" Asked what it would take for him to trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, Austin said it's not about trusting Putin but ""about our allies trusting us -- and so that's really what we're focused on."" The White House said President Joe Biden had a call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, to ""reaffirm our support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" after the U.S. hand-delivered its diplomatic response to Russia's security demands and refused to agree to its central request that Ukraine never be allowed into NATO. At a press briefing Friday morning from Moscow, Ambassador John Sullivan, who delivered that U.S. response Thursday, reiterated that any further incursion to Ukraine would be met with massive economic sanctions. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in a press conference with Russian media on Friday, countered that the Kremlin will take retaliatory measures unless a guaranteed security agreement is reached with the West. ""If our attempt at reaching an agreement on mutually acceptable principles of the provision of European security fails, we will resort to retaliatory measures,"" Lavrov said. Later on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron was scheduled to speak directly with Putin as world leaders engage in finding a diplomatic solution. While White House press secretary Jen Psaki repeated on Thursday the Biden administration's belief that an invasion of Ukraine could ""come at any time"" as Russian troops continue military exercises in a show of force, officials in Ukraine have urged their people not to panic. While it's unclear if Russia if or when Russia may actually invade, some have speculated an offensive could be timed with the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing as Russia has used both winter and summer Olympic Games in the past as cover to launch military action.",,,,27
2022-01-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-chance-diplomatic-ukraine-crisis-us-ambassador/story?id=82553278,Russia has chance for 'diplomatic way out' of Ukraine crisis: US ambassador to UN,"U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned on Sunday that Russia's menacing military troop buildup on Ukraine's borders signals the Kremlin's ""intentions to use them,"" noting that Russia still has a chance to ""find a diplomatic way out."" Thomas-Greenfield's comment to ABC's ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos came on the eve of an open U.N. Security Council meeting she requested to discuss Russia's aggression toward Ukraine and what to do about it. Stephanopoulos pressed Thomas-Greenfield, asking, ""Does the U.S. believe an invasion is imminent?"" ""You don't amass 100,000 troops if you don't have intentions to use them,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. She said Monday's U.N. Security Council meeting ""is one more opportunity to find a diplomatic way out for the Russians."" She added that Ukrainian officials have also asked for the meeting, which is expected to be heard in open session. ""We've made clear that we're prepared to address our concerns, Ukrainian concerns and Russian concerns at the diplomatic table, but it cannot be done on the battlefield,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. Russia has maintained that it has no intentions to invade Ukraine and has objected to Monday's U.N. Security Council meeting, threatening to move to try to block the gathering. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's deputy permanent representative at the United Nations, posted on Twitter that the meeting was a ""clear PR stunt shameful for the reputation of UN Security Council."" ""Can Russia block it?"" Stephanopoulos asked Thomas-Greenfield of the U.S. Security Council meeting. ""If not, what do you hope to achieve?"" ""They know that they cannot block the meeting and I expect that, knowing what we're dealing with, that they will make an attempt,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""But the Security Council is unified, our voices are unified in calling for the Russians to explain themselves. We're going to go into the room prepared to listen to them, but we're not going to be distracted by their propaganda and we're going to be prepared to respond to any disinformation that they attempt to spread during this meeting."" While Russia's official line has been that it has no plans to invade, it has demanded promises that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO and that the Western alliance will pull its troops out of Eastern Europe. Both requests have been rejected by the United States and its Western allies. Stephanopoulos noted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his team have ""expressed some irritation, even alarm"" that the U.S. and its allies are exaggerating the threat for political reasons. ""How do you respond to that?"" Stephanopoulos asked Thomas-Greenfield. She said the United States has engaged very closely with the Ukrainians, citing the call Biden had last week with Zelensky, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent trip to Ukraine and her meetings on a regular basis with the Ukrainian ambassador in New York. ""We've also been working with the Ukrainians on building up their defenses in the event of an attack,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""And ... since 2014, we've provided close to $5 billion in support to them, $200 million of that was just provided in the past week."" ""We've seen the Russian playbook before,"" she added. ""They are using disinformation. They're encouraging Ukrainians not to worry about an attack. But we know an attack is possible."" Stephanopoulos pressed Thomas-Greenfield on what a diplomatic settlement would look like. ""You know, at first it would mean Russia making the decision to de-escalate, to pull their troops back and to come to the diplomatic table and to talk with the United States, with the Ukrainians and our NATO allies about their security concerns,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. Turning to concerns over seven ballistic missile tests North Korea has conducted this month alone -- more than all it conducted in 2021, including Sunday's launch of the longest-range missile it has tested since 2017 -- Stephanopoulos asked about how the U.S. will respond. “It is provocative and it is something that we have very very strongly condemned in the Security Council,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. She said the United States has imposed unilateral sanctions in the last few weeks against North Korea and has pushed for sanctions within the U.N. Security Council. ""I will be engaging with our allies, the (South) Koreans as well as the Japanese, who are also threatened by this, to look at other options for responding,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. Stephanopoulos followed: ""Is it time for President Biden to engage personally with (North Korean leader) Kim Jong-un?"" “You know, we have been clear on that from the beginning: We are open to having diplomatic discussions,"" Thomas-Greenfield replied. ""We’ve offered this over and over to the DPRK, and they’ve not accepted it."" ""But we’re absolutely open to a diplomatic engagement without pre-conditions,"" she added. ""Our goal is to end the threatening actions that the DPRK is taking against their neighbors.""",,,,7

The meeting didn't yield any action or even a joint statement, but ambassadors from the U.S. and Russia sparred in dueling remarks, trading blame for escalating the crisis. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has amassed over 100,000 troops and heavy equipment and weaponry on three sides of Ukraine, including in Russian-annexed Crimea and in Belarus, Kyiv's northern neighbor and a close Kremlin ally. At first, Russia, backed by China, tried to block the session from moving forward by calling a vote among Security Council's 15 member states. Russia and China opposed it, three countries abstained, but ten voted to move ahead with it. ""You heard from our Russian colleagues that we're calling for this meeting to make you all feel uncomfortable. Imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100,000 troops sitting on your border in the way that these troops are sitting on the border with Ukraine,"" said U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield. ""This is not about antics. It's not about rhetoric. It's not about 'U.S. and Russia.' What this is about is the peace and security of one of our member states."" In her remarks, Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of ""the largest -- hear me clearly -- mobilization of troops in Europe in decades"" and threatening military action should its concerns about Ukraine joining NATO and NATO's troop deployments in Eastern European member states not be addressed. ""If Russia further invades Ukraine, none of us will be able to say we didn't see it coming, and the consequences will be horrific,"" she added. But Russia's envoy again denied that the Kremlin is planning to attack its neighbor, a former Soviet state and now a growing democracy -- telling the Security Council there is ""no proof confirming such a serious accusation whatsoever,"" defending troop movements within Russia's borders as a domestic issue, and then denying there are 100,000 as U.S. and other Western officials have said. ""They themselves are whipping up tensions and rhetoric and are provoking escalation,"" Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said of the U.S. and its NATO allies. ""The discussions about a threat of war is provocative in and of itself. You are almost calling for this. You want it to happen. You're waiting for it to happen."" Thomas-Greenfield requested to speak again to respond, saying, ""I cannot let the false equivalency go unchecked, so I feel I must respond. ... The threats of aggression on the border of Ukraine -- yes on its border -- is provocative. Our recognition of the facts on the ground is not provocative."" Ukraine -- which is not a member of the Security Council, but was invited to participate -- urged Russia to respect its ""sovereign right"" to choose which countries it partners with. ""Ukraine will not bow to threats aimed at weakening Ukraine, undermining its economic and financial stability, and inciting public frustration. This will not happen. And the Kremlin must remember that Ukraine is ready to defend itself,"" Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told the council. In a sign of their increasing alignment, China was the only country to back Russia's effort to squash the public meeting. Its ambassador Zhang Jun said they oppose ""microphone diplomacy of public confrontation"" and believed the open discussion of the issue would add ""fuel to the tension."" While the session didn't yield any results, it marks the start of another week of diplomacy between Russia and the U.S. and its allies over Ukraine. ""Russia heard clearly a united position from the vast majority of the council, and I hope that that will lead to a diplomatic solution,"" Thomas-Greenfield, a member of President Joe Biden's Cabinet, told reporters after the meeting. Biden himself hailed the meeting as ""a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice: rejecting the use of force, calling for military de-escalation, supporting diplomacy as the best path forward."" On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will speak with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the State Department and Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed Monday -- the first conversation after the U.S. responding in writing last week to Russia's demands about Ukraine and NATO. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to speak to Putin this week, days after the U.K. said it could deploy troops to protect NATO allies if Russia invaded Ukraine. Biden announced a similar position last week, putting 8,500 U.S. troops on ""heightened alert"" and adding Friday he could do so in the ""near"" future. In a potential positive sign for diplomacy, Russia said some of its forces had pulled back from the border areas after a ""preparedness check,"" according to the Russian Armed Forces' Southern Military District. But it's not yet clear if the U.S. had confirmed any troops were withdrawn from the border region, and Thomas-Greenfield warned the U.S. has evidence Russia intends to expand its presence in Belarus to more than 30,000 troops -- putting them less than two hours north of Kyiv. Those deployments include short-range ballistic missiles, special forces, and anti-aircraft batteries, she added -- all of which Russia and Belarus have said are for military exercises.

2022-02-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-russia-agree-talking-amid-ukraine-crisis-putin/story?id=82600066,"US, Russia agree to keep talking amid Ukraine crisis but Putin claims concerns 'ignored'","The U.S. and Russia are moving ahead with their diplomatic engagements over Russia menacing Ukraine, according to senior State Department officials, after the two countries' top diplomats spoke Tuesday. But as talks continue, there have been no results yet -- with more than 100,000 Russian troops still massed on Ukraine's borders, including increasingly in its northern neighbor Belarus. Russian leader Vladimir Putin said the U.S. has ""ignored"" Russia's key demands that NATO bar Ukraine from joining and pull back allied troops from Eastern European countries -- his first comments on the crisis in over a month. But his government is still analyzing the U.S. response to Russia, laid out in a formal proposal hand-delivered by the U.S. ambassador in Moscow last week, he said. During a critical call Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ""did agree that the ideas on both sides that have been exchanged did form the basis for the potential for serious discussion on a range of issues,"" said a senior State Department official. Those ideas include issues like arms control and greater transparency in military exercises, they added, expressing some hope that Russia's continued engagement could lay the groundwork for real negotiations. But for now, Russia is still formulating its response to those U.S. ideas, Lavrov said he told Blinken, calling those issues ""important in their own way, but secondary"" to Russia's key demands. Putin dug into NATO on Tuesday during a press conference with Viktor Orbán, the autocratic prime minister of NATO member Hungary. ""We have been promised by NATO that it will not advance its infrastructure one inch further eastwards. Everybody knows that. Today, we see where NATO is -- Poland, Romania, the Baltic States. They said one thing and did another thing. As the people say, they played us -- simply lied. OK, that's fine,"" the Russian leader said. U.S. officials have said that the U.S. and NATO never made promises not to expand eastward and that joining the Western military alliance is the decision of any individual country and NATO. But Putin for years has decried the alliance as threatening Moscow, even as Russia has invaded Ukraine and Georgia, illegitimately stationed troops in Moldova and conducted cyberattacks against the U.S., United Kingdom and others. He also accused Ukraine, ""fully packed of weapons,"" of seeking to join NATO to start a conflict with Russia over Crimea with NATO's backing. Crimea is the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia seized in 2014 -- a land grab the international community has not recognized -- as Russian forces fomented a conflict in Ukraine's eastern provinces known as Donbas. That's exactly the pretext for a renewed Russian attack on Ukraine that U.S. officials have said they're concerned Moscow is preparing. The heightened rhetoric from Putin was largely dismissed by the Biden administration Tuesday, with State Department spokesperson Ned Price saying, ""I will leave it to the Kremlinologists out there -- budding professional, amateur, or otherwise -- to read the tea leaves and try to interpret the significance of those remarks. For our part, we don't necessarily need to do that because we know that a formal response from the Russian Federation is forthcoming."" When that response is finalized, it will be sent to Putin for approval and then set to the U.S., the senior State Department officials said, and after that, Blinken and Lavrov plan to speak again. Pressed on whether the Russians may be buying time or stalling before a renewed attack on Ukraine, a second senior State Department official said, ""Because we don't President Putin has made a decision [on whether to further invade Ukraine], we think it's important to keep the diplomatic option on the table -- so to the extent that Russia wants to engage in that diplomatic track, we are also open to having that continued diplomatic engagement."" Blinken and Lavrov didn't agree on when or how those talks would continue, but the U.S. has called for them to include one-on-one meetings, as well as negotiations between NATO and Russia and dialogue at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a Cold War-era forum that includes the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine. On Monday, Moscow sent the U.S., as well as all OSCE members and several NATO allies, a similar letter seeking clarification about security principles enshrined in one of the OSCE's key documents, the Helsinki Final Act, according to U.S. and Russian officials. The letter was not Russia's response to the U.S. proposal, but seems to be part of its effort to formulate one. ""NATO refers to the right of countries to choose freely, but you can not strengthen someone's security at the expense of others,"" Putin said Tuesday during his press conference. ""This is a topic that we will not allow to be covered up. We will insist on a frank conversation and a frank explanation as to why the West doesn't want to fulfill its obligations or it wants to fulfil them selectively in its own favor,"" Lavrov added during an appearance after his call with Blinken. The U.S. has previously made clear it believes that Ukraine has a right to choose its own alliances and that the smaller, democratic country poses no threat to Russia's security. As the U.S. and NATO wait for that formal Russian response, Blinken again urged Russia to deescalate tensions by pulling back troops, heavy weaponry, and equipment from Ukraine's borders. But Lavrov gave no indication during the call that Russia would do so, the senior State Department officials said. ""All of the actions that we are seeing on the ground do not suggest escalation. We continue to see in fact more Russian troops coming not only to Russia's border with Ukraine, but as you know, also to Belarus for these supposed exercises,"" the second senior State Department official said. Russia and Belarus have said those forces are preparing for military exercises to improve their readiness. But the U.S. said Monday it has evidence that more than 30,000 Russian troops will mass in Belarus in the coming days, citing declassified U.S. intelligence -- a concerning move that puts them within two hours of Ukraine's capital Kyiv.",,,,27

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced the imminent arrival of several thousand U.S. troops -- some already in Europe and some from the U.S. -- to NATO allies in eastern Europe at a Pentagon briefing Wednesday -- the first major movement of U.S. forces in response to concerns Russia will invade Ukraine. ""President Biden has been clear that the United States will respond to the growing threat to Europe's security and stability. Our commitment to NATO Article 5 and collective defense remains ironclad. As part of this commitment and to be prepared for a range of contingencies, the United States will soon move additional forces to Romania, Poland, and Germany,"" Kirby said. All of the troops would be under U.S. command. In a brief exchange with reporters Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden said the move was “totally consistent with what I told Putin in the beginning."" ""As long as he is acting aggressively,"" Biden said, ""we're going to make sure we can reassure our NATO allies and Eastern Europe that we're there and Article Five is a sacred obligation.” Russia called the deployments “destructive.” ""Destructive steps that are unjustified by anyone, they increase military tension and narrow the room for political decisions,” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. The White House said the deployments were not in response to any specific, recent event. ""I would not read this as a decision made based on any events over the last 48 hours or a couple of days,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. ""We've been in discussion and under discussion with our partners and allies in the region where these troops are going for several weeks now.” Psaki said the United States was aiming to reassure allies, deter Russia and ""ensure we are ready for every contingency."" Kirby said he wanted to ""be very clear"" that ""these are not permanent moves."" ""They are moved designed to respond to the current security environment. Moreover, these forces are not going to fight in Ukraine. They are going to ensure the robust defense of our NATO allies,"" he said. A senior defense official had earlier confirmed to ABC News that about 3,000 U.S. troops will be given orders to deploy to Europe or, if they're already in Europe, to head to countries in eastern Europe. One of the units moving into eastern Europe from Germany is a fast-moving armored Stryker unit. ""It's important that we send a strong signal to Mr. Putin and frankly, to the world that NATO matters to the United States. It matters to our allies, and we have ironclad Article 5 commitments attack on one is an attack on all,"" Kirby said. The troop movements are separate from the 8,500 U.S. troops put on ""heightened alert"" to reinforce NATO's Response Force if needed -- and none would go to Ukraine. Pressed on what signal it sends that the U.S. is not waiting for a NATO vote to deploy an alliance force, Kirby said ""the signal that sends -- that we're that we're moving additional U.S. forces into allied territory, at the request and with the invitation of those countries -- is that we take our NATO commitments very, very seriously."" Kirby said 1,000 soldiers based in Germany will arrive in Romania in ""the coming days"" at the request of the country, augmenting the roughly 900 U.S. troops already in Romania. Another 2,000 troops from Fort Bragg in North Carolina will deploy to Europe, with 1,700 heading to Germany and about 300 to Poland, the White House said. ""The 82nd Airborne Division is deploying components of an Infantry Brigade Combat Team and key enablers to Poland. And the 18th Airborne Corps is moving a joint task force capable headquarters to Germany. Both of them, as you know, are based in Fort Bragg, North Carolina,"" Kirby said. The Pentagon spokesperson said that these moves could be ""preliminary,"" meaning more troops could be sent. He added that the 1,000 troops heading to Romania will be joining the country's own ""very capable"" military, and will also be joined by an unspecified number of French troops. Asked why the deployment is coming now, Kirby blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin who, he said, ""continues to add forces -- combined arms, offensive capabilities even over just the last 24 hours."" ""He has showed no signs of being interested or willing to de-escalate the tensions,"" Kirby said of the Russian leader. After last week saying the U.S. thought a Russian invasion was “imminent,” Psaki said Wednesday she no longer would use that word. Ukrainian officials had publicly disputed the fact that a Russian attack was “imminent” and even criticized the Biden administration for how it was describing the threat. A better way to describe the White House’s view about what Putin may do, Psaki said Wednesday, was that “he could invade at any time.” The U.S. still believes Putin has not made a decision about how to proceed, she said. Kirby emphasized the Biden administration does not believe conflict is inevitable. The announcement comes after Biden told reporters on Friday that he would be moving American forces ""in the near term."" Putin blamed the escalating tensions on the U.S. and the West for having ""ignored"" Russia's key demand that NATO bar Ukraine from joining the organization. The U.S. and NATO allies argue Russia is the aggressor, having already invaded Crimea and massing troops at the border. ABC News' Ben Gittleson and Max Karmen contributed reporting.",,,,27

One of a number of options Russia has been allegedly planning, U.S. officials said, was to ""stage a fake attack"" against Russia or Russian-speaking people. ""As part of this fake attack, we believe that Russia would produce a very graphic propaganda video, which would include corpses, and actors that would be depicting mourners, and images of destroyed locations as well as military equipment,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. The United States took the rare step of making this intelligence public in order to dissuade Russia from moving forward or, if it did move forward, to make it more difficult for it to spread disinformation after the fact, according to Jon Finer, the principal deputy U.S. national security adviser. ""We don't know definitively that this is the route they're going to take,"" Finer said in an interview with MSNBC. ""But we know that this is an option under consideration,"" he continued, ""that would involve, you know, actors playing mourners for people who are killed in an event that they would have created themselves, that would involve the deployment of corpses to represent bodies purportedly killed in -- people reportedly killed in an incident like this."" The U.K. said later Wednesday that it had conducted its ""own analysis of the intelligence,"" and that it had ""high confidence that Russia is planning to engineer a pretext blaming Ukraine in order to justify a Russian incursion."" “This is clear and shocking evidence of Russia’s unprovoked aggression and underhand activity to destabilize Ukraine,"" Britain's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said. It is not the first time in recent weeks that the United States had accused Russia of ""fabricating a pretext"" to justify invading Ukraine. The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed the new allegations. ""This is not the first such promise,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Russian state news agency TASS ""Earlier, similar things were also voiced. But nothing ever occurs."" Last month, the White House said the U.S. had intelligence that Russia had prepositioned a group of operatives in eastern Ukraine in order to create a ""false-flag operation"" there. The administration said the group was trained in urban warfare and the use of explosives. A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council declined to say whether those the United States is accusing of being involved in creating a fake video were part of this same group. The U.S. believes Russia has already recruited the people who’d be involved with the fake ""attack"" video and that “Russian intelligence is intimately involved in this effort,"" according to the senior administration official. The U.S. thinks that “the military equipment used in this fabricated attack will be made to look like it is Ukrainian or from allied nations” – and that it was “possible” that Bayraktar drones, which Ukraine has, would be used to make it look like Ukraine carried out the attack, according to the official. U.S. officials have repeatedly said, as recently as Wednesday, that they do not believe Russia's President Vladimir Putin had yet decided whether to invade Ukraine. But if he did want to move forward, the senior administration official said, one trigger could be Russia recognizing separatist regions in Ukraine as independent, rather than as part of Ukraine. Russia's parliament is advancing legislation that would do so. The U.S. believes that if Russia formally recognized the regions as independent, Russia could then release the video showing a fake Ukrainian ""attack"" – that it could portray as in response to the independence recognition – or Russia could just invade without releasing the video, according to another administration official. “In line with its previous interventions, Russia would portray its actions as defending ethnic Russians and coming at the request of a sovereign government for assistance,"" the senior administration official said.

2022-02-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wh-national-security-adviser-distinct-possibility-russian-attack/story?id=82694548,WH national security adviser says there's a 'very distinct' possibility of Russian attack on Ukraine,"As the standoff between Russia and the United States continues, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned of a ""very distinct"" possibility Russia will attack Ukraine at ""any time now."" ""We believe that there is a very distinct possibility that Vladimir Putin will order an attack on Ukraine. It could take a number of different forms. It could happen as soon as tomorrow or it could take some weeks yet,"" Sullivan said in an interview with ABC ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. ""[Putin] has put himself in a position with military deployments, to be able to act aggressively against Ukraine at any time now,"" he added, stressing that the United State is working with allies and continues to urge a path of diplomacy. Sullivan said the United States is ready to respond, no matter what Russia decides. ""If they choose to go down the path of escalation instead, it will come at enormous human cost to Ukrainians. But it will also, we believe, over time, come at real strategic cost to Vladimir Putin,"" he said. ABC News has learned Putin now has 70% of his troops in place to possibly launch a full-scale attack on Ukraine. The report comes as U.S. troops began arriving in Poland over the weekend after President Joe Biden ordered deployments to reassure NATO allies. Raddatz pressed Sullivan on the message U.S. troop deployments sends to the Russians as the U.S. continues to push for a diplomatic solution: ""You talk about this diplomatic path, but 1,700 US troops just arrived in Poland, part of the 3,000 going in. Three hundred more sent to Germany. ... (It) sounds like you're no longer trying to de-escalate the situation."" ""We have since the beginning for months now, as we have warned about the possibility of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, pursued a two-track approach, deterrence and diplomacy,"" he argued. ""Those forces you just referred to have not been sent to fight Russian forces in Ukraine. They have been sent to defend NATO territory because we have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend our NATO allies and to send a clear message to Russia, that if it tries to take any military action or aggression against our NATO allies, it will be met with a stiff response, including by the U.S. forces who are on the ground there now,"" Sullivan said, adding the U.S. has been ""equally clear"" it is ready to have ""substantive discussions on matters of European security"" with Russia. Sullivan would not get into specifics on how certain an attack is, even though Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., reportedly said after a briefing on the situation that a Russian invasion was a ""near certainty."" ""I'm not going to make a prediction about what is going to unfold in the coming days. All I'm going to say is that we, the United States, under the direction of President Biden, are ready either way,"" Sullivan said when pressed by Raddatz. ""We are ready,"" he said, adding, ""And we are ready to respond in a united, swift and severe way with our allies and partners should he choose to move forward with a military escalation."" As the window for diplomacy appears to be rapidly closing, U.S. officials have repeatedly said they do not believe Putin has made up his mind on how to proceed but no longer describe the threat of a possible invasion as ""imminent,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. With athletes from around the world gathering to compete in the Winter Olympics in China, Raddatz asked Sullivan if the U.S. believed Putin would hold off on an attack until the games conclude on Feb. 20 -- allowing more time for the ground to freeze to facilitate tank movements. Sullivan said it was possible but stressed that an attack could also come sooner. ""At this point, we're in the window, meaning that we can't just assume it's going to be a couple of weeks off. Is that a possible scenario? Are there reasons to believe that it could happen in that timeframe? Yes. But there are also reasons to believe that Russia, under the direction of President Putin, could take steps before then."" Sullivan appeared to brush off concerns over China's alliance with Russia and the impact it could have on the U.S. threat of sanctions after Putin and President Xi Jinping met in Beijing Friday. ""That is an economic power powerhouse, China. Could that undermine your plans for severe sanctions?"" Raddatz asked. ""Our view is that China is not in a position to compensate Russia for the economic losses that would come from our sanctions. That's the analysis that we and the European share, and we believe the Russians and Chinese understand that as well,"" Sullivan responded, adding that China would also feel the cost in the ""eyes of the world"" of supporting Russia.",,,,7
2022-02-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-meet-german-chancellor-urge-united-front-amid/story?id=82712888,"Biden, German chancellor present united front amid tensions with Russia over Ukraine","President Joe Biden welcomed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to the White House Monday at a critical time for the leaders as tensions with Russia persist over Ukraine. During brief remarks in the Oval Office ahead of a joint press conference, Biden said the two countries are ""working in lockstep to further deter Russian aggression in Europe and address the challenges opposed by China and promote stability in the Western Balkans,"" as military forces buildup along the Ukraine border. Monday marks Scholz's first visit to the White House, and Biden said it provided a good chance to ""get to know you more personally."" While the Biden administration has warned for weeks that Russia will face ""severe"" consequences if it invades Ukraine, Germany had often opted for a softer response, refusing to send military equipment to Ukraine or deploy more troops to the eastern flank. Germany had also shown reluctance to shut down Nord Stream 2, a Russian natural gas pipeline, not yet operational, that would carry gas directly to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. Meanwhile, Biden has been rallying European allies to respond to Russia's threats in lockstep with his more aggressive plan. But meeting with Scholz Monday, the two world leaders expressed unity with their posture towards Russia. After both leaders appeared to avoid mentioning the pipeline, under repeated questions from reporters at an afternoon press conference, Biden, standing next to the German chancellor said Nord Stream 2 would not move forward if Russia invades Ukraine, in a warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin of potential economic consequences. ""If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the -- the border of Ukraine again, then there will be -- there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,"" Biden said during the press conference with Scholz, who did not go as far as Biden, but insisted the U.S. and Germany remain ""absolutely united."" Pressed on how he can commit to that given that Nord Stream 2 is under German control, Biden doubled down, saying, ""We will -- I promise you -- we will be able to do it."" Scholz, in turn, expressed unity with the U.S. and said that Germany was preparing sanctions in case Putin decides to invade. ""As I already said, we are acting together,"" Scholz said at the press conference. ""We are absolutely united and we will not take different steps. We will do the same steps and they will be very, very hard to Russia, and they should understand."" Biden added that all diplomatic lanes should be taken to de-escalate the situation on the Ukraine border where at least 100,000 Russian troops have gathered and that Russia needs to understand NATO nations stand together. Asked by another reporter if Americans who are still in Ukraine should leave, Biden said would be ""wise"" for Americans to leave the country. “I’m not talking about our diplomatic core. I'm talking about Americans who are there. I hate to see them get caught in a crossfire if, in fact, they did invade. And there's no need for that,"" Biden said. ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega asked Biden as he was exiting the press conference, ""Is de-escalation possible?"" ""The answer is yes,"" Biden replied. While an administration official earlier acknowledged ""the narrative that's been out there"" that Germany's response to Russia has been lacking, they were not outright critical of Scholz's hesitation thus far. But they declined to say whether U.S. officials have already convinced the Germans to get on board with the plan to block Nord Stream 2 entirely if Putin decides to move. ""We're confident that the Germans share our concerns with Russian aggression, that they're very involved in our ongoing efforts on both deterrence and diplomacy,"" the official said. ""What I can say is that we will continue to work very closely with Germany to ensure the pipeline does not move forward."" When asked if the administration is working on ways to prevent the Nord Stream pipeline from becoming operational regardless of if Russia invades, the official underscored the U.S. opposition to the project overall, ahead of Biden's joint remarks. ""There is not currently any gas flowing through the pipeline. And there won't be any gas for months, in part because of the diplomacy that the United States has been able to do on this issue with Germany,"" the official noted. ABC News has learned Putin now has 70% of the troops necessary to possibly launch a full-scale attack on Ukraine in place along the Ukrainian border. With U.S. intelligence indicating Putin is preparing for a large-scale invasion, the senior administration official said key allies like Germany are being kept aware of the situation. ""I absolutely think that our countries are unified in terms of awareness of the risk of further Russian aggression to Ukraine. We have been for a long time sharing intelligence with Germany with the rest of our allies,"" the official said. ""And I think there is absolutely absolute agreement, that if there is further Russian aggression, that there's a number of things that need to be done in terms of deployment of additional troops to the eastern flank, and to the imposition of a large package of economic sanctions."" Scholz's visit comes almost two months to the day since he took office, highlighting the importance of the U.S.-German relationship. Biden first met with Scholz in October at the G-20 summit, when former Chancellor Angela Merkel invited the then-finance minister to accompany her to her meeting with Biden, giving the leaders a chance to meet ahead of Scholz taking the helm. As Biden and Scholz participated in their first joint press conference from the East Room, in-person talks between French President Emmanuel Macron and Putin wrapped after five hours, according to Russian media. Biden told reporters Monday that he has been “very straightforward and blunt” in his discussions with Putin when warning of sanctions Russia could face but said he still he does not know what Putin will ultimately do. “I know he's in a position now to be able to invade, almost assuming that the ground is frozen above Kiev. He has the capacity to do that,"" Biden said. ""What he's going to do, I don't know.""",,,,7
2022-02-08,https://abcnews.go.com/International/france-putin-promised-military-initiatives-ukraine-talks-macron/story?id=82741612,France says Putin promised no 'new military initiatives' near Ukraine in talks with Macron,"KYIV -- France's President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday Russian President Vladimir Putin had assured him there would be no ""escalation or deterioration"" of the crisis around Ukraine, as French officials said there were signs Putin was moving towards de-escalation. Macron said he obtained the assurances during the five hours of talks he held with Putin in the Kremlin in Moscow on Monday night. Following the talks, French officials said Putin had committed to not launch any new ""military initiatives"" and promised the thousands of Russian troops massed in Belarus to the north of Ukraine would leave after exercises ended there this month. Macron flew to Kyiv on Tuesday to meet with Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where during a joint press conference afterwards he said Putin had told him he would ""not be the instigator of any escalation."" He said ""no one was naive"" but that he believed some progress had been made. “For me it was about arranging things to prevent an escalation and open up new avenues ... and that objective for me has been fulfilled,” Macron told reporters on the plane flying to Kyiv, according to AFP. If true, the commitment not to launch new military action could be an important sign may be closer to taking Western diplomatic offers as a road out of the crisis, where the Russian build up near Ukraine has sparked fears of invasion. But the Kremlin on Tuesday downplayed the French comments, denying that any deal had been reached. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Financial Times, which first reported the French claims, had “simply written incorrectly"" and that it was impossible for Putin and Macron to reach a deal since France was not the leader of NATO, which would need to accept any agreement. Peskov said Western countries for now were still ignoring Russia's key demands for security guarantees that Ukraine never join NATO, saying while grateful for Macron's efforts, “for now, of course, we can’t say we sense any real path to a resolution.” But Peskov did confirm the promise Russian troops will leave Belarus once the joint exercises there end on Feb. 20. “No one has ever said that Russian troops will remain on the territory of Belarus, that has never been a question,” Peskov told reporters. “On the conclusion of these exercises the troops will return to their place of permanent deployment."" Russia has been pouring trainloads of troops into Belarus amid its broader build up near Ukraine, alarming Western countries which fear they could be used as a cover for an attack. But Moscow and Minsk both insist the troops are there just for war games. Putin and Macron’s marathon talks in the Kremlin Monday had ended with a glimmer of hope the Russian leader is ready to accept diplomacy. Putin afterwards told a press conference that Macron had brought “a range of ideas,"" which he said it was too early to talk about publicly, but that Putin said he considered “possible as the basis for our next steps.” It was not clear what those ideas were. But French officials afterwards said Putin and Macron had agreed to “the initiation of a broader dialogue” on three key points: first, Russia’s military posture and second, the long-running ‘Normandy Format’ negotiations aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine between government and Russian-backed separatists in the east. Third, the “opening of a dialogue on strategic issues,” a phrase that refers to troop and weapon deployments, and wider questions of NATO’s relationship with Moscow. Ukraine's Zelenskyy on Tuesday was also more sceptical of Putin's assurances, saying at the press conference with Macron: ""I do not really trust words, I believe that every politician can be transparent by taking concrete steps"". Russia has denied it has any plans to attack Ukraine, calling the Western accusations hysteria. But it has continued to build up troops near to Ukraine, with more forces arriving in recent days and, according to open source researchers, some appearing to move closer to the border. While massing troops near Ukraine, the Kremlin has demanded the United States and NATO give a binding guarantees on NATO membership and that the alliance pull back its infrastructure from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. The U.S. and NATO countries, including France, have rejected those as non-starters, but have offered to engage with the Kremlin on more modest security issues, including limits on missile deployments and troop exercises. Macron in front of Zelenskyy again affirmed NATO’s so-called ""Open Doors"" policy. Any diplomatic breakthrough would either have to find a creative way of reassuring the Kremlin on its main demands or for Putin to move back from them. Macron and Zelenskyy both denied a report that Macron had raised the idea of so-called 'Finlandization' as a possible solution. The term refers to Finland's neutral status during the Cold War where it remained outside NATO in return for the Soviet Union largely recognising its independence. Macron denied using the phrase or raising the concept with Putin, despite news reports he had told journalists it was one option ""on the table."" Zelenskyy said this was the first time he had heard of the idea and that he would never suggest ""Ukraine-izing"" other countries. Both men emphasised the importance of talks planned this Thursday in the so-called 'Normandy' group, that is mediated by France and Germany to try to end Ukraine's conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the country. The talks seek to unblock efforts to implement the 'Minsk agreement', which ended large-scale fighting in 2015 between Ukraine's government and the Russian-controlled rebels but has been largely deadlocked since. It is not clear how that has changed, but Macron and Zelenskyy both spoke positively about Thursday's talks, saying they hoped they would make progress. Zelenskyy said he hoped the talks would move the possibility of a full-scale summit between the leaders of the four countries closer. After meeting with Zelenskyy, Macron flew onto Berlin to meet with Germany's leader Olaf Scholz, who has just returned from Washington, where he met with President Joe Biden on Monday and discussed the crisis. Macron and Scholz afterwards said their ""common goal is to prevent war in Europe"" and Scholz, who has been criticised as being too reluctant to threaten painful sanctions on Russia if it attacks, said they were united in preparing to respond. ""Our appraisal of the situation is united, as is our position on this: Any further attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is unacceptable and will draw wide-reaching consequences for Russia -- politically, economically and geo-strategically,"" Scholz said.",,,,17
2022-02-09,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-russia-hold-key-talks-crisis-berlin/story?id=82781870,"Ukraine, Russia to hold key talks on crisis in Berlin","KYIV -- A new round of key talks aimed at de-escalating the Ukraine crisis is set to take place in Berlin on Thursday. The talks will follow the so-called Normandy Format, the name of the long-running negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, mediated by France and Germany, and are aimed at ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in the country's east. The talks have been largely deadlocked since 2015, but Thursday's meeting is being closely watched for signs that a flurry of diplomatic activity this week, spear-headed by French President Emmanuel Macron, might point toward a broader de-escalation of the growing crisis. Macron visited Kyiv Tuesday to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following marathon talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow that resulted in a glimmer of hope that Putin may be open to taking Western offers of diplomacy to end the crisis. Macron has said Putin assured him there would be no escalation around Ukraine, and French officials have since said they believe the visit has achieved a ""pause"" that allows de-escalation and gives more time for negotiations. With Russia continuing to move troops close to Ukraine, where it has already massed over 100,000, the hope expressed by Macron and Zelenskyy is that Thursday's talks can widen that diplomatic path and help bring down tensions. In Kyiv, both leaders spoke optimistically about Thursday's talks, saying they expected progress. The talks will be held between Ukraine's lead negotiator, Zelenskyy's top aide Andriy Yermak, and Dmitry Kozak, a deputy chief of staff to Putin. No breakthrough or even substantial progress is expected, but Western countries and Ukraine are pushing to reinvigorate the format to try to get Russia to engage or at least keep diplomacy going for now. Macron has said the talks should provide a ""clarification"" of what's possible. Macron has said making progress in the Ukraine talks should be combined with the launching of a separate dialogue with Russia on European security to address Kremlin concerns about NATO. It is still not clear if Macron's initiative means the Kremlin is ready to take a diplomatic exit. But it's hoped some positive steps at the talks could reduce the risk of military escalation. ""Unless Russia is serious about de-escalation, I think buying time is all we can hope for,"" a former adviser to Zelenskyy told ABC News. Russia's buildup has already reinvigorated the talks -- a round held in Paris two weeks ago was the first in two years and ended with the sides recommitting to a much-violated ceasefire. The Normandy talks are intended to negotiate the fulfillment of the so-called Minsk agreement, a peace deal that ended large-scale fighting in 2015, but which has been effectively stillborn since. The deal envisages Ukraine regaining control over the eastern separatist Donbas regions in return for granting them broad autonomy in its constitution. The talks have been deadlocked because Russia and Ukraine disagree over the order the agreement should be fulfilled. Russia demands that Ukraine first change its constitution to give the Russian-occupied regions special autonomous status and hold elections in them before it regains any control there. Ukraine says the separatists must disarm and Russian forces there leave before any elections to decide the regions' statuses can be held. Russia has pushed for Ukraine to reintegrate the separatist regions because it would give it a lever in Ukraine's government, and a de facto veto on Ukraine joining NATO or the European Union. For that reason, accepting the Minsk agreement on Russia's terms has become politically impossible for any Ukrainian government, which would face huge backlash at home. Most experts believe Russia is massing troops near Ukraine in part to try to force Kyiv into moving toward Moscow's interpretation of the Minsk agreement. But Ukraine's government has feared that in the face of the Russian military threat, Western countries might force it to make concessions. In Ukraine, there was media speculation Wednesday that Macron may have pressured Zelenskyy to make concessions in Thursday's talks, in particular to begin direct negotiations with the Russian-controlled separatists, the self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (DNR and LNR). If true, that would be politically explosive in Ukraine and would mean Macron had pushed Zelenskyy into a major concession. But Ukraine's foreign minister on Wednesday bluntly denied it would ever hold direct negotiations with the separatists. The minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said France understands Ukraine's ""red lines and do not demand to implement things that are not acceptable to Ukraine."" Kyiv refuses to negotiate with the separatist because it sees them as puppet governments controlled by Russia. Talking to the rebels directly would accord them recognition and also legitimize the Kremlin's false claim that the conflict in Ukraine is a civil war, in which Russia is not involved. Macron's office also denied it had pressured Ukraine. French officials said Thursday's talks would focus on how Ukraine can move toward introducing a draft law granting special status for the separatist areas and get comments on it from the separatists as an exception set out by the Minsk agreements. ""We are basically preparing to be able to put on the table all the practical options which will ultimately have to receive the approval not only of the Ukrainians, but of the Russians,"" the officials said. Oleksiy Semeniy, a former adviser to Ukraine's national security council and currently director of the Institute for Global Transformations in Kyiv, told ABC News on Wednesday he did not believe it was politically possible for Zelenskyy to start direct negotiations with the separatists. He said an important sign of success would be if it was announced following the talks that a leaders summit, involving Zelenskyy and Putin, would take place.",,,,17
2022-02-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-propose-federal-gas-tax-holiday-ahead-midterm/story?id=82756082,Democrats propose federal gas tax holiday ahead of midterm elections,"Two Senate Democrats up for reelection proposed a bill on Wednesday to temporarily suspend the federal gas tax through the end of 2022, as millions of Americans grapple with the economic impacts of surging oil prices. The Gas Prices Relief Act from Sens. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., would suspend the $18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax through Jan. 1, 2023, according to a summary of the proposal shared with ABC News. The senators, who are both on the ballot in November, released the proposal at a time when gas is roughly $3.45 a gallon nationwide, about $1 more expensive than a year ago, according to AAA. ""Arizonans are paying some of the highest prices for gas we have seen in years and it's putting a strain on families who need to fill up the tank to get to work and school,"" Kelly said in a statement. ""This bill will lower gas prices by suspending the federal gas tax through the end of the year to help Arizona families struggling with high costs for everything from gas to groceries."" ""We need to continue to think creatively about how we can find new ways to bring down costs, and this bill would do exactly that, making a tangible difference for workers and families,"" Hassan said in a statement. At least four other Democrats, Sens. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia have already signed on as co-sponsors of the measure. (Cortez Masto and Warnock, like Hassan and Kelly, are up for reelection in the fall.) With inflation at a nearly 40-year high and Americans frustrated about the rising cost of many staples, Republicans have seized on the issue of gas prices as they try to retake the House and Senate in the midterms, pointing to the Biden administration's economic agenda. According to Gallup, just 33% of Americans are satisfied with the state of the economy -- a 10-point drop from 2021 -- and just 27% are satisfied with the nation's energy policies. Around the country, Democratic and Republican governors have proposed their own changes to state gas taxes ahead of the summer -- by either freezing state gas tax collection or stopping planned increases from taking effect. The Biden administration in November released 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help fight high gas prices before the holidays. Cold weather and the possibility of sanctions against Russia over a potential invasion of Ukraine have both played a role in keeping the price of oil high, according to AAA. Despite inflation, the Biden administration has touted the latest job numbers, arguing that the stronger-than-expected addition of 467,000 jobs in January signaled that the economy is weathering the pandemic as the latest wave of COVID-19 recedes.",,,,23
2022-02-10,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-begins-huge-war-games-belarus-amid-ukraine/story?id=82799211,Russia begins huge war games in Belarus amid Ukraine invasion fears,"KYIV -- Russia has officially kicked off the main phase of huge joint military exercises in Belarus, as Western countries continue to warn Russian forces massed near Ukraine could be used to launch a possible attack. Russia has poured an unprecedented number of troops and equipment into Belarus over recent weeks ahead of the 10-day drills, moving units almost 6,000 miles from its far east and deploying tanks, long-range artillery and advanced fighter jets. The United States and NATO countries have expressed worries that the exercises could be used as a cover for preparations for a possible on Ukraine, whose capital, Kyiv, is less than 200 miles south. But Russia and Belarus have insisted the drills are just defensive war games. Russia’s defense ministry on Thursday said the exercises, called ""Union Resolve 2022,"" will “practice averting and repelling external aggression via a defensive operation, as well as combating terrorism and defending the interests” of Russia and Belarus. The exercises are due to end on Feb. 20 and the Kremlin has said its troops will leave Belarus then. Russia’s deployment of troops to Belarus is part of its broader military buildup massing over 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s eastern border and to the south in Crimea. Independent military analysts have sounded the alarm over the exercises, saying the scale of the Russian deployment is vastly larger than anything since the Cold War and includes units that would be used in a major invasion, such as advanced anti-air defences and Iskander-M long-range missile brigades. Satellite imagery has shown some of the Russian units are parked only a few dozen miles from Ukraine’s border, in areas not officially designated for the exercise. The Belarus drills will coincide with what Western countries and some analysts have said is the window when Russia will reach the point of readiness to launch a major military operation against Ukraine. NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday warned “the number of Russian forces is going up. The warning time for a possible attack is going down."" “We must be prepared for the worst while remaining strongly committed to finding a political solution,"" Stoltenberg added. Ukrainian officials are much more skeptical and have denied the Russian forces in Belarus appear ready to launch an offensive. Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov this week said Ukraine did not see Russia forming any strike groups in Belarus and that it had insufficient forces, he estimated only several thousand. Ukraine's government has said it believes the Russian buildup right now is primarily aimed at putting psychological pressure on Ukraine with the threat of attack. In the next 10 days Russia will make a vast display of military power to the north, east and south of Ukraine, holding exercises on an unprecedented scale also outside Belarus. The period seems likely to be a key moment in determining whether the crisis escalates or if the Russian buildup turns to a bluff. The exercises in Belarus will also overlap with large-scale Russian naval drills in the Black Sea, that on Thursday prompted Ukraine to accuse Moscow of mounting an “unprecedented” naval blockade of Ukrainian ports. Six Russian warships, including amphibious landing ships, entered the Black Sea Wednesday night, to join a fleet already there. Ukraine said it “strongly protests” against the live-fire drills between Feb. 13 and Feb. 19 that are expected to close off access to much of its coast in the Black Sea and to the Sea of Azov. If President Vladimir Putin is preparing to attack, the Russian build up appears to be approaching a point of maximum danger, according to some analysts, who say it has nearly completed its build up of heavy equipment and is now entering a phase where it will move up personnel to man it. That does not mean that Russia will attack — U.S. officials say they believe Putin has not yet made a decision — just that it will have the forces in place to do so within the next two weeks. “Once the second phase of the exercise begins on the 10th, I think they’re going to have everything they need in place and I think that week or the week after would make the most sense for an escalation if Russia is planning on doing an escalation,” Rob Lee, an analyst at Kings College London’s War Studies department, told ABC News. An analysis by Janes, the defense think tank, estimated there are at least 14 Russian battalion tactical groups in Belarus with around 8,000 to 14,000 troops. The U.S. has said it assesses as many as 30,000 could take part. “Best case scenario at the end of the exercise they start moving that equipment out,"" Lee said. But as long as that equipment is still there then the risk is going to be very high of an escalation."" Lee said he believed a military incursion was more likely than not. The Kremlin has denied it has any invasion plans, dismissing it as Western “hysteria."" After meeting the U.K.’s foreign minister in Moscow on Thursday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov mocked Western allegations Russia was preparing to attack, including claims it might be waiting for the ground to freeze to allow tank movements. “It’s like when they say that Russia is waiting for the ground to freeze so that tanks can easily enter Ukraine,” he added. “It seems that our British colleagues were on similar ground today, off of which bounced all the facts we presented them.” Key talks are taking place in Berlin Thursday aimed at continuing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the crisis. Ukraine and Russia will meet at the so-called ""Normandy Format,"" the long-running negotiations, mediated by France and Germany, aimed at resolving the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in its east. No breakthrough is expected, but Western countries are hoping the talks can build on the small positive signs for diplomacy that emerged from French President Emmanuel Macron’s meeting with Putin in Moscow at the start of this week.",,,,17

""We can't pinpoint the day, at this point, and we can't pinpoint the hour, but what we can say is that there is a credible prospect that a Russian military action would take place even before the end of the Olympics,"" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House. The Winter Olympics, which are ongoing in Beijing, are scheduled to end on Feb. 20. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking in Melbourne, Australia, earlier Friday, shared the same message: ""As we said before, we're in a window when an invasion could begin at any time. To be clear, that includes during the Olympics."" Sullivan said the United States still could not say whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had actually made a decision to invade. But he said the situation had grown so dire that Americans in Ukraine should leave ""immediately"" -- or at least ""in the next 24 to 48 hours."" ""We don't know exactly what is going to happen,"" Sullivan said. ""But the risk is now high enough, and the threat is now immediate enough that this is what prudence demands."" Sullivan told ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce that he expected President Joe Biden to ""engage by telephone with President Putin."" The last time the leaders spoke was Dec. 30. A White House official later said the two men would speak Saturday morning. Sullivan said Biden did not plan to put American troops' lives at risk to rescue Americans who remained there. ""If you stay,"" he said, echoing what said in an NBC News interview Thursday, ""you are assuming risk with no guarantee that there will be any other opportunity to leave, and there is no prospect of a U.S. military evacuation in the event of a Russian invasion."" Sullivan said the U.S. is reducing the size of its ""embassy footprint"" in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Sullivan went on to describe in vivid detail what could happen, including a ""rapid assault on the city of Kyiv."" ""If a Russian attack on Ukraine proceeds, it is likely to begin with aerial bombing and missile attacks that could obviously kill civilians without regard to their nationality,"" Sullivan said. ""A subsequent ground invasion would involve the onslaught of a massive force with virtually no notice, communications to arrange a departure could be severed and commercial transit halted."" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley spoke Friday with Chief of Russian General Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov by telephone, a Joint Chiefs spokesperson said in a statement. ""The military leaders discussed several security-related issues of concern,"" the statement said. ""In accordance with past practice, both have agreed to keep the specific details of their conversation private."" Earlier Friday, Biden held a call with transatlantic leaders to chart next moves as talks over Russia's military build-up near Ukraine showed no sign of defusing the crisis. Biden spoke about ""coordination on both diplomacy and deterrence"" with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, NATO, the European Commission, and the European Council, according to the White House. The president has remained largely silent on Ukraine over the past few days, instead holding public events focused on the U.S. economy. The transatlantic call came as NATO warned Europe was facing a ""dangerous moment."" ""This is a dangerous moment for European security,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday in Brussels. European leaders have engaged in intense diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine over the past several weeks to avoid war in eastern Europe. But the talks have so far failed to yield much apparent progress. France's President Emmanuel Macron traveled to Moscow to meet with Putin, before meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the next day. Russia and Ukraine held talks Thursday in Berlin, moderated by Germany and France, but after nine hours of discussion failed to even agree on issuing a joint statement. Western officials had hoped that the latest round of the so-called ""Normandy Format Talks"" would push forward the diplomacy by Macron and other officials who have been shuttling between capitals over the past couple weeks. The sides remained at an impasse, though, over Russia's insistence that the Ukrainian government speak directly with Russian-backed separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine. Biden said Monday that Americans currently in Ukraine should leave, and on Thursday, he repeated that message with more urgency. ""American citizens should leave now,"" Biden Thursday said in an interview with NBC News. ""It's not like we're dealing with a terrorist organization. We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly."" Senior U.S. officials say they do not believe Russia's President Vladimir Putin has made a decision whether to invade Ukraine, even as he has amassed over 100,000 troops on Russia's border with Ukraine. The U.S. and other Western nations have warned of severe economic consequences to Russia if it does invade. Russia denies it plans to do so. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Russia and Belarus kicked off 10 days of joint exercises in Belarus, north of Ukraine. ABC News' Patrick Reevell and Matt Seyler contributed to this report.",,,,16
2022-02-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-ukraine-tensions-reignite-debate-bidens-climate-agenda/story?id=82779009,"Russia-Ukraine tensions threaten Europe's oil supply, reigniting debate over Biden's climate agenda","The specter of a military confrontation on the Ukrainian border is stoking fears in Europe of an interruption in natural gas from Russia -- and pumping fresh life into the debate over whether President Joe Biden's climate agenda is brushing up against difficult geopolitical realities. Critics of the Biden administration say its efforts to curb domestic oil and gas production have complicated its ability to negotiate with Russia, which provides more than a third of Europe's natural gas. To others, the standoff demonstrates the need for a swift transition to clean energy, ""so that we're not held hostage by Russia moving forward,"" says Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security and a former intelligence official. Either way, experts say, the conflict in Eastern Europe is shining a spotlight on the challenges ahead as governments adapt to an evolving energy landscape. ""It is clear that climate change is a huge focus for the Biden White House,"" said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But energy security realities are intervening, and they can't be ignored."" As Russian troops amass along Russia's border with Ukraine, American officials are warning of a possible invasion in the coming days or weeks. In the event of an escalation, Western leaders fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin could halt gas supplies to Europe, potentially threatening Europe's energy security. The Biden administration has prepared contingency plans to backfill Europe's energy needs in such an event. But oil interests and Republican lawmakers argue that a reduction in domestic fossil fuel extraction in recent years has hamstrung the United States' ability to ensure Europe's energy security. Frank Macchiarola of the American Petroleum Institute told ABC News that ""ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine serve as a reminder of the critical role of U.S. oil and natural gas in meeting our nation's energy needs and ensuring our allies have access to a stable supply of affordable, reliable energy."" On Capitol Hill, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, echoed that sentiment to Politico, characterizing the Biden administration's scramble to shore up natural gas for Europe as ""a crisis strategy that didn't have to be."" But many experts disagree with that critique. Because investments in domestic oil production today generally won't impact the market for many years, Biden is limited in what he can do now to boost oil reserves. In the meantime, Cahill said, Biden should continue to advance his clean energy ambitions -- but recognize the need for future U.S. oil production. ""The Biden administration should pursue its climate agenda, including tougher regulations on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry,"" Cahill said. ""But we'll need fossil fuel investment for years to come, even as the energy transition picks up speed."" Sikorsky warns critics not to conflate ""the short-term crisis and the long-term strategy."" ""The administration has to do what it has to do to make sure energy supplies in Europe remain strong in the face of Russian aggression,"" Sikorsky said. ""But it has do that with an eye toward a more rapid transition to renewable energy."" Because Russia's economy relies so heavily on natural gas exports to Europe, Biden and European allies still have substantial energy-related leverage in negotiations with Moscow. The Russian government generated almost 30% of state revenue in 2020 from fossil fuel companies, including $40 billion in gas sales to Europe, according to one U.S. government report. ""The long-term threat to Russia's market position is actually far greater"" than the threat to Europe's energy needs, said Matthew Schmidt, director of the International Affairs program at the University of New Haven. ""Russia is a dinosaur. Their economy is weak. It's a carbon-based economy, and if Putin were to use gas a weapon, he's going to kill the market."" Additionally, experts say renewable energy breakthroughs are closer than most leaders realize -- a development that could render oil and gas obsolete in the coming decades. Schmidt said he would encourage the Biden administration to forego any further investment in fossil foils and instead ""go in on clean energy now, because that's the long-term trend."" This week, Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz pledged to halt production of Europe's Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the event of an invasion. The U.S. and its allies could also directly sanction the Russian oil and gas industry as part of an effort to ""reverse the direction of energy leverage,"" according to a Brookings Institute policy paper. But sanctions targeting Russia's oil industry carry substantial risks for Europe's energy needs. Enacting them would present the same outcome as Putin preemptively cutting off natural gas. Cahill said that Biden's quest for additional energy resources ""does raise questions about whether we've under-invested in fossil fuels in the past five to seven years ... which in turn raises questions about our ability to impose sanctions."" For some industry experts, Europe's dependence on Russian oil serves as a cautionary tale for the U.S. -- and an impetus for the U.S. to expand investments in clean energy. ""Europe's dependence on fossil fuels has made it vulnerable, the result of investment choices made over the course of decades,"" said Trevor Higgins, vice president for climate policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ""We should not repeat the same mistakes,"" said Higgins. ""A clean energy economy will be more secure and resilient than continued dependence on fossil fuels.""",,,,20

The deployment of the additional troops to Poland came as the White House warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could begin during the Olympics and urged all American citizens in Ukraine to leave the country over the next 24 to 48 hours. ""At the direction of the President, Secretary Austin today ordered to Poland the remaining 3,000 soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Infantry Brigade Combat Team based at Fort Bragg, N.C.,"" said a senior U.S. defense official. ""These troops will depart Fort Bragg over the next couple of days. They are expected to be in place by early next week."" The additional paratroopers will join the 1,700 soldiers from the same unit who began arriving in Poland earlier this week to help prepare the infrastructure needed if additional American forces were deployed to Poland. Those soldiers were part of a deployment announced last week that included sending 300 soldiers from the 18th Airborne Corps headquarters unit to Germany and sending 1,000 soldiers from the 2nd Stryker Regiment based in Germany to Romania. ""They are being deployed to reassure our NATO allies, deter any potential aggression against NATO's eastern flank, train with host-nation forces, and contribute to a wide range of contingencies,"" said the senior defense official. Those soldiers from the 82nd Airborne have been arriving at an airport in southeast Poland located 60 miles form the border with Ukraine. A U.S. official has told ABC News that these troops would be prepared to provide assistance to any American citizens fleeing Ukraine by land. ""These additional deployments are temporary in nature, meant to supplement for a brief time the more than 80,000 U.S. troops already in Europe on rotational and permanent orders,"" said the senior defense official. The 3,000 troops now headed to Poland were not among the 8,500 troops based in the United States who had been put on ""heightened alert"" two weeks ago in case they needed to be deployed on short notice as part of the NATO Response Force. Additional U.S. aircraft and accompanying personnel already in Europe have moved closer to NATO's eastern flank as tensions have grown in recent days. Eight American F-15 fighter jets along with about 130 troops with the 493 Fighter Squadron based in the United Kingdom arrived in Poland Thursday. ""The extra fighters will bolster readiness and Allied deterrence and defense as Russia continues military build-up in and around Ukraine,"" a statement from U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa said. Another squadron of Air Force F-16 fighters based in Germany arrived in Romania on Friday. Additional naval power has also been sent to the European region, with four U.S.-based destroyers deployed to ""participate in a range of maritime activities in support of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and our NATO allies,"" according to the U.S. Navy. While not confirming the deployment of the four ships is directly tied to tensions with Russia, a Navy official noted that they destroyers bring options to the region. ""One of the unique values of naval forces is their mobility and ability to deploy for a range of contingencies and operations,"" the official said. ""These deployments provide additional flexibility to the Sixth Fleet Commander.""",,,,27

The two leaders spoke for just over an hour for the first time since Dec. 30, marking their third conversation amid escalating tensions over Russia's military buildup at the Ukraine border, where it has amassed over 100,000 troops. Biden warned that the U.S. and its allies ""will respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs on Russia"" if it invades Ukraine, according to a brief White House readout of the call. The president also stressed that a Russian invasion of Ukraine ""would produce widespread human suffering and diminish Russia's standing,"" the White House said. ""President Biden was clear with President Putin that while the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy, in full coordination with our Allies and partners, we are equally prepared for other scenarios,"" the White House said. Russia has repeatedly denied it has plans to invade Ukraine, despite the buildup on its border. The Kremlin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters the call took place in a ‘business-like” manner despite an “atmosphere of unprecedented hysteria” he claimed was being artificially inflated by the U.S. ""The last days, hours, the situation has simply been brought to the point of absurdity,"" Ushakov said. “We have outlined our considerations and stressed several times that we do not understand why deliberately false information about our Russian intentions should be transmitted to the media,"" he continued. A senior administration official did not detail specifics of the call, but told reporters ""there was no fundamental change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks."" The official said the countries will continue to ""stay engaged in the days ahead,"" as military action from Russia remains a ""distinct possibility."" ""We are not basing our assessment of this on what the Russians say publicly. We are basing this assessment on what we're seeing on the ground with our own eyes, which is the continued Russian buildup on the border with Ukraine, and no meaningful evidence of de-escalation,"" the official said. The call comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts Saturday to defuse tensions and avoid war in eastern Europe. On Saturday, France President Emmanuel Macron and Putin spoke at the request of Macron, Russian officials said. The two presidents ""continued their discussion on the conditions for security and stability in Europe,"" Macron's office said in a statement. ""They both expressed a desire to continue the dialogue on these two points,"" the statement continued. French officials said Macron received personal assurances from Putin that he has no intention of attacking Ukraine. Macron raised concerns about Russian naval maneuvers near Ukraine in the Sea of Azov. ""Putin did not present this movement as a precursor to attack,"" French officials said. On Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Blinken also spoke. During the 35-minute call, Blinken discussed ""acute and shared concerns that Russia may be considering launching further military aggression against Ukraine in the coming days,"" U.S. officials said. Blinken repeated his refrain that the path of diplomacy remains available -- but if not, the repercussions will be ""resolute, massive and united."" Lavrov accused the U.S. and its allies of a ""propaganda"" campaign and of making attempts to ""sabotage"" the diplomatic talks to resolve the Russian-stoked conflict in eastern Ukraine, Russian officials said. Lavrov denied that Russia has any intention to invade Ukraine, but he also didn't signal that Russia was prepared to deescalate, a senior State Department official told ABC News. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with his Russian counterpart, Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu, on Saturday about ""Russia's force build-up in Crimea and around Ukraine,"" the Department of Defense said in a brief readout. The calls come a day after U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could begin during the Beijing Winter Olympics, which are scheduled to end on Feb. 20. ""We can't pinpoint the day, at this point, and we can't pinpoint the hour, but what we can say is that there is a credible prospect that a Russian military action would take place even before the end of the Olympics,"" Sullivan said. Following the warning, the State Department said Saturday that all non-emergency U.S. employees would depart the embassy in Kyiv, leaving only a core team of American diplomats and Ukrainian staff members. The department also emphasized that all Americans in Ukraine should leave the country immediately. ""We encourage all American citizens who remain in Ukraine to depart immediately,"" Sullivan said Friday. ""We want to be crystal clear on this point. Any American in Ukraine should leave as soon as possible, and in any event in the next 24 to 48 hours."" The Pentagon also ordered Saturday that a contingent of about 160 members of the Florida Army National Guard training in western Ukraine leave the country. Over a dozen countries have joined the U.S. in telling their citizens in recent days to leave Ukraine. On Saturday, senior U.K. officials said British citizens should get out ""immediately by any means."" The European Union has also begun pulling out non-emergency staff. In Kyiv, Mayor Vitaly Klitschko announced an evacuation plan Saturday and said the Ukrainian capital is preparing in case of a large-scale attack. Russia has also announced it is drawing down its embassy in Ukraine and pulling out some staff because it fears ""provocations"" from Kyiv or other countries, officials said Saturday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that the country is ready to counter a possible Russian invasion, but intelligence claims on possible aggression coming next week and the evacuation of foreign diplomats only cause panic. ""Today in the information space, there is too much information about a deep, full-scale invasion from Russia,"" Zelenskyy told reporters. ""The best friend of our enemy is panic in our country, and all that information which helps create only panic doesn't help us."" Russia and Ukraine held talks Thursday in Berlin, moderated by Germany and France, but after nine hours of discussion failed to agree on issuing a joint statement. The sides remained at an impasse over Russia's insistence that the Ukrainian government speak directly with Russian-backed separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine.

""It isn't just time to leave Ukraine. It is past time for private citizens to leave Ukraine,"" a senior State Department official said Saturday. The U.S. embassy announced it was evacuating all but non-emergency staff from the country and that among the skeleton crew left behind, many would pull out of the capital, Kyiv, to the western city, Lviv, near the border with Poland. The Pentagon also announced that it was withdrawing 160 soldiers from the Florida National Guard, among the only U.S. military presence in the country. Ukrainian officials, at odds with the U.S. assessment of an imminent threat for weeks, were critical of the decision as they try to project calm to a nation weary of eight years of Russian aggression. ""Today in the information space, there is too much information about a deep, full-scale invasion from Russia,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters. ""The best friend of our enemy is panic in our country, and all that information which helps create only panic doesn't help us."" Russia has denied it has plans to invade Ukraine, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov telling Secretary of State Antony Blinken that again during a call Saturday, according to a second senior State Department official. That call was part of a full-court press by the Biden administration to urge Russia to stand down from what U.S. officials say could be an imminent attack. President Joe Biden spoke to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu Saturday, while Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a rare call Friday to his counterpart, Russian General Staff Gen. Valery Gerasimov. But those high-level calls have not yet changed the U.S. assessment that an attack could take place in the coming days, as Biden's national security adviser warned Friday. Therefore, the U.S. embassy is suspending consular services Sunday, as most of the remaining staff depart. While the embassy will not close, only emergency services will be available, with diplomats focused on communicating with the Ukrainian government. ""We fervently hope and continue to work intensively to try to ensure that Ukraine does not become a war zone,"" the first senior State Department official said, but they warned it ""appears increasingly likely that this is where this situation is headed -- toward some kind of active conflict."" Pressed on Zelensky's opposition, they added, ""The Ukrainians understand why we are taking these steps, even if all of them don't necessarily agree ... with our threat assessment and with our assessment of the extent to which potential conflict is imminent."" During their call, Blinken ""emphasized"" to Lavrov the ""priority we place on the safety and security of American citizens, diplomatic personnel and our embassy facility,"" the second senior State Department official said. But the first official said ""even with restraint and respect for diplomatic facilities,"" things can ""go wrong."" While the U.S. will set up a diplomatic presence in Lviv instead, there will not be a de facto embassy there and staff won't be able to provide consular support like passports or visas, according to the official. For that, Americans are instructed that they will have to leave Ukraine and go to an embassy or consulate in another country. Diplomats aren't the only ones leaving. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered 160 soldiers from the Florida National Guard to leave Ukraine to be repositioned elsewhere in Europe, the Pentagon announced Saturday. ""These troops, assigned to the 53rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, have been advising and mentoring Ukrainian forces as part of Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine,"" said John Kirby, the Pentagon's top spokesperson. ""They are departing Ukraine and will reposition elsewhere in Europe,"" said Kirby. ""The Secretary made this decision out of an abundance of caution -- with the safety and security of our personnel foremost in mind -- and informed by the State Department's guidance on U.S. personnel in Ukraine."" ""This repositioning does not signify a change in our determination to support Ukraine's armed forces, but will provide flexibility in assuring allies and deterring aggression,"" he added. In a sign of that, even as these drawdowns unfold, another shipment of U.S. military aid for Ukraine's armed forces is scheduled to arrive Saturday, according to the first senior State Department official. But Biden has made clear U.S. troops will not enter Ukraine to support its military or even to evacuate American citizens. The Guardsmen have been in western Ukraine since November, training Ukraine's military and are based at a training center in Yavoriv, less than 10 miles from the border with Poland. There was no update provided on the status of U.S. special operations forces that have also been serving in Ukraine as part of a training mission with Ukrainian special operations forces.",,,,26

The Sunday morning call took place as U.S. officials continue to warn that an attack from Russia could come ""any day now"" and urge all Americans still in Ukraine to leave the country. ""President Biden made clear that the United States would respond swiftly and decisively, together with its allies and partners, to any further Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" the White House said of the call. ""The two leaders agreed on the importance of continuing to pursue diplomacy and deterrence in response to Russia's military build-up on Ukraine's borders."" In a tweet Sunday following the call, Zelensky said he and Biden discussed ""security, economy, existing risks, sanctions and Russian aggression."" The conversation with the Ukrainian president comes one day after Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin, where Biden similarly warned that should Russia take action against Ukraine, the U.S., along with its allies, ""will respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs on Russia."" According to a White House official, the call between Biden and Zelensky, who last spoke at the end of January, lasted 51 minutes, a shorter call than Biden's discussion with Putin on Saturday, which lasted just over an hour. A senior administration official, speaking with reporters following the Saturday call with Putin, said the tone was ""professional and substantive,"" however, ""there was no fundamental change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks."" Since Friday, the Biden administration has ramped up its warnings about a possible Russian attack on Ukraine -- which they say could happen as soon as this week. ""We have seen, over the course of the past 10 days, dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces and the disposition of those forces in such a way that they could launch a military action essentially at any time,"" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CBS on Sunday. ""They could do so this coming week."" Despite the warnings, Zelensky has continued to call for calm in the country and seemed to express frustration with the dire tone.

2022-02-15,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-urges-americans-belarus-part-moldova-leave-now/story?id=82890184,"US urges Americans in Belarus, part of Moldova to leave now amid Russian threat","The State Department has escalated its warning to U.S. citizens in Belarus, where thousands of Russian troops have massed for menacing military exercises -- now urging them to leave the country ""immediately."" The stark new warning comes as U.S. officials fear a possible Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine could unfold in the coming days, prompting the State Department to shutter its embassy facility in the capital Kyiv and relocate them to the western city Lviv. Belarus and Russia launched military exercises Thursday, bringing thousands of Russian troops and advanced weaponry and equipment to the landlocked country that borders both Russia and Ukraine. Its strongman leader, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, has drawn increasingly closer to Russian President Vladimir Putin after cracking down on political opposition, fomenting a migrant crisis in Europe and facing tough Western sanctions. The State Department had already urged American citizens ""do not travel to Belarus"" because of that domestic crackdown and the risk of ""arbitrary enforcement of laws"" and detention, as well as COVID-19. But in a new advisory Monday evening, it added a warning about the ""unusual and concerning Russian military buildup along Belarus’ border with Ukraine"" and added, ""U.S. citizens in Belarus should depart immediately via commercial or private means."" The ""situation is unpredictable, and there is heightened tension in the region,"" the advisory states, mirroring the increasingly urgent tone from the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, which urged Americans on Saturday to ""depart immediately"" as well. The warning also noted, ""The U.S. government’s ability to provide routine or emergency services to U.S. citizens in Belarus is already severely limited due to Belarusian government limitations on U.S. Embassy staffing."" The embassy in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, had previously ordered the departure of family members on Jan. 31, with a very small group of U.S. diplomats still in the country. In addition, the State Department is urging Americans to ""depart immediately"" from Transnistria, which is part of Moldova -- the landlocked country on Ukraine's southwestern border. The urgent warning doesn't apply to the entire country, but just to Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway region where Russia has stationed troops against the Moldovan government's will as ""peacekeepers,"" similar to Russian troops in two disputed regions of Georgia, the small former Soviet republic. Like Belarus, Moldova had been on the State Department's Level 4: ""Do Not Travel"" list because of COVID-19, but now in its new advisory, it warns of the ""unusual and concerning Russian military activity around Ukraine, and the unresolved conflict between the breakaway region of Transnistria and the central government; U.S. citizens in Transnistria should depart immediately."" U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have repeatedly referenced Transnistria during the current crisis as another example of Russia's aggression in the region in recent years, along with Georgia and Ukraine. Ukrainian officials went even further last month. Its defense intelligence agency said it had evidence that Russia was planning a false flag provocation against its own soldiers in Transnistria to justify an invasion of Ukraine -- an accusation the Russian government denied. The Biden administration has said it will not use the U.S. military to help evacuate American citizens if war breaks out in the region -- with the memory of Afghanistan hanging over them. That historic, chaotic operation ultimately evacuated some 124,000 people, but the State Department has made clear it was not a precedent. Instead, the U.S. has used increasingly dire warnings to private Americans in Ukraine and now Belarus and Transnistria to leave now while commercial flight options or land border crossings are available.",,,,17

Russia's Ministry of Defense said units from its southern and western military districts, which have deployed thousands of troops close to Ukraine's border, had begun returning to barracks. Video released by the military showed what it said were tanks pulling back and being loaded onto rail transports. A spokesman for Russia's southern military district also said its servicemen had begun leaving Crimea, where Russia has built up a large force. The United States and other western officials, as well as independent experts, expressed caution about the development, saying they would wait to see if Russia really pulled back the troops. Major Russian exercises are continuing in neighboring Belarus to the north of Ukraine and in the Black Sea. NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that for now, the alliance had not seen ""any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side"" but noted there were signs for diplomacy from Moscow that gave grounds for ""cautious optimism."" Ukraine's foreign minister said officials would believe the Russian withdrawal ""when we see it."" Hopes that Russia might be moving to de-escalate tensions were almost immediately dimmed by Russia's parliament, which on Tuesday voted to pass a law calling on President Vladimir Putin to recognize two Russian-controlled breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent. The law appeals to Putin to recognize the self-proclaimed ""People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk"" in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian statelets that were created with Moscow's backing and troops during fighting in 2014. Separatist forces, backed by Russian troops, have continued to fight a low-intensity war with the Ukrainian government. The move to recognize the regions would open a path for Russia to formally annex the regions, as it did Crimea eight years ago. This step would likely trigger more Western sanctions and further escalate the crisis. The vote now puts the decision in Putin's hands. But Putin himself on Tuesday later appeared to suggest he would not move to recognize the regions immediately. At a press conference after meeting with Germany's new chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was visiting Moscow, Putin said that while he believed a ""clear majority"" of Russia supported the step, for now, he believed Russia should continue to work within the existing peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine, the 2015 Minsk agreement. ""I start from that we must do everything for the resolution of the problem of Donbas, but do it first of all starting from the unfulfilled possibilities of the Minsk agreement,"" Putin said. The parliament vote was denounced in Ukraine, with an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky calling it an ""escalatory action."" Ukraine's foreign ministry said if Putin did follow through with recognition, Russia would ""de-facto and de-jure exit the Minsk agreements, with all the accompanying consequences."" Putin sent mixed messages during the press conference with Scholz, the latest western leader to visit Moscow to urge a diplomatic exit to the crisis. While Putin acknowledged some Russian troops were withdrawing near the Ukraine border, he signaled he did not consider the crisis to be over, saying Russia was still insisting on its key demands for a guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO. The U.S. and NATO countries have rejected that as a non-starter but offered to engage with Russia on more modest issues, including limits of missile deployments and military exercises. Putin said he was ready to work with the West of discussing some of those proposed confidence-building measures, including a possible restoration of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty that the Trump administration pulled out from. But Putin insisted those discussions could not mean Russia was dropping its central demand on NATO. ""We hear that Ukraine isn't ready today to join NATO and they say that they won't take it tomorrow. And will they take it then when it is ready? Well, for us that might already be too late,"" Putin said. ""And so we want to resolve this question right now. In the nearest future in the course of the negotiating process, with peaceful means,"" Putin said. Asked what the week would bring, Putin didn't rule out the crisis could still escalate, though he repeated Russia does ""not want war."" ""How will Russia act next? According to the plan!"" Putin said that no one knew how the situation would develop but that Russia would strive to come to an agreement diplomatically. Scholz said at the press conference that Russian recognizing the separatist regions would be a ""catastrophe."" He expressed hope that diplomacy can work, but said Russia should take ""clear steps to de-escalate the current tensions"" and warned European Union countries would take ""far-reaching measures"" in the event of Russian ""military aggression"" against Ukraine. The U.S. and other western countries have warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could come this week. Before the Russian announcement of the partial withdrawal, satellite images and videos spotted on social media by open source researchers appeared to show Russian forces continuing to move closer to Ukraine, with some units taking up what experts said looked like forward positions. The U.S. on Monday announced it was closing its embassy in Kyiv and moving key diplomats to Lviv in western Ukraine amid an ""accelerated"" buildup by Russian forces. Satellite images published by the private company, Maxar, showed substantial new forces close to Ukraine in Crimea, Belarus and in western Russia, including attack helicopters. Cristo Grozev, a well-known open source researcher, said a team working with the group, Conflict Intelligence Team-- that has been tracking the Russian build up for months-- so far had seen evidence of a Russian withdrawal. ""This may well change in the next hours or days,"" Grozev wrote on Twitter. But for now, he said, the convoys they had been tracking moving towards the Ukraine border ""are still moving in the same direction."" On Tuesday evening, Ukraine said a cyberattack had hit the websites of its military and two of the country's largest state banks. The national cybersecurity center said a DDoS attack had struck the public websites of the ministry of defense and Ukraine's armed forces, causing some disruption to online banking for PrivatBank and the State Saving Bank of Ukraine. Russia's announcement that it was pulling back some forces came a day after Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu briefed Putin that Russia's huge military drills would end in the ""near future."" Shoigu told Putin that ""part of the drills are approaching their completion and part would be completed in the near future."" Russia has consistently denied it has any intention to attack Ukraine using the more than 100,000 troops it has massed near its border. However, Russia has claimed warnings from the U.S. and other Western countries that it may be preparing to launch an invasion as ""hysteria."" Tuesday ""will go down in history as the day the Western propaganda war failed. Disgraced and destroyed without a shot being fired,"" Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, wrote on her Facebook page Tuesday. Military exercises on an unprecedented scale are continuing in Belarus and are due to end on Feb. 20. The U.S. has warned that Russia could launch an invasion of Ukraine this week, reportedly briefing NATO allies last week that it had intelligence the attack could come on Wednesday. Ukraine's government has expressed more skepticism that Russia is ready to attack this week, suggesting it believes the massive Russian buildup is intended to pressure Ukraine with the threat of invasion. Zelensky, in a televised address Monday night, told Ukrainians he was declaring Wednesday, the alleged day of a possible Russian attack, a national holiday. Zelensky's national security adviser, Oleksiy Danilov, told Ukrainian television Monday night that Ukraine did not see signs Russia is preparing to attack on Feb. 16 or 17. ""We recognize all the risks that there are for our country. But the situation is absolutely under control,"" he said.",,,,17
2022-02-16,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-troops-moved-firing-positions-ukraine-putin-ready/story?id=82909721,"Some Russian troops moved to firing positions near Ukraine, Putin said be ready by Feb. 16: Sources","While Russia's defense ministry said Tuesday that some forces would pull back from Ukraine's borders after completing military exercises, the U.S. has so far not seen that, President Joe Biden said in an address to the nation. But worrying U.S. officials, Russians troops are instead moving forward closer to the line, including with medical supplies, and being put into firing positions, sources told ABC News. The U.S. believes that Russia now has all the necessary pieces in place, including 150,000 troops in the region, to launch a swift and brutal invasion of Ukraine, the sources added -- the reason why Biden administration officials have now publicly been saying Russia could move ""at any time."" In particular, ABC News has learned that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had told his military forces to be ready to go by Wednesday, Feb. 16, but it is still unclear whether he has made a decision to attack his neighbor. The Russian government has denied any plans to invade Ukraine and repeatedly accused the U.S. of ""hysteria"" with these increasingly urgent warnings about one. ""After Russian troops finish drills and return to barracks, the West will declare 'diplomatic victory' by having 'secured' Russian 'de-escalation' -- a predictable scenario and cheap domestic political points,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Saturday, according to the country's foreign ministry. The U.S. believes an invasion would likely begin with electronic warfare and aerial bombardment against critical infrastructure, the sources said, followed by special operations forces entering Kyiv to decapitate the Ukrainian government and resupplying troops entering from Belarus -- with plans to complete their operations in 24 to 72 hours. During his remarks Tuesday, Biden confirmed that Russian troops ""remain very much in a threatening position"" -- warning that an invasion remains ""distinctly possible"" and would inflict an ""enormous"" human toll. But Biden said the U.S. would welcome Moscow pulling back its forces and engaging in diplomatic talks on U.S. and NATO proposals, on issues like arms control and transparency over military exercises. While Lavrov said Moscow's response to those proposals would be transmitted in the coming days, Putin said that Russia's key demands were being ignored -- that Ukraine be barred from joining NATO and that the Western military alliance pull back its forces from Eastern European member states. The U.S. and NATO have said those are nonstarters -- issues that only the alliance itself or individual countries can decide and not under Russian pressure. ""This is about more than just Russia and Ukraine. It's about standing for what we believe in, for the future that we want for our world, for liberty -- for liberty, the right of countless countries to choose their own destiny, and the right of people to determine their own futures, or the principle that a country can't change its neighbor's borders by force,"" Biden said at the White House. Biden and Putin spoke Saturday -- their first conversation in over a month -- while their top diplomats Lavrov and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have spoken twice now in recent days. While the door to continued dialogue remains open, both sides have indicated, there are concerns Russia may resort to war even as it negotiates. Russia already seized Ukrainian territory when it annexed Crimea in 2014, and since then, it has fomented a war against Ukrainian troops by arming and financing separatists in Ukraine's eastern provinces known as Donbas. Russian parliament passed a resolution Tuesday calling on Putin to recognize them as independent republics -- something Putin indicated he would not yet do. But sources said if Russia attacks Ukraine, it would likely not be against a small slice of territory in Donbas, but a bloody, brutal, and swift campaign to topple President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration and install a puppet government. Amid the heightened U.S. fears, the U.S. has also been concerned that the Zelenskyy's government hasn't responded quickly enough and isn't better prepared for a potential Russian invasion, sources said, including the positioning of its forces in eastern Ukraine. U.S. officials have been urging better preparedness for two months now, the sources added, but President Zelenskyy and his inner circle have been both intent on staving off a panic and persistent in a belief that Moscow wouldn't invade. While some U.S. officials doubt Putin is bluffing given the costs, financial and political, of the buildup, many analysts have been skeptical of dire U.S. assessments -- with some saying Putin is achieving his ultimate objective: destabilizing an increasingly democratic Ukraine aligned with the West. ""Putin has the hard experience of humiliation in Chechnya that tells him that while Russia might eventually be able to conquer Ukraine, they can’t hold it, and with any crossing of the border they will pay a very high price in blood and treasure,"" said retired Col. Stephen Ganyard, a former senior State Department official and now an ABC News contributor. ""If he fails in Ukraine, it could be his rule that ends as well."" In particular, Ganyard said, a Russian invasion is still facing warm, wet weather conditions that make tank movements and aerial bombardment difficult, while the number of massed Russian troops still pales compared to Ukraine's forces, especially if Russian troops have to occupy a country the size of Texas. Biden made clear the U.S. still hopes for a diplomatic off-ramp and for Putin to decide against invasion, even as they continue to make preparations for one -- from increased military aid for Ukraine, to coordination with European allies and others on sanctions. Since Russia's buildup began, allies and partners have come together quickly to prepare a year's worth of sanctions work in the last six weeks, sources said, including export controls that could devastate Russia's economy. But the U.S. is concerned that Russia could maintain its troop buildup and other ways of pressuring Ukraine short of taking military action -- and that that could start to splinter the Western coalition's unity. Biden made reference to the economic pain that could be felt at home in the U.S., including elevated energy prices because of Russia's major role as an oil and gas exporter. ""But the American people understand that defending democracy and liberty is never without cost,"" Biden said -- adding his administration was taking ""active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets.""

""I will not pretend this will be painless,"" Biden said Tuesday while preparing Americans to be prepared for higher energy prices in the U.S. if Russian President Vladimir Putin decides to attack Ukraine and the Biden administration in turn puts its ""powerful"" sanctions in place. The average price of a gallon of gas reached $3.51 on Wednesday, according to AAA, up roughly a dollar from a year ago and the highest level since October 2014. And in just the last month, prices in more than a dozen states have jumped 25 cents. Russia is the second largest oil producer in the world, and if it invades and U.S. sanctions then keep its oil from the world market or make it more expensive, and ABC News Chief Business Correspondent Rebecca Jarvis reports some analysts predict prices at the pump in the U.S. could jump as much as 50 cents. Polls show Biden already is being blamed for higher gas prices as part of the worst inflation in nearly 40 years -- more than 7% last year -- and it's a big political problem for him and Democrats ahead of November's midterm elections. ABC News' Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega pressed the White House on what Americans should be ready for. ""Worst case scenario, what should they expect if this happens,"" Vega asked White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday. ""If Russia decides to invade, there could be consequences here at home, and that could have an impact on energy prices, which could have an impact on prices at the gas pump,"" Psaki said. ""He also wanted to be very clear and direct with the American people about what the impact could be and the fact that in his view, defending democracy and liberty is never without costs, but we need to convey to the American people exactly what that could look like."" Psaki said ""all options are on the table"" to help bring down the price of gasoline and President Biden has been trying to get ahead of a major impact by shoring up supplies with allies and energy producers. ""We are taking active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets and offset rising prices,"" said Biden. Several Democratic senators have introduced legislation to temporarily suspend the 18.5 cents per gallon federal gas tax for the remainder of the year to help bring the price at the pump down. During a news conference on inflation Wednesday, Republican senators called the proposal a ""gimmick"" and criticized the Biden administration's energy policies that they say have punished American producers and increased foreign reliance on Russian energy. ""One of the best ways we can thwart Putin's use of energy as a weapon against our NATO allies is actually produce more energy that we can supply to them. Everybody agrees with that, except for a few far-left individuals in the White House who somehow came in and won the debate about 'let's unilaterally disarm American energy,'"" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said. The White House has not taken a position on the proposal. In January, senior administration officials said they had been working with countries in North Africa, Asia, Europe and Asia to ""ensure the continuity of supply"" and lessen the price shock that comes with a shortage. President Biden discussed global energy supplies with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud on Feb. 9 and when he hosted Qatar's Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani at the White House on Jan. 31. Despite the outreach and calls to pump more oil, Saudi Arabia has decided to abide by a five-year-old deal between OPEC+ countries and will not increase its production to full capacity, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Ukraine on Wednesday held a nationwide “Unity Day,"" hanging flags and holding ceremonies to sing the nation's anthem on the day that U.S. officials had said a Russian invasion could take place. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted the public holiday in an apparent signal of defiance that also indicated Ukrainian skepticism that an attack would take place. Russian officials, meanwhile, mocked claims that the attack would materialize Wednesday, saying it illustrated Western “hysteria” around Russia’s buildup of troops close to Ukraine. Russia’s military a day earlier said some of its troops have started to withdraw after completing “exercises” and on Wednesday said that process was continuing, releasing new video showing a trainload of armored vehicles rolling across a bridge from Crimea to Russia. But NATO’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said that despite the few videos released by Russia, the alliance so far sees no evidence of actual withdrawal and that more troops have continued to arrive. “So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground. On the contrary, it appears that Russia continues the military buildup,"" Stoltenberg told reporters before a two-day meeting of NATO’s 30 defense ministers in Brussels. “We are, of course, monitoring very closely what Russia does in and around Ukraine. What we see is that they have increased the number of troops and more troops are on their way and so, so far, no de-escalation,” he said. But Stoltenberg said the alliance still hoped Russia would choose a diplomatic way out of the crisis, noting recent statements from President Vladimir Putin expressing a readiness to engage with the West. “Of course, we hear all the messages about diplomacy and we are ready to engage in diplomatic efforts with Russia,"" Stoltenberg said. Russia’s military said units from its western and southern military districts, that have amassed thousands of troops near Ukraine, have begun returning to their bases. The defense ministry on Wednesday said the western military district units had completed loading their tanks onto transports and were now beginning a “1000 kilometer” journey back to their home base. Russia is continuing to hold huge exercises in neighboring Belarus and in the Black Sea, which are due to run until the end of this week. Western and Ukrainian officials, as well as independent military analysts have expressed skepticism that the announced moves reflect a true pull-back, noting that previously announced withdrawals have amounted to little more than shuffling forces around. U.S. officials also said they have not seen a real withdrawal. ""On the contrary, we continue to see forces, especially forces in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine, continuing to be at the border, to mass at the border,"" Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" Wednesday. Russia has amassed an estimated 150,000 troops on three sides of Ukraine, a presence that includes long-range artillery, advanced aircraft and dozens of attack helicopters. U.S. officials have warned in recent days that some of the troops appear to be moving into ""firing positions"". Satellite photographs from a private company and videos spotted on social media by open source researchers appear to show that for now Russia has continued to move forces closer to the border with Ukraine. A large number of cellphone videos have appeared on TikTok that seem to show convoys of tanks and armored vehicles moving in the Belgorod region that borders Ukraine. The Russian state newspaper Izvestia cited defense ministry sources that the units re-basing were the western district’s 3rd Motor Rifle Division and the southern district's 42nd Guards and 150th Motorized-Rifle Division. But analysts said that the units' home base are located close to Ukraine in any case. The 3rd Motor Rifle Division is based in the town of Boguchar, only about 60 miles from the border. It means the units rather than pulling back from the border are simply moving to a different location along the border. Belarus' foreign minister Vladimir Makey said at a press conference on Wednesday that all Russian troops would leave his country after the joint drills end February 20. U.S. officials continue to believe it is likely Russia will launch a large-scale invasion, potentially as early as this week, although they don't believe Putin has made a final decision yet. ABC News learned that U.S. officials had briefed allies that Wednesday could be the day of the attack because they had information Putin has ordered his military to be ready to go from that day. The U.S. assesses that Russia now has all the necessary forces in place to launch a major attack if Putin chooses. It believes such an attack would not be limited to eastern Ukraine but would target the capital Kyiv, aiming to decapitate the government in a lightning strike planned to be over within 72 hours. The operation would be preceded by large-scale cyber attacks and aerial bombardments against critical infrastructure, before special forces enter Kyiv to target Ukraine's leadership. Russian forces in neighboring Belarus would sweep in from the north, according to the U.S. assessment. A cyber attack hit the website of Ukraine’s defense ministry and two of its largest state banks on Tuesday night. The cyber defense department of Ukraine’s national security service said the DDoS attack was very large, but the damage appeared limited, it said due to preparations Ukraine had taken in recent weeks. After some disruption in online payments, the two banks, Privat Bank and the State Savings Bank, said their systems were working again. The security service said the U.S. was assisting Ukraine in protecting itself against the attack. Ukraine’s government has appeared more skeptical of the invasion risk, with senior officials saying they did not see signs Russia was preparing to attack Wednesday. President Zelenskyy inspected military exercises in the Rivne region near Belarus, wearing army fatigues. In an address filmed selfie-style on his phone earlier Wednesday, he told Ukrainians, “Our shared desire to live unites us, to live together in peace. We are in Ukraine and no one can defend our home like we can.” In Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, hundreds of cadets at a local military academy gathered around a towering flag pole on Wednesday morning for a ceremony, where they sang the national anthem, which begins “Ukraine is not dead yet.”",,,,17

""My sense is this will happen in the next several days,"" he told ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega as he left the White House for a trip to Ohio. Biden told reporters the threat of an invasion is ""very high."" ""They have not moved any of their troops out. They have moved more troops in,"" he said. ""We have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false flag operation, to have an excuse to go in. Every indication we have is they're prepared to go into Ukraine and attack Ukraine."" A senior administration official said Wednesday evening the Kremlin had added about 7,000 troops near the Ukraine border in recent days -- ""with some arriving as recently as today"" -- placing the number of Russian forces near Ukraine above the 150,000 figure cited by Biden in an address to the nation Tuesday. At the same time, Biden repeated there is still a path to diplomacy but said he has no plans to hold a call with Putin. ""That's why I asked Secretary Blinken to go to the U.N. to make his statement today,"" he said, referring to Secretary of State Antony Blinken changing plans at the last minute to address the U.N. Security Council. ""He'll lay out what that path is. I've laid out a path to Putin as well ... There is a path, there is a way through this."" Even as Russia delivered its written response Thursday to U.S. and NATO proposals for talks, a senior administration official dismissed Russia's diplomacy, so far, as disingenuous, to reporters on an earlier call. ""Every indication we have now is that they mean only to pretend to engage in diplomacy, where they publicly offer to talk and make claims about de-escalation -- while privately mobilizing for war,"" the official said. For days now, the Kremlin has claimed to be pulling back Russian forces after completing military ""exercises,"" but U.S. security analysts have said it appears Russian troops are rotating in and growing in number, with the ability to invade Ukraine at any point. Russian leaders, meanwhile, have accused the West of creating ""hysteria"" over the situation at Ukraine's border. The buildup of Russian forces has prompted the biggest concentration of troops in Europe since the Cold War, the NATO secretary-general said Wednesday. Biden warned Putin in remarks from the White House earlier this week that if Russia invades Ukraine, the U.S. is prepared to respond decisively and in unison with NATO allies. ""If Russia attacks Ukraine, it will be met with overwhelming international condemnation,"" Biden said. ""The world will not forget that Russia chose needless death and destruction. Invading Ukraine will prove to be a self-inflicted wound. The United States and our allies and partners will respond decisively. The West is united and galvanized."" Explaining U.S. involvement in the region, Biden told the American people, ""this is about more than just Russia and Ukraine."" ""It's about standing for what we believe in, for the future that we want for our world, for liberty, for liberty, the right of countless countries to choose their own destiny. And the right of people to determine their own futures, or the principle that a country can't change its neighbor's borders by force,"" Biden said.

2022-02-17,https://abcnews.go.com/International/tensions-rise-ukraine-russian-backed-separatist-shelling-hits/story?id=82962555,Tensions rise in Ukraine as Russian-backed separatist shelling hits nursery school,"LVIV, Ukraine -- Tensions have jumped in eastern Ukraine as Russian-controlled separatists there shelled a nursery in Ukrainian government-held territory and warned of escalation, amid concerns that Russia may be looking to build a pretext to launch an invasion. Mortar rounds fired by the separatists struck kindergarten number 21 in the village of Stanytsa Luhansk on Thursday morning close to the frontline with Ukrainian troops, injuring three adults, according to Ukraine’s military. Video filmed by Ukrainian soldiers showed a hole blown in the school’s wall. Twenty children had to be evacuated but were unhurt, Ukraine’s armed forces said. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the Russian-backed separatists of “provocative shelling” and as the United States warned Russia is now preparing to launch an invasion in the coming days. President Joe Biden on Thursday told reporters “every indicator we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine, and “we have reason to believe they are engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in."" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also said he was concerned Russia “is trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine.” The firing occurred at the same time as the Russian-controlled separatists accused Ukraine of “large-scale” shelling onto their territory and warned of a “substantial worsening” of the situation along the front line. The self-declared Peoples Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk on Thursday issued “emergency statements” claiming Ukrainian troops had fired onto civilian areas in nine villages, including with heavy caliber mortars. Rodion Miroshnik, a political advisor for the Lugansk ‘republic’, accused Ukraine of ordering a “massive provocation.” The two unrecognized statelets control part of Ukraine’s Donbas regions, after Russia helped create them during fighting in 2014 and they remain heavily dependent on Moscow and its troops, which are covertly stationed there. For weeks, the separatist leadership and Russian state media have accused Ukraine of preparing to mount an offensive against the separatist territories. Western officials and independent experts worry Russia may be laying the groundwork for a pretext it could use to justify a military intervention should it choose to attack. This week, Russia opened a war crimes investigation into separatist claims to have found mass graves, supposedly containing the victims of alleged Ukrainian atrocities. Russian President Vladimir Putin told a press conference on Tuesday “genocide” was taking place in eastern Ukraine. At least 14,000 people have died during the eight-year conflict in Ukraine, many of the victims died following indiscriminate artillery fire by both sides. However, no evidence has emerged of large-scale massacres or genocide as Russia claims. Late Wednesday night, Russia's mission to the United Nations circulated a document that alleged Ukraine had committed large-scale war crimes in the eastern regions ahead of a U.N. Security Council session on the war. U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in the U.N. council session Thursday accused Russia of planning to manufacture a pretext for an imminent invasion of Ukraine, singling out the mass grave claims and saying Moscow might also stage phony drone strikes or chemical or biological weapons attacks. Russia might try to claim such an event as “ethnic cleansing or a genocide.” Blinken said. He said that would make a “mockery of a concept that we in this chamber do not take lightly.” “Nor do I take lightly, based on my family history,” said Blinken, a reference to his stepfather who survived the Holocaust. Blinken said the U.S.’ information now indicates that Russia’s build up of forces near Ukraine means they “are preparing to launch an attack against Ukraine in the coming days.” He warned that after spreading false claims about a Ukrainian attack on the separatist, Russia might convene high-level emergency meeting to address them, after which it would launch an assault. Blinken said the Russian plan would see aerial bombardment across Ukraine, backed up by massive cyberattacks, as Russian tanks and troops moved on cities, including the capital Kyiv. ""Here today, we are laying it out in great detail with a hope that by sharing what we know with the world, we can influence Russia to abandon the path of war and choose a different path while there's still time,"" Blinken said. Russian officials have dismissed the U.S. accusations as “hysteria” and pointed out that a date announced for the possible Russian attack this week, Feb. 16, had passed without anything materializing. ""We have long ago clarified everything and explained everything, and the announced date of the so-called invasion is behind us, so therefore, my advice to you is not present yourself in an awkward situation,"" Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin told Blinken during the UN council meeting. The Feb. 16 was reported as a possible day for a Russian attack after U.S. officials privately briefed NATO allies last week, but U.S. officials have said the reason they identified it was because of information Putin has ordered his military to be ready to go from that date. Russia’s parliament earlier this week passed a law appealing to Putin to recognize the separatist regions as independent from Ukraine. The step would be a major escalation, opening the path for Russia to formally annex them as it did Crimea in 2014. But Putin so far has signaled he will not act on the appeal, saying on Tuesday that Russia will continue to work through the so-called Minsk agreements. The 2015 peace deal aimed at end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia recognizing the self-declared republics would amount to it exiting the Minsk deal. Russia’s military this week has claimed to be moving some of its forces back from near Ukraine and its Defense Ministry on Thursday insisted again some troops were now returning to base. A spokesman said, the first units from Russia’s western and southern military districts, had already reached their home bases far from the border and more were moving there now. But NATO countries and Ukraine, as well as independent analysts, have said so far there is no evidence of Russia is withdrawing substantial forces and that in reality it is continuing its build up. Huge Russian exercises are continuing in neighboring Belarus and the Black Sea, scheduled to go on until Feb. 20, after which Russia has said its forces will leave. A Russian deputy foreign minister on Thursday said it was time for western countries “to calm down,” saying the exercises would soon end. ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",,,,17

Tensions over the potential for a Russian invasion in Ukraine have increased as American officials have repeatedly said that a Russian invasion could occur ""any day."" Russia's defense ministry claimed this week that it had begun withdrawing tank units and other forces from the area at the conclusion of exercises that had been cited as the reason for the massive troop buildup around Ukraine. But U.S. officials have rejected those claims, saying instead that Russia has continued to flow more troops into the border area while it was claiming a troop withdrawal was taking place. ""He's got things like medical tents and nurses -- you ... would never have seen that if you were going to be withdrawing your troops?"" Raddatz asked Austin. ""Exactly. If they were redeploying to garrison, we wouldn't be seeing the kinds of things in terms of, not only combat power, but also logistical support, medical support, combat aviation that we've seen in the region,"" Austin responded. On Friday, the American representative to the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe reported to that organization that the U.S. assesses that Russia has ""probably"" amassed between a force numbering between 169,000 and 190,000 near Ukraine's borders, a total that includes Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.

Answering questions afterward, he appeared to go further than he has before about what Russian President Vladimir Putin might do, saying, ""As of this moment, I am convinced he has made the decision"" to invade. When asked if this means that diplomacy is off the table, Biden said, ""no"" and said until he invades, ""diplomacy is also a possibility."" Pressed why he was confident in his assessment, he responded, ""We have significant intelligence capability."" In his prepared remarks, Biden said, ""We have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to and intend to attack Ukraine in the coming week -- the coming days. We believe that they will target Ukraine's capitol of Kiev, a city of 2.8 million innocent people. We're calling out Russia's plans loudly and repeatedly not because we want a conflict,"" Biden said, but to prevent them from moving. He made the remarks after he held a call with translatlantic leaders to discuss continued efforts at deterrence and diplomacy and what the White House called ""Russia's buildup of military troops on the border of Ukraine."" He said he spoke with members of Congress attending the Munich Security Conference as well. ""Despite Russia's efforts to divide us at home and abroad, I can affirm that has not happened. The overwhelming message on both calls was one of unity, determination and resolve,"" Biden said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau participated in the call, along with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, the EU, and NATO, according to Trudeau's office. On Friday, the leader of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine called for his supporters to begin a mass evacuation to Russia, claiming Ukraine was readying for an invasion of the region. Ukraine immediately denied the claim. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Moscow will likely manufacture Ukrainian provocations to justify an invasion of its smaller neighbor. Putin Friday warned the situation is ""escalating,"" appearing to place blame on Ukraine. ""All Kyiv needs to do is sit down at the negotiating table with representatives of Donbas and agree on political, military, economic and humanitarian measures to end the conflict,"" Putin said Friday during a news conference alongside the leader of Belarus. But Putin continues to demand assurances from the West that Ukraine will never join NATO, a concession U.S. officials are unwilling to make.",,,,17
2022-02-22,https://abcnews.go.com/US/gas-prices-soar-record-levels-california-amid-ukraine/story?id=83045782,"Gas prices soar to record levels in California amid Ukraine crisis, tax hikes","Analysts are warning motorists in California to hold on to their wallets as a host of factors will take already record-high gas prices to new levels. The state averaged $4.742 a gallon on Tuesday, about $1.20 more than the national average, according to AAA. Some counties, including San Francisco, are averaging over $4.90, according to AAA. Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, which tracks gas prices across the nation, told ABC News that the statewide average is likely to cross the $5 a gallon average threshold soon. ""Everyone is going up the same but no one is going to match California's prices,"" he said. De Haan said there were several factors, the biggest being the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The political uncertainty over a possible invasion has affected oil prices globally, De Haan noted. ""We are subject to international supply and demand,"" he said. ""How long it progresses through the summer depends on Russia."" California's regulations have also affected prices, specifically its gas tax of 51.1 cents per gallon, according to De Haan. The tax, which pays for road repairs and maintenance throughout the state, is one of the largest in the nation, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators, and has gone up with inflation. ""The taxes make a huge difference in the overall price. That's why you haven't seen as big of a jump in Oregon or Washington,"" he said. Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed to halt a scheduled gas tax increase, but has not received support from Democratic members of the state legislature, the Associated Press reported. De Haan said that spring is around the time that gas prices tend to go up and there is very little that motorists who drive in California can do to avoid taking a financial hit at the pump. He did offer one suggestion that could help drivers cut down their trips to the gas station: slow down. De Haan said that a car's mileage grows when a driver maintains their speed as much as possible. ""Slowing down a couple of miles per hour [and] not racing light to light can easily save you 10 to 15% in every tank,"" De Haan said.",,,,23
2022-02-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-begins-sanction-moscow-beginning-russian-invasion-ukraine/story?id=83041555,Biden begins to sanction Moscow for 'beginning of a Russian invasion' of Ukraine,"President Joe Biden declared Tuesday that Russia's latest moves amounted to ""the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" announced new sanctions and said he would send additional U.S. troops to the region. The president said the sanctions would target large Russian banks, Russia's sovereign debt, and, starting Wednesday, the Russian elite and their relatives, and he threatened to add more if Russian President Vladimir Putin takes even more aggressive action. ""This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, as he indicated and asked permission to be able to do from his Duma,"" referring to the Russian parliament, Biden said in remarks from the White House. He said, ""if Russia goes further with this invasion, we stand prepared to go further as with sanctions."" ""None of us, none of us should be fooled,"" the president said. ""None of us will be fooled. There is no justification. Further Russian assault in Ukraine remains a severe threat in the days ahead."" Putin, in ordering Russian troops into two Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, was ""setting up a rationale to take more territory by force,"" Biden said. ""Who in the Lord's name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors?"" he said. Calling the Russian moves ""a flagrant violation of international law"" and one that ""demands a firm response from the international community,"" Biden said ""full blocking sanctions"" would be placed on two large Russian financial institutions and ""comprehensive sanctions' on Russia's sovereign debt. ""That means we've cut off Russia's government from western financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and can not trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either,"" he said. Starting Wednesday, he said, ""we'll also impose sanctions on Russia's elites and their family members. They share in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin policies and should share in the pain as well."" Biden also announced he would send more troops to the Baltics. ""Today, in response to Russia's admission that it will not withdraw its forces from Belarus, I have authorized the additional movements of U.S. forces and equipment already stationed in Europe, to strengthen our Baltic allies, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,"" he said. Biden did not provide more details but called the deployments other than calling them ""totally defensive moves on our part."" He noted ""we have no intention of fighting Russia"" and said it was about sending ""an unmistakable message"" the U.S. ""will defend every inch of NATO territory."" Several experts told ABC News that the new U.S. sanctions would have minimal impact on Russia's behavior and finances -- and that they stopped far short of the more severe sanctions that the White House had signaled it could eventually levy. ""This is an ante to say, 'This is the beginning of what we can do,'"" said Julia Friedlander, a former Treasury Department official who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council. The Treasury Department said it would target two banks important to the Russian government and defense sector. But Russia has anticipated sanctions, with significant foreign currency reserves and a sizable national wealth fund, experts said. Andrew Lohsen, who worked as an officer and analyst at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Ukraine mission, said that if the U.S. wanted to make a real impact, it should sanction Russia's largest banks where most Russians hold accounts: Gazprombank, VTB Bank and Sberbank. ""Those haven't been touched,"" Lohsen, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. ""There's obviously a belief that there's still some leverage that can be gained from holding those three banks in particular in reserve."" While the European Union and NATO have both said Russia had moved forces into Ukraine, Biden stopped short of saying whether Russia had done so, instead focusing on Russia recognizing the independence of two breakaway Ukrainian provinces already partially controlled by pro-Russian separatists. His remarks followed nearly a daylong linguistic dance around how the U.S. would characterize and react to Putin's moves. After for weeks saying the U.S. would impose ""severe and swift"" sanctions on Russia if it invaded Ukraine, the Biden administration has been grappling with whether Russia's decision to send troops across the border would trigger the most severe punishments it had prepared. The U.S. on Monday imposed limited sanctions in response to Russia recognizing the regions' independence, and blasted Putin for ordering troops into those regions. But as the White House stopped short of putting in place sanctions it said would make Russia an ""international pariah,"" observers were left to parse what, in President Joe Biden's eyes, would actually prompt that. ""Russia will be held accountable if it invades,"" Biden said at a news conference on Jan. 19. ""And it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera."" Within hours, his press secretary, Jen Psaki, clarified: ""If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our allies."" The next day, Biden, too, added: ""If any -- any -- assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion"" that ""would be met with severe and coordinated economic response that I've discussed in detail with our allies."" And his top national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a Feb. 6 interview with NBC News: ""President Biden has spoken to the fact that if a Russian tank or a Russian troop moves across the border, that's an invasion"" that would result in ""severe economic consequences."" But with Putin so far ordering troops into regions where Russian operatives already operate -- albeit within Ukraine's internationally recognized borders -- it was unclear what, exactly, would trigger the larger sanctions. ""We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia's latest invasion, into Ukraine, and you already seeing the beginning of our response that we've said would be swift and severe,"" Jon Finer, the principal deputy U.S. national security adviser, said in an interview with CNN Tuesday. ""An invasion is an invasion, and that is what is underway,"" he said. ""But Russia has been invading Ukraine since 2014."" Administration officials, though, had in the past suggested to reporters that sanctions would not come in a piecemeal fashion. Psaki, though, said Monday that the sanctions the U.S. was announcing were ""separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine."" The linguistic dance took place in Europe, as well, where the European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Tuesday told reporters that ""Russian troops are on Ukrainian soil"" but that he wouldn't call Russia's actions ""a fully-fledged invasion."" NATO's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, also said Tuesday that there was evidence additional Russian forces had moved into Ukraine, and that Russia had moved from ""covert attempts to destabilize Ukraine to overt military action."" After Russia's actions Monday, the U.S. and its allies began imposing a series of cascading sanctions. The U.S. on Monday targeted people connected to the two separatist-controlled areas. On Tuesday, Germany took the major step of suspending the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia; the U.K. imposed sanctions on three Russian oligarchs, five Russian banks and Russian parliamentarians; and the European Union put penalties on banks, decision-makers and lawmakers involved in the independence recognition and limits on Russia's ability to access EU financial markets and services. ""What's good is that there was unity,"" said Tom Graham, a former State Department and White House National Security official, now with the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Everybody did something. They were coordinated."" But the moves -- particularly from the United States - stopped far short of the most severe sanctions the White House has threatened. It has warned it was preparing to restrict Russians' access to semiconductors; punish Russia's aerospace, defense and high-tech industries; cripple the country's largest financial institutions; and hit even Putin and those around him. ""If Russia invades Ukraine, it would become a pariah to the international community, it would become isolated from global financial markets, and it would be deprived of the most sophisticated technological inputs,"" the White House's top national security official crafting sanctions, Daleep Singh, said Friday. Tuesday's sanctions -- from the U.S. and Europe -- ""were hardly devastating at all,"" Graham said. U.S. officials have for weeks been working to get European allies to act in unison on reacting to Russia. Biden and other top U.S. officials have repeatedly threatened ""swift and severe consequences."" American officials have signaled that there is more agreement with other Western nations on what would happen if Russia carries out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine -- but that if Russia stops short and the world sees other scenarios play out -- like a partial invasion of eastern Ukraine, or solely recognizing the regions' independence, for example -- the kaleidoscope of possible penalties might not come into full harmony.

2022-02-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/americans-care-ukraine-russia-conflict/story?id=82907932,Why Americans should care about the Ukraine-Russia conflict,"After weeks of mounting tensions and warnings from United States officials about an imminent attack, Russia's military launched its invasion of Ukraine early Thursday. Russia has spent weeks building up military forces near eastern Ukraine, amassing more than 150,000 troops in Belarus and on the Russian side of the border, according to U.S. officials, before it invaded, striking several cities and military bases in Ukraine, including Kyiv, its capital. The Kremlin had repeatedly denied warnings of an invasion before Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his intention to conduct a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine Thursday. Leading up to the invasion, Americans were somewhat mixed on how the U.S. should respond. In a recent poll from Quinnipiac University, 57% of Americans said the U.S. should not send troops into Ukraine if Russia invades, and 54% support Biden's decision to deploy troops to support NATO allies. Last week, as U.S. officials continued to warn about an invasion and the escalating conflict, President Joe Biden addressed the American public and again made clear the U.S. will not send troops to support Ukraine. But he promised to defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory, already deploying several thousand more troops to Europe, and to support the Ukrainian people and their government with lethal defensive weapons, economic aid and crippling U.S. and allied sanctions on Russia. In the wake of the invasion, Biden announced new sanctions on Russian banks. That high level of U.S. involvement is necessary, he said, because ""this is about more than just Russia and Ukraine."" ""It's about standing for what we believe in, for the future that we want for our world, for liberty, the right of countless countries to choose their own destiny, and the right of people to determine their own futures, or the principle that a country can't change its neighbor's borders by force,"" Biden said. ""If we do not stand for freedom where it is at risk today, we'll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow."" To understand the United States' vested interest in the conflict, you'd have to go back to the Cold War, Craig Albert, an associate professor of political science and the director of Intelligence and Security Studies at Augusta University, told ABC News. To counter Soviet aggression in Europe, the U.S. helped form the security alliance NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in 1949. In the years since, NATO has expanded several times, including adding three former Soviet republics. Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that is bordered by Russia on the east, is not a NATO member, though in 2008 the alliance opened the door to membership. Putin has demanded this not happen, as he seeks to limit NATO along Russia's border. ""Ukraine has attached itself to the West, to NATO,"" Albert said. ""They still have military agreements, treaties, economic treaties, business treaties or relationships, even though there's no NATO treaty in place between Ukraine and NATO and the U.S."" One previous agreement is the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, reached between the U.S. and Russia in 1994, under which Ukraine would turn over its nuclear weapons stockpile in exchange for security assurances against threats to its territorial integrity and sovereignty, including seeking ""immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine."" Russia would later flout that agreement when it seized Crimea in 2014. The NATO members bordering Russia also present a concern to U.S. officials. The potential impact of the Ukraine conflict on U.S. interests is considered ""significant,"" by the Council on Foreign Relations, which said in part that the conflict ""risks further deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations and greater escalation if Russia expands its presence in Ukraine or into NATO countries."" As Russia tries to ""reassert itself into the great power game,"" the U.S. is seeking to maintain the balance of power in Europe and ""protect Ukraine as a buffer against Russian-perceived aggression in Europe itself,"" Albert said, noting that Ukraine is ""strategically important"" for Russia, the U.S. and NATO. NATO is ""critical to U.S. policy in Europe,"" and supporting Ukraine for the past 30-plus years ""has been integral to U.S. security policy for the European continent as a whole,"" Matthew Pauly, an associate professor of history at Michigan State University who is an expert on Russia, Ukraine and Eastern Europe, told ABC News. ""There's no doubt that the most eastern-facing NATO member states are quite rightly anxious about Russia's actions in Ukraine,"" Pauly said. ""The United States obviously views it as its duty to oblige by the responsibilities of NATO membership to hold the line on the eastern front of NATO."" Indeed, the U.S. had sent in troops amid the Russian aggression to support NATO's eastern flank. On Thursday, Biden announced he was authorizing additional U.S. force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO's response force -- including the 8,500 troops put on ""heightened alert"" last month. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,"" Biden said during an address Thursday. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" The U.S. has sent thousands of additional troops to Central and Eastern Europe in recent weeks, though Biden made it clear he won't be sending any to Ukraine to fight Russia and had stressed the importance of diplomacy toward achieving de-escalation. In an interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt earlier this month, Biden acknowledged the risk of further aggression. When asked what scenario could prompt him to send troops to aid Americans in Ukraine, Biden said, ""There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another."" ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation, and things could go crazy quickly,"" he said. The risk of the conflict escalating beyond Ukraine is ""high,"" Michael ""Mick"" Patrick Mulroy, ABC News national security and defense analyst, said on ABC News Live last week. ""It should be a concern to everybody,"" he said. Another important dimension to U.S. involvement in the crisis has to do with its support of Ukraine as a democracy, Pauly said. Since 1991, when Ukraine declared its independence, the U.S. has offered ""substantial"" foreign aid, particularly in the 1990s, to help it emerge from the Soviet period, democratize and develop a free market economy, he said. ""Ukraine is a democracy, it's the only really functioning democracy of the few in the former Soviet space,"" Pauly said. ""Although democratization has had sort of a challenging path in Ukraine, it's hard to argue that it is not a democracy."" ""Democracy in Ukraine is worth protecting,"" he continued. ""Democracy is our best guarantee against war and best assurance of peace."" The U.S., along with Western allies, has also voiced support for Ukraine maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russian aggression. Biden said the U.S. has been supplying Ukraine's military with arms, training and intelligence to help defend itself. ""Nations have a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the president said last week. ""They have the freedom to set their own course and choose with whom they will associate."" The exact impact of an invasion beyond the front lines remains unclear. Though Biden warned the American people that there would be ""consequences at home"" -- foremost an increase in energy prices as a result. ""I will not pretend this will be painless,"" Biden said last week. ""There could be impact on our energy prices, so we're taking active steps to alleviate the pressure on our own energy markets and offset rising prices."" In an incursion limited to eastern Ukraine, there could be a rise in the price of oil by $5 or $10 a barrel, according to Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy. Currently, a $1 per barrel rise equates to about a 1.5 cents per gallon rise in the national average price of gas. In response to sanctions, Russia, could retaliate by curbing oil exports, he said, impacting global markets. If higher oil and gas prices cause the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in its monetary tightening, that could also impact inflation, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Cyberwarfare also remains a concern. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security warned that the U.S. response to a possible Russian invasion could result in a cyberattack launched against the U.S. by the Russian government or its proxies. Amid increased warnings of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, senior law enforcement and homeland security officials last week urged private industry and state officials to shore up their cyber infrastructure. There's also the impact on American troops, as more military forces are being deployed to support NATO countries. ""I think [Americans] should be paying attention to this because it could significantly affect strategic deployments of U.S. personnel,"" Albert said. ""If nothing else, just people moving from where they are in their typical assignments right now, to move somewhere else, more strategically positioned against, perhaps, a Russian invasion.""

Protesters are demanding action from their local leaders regarding the Russian invasion into Ukraine, which has already claimed dozens of lives. In New York City, hundreds of protesters marched to and gathered at Times Square, the Russian Mission and United Nations buildings in support of Ukraine amid the Russian attacks. The city is home to the largest Ukrainian community in the U.S., with more than 150,000 Ukrainians residing across the region. In Washington, D.C., protesters marched to the White House, as well as to the Russian embassy, to demand action from President Joe Biden. According to Washington ABC affiliate WJLA, a demonstrator painted the word ""murder"" on the sidewalk in front of the embassy building. Protests also took place in Chicago. In London, hundreds of protesters gathered outside Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office and the Russian Embassy carrying Ukrainian flags. Russians, Ukrainians and other protesters joined together in calls against the military invasion. Berlin's most famous landmark, The Brandenburg Gate, was lit in the yellow and blue colors of Ukraine in support of the country under siege. Thousands also marched through the city's streets in support of Ukrainians. In Paris, the City Hall was also lit up in support of Ukraine. Marches also took place throughout the city. In Moscow, anti-war protesters spoke out against their own country, as Russian military forces continued to lay siege to their neighboring country. More than a thousand protesters were arrested in a sign of the totalitarian nature of Russia's government. Protests also broke out in Saint Petersburg.

2022-02-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy/story?id=83085078,What to know about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,"Until his surprise election in 2019, Volodymyr Zelenskyy played a president on TV. Today, the 44-year-old is leading Ukraine as it faces an invasion from Russia, facing a threat to his rule and perhaps his life, from President Vladimir Putin. Addressing Ukrainians on television Thursday, at the end of the first day of the invasion, Zelenskyy said he had information Russia ""has identified me as target No. 1 and my family as No. 2."" ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" the president said in the televised speech. Zelenskyy's life and career have been anything but typical compared to other international leaders, and he has faced a seemingly unending series of crises since taking office. Zelenskyy, who is married and has two children, graduated from the Kyiv National Economic University in 2000 with a law degree, but he decided to pursue a different career. He formed the comedy troupe Kvartal 95 with other actors in 1997 and in 2003, the group began producing television programs. In 2015, Zelenskyy began starring in the role that would set him on the path to the presidency. In the show ""Servant of the People,"" he played Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko, a school teacher who wakes up to find that a rant he made against corrupt politicians went viral and catapulted him to the presidency. Holoborodko was often portrayed as being in over his head, but willing to fight corruption. The show was so popular that it led to Kvartal 95 creating a political party in its name. In 2018, Zelenskyy abruptly moved into real politics and announced his candidacy for president under the Servant of the People party. During his campaign, he continued touring with his troupe and mocked his opponents in stand-up routines. Zelenskyy also took to social media to promote his campaign and platform. His attitude was similar to his TV character as he vowed to crack down on corruption and promote a more centrist administration. He went on to win the election in a landslide, taking over 73% of the vote, after running on a platform to end the war with Russia and its separatist proxies in eastern Ukraine. He was inaugurated in May 2019. Two months later, Zelenskyy would become entangled in a major U.S. scandal involving then-President Donald Trump. News emerged that Trump had called Zelenskyy and pressured him to work with Rudy Giuliani and then-Attorney General William Barr to investigate Joe Biden, who was then running against Trump in the presidential election, and his son Hunter. Trump withheld $400 million in congressional aid to Ukraine when Ukrainian officials didn't comply. Trump denied any wrongdoing, repeatedly saying it was a ""perfect call,"" but a congressional investigation led to Trump's impeachment later that year. He was acquitted in the Senate in February 2020. Zelenskyy has had a more amicable relationship with Biden since he took over the presidency and visited the White House last year. Zelenskyy led his country as COVID-19 ravaged the world. He would test positive for the virus in November and was hospitalized for three days. He came to office promising to find a way to resolve the eight-year conflict in eastern Ukraine with the Russian-controlled separatists there. He initially tried to engage with Putin diplomatically, but was treated coldly by the Russian leader. In the past year, under pressure politically during the COVID-19 crisis, Zelenskyy had taken a harder line against pro-Russian political factions in Ukraine, including Viktor Medvedchuk, known as Putin's man in Ukraine. Russia's military buildup against Ukraine began around the same time Zelenskyy moved to sanction Medvedchuk and TV stations linked to him. He has denied all allegations by Putin and Russian-controlled separatists that he is provoking war and made an impassioned plea in Russian on Feb. 23 for that country's people to reject the aggression. ""We don't need war. Not a cold one, nor a hot one, nor a hybrid one,"" Zelenskyy said during his speech. Putin has claimed his military operation in Ukraine is aimed in part at ""de-Nazification"" of the country, playing on a false narrative that Western-leaning politicians are sympathetic to fascism. Zelenskyy is Jewish and three of his great uncles were killed in the Holocaust. Zelenskyy for now has said he will remain in Kyiv and has continued to post video addresses during the invasion. During his speech on Wednesday, Zelenskyy switched from Ukrainian into Russian, appealing directly to Russians for peace, saying their leadership was leading them into a senseless war. ""I know that Russian TV won't show my speech. But citizens of Russia need to see it. They need to see the truth. The truth is you need to stop before it's too late,"" he said. A few hours later, missile strikes began hitting Kyiv. ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",,,,25
2022-02-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-factors-ukraine-russia-conflict/story?id=83090926,How NATO factors into the Ukraine-Russia conflict,"Ukraine is not a member of NATO, though the international security alliance has been a key player in its ongoing conflict with Russia, which escalated to a full-scale invasion by Russian forces Thursday. Since the United States helped form NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in 1949 to counter Soviet aggression in Europe, the alliance has grown to 30 member countries, including three former Soviet republics -- the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In 2008, NATO appeared to open the door to membership to two more former Soviet republics when its heads of government declared that Georgia and Ukraine ""will become members of NATO."" Neither have formally received a pathway to eventual membership, with corruption concerns and a lack of consensus among members seen in part as holding back Ukraine's invitation. Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that Ukraine never join the alliance as he seeks to limit NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe. Putin's military operation has prompted NATO allies, worried about further escalation, to issue sanctions meant to impact the Russian economy, bolster troops along the alliance's Eastern flank and repeatedly warn that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all. In the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine, President Joe Biden announced that NATO will convene a summit Friday to ""affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO alliance."" Biden has repeatedly said the U.S. won't be sending troops to engage with Russia in Ukraine, though he has recently authorized the deployment of ground and air forces in Europe to support NATO's eastern flank allies -- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania -- in response to Russian aggression. Following Thursday's attack on Ukraine, Biden said he has authorized additional forces to deploy to Germany as part of NATO's response. According to a senior Defense Department official, 7,000 service members will be deployed to Germany in the coming days. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,"" Biden said during an address Thursday. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" During a video address days before he announced a military operation in Ukraine, Putin linked the current crisis directly to Russia's NATO demands, which include a guarantee that NATO stop expanding to the East and pull back its infrastructure from Eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War. He accused the U.S. and NATO of ignoring Russia's demands and blamed the West for the current crisis in Ukraine. The potential impact of the Ukraine conflict on U.S. interests is considered ""significant,"" by the Council on Foreign Relations, which said in part that the conflict ""risks further deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations and greater escalation if Russia expands its presence in Ukraine or into NATO countries."" ""I think we shouldn't get fixated only on Ukraine,"" Doug Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and ABC News contributor, told ABC News Live following Putin's speech. ""[Putin's] ambitions beyond that are to essentially rewind the clock 30 years and reverse the progress made in Western Europe, certainly Central and Eastern Europe, and if possible, break the ties between the United States and its European allies."" Were the conflict to go beyond Ukraine and impact NATO members, that could lead the organization to invoke its mutual self-defense clause -- what's known as Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that ""an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."" If one ally is attacked, the others will respond with necessary action, including armed force, ""to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area."" The first and only time NATO invoked Article 5 was in response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, in support of the U.S. On Thursday, Biden said the U.S. and its NATO allies ""will meet our Article 5 commitments"" if necessary in response to Russian aggression, though they are seeking to deescalate the conflict through increased sanctions. ""If [Putin] did move into NATO countries, we will be involved,"" Biden told reporters. ""The only thing that I am convinced of is -- if we don't stop now, he'll be emboldened. If we don't move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened."" U.S. officials see Article 5 as another deterrent for any further Russian aggression. ""Is it a possibility that Putin goes beyond Ukraine? Sure, it's a possibility, but there's something very powerful standing in the way of that -- that's something we call Article 5 of NATO,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview with ABC's David Muir on Thursday. ""The president's been very clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory. I think that's the most powerful deterrent against President Putin going beyond Ukraine."" One ""gray area"" around NATO's Article 5 response is Russian cyberattacks and their impacts beyond Ukraine, according to U.S. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who oversees the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. ""The real deal is if they suddenly decide to shut down all the power in Ukraine, chances are that may shut down the power in eastern Poland, where American and NATO troops are located,"" Warner told reporters Thursday. ""If they shut down the hospital systems in Poland, and people die because you can't operate, we are suddenly outside of the hypothetical realm of what could constitute what's called an Article 5 violation, where if you attack one NATO nation, you attack all 30 NATO nations. And these hypotheticals become a reality."" If Russia responds to NATO allies' sanctions with cyberattacks, ""we are again going into uncharted territory,"" he said. Last year, NATO said the alliance would consider whether to invoke Article 5 in response to a cyberattack ""on a case-by-case basis."" When asked by ABC White House correspondent MaryAlice Parks on Thursday if the White House thought a cyberattack against a NATO member would trigger an Article 5 response, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that'd be a ""point of discussion."" ""That, again, is up to the NATO alliance to determine, but obviously a cyberattack does constitute an attack, so that would certainly be a point of discussion among the NATO members,"" she said.

Biden said in an address Thursday that NATO would meet to ""affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO alliance."" He also announced escalated sanctions to correspond with the escalated Russian aggression, but not the full economic punishment Ukraine and others have called for and none yet on Putin himself, although he did say that option was ""not a bluff. It's on the table."" ""He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine,"" Biden warned of the Russian leader. ""He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That's what this is about. And I think that his ambitions are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived."" Pressed on why the U.S. hasn't gone further with sanctions, Biden said that some decisions must be made in unison with European allies -- signaling more sanctions may follow Friday's meeting of NATO's 30 member countries. ""The sanctions that we are proposing on all their banks have the equal consequence, maybe more consequence than SWIFT, number one. Number two, it is always an option but right now that's not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,"" Biden said, referring to an international messaging system that allows large financial institutions to send money to each other. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg offered public remarks to open the meeting and was scheduled to hold a news conference at its conclusion, which will be live-streamed on ABC News Live. ""Russia has shattered peace on the European continent,"" he began. ""What we have warned against for months has come to pass, despite all our efforts to find a diplomatic solution. Moscow bears sole responsibility for the deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion."" Stoltenberg said NATO condemns Russia's aggression ""in the strongest possible terms"" and is calling on Russia to ""immediately cease its military action."" ""We stand with the brave people of Ukraine. We fully support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its right of self-defense, and its right to choose its own path,"" he added. Following the meeting, NATO announced it has activated its NATO Response Force (NRF) because of Ukraine -- a significant development as it's the first time that that the alliance has activated the potentially 40,000 man force for ""a deterrence and defence"" role, according to a NATO spokesperson. ""We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance,"" NATO said in a release. The first unit to be deployed will likely be a French and German infantry brigade of 3,500 troops that is always on a heightened state of alert. Then other NATO countries will provide forces, including the U.S. Biden reiterated on Thursday that U.S. troops would not be involved in the fight against Russia in Ukraine, but he did announce that he will deploy more forces to Germany, including some of the 8,500 troops in the U.S. that have been on a ""heightened alert,"" and said he is open to sending additional troops elsewhere in Europe. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,"" Biden said. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power."" Throughout the crisis, Biden has maintained U.S. involvement is about fulfilling a responsibility to defend NATO allies -- and democracy around the world. ""America stands up to bullies,"" Biden said Thursday. ""We stand up for freedom. This is who we are."" ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",,,,27
2022-02-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/economic-sanctions-affect-russia/story?id=83067637,What to know about economic sanctions and how they will affect Russia,"In response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to recognize the separatist-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk regions in Ukraine as ""independent"" states and to attack Ukraine, President Joe Biden announced two waves of sanctions against Russia. Biden on Tuesday initiated sanctions, warning they could grow more severe. After Russia attacked Ukraine, Biden put in place escalated sanctions on Thursday, though not the full economic punishment Ukraine and others have called for including putting sanctions on Putin himself. ""Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" Biden said Thursday. Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian state TV earlier this week that Russia was already ""used to"" sanctions and that it believes more sanctions would be imposed on Moscow regardless of what it does. ""That our [Western] colleagues are trying to push the blame on Russia for the failure of the Minsk agreements, we also understand,"" he said, referring to a truce Ukraine and separatists signed in 2014. ""Our European, American, British colleagues won't stop and won't calm down as long as they haven't exhausted their possibilities for the so-called punishment of Russia."" What are economic sanctions? Economic sanctions are defined by the Council on Foreign Relations as the withdrawal of customary trade and financial relations for foreign and security policy purposes. The sanctions can be comprehensive, which prohibit economic activity with an entire country, or targeted, which block transactions by and with specific individuals, businesses or groups. These restrictions are placed on individuals or entities and prevent them from doing business with the country imposing those sanctions. Sanctions put in place by the U.S. government cut off an individual or entities from the American financial system, meaning they can no longer do business in the U.S. and all their assets under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen. Americans and American businesses are also prohibited from doing business with these institutions, unless authorized by the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Sanctions aim to impair the ability of the person or entity from being able to perform basic functions in the international financial system. They are used by the U.S. government depending on foreign policy and national security goals. What sanctions did the US impose on Russia? New sanctions were placed on Russia's biggest banks on Thursday, accounting for nearly 80% of all the banking assets in Russia, according to the Department of Treasury. The new sanctions also targeted Russian elites and families and restrict Russia's ability to raise funds by adding additional prohibitions related to new debt and equity of major Russian state-owned enterprises and large privately owned financial institutions. The U.S. also on Thursday put in place export controls in an effort to block Russia from being able to import technologies like semiconductors or software, which it needs to build out high-tech industries and the military. The U.S. sought to block Russia from importing these technologies manufactured anywhere in the world, so long as they contain American-developed components. ""There aren't a lot of semiconductors in the world that don't have an American component,"" said Tom Graham, an expert on Russia at the Council on Foreign Relations, to ABC News. This follows an initial wave of sanctions placed on two Russian state-owned financial institutions and five Kremlin-connected elite on Tuesday, which targeted the Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, which is known as Vnesheconombank (VEB), and Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company (PSB), along with 42 of their subsidiaries. These sanctions, which targeted institutions specific to raising funds and Russia's defense sector, instead of institutions that ordinary Russians use, were not the most severe option available. This was a tactic, according to Julia Friedlander, a former Treasury Department official who worked on sanctions policy. ""The idea is that you can't blow all your options at once,"" Friedlander, who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said earlier this week. ""If you blow all your fire now, then what is Russia's incentive to hold back?"" According to the U.S. Treasury Department, VEB is crucial to Russia's ability to raise funds, and PSB is critical to Russia's defense sector. The two institutions and their subsidiaries hold combined assets worth tens of billions of dollars. ""Today's action constrains Russia's ability to finance defense-related contracts and raise new funds to finance its campaign against Ukraine,"" the Department of Treasury said in a statement Tuesday. VEB, which finances Russia's national economic development, has an asset portfolio of $53 billion, making it one of Russia's top five financial institutions, according to the Treasury Department. Some of VEB's sanctioned subsidiaries include banks and other financial firms, electronic component producers and a coal mining group in Russia and three other countries. PSB, Russia's eighth-largest bank, was designated by the government to finance the Russian Ministry of Defense and defense sector, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. It services nearly 70% of Russia's defense contracts and provides banking and personal finance to Russian military personnel. Influential Russians and their family members who are in Putin's inner circle and believed to be participating in the Russian regime's ""kleptocracy"" -- including the chairman and CEO of PSB -- were also sanctioned, the Department of Treasury said. Will the sanctions have an effect? The U.S. and its allies went after Russia's biggest banks in the second wave of sanctions announced Thursday, which would leave a greater impact on its economy, experts told ABC News. ""The bottom line is that these sanctions will have a significant impact on Russia's overall economy, and average Russians will feel the cost,"" Clay Lowery, executive vice president for the Institute of International Finance (IIF), a trade association that represents global banks, said in a statement Thursday. ""These sanctions target Russia's domestic financial system, causing bank runs and forcing Russia's central bank to continue hiking rates."" The U.S. said it wanted to minimize the impact of sanctions on ordinary Russians, putting less severe restrictions on the country's largest bank, Sberbank, which handles a lot of pensions and salaries. The ordinary Russian won't be as directly impacted, but they will likely suffer from the many effects of a weakened economy. ""The whole idea is to destabilize the economy financially,"" said Maria Shagina, a sanctions expert at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. ""The indirect impact will reverberate through the whole system."" Jeffrey Schott, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said the export controls are a significant step meant to ""degrade"" Russia's economy over the long-term. ""Those export controls won't have an immediate impact on Russian capabilities,"" he said. ""They will have a corrosive effect on the development and growth of Russian industry and military. The damage builds up over time."" Schott said this is a strategy that has worked during the trade war between the U.S. and China in 2019. The U.S. imposed export controls on Chinese tech giant Huawei, which has been successful in hampering the company's access parts to make smartphones and other technologies. Russia has been preparing for sanctions, said Andrew Lohsen, a former officer with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, earlier this week. Sberbank has reportedly been testing its ability to survive without access to Western software. It also has hundreds of billions in foreign currency reserves and in a national wealth fund. ""The Russian economy has worked to sanction-proof itself since 2014,"" Lohsen, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told ABC News. ""But at the end of the day, my concern is that Russia will just force its citizens to tighten its belts and will just proceed with this empire building project that it's set for itself in Ukraine."" He questioned whether the limited sanctions put in place earlier this week will be enough to deter Russia. ""Can anything deter Putin,"" he said, ""short of return fire?""

2022-02-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/questions-ukraine-russia-conflict-answered/story?id=83085067,"Questions about the Ukraine-Russia conflict, answered","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday launched an all-out military assault on Ukraine after weeks of denying ""hysteria"" from the West about the possibility of a Russian invasion. Despite calling the attack a ""special military operation"" in the eastern Donbas region, bombing campaigns began across almost the entirety of Ukraine, including near the capital of Kyiv, and Russian forces crossed borders from three sides of Ukraine, including Russian-occupied Crimea to the south and Ukraine's neighbor Belarus to the north. Putin claimed Russia's plans did not include occupying Ukraine, while warning other countries not to interfere or ""face consequences greater than any you have faced in history."" This is not the first time in recent years that Russia has invaded Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. In 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Here's what we know and don't: Why is Putin invading Ukraine? In December, the Kremlin published two draft treaties laying out its demands as it massed troops and weaponry around Ukraine. Chief among them were ""security guarantees"" that NATO bar Ukraine from membership and that the western military alliance (which started as a collective security pact against the Soviet Union) pull back its forces from Eastern European member states. But in a ranting speech Monday night, Putin went further, laying out his false pretext for an invasion by questioning Ukraine's legitimacy as a country and even claiming it needed to be liberated from Nazis and pro-Nazi people. Putin also signaled he sees the current democratically elected government in Ukraine as criminal. In addition, Putin used his speech Monday night to lament the end of the Soviet Union and claim that the countries created from Soviet republics weren't really independent. That led President Joe Biden and other world leaders to accuse Putin of trying to reestablish a Soviet empire -- something Putin denied the next day. While it's impossible to see inside Putin's mind, those stated concerns have proven false. On Tuesday, he warned Russia was ready to provide ""military assistance"" to the two Russian-created separatist republics in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. But his assault on Ukraine hit targets far beyond those tiny separatist areas, where Russian forces have been covertly stationed since 2014. ""This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin's desire for empire by any means necessary,"" Biden said Thursday. Who is involved? Russia had been holding huge joint military exercises within Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, in the weeks leading up to the invasion -- while scoffing at concerns they would be used for an invasion. On Thursday, Russian and Belarusian forces attacked Ukraine from the north. Other states, including the U.S. and European Union countries, had been attempting to resolve the conflict diplomatically. For weeks, the U.S., NATO, France, Germany, and others engaged in talks with Russia, while threatening heavy sanctions for any invasion and arming Ukraine with defensive lethal weapons. But Biden and other Western leaders have made clear they will not deploy troops to Ukraine to support its military. Still, a U.S. official told ABC News that surrounding nations are worried they will be overwhelmed with refugees fleeing Ukraine. Those surrounding nations include Poland, a NATO ally. The Baltic States -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- also border Russia to the west and are members of NATO. Should Russia invade any of them, as some fear, the United States has said it will uphold NATO's Article 5, which says an attack on any NATO country is an attack on them all and necessitates a military response. ""The United States, together with our allies, will defend every inch of NATO territory,"" Biden said Tuesday. Biden has deployed thousands of U.S. troops to Europe, including the Baltics, to reassure allies of that promise. What do we know about the separatists? Putin recognized two Moscow-backed rebel regions within eastern Ukraine as independent states. The two self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk want to control the whole of eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, while they only held one-third of it before the Russian invasion. The Russian-controlled separatists claimed they were under attack by Ukraine and were in need of military assistance from Russia ""in repulsing Ukrainian aggression."" Many of these so-called aggressions have been exposed as false flag attacks, and called out as such by the U.S. government and allies. Before pulling out its personnel, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's war monitor reported an exponential increase in shelling and other attacks, but made clear it was largely from the separatists' territory. How are the U.S. and its allies responding? Biden announced sanctions against Russian elites and their families and four financial institutions on Thursday, as well as export controls that block key materials like semiconductors for Russia's defense and high-tech industries. Two days earlier, Biden unveiled sanctions on two smaller Russian banks and a first group of oligarchs, warning Putin not to attack or face these harsher punishments -- a threat that was ignored. The U.K. on Thursday announced severe sanctions against more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, including freezing the assets of all major Russian banks and moving to exclude them from the U.K.'s financial system. The European Union also hit Russia with sanctions, including freezing assets. The G-7 countries released a joint statement on Thursday condemning Russia's military aggressions and announcing it will adopt ""severe"" coordinated sanctions. Several members, like Japan and Canada, announced their own, while other nations like South Korea, Australia, and Taiwan have joined, too. The U.S. also sanctioned 24 Belarusian officials, businesspeople, defense agencies and firms, state-owned companies and banks and financial institutions in response to ""Belarus's support for, and facilitation of"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Treasury Department said in a statement. What's at stake? At least 137 people have been killed so far and several hundred have been injured, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As the conflict continues to unfold, many Ukrainians will likely be forced to leave their country en masse, becoming refugees. There also may be large numbers of casualties. Russian troops reportedly took full control of the area around the Chernobyl nuclear power station, including the plant itself, on Thursday, according to Ukraine's prime minister. The zone is about 60 miles north of Kyiv. The destroyed Chernobyl reactor itself is sealed under a giant containment shield, a stadium-sized metal structure that was built over it and completed a few years ago. But the biggest stakes are the rules-based order and general respect for sovereignty in Europe that has helped prevent all-out war for decades, potentially providing a playbook for further land grabs from Putin or other strongmen around the world.",,,,17

A defiant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, surrounded by his advisers and wearing combat fatigues, addressed the country while standing outside his office on the streets of central Kyiv. ""We are all here. Our military are here, as are our people and whole society,"" Zelenskyy said in a selfie-style video posted to Facebook Friday. ""We're all here defending our independence and our country. And we'll go on doing that. Glory to our defenders! Glory to Ukraine."" Hours later, Zelenskyy warned during a televised address that he believed Russian troops would storm the capital overnight. “The night will be more difficult than the day,” he said, as the sound of shelling and loud booms from airstrikes could be heard over Kyiv. ""We cannot lose Kyiv,"" he said. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv and a legendary boxer, also said he will stand and fight for his city alongside his brother Wladimir, also a former heavyweight champion boxer. ""I don't have another choice,"" Vitali told ""Good Morning Britain"" on Thursday. ""Words are followed by missiles and tanks. Destruction and death come upon us. ... We will defend ourselves with all our might and fight for freedom and democracy,"" Wladimir wrote on Linkedin Thursday. Several members of Ukraine's parliament said they were remaining in the city and prepared to defend themselves as Russia's military continued its attack. ""I'm at the center of Kyiv and I will remain here,"" Kira Rudik, the leader of the political party Holos, told CNN Friday. ""I'm a member of parliament and the leader of the party. It is my duty to be here,"" she said. Rudik said she could hear airstrikes as she spoke to CNN, and that she has had to hide in a bomb shelter multiple times since the Russian military launched its attack on Ukraine Thursday morning. ""There is lots of stress and it is not really helping the morale of the people, being under the airstrikes all the time,"" she said. Rudik said she was prepared to ""bear arms,"" and that she and members of her ""crew"" had received Kalashnikov assault rifles ""so we will be able to resist if Russian forces will come to Kyiv."" Parliament member Sviatoslav Yurash said in an interview with BBC Radio 4 Friday morning he was ""looking at my AK-47 in front of me"" as Russian troops closed in on Kyiv. ""We are giving anyone who wants to help Ukraine fight a chance to do that,"" he said. ""We are arming people who will be taking that fight to the Russians in every way."" Yurash said the nation of some 40 million people is ""not going to just stand idly by,"" even as it faces a more powerful military. ""We will fight with everything we have and all the support that the world can provide us,"" he said. A past Ukrainian leader also appeared ready to defend the capital. Former President Petro Poroshenko spoke to CNN Friday from the streets of Kyiv with a Kalashnikov in hand. He said they didn't have any heavy artillery, tanks or enough arms for the ""long line of people"" volunteering to join Ukraine's civilian territorial defense battalion, but he believed that they could hold out against the Russian aggression ""forever."" ""I think that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin never will catch Ukraine ... no matter how many soldiers he has, how many missiles he has, how many nuclear weapons he has,"" Poroshenko said. ""We Ukrainian are a free people with a great European future."" The businessman served as president of Ukraine from 2014 to 2019, when he was defeated by Zelenskyy. Poroshenko returned to Kyiv from Poland last month amid escalating tensions with Russia to face allegations of high treason, which he has denied. ""I will return to Ukraine to fight for Ukraine,"" he told reporters last month. In his latest televised address Friday, Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to ""stand firm this night."" ""The fate of Ukraine is at stake right now,"" the president said. ""Everyone capable of defending -- please help our military. Burn down enemy's tanks and armor with whatever means."" ""The night ahead will be hard, very tough,"" he continued. ""But there will be dawn after it."" The warning came as Ukrainian and Russian government officials were working to arrange possible negotiations to end the fighting, a spokesman for Zelenskyy told ABC News.

2022-02-26,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-work-allies-collectively-isolate-russia-analysis/story?id=83088984,How the US could work with its allies to collectively isolate Russia: ANALYSIS,"As Russian President Vladimir Putin's military forces invade the sovereign nation of Ukraine, many nations will look for ways to respond forcefully to immediately treat Russia as a pariah state on par with Bashar Assad's Syria and Kim Jong Un's North Korea. While the United States said it will not engage Russia directly on the battlefield in Ukraine with U.S. troops, one strategy it could take is to mobilize allies to collectively isolate Russia in all ways possible -- economically, diplomatically and through ""gray-zone"" activities like cyber or information warfare -- to make Putin understand that this invasion will not stand and that his decision was a grave mistake. The goal here would be to make Putin and his backers feel enough pain to force them to abandon their intent to annex Ukraine. Pressure can also be applied through all these means to turn Russian citizens completely against this effort to the point that Putin worries about simply retaining his power domestically. The U.S. is already working to implement severe sanctions. That's an important first step. The U.S. and its allies will look to isolate Russia economically, including by cutting Russia out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) banking network and ensuring the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline remains off. While Russia has bolstered its currency reserves in anticipation of this sort of moment, the economic results of this strategy could spark discontent among the Russian people about Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which has already sparked protests despite the strong risk of arrest. Certainly, Putin will use Russian propaganda to point the blame back at the West for a weakening of the Russian economy. But, the United States can make it clear to the Russian people that Putin has the power to end sanctions affecting their everyday lives by reversing course. Perhaps more importantly, the sanctions will seek to hit Russian oligarchs hard. These powerful tycoons are keeping Putin in power. Cutting off their international trade and seizing their assets will make them question whether they want to continue supporting his rule. Along with economic isolation, another strategy would be to cut off Russia from the world. The U.S. could pressure allies around the world to expel Russian diplomats and shutter their embassies. The Czech Republic has already set a precedent by closing Russian consulates on Czech territory and sending their diplomats home. Further, the U.S. and its allies can stop issuing visas to Russian nationals. Russian citizens would not be permitted to travel into or through their countries. This travel ban will continue to demonstrate that the West will cut Russia off from the world until Putin abandons his conquest of Ukraine. That said, diplomatic discussions could remain a possibility, since this conflict will not end through Western military intervention. This includes retaining back-channel diplomatic talks through a government like Austria in order to work with our allies on finding a way forward. The U.S. could also work with our NATO allies to ensure NATO members in Eastern Europe are protected from further Russian incursion. NATO, led by the U.S., could send additional forces to Eastern Europe and begin plans to permanently station them there. Putin worries about being surrounded by NATO. This action seeks to show him that his unlawful aggression has, in fact, strengthened NATO and he has essentially caused everything he claimed to be concerned about. Nonetheless, Putin controls one of the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons. The goal would be to not escalate to the point where U.S. and Russian forces are facing off. That said, the U.S. can provide military assistance to the democratically-elected Ukrainian government fighting off an invasion of their sovereign lands. The United States and its NATO allies can accordingly send additional arms immediately for Ukraine to fight off the invading Russian forces. It's unclear at the moment just how far Putin will push forward his troops. If they are successful in capturing all or part of Ukraine militarily, resistance groups will start to fight the Russian occupiers. American special operations and intelligence officers have an extensive knowledge base from 20 years of fighting insurgencies in places like Afghanistan. They can work with Ukrainians to support a fierce and effective resistance movement. As part of this effort, the U.S. and its NATO allies would provide weapons, ammunition, medical, intelligence and financing support to these insurgent movements. The Ukrainian resistance will also need a safe haven for a base of their operations. The U.S. and the rest of NATO would work with Poland and Moldova to support this effort. The U.S. can also lead the fight in another critical domain: information warfare. For too long, we have endured relentless propaganda targeting American (and Ukrainian) citizens in every aspect of civil society. We can break out of our traditional bureaucratic process to more effectively respond, counter and present our own messages as the leaders of the free world. Again, the goal is to further create dissent internally within Russia that makes Putin focus on his own country and abandon his external ambitions. In line with this, the United States can endeavor to find ways to creatively bolster its support for Russian civil society and fund Russian opposition movements. Carefully targeted cyber attacks within Russia can also be considered if Russia attacks us via these means. These types of gray-zone activities are not without risk. Cyberwarfare, for example, may have unforeseen consequences as much of our critical infrastructure is on systems that were designed before this form of warfare was considered. The tactics to isolate Russia also may not have the immediate desired effect, such as the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. Nonetheless, the U.S. faces a moral obligation to do what we can to support the Ukrainian people.

2022-02-26,https://abcnews.go.com/International/fears-growing-refugee-crisis-europe-loom-amid-russias/story?id=83085068,Fears of a growing refugee crisis in Europe loom amid Russia’s attack on Ukraine,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine is forcing many Ukrainians to leave their homes to seek shelter, with long lines already forming at the border and the potential for severe humanitarian consequences looming. More than 50,000 Ukrainians left the country within less than 48 hours, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said on Friday. The majority have fled to Poland and Moldova, he said. The U.N. refugee agency estimates that some 100,000 Ukrainians have already been forced from their homes, UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told ABC News, cautioning that the agency does not have exact numbers. “But there clearly has been significant displacement inside the country and some movements towards and across the borders,” she said. In a statement, Grandi said the consequences for this invasion will be devastating. ""The humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war, but countless lives will be torn apart,"" Grandi said. USAID also activated a disaster assistance response team to Poland ""to respond to growing humanitarian needs stemming from Russia's unprovoked and unjustified further invasion of Ukraine,"" the agency announced. The agency said it will coordinate U.S. disaster response to the potential refugee crisis and the humanitarian needs in Ukraine. Experts say the longer the conflict carries on, the greater the crisis could become. The crisis is likely to start out as an internal displacement of people, as Russian troops continue to make advances into Ukraine, Serena Parekh, a professor of philosophy at Northeastern University and a researcher who focuses on the displacement of refugees, told ABC News. ""That refers to the people who have just left their homes gotten in their car, they're driving somewhere anywhere, just to get out of the conflict,"" Parekh said. ""That's going to be the first crisis."" The ability of international organizations to continue working in Ukraine, or whether they themselves will become targets, will also play a role in the internal crisis, experts say. Attacks on non-military locations happened in Ukraine in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, leaving 1.4 million people in internal displacement, Daniel Balson, an advocacy director at Amnesty International, told ABC News. Balson said Amnesty International has recorded three attacks in Ukraine involving the usage of explosive weapons with wide area affects in densely populated areas, including a hospital (which is protected under international law) and a residential block. ""This is becoming part of a pattern. And that pattern demonstrates a blatant disregard for the lives of civilians by using these indiscriminate weapons and heavily densely populated areas,"" Balson said. ""Ukraine has about 40 million people in there. I mean, we're talking about very large numbers of people who are impacted and affected,"" he said. Parekh said if the conflict continues, the crisis could likely move out of Ukraine and into neighboring countries. ""Secondarily, people will start crossing borders into Eastern Europe, in particular Poland. And the rate and the exact numbers remain to be seen,"" Parekh said. Neighboring countries are bracing for an influx of Ukrainians fleeing the conflict. ""Poland has said they're prepared to take upwards of a million refugees, which is great, in some sense, because the change in attitude towards Ukrainian refugees as compared to the Syrian refugees that were coming into Bella Luce last year, is very, very striking,"" Parekh said. ""It's not clear that they actually have the capacity to take that many refugees,"" she said. ""In 2021, they only took in 5,000 Refugees in total. So it's a huge leap from that to say that they are preparing to take in a million refugees."" Parekh said that countries that share a border with Ukraine, including Poland, Hungry and Romania, will likely need a lot of support from the international community in order to be able to accommodate what could be hundreds of thousands of people crossing their borders. The problem with supporting refugees is not one of ""technical capacity,"" Balson said. ""It's often a problem with political will. When a government decides what it will concentrate its resources on, it's imperative that supporting refugees be at the top of that list. Has this always been the case in the past? No,"" Balson said. He said the international community has shown some positive signs, with border countries like Poland saying they will keep their borders open. Parekh said it is likely there will be a lot of sympathy toward Ukrainian refugees for several reasons including the fact that they are fleeing a common enemy and the fact that Ukrainians are white, largely Christian and seen as Europeans. ""There's racism that prevents all people from being treated equally, but there's also a sense in which humans seem to have a natural tendency to be sympathetic to people they perceive to be like them in some significant way,"" Parekh said. The international community has tended to downplay the risk of refugee crises stemming from previous conflicts until it was unavoidable, but that does not seem to be the case with Ukraine, Parekh said. ""The language that people are using to talk about the Ukrainian crisis right now is great and it shows a readiness and a willingness to acknowledge the strong likelihood that this war will produce substantial refugee crisis,"" Parekh said.",,,,2
2022-02-27,https://abcnews.go.com/International/swift-called-nuclear-option-russian-sanctions/story?id=83131068,What is SWIFT and why it's being called the 'nuclear' option for Russian sanctions,"As Western allies levy increasingly harsher economic sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, the latest target involves Russia's access to SWIFT. An acronym for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT is a messaging system founded in 1973 that allows large financial institutions to send money to each other. The Belgian-based cooperative is used by more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories, including Russia. It handles 42 million messages a day, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of transactions. Russia accounted for 1.5% of SWIFT transactions in 2020, according to the Financial Times. The White House announced Saturday evening that the U.S. will be disconnecting some Russian banks from SWIFT in partnership with the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada and are ""imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions."" ""This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,"" the White House said in a statement. A senior White House official told reporters Saturday that the European Union will finalize which specific banks are cut off from SWIFT, since it is under Belgian jurisdiction. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has repeatedly called for Russia to be excluded from the network for its aggression against Ukraine. ""Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from SWIFT has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too,"" he tweeted Thursday in the wake of Russia's invasion. Some experts believe that sanctioning banks in the way the U.S. and allies have done so far is an effective way of freezing Russian assets. If there is no money to move, the messaging system becomes moot. Also, European countries will likely face a negative impact on their own economies from SWIFT sanctions. Germany, in particular, had been a holdout due to its reliance on Russian gas and oil supplies. The full consequences of such a sanction are hard to forecast, and it's unclear how many Russian banks are impacted. A total ban of Russia from SWIFT, which uses the dollar as the reserve currency, could weaken the dollar as a reserve currency and thus impact the global economic dominance of the U.S. The senior White House official said Saturday officials are trying to minimize the impact of the latest restrictions on other economies. For days, world leaders have debated what French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire reportedly referred to as a ""financial nuclear weapon"" Friday. EU finance ministers said in a statement Friday that ""all options are on the table"" as they weighed further financial sanctions against Russia. On Thursday, President Joe Biden said the sanctions on Russian banks may have ""more consequence than SWIFT,"" though also noted ""it is always an option."" On Saturday, prior to the White House's announcement on disconnecting ""selected"" Russian banks from SWIFT, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated in an address that Western countries had come to an agreement on SWIFT sanctions. ""For Russia it will mean being cut off [from] normal financial civilization,"" he said. ""This is a big diplomatic victory. Russia will suffer billions upon billions of financial losses -- their price for invasion."" In a Facebook post earlier Saturday, Kuleba said the official decision had not yet been made, but the ""technical preparation for the decision and the implementation of this sanction has already begun."" Being cut off from SWIFT will make it harder for Russian entities to process transactions and do business beyond its borders. Russia does have its own messaging system that it could use in tandem with China, though it would not be easy to switch over from SWIFT.

2022-02-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-allies-bar-russian-central-bank-accessing-reserves/story?id=83155896,US and allies bar Russian Central Bank from accessing reserves worldwide,"The Biden administration on Monday emphasized the drastic nature of economic sanctions levied again Russia over the weekend in which the U.S. and allies targeted Russia's Central Bank, preventing the Kremlin from accessing any of its more than $600 billion in reserves in the U.S., or in U.S. dollars in foreign countries. The sanctions also target Russia's National Wealth Fund and the Ministry of Finance, and officials said it was clear from the beginning of the Ukraine invasion that Russian President Vladimir Putin was planning to use Central Bank assets to mitigate the impact of sanctions. ""Today's announcement that prohibit transactions with the Central Bank of Russia in the National Wealth Fund will significantly hinder their ability to do that, and inhibit their access to hundreds of billions of dollars in assets from our actions alone, they will not be able to access assets that are either in United States are in U.S. dollars,"" officials told reporters. ""This fund and its leadership are symbols of deep-seated Russian corruption and influence-peddling globally … and it's known to be intimately connected to kleptocracy at the highest levels of the Russian government,"" an official added. ""Our strategy -- to put it simply -- is to make sure that the Russian economy goes backwards, as long as President Putin decides to go forward with his invasion of Ukraine,"" a senior administration official said. Officials explained the sanctions -- a major step for the Biden administration -- were announced over the weekend when it became clear it was necessary to move before the markets opened Monday. ""We learned over the course of the weekend from our allies and partners was the Russian Central Bank was attempting to move assets and there would be a great deal of assets starting on Monday morning from institutions around the world. So, we took these that we're taking these actions in a way that they will be effective immediately,"" an official said. Officials said the ""actions represent the most significant actions the U.S. Treasury has taken against an economy of this size, and assets of this size,"" noting the Russian Central Bank is many times larger than Iran's or Venezuela's. Officials wouldn't specify how much of the $630 billion ""rainy-day fund"" would be affected, but noted the U.S. knows that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation has its assets diversified around the world. ""What we've done today is not only preventing them from using those dollars in the United States, but preventing them from being able to use those dollars in other places like Europe or Japan to defend their currency and prop up their institutions. And our - our goal was to make sure that not only would they not have access to dollars, but also not have access to other currencies,"" an official said. The U.S. Treasury said in a statement its move ""effectively immobilizes any assets"" of Russia's Central Bank and ""will disrupt Russia's attempts to prop up its rapidly depreciating currency."" One analyst said this will have more impact than denying Russia access to the SWIFT international banking system. This is ""sanctions action without precedent,"" according to analyst Eddie Fishman, who said it ""renders ALL of Russian government's rainy-day funds inert."" In a statement, Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the action was being taken in coordination with European allies. Another analyst said the speed at which the European Union and U.S. have acted, and in lockstep, has been remarkable given the technical and complex nature of the new sanctions. ""You can't imagine how hard it is to manage these various moves, which have to balance different legal structures and traditions, national economic needs and capabilities, and complex international relationships. It is truly impressive how well stitched up this has been, even if you can occasionally see the seams,"" tweeted Richard Nephew, a sanctions expert at Columbia University who left the Biden administration's Iran talks team last month. On the energy front, administration officials said they have multiple interests in keeping energy out of the sanctions packages for now: ""A -- because we want to support the global economic recovery, but B -- because we don't want prices to spike for the benefit of President Putin as a major energy exporter."" Officials said over the long term, the U.S. and allies will look to degrade Russia's capacity to be a leading energy supplier, perhaps working to keep it from developing energy technologies.

2022-02-28,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-mounting-stiff-resistance-inflicting-painful-casualties-russia/story?id=83145245,"Ukraine mounting stiff resistance, inflicting painful casualties on Russia","KYIV -- There is growing evidence that Ukraine is managing to inflict significant casualties on Russian forces as they try to advance deeper into the country -- and that the swift strike Russia hoped to carry out on the capital, Kyiv, has been slowed by intense and popular resistance. Russia hasn't managed to make significant progress in the last two days. The main Russian force pushing down from Belarus towards Kyiv does not appear to have advanced closer towards the city since coming within about 20 miles, although smaller advanced groups have been fighting gun battles with Ukrainian forces inside the capital since at least Friday. Ukraine's military claims the Russian troops are struggling with fuel and logistics supplies. Images and videos of destroyed Russian military vehicles and tanks, which have been verified, have been circulating online. One example of the effective Ukrainian resistance took place Sunday when Russia appeared to mount a half-hearted attempt to destroy resistance in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv. Russian special forces units in light armored vehicles tried to push into Kharkiv after indiscriminately bombarding the city with artillery, but they were rapidly destroyed by Ukrainian troops and volunteer territorial defense, according to videos posted online. Kharkiv's Mayor Oleg Sinegubov on Sunday night pushed a triumphant message, saying that ""control over Kharkiv is completely ours"" and that Ukrainian forces had succeeded ""in a full clearing of the city of the enemy."" Sinegubov said dozens of Russian troops had surrendered with little fight, sometimes in whole groups of five to 10 men, with some abandoning their equipment. A number of military analysts -- including those that correctly predicted the invasion -- believed Russia had hoped for a lightning ""shock and awe"" advance to the edge of Kyiv in the first days that would lead to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government surrendering without Russia needing to actually seize the city. Instead, the resistance is growing, officials said. ""It is clear they hoped to get Zelenskyy to surrender quickly without inflicting heavy casualties on the Ukrainian military [and] civilians. That failed, but their execution still appears to be fairly restrained,"" Rob Lee, analyst from Kings College London's War Department, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Lee said that strategy had now failed, and that Russia would have to move to a plan B, which he feared would mean ""more force."" Time is working against Russia. Ukrainian popular resistance is gaining in self-confidence, and the Russian piecemeal strategy so far has allowed cities more time to set up defenses, putting in place barricades and distributing thousands of weapons. In Berdyansk, the only major city Russia has gained full control of, videos posted to social media Monday showed a crowd of residents angrily chanting a slogan insulting President Vladimir Putin at Russian troops guarding a government building on the main square. At the same time, the international response is also growing, with more sanctions and moves aimed at crippling Russia's economy, while European countries are sending more and more weapons to bolster the Ukrainian defense, with the European Union also announcing that for the first time it would provide Ukrainian officials with military support. Russia has so far held back its main army and has been using its air and artillery power against military targets, avoiding widespread, intense bombardment against civilian areas. Analysts, including Lee, said Russia appeared to have initially sought to inflict limited casualties on Ukrainian civilians and the military, likely out of concern about backlash in Russia and making it harder to achieve a swift political change in Ukraine, as well as a stronger international reaction. U.S. officials and independent analyst now fear if Russia's attempt to overpower Ukraine quickly fails, it may turn to using more brute force to achieve it. That could mean unleashing indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes to destroy Ukraine's military and terrorize civilians, as well as besieging cities. That already appears to be happening in Kharkiv, where Russia in the last two days has fired heavy artillery, including ""Grad"" multiple rocket launchers onto the city, causing significant damage to civilian buildings. ""I think today we've seen a shift in Russian targeting towards critical civilian infrastructure, greater use of MLRS, and artillery in suburban areas. Unfortunately, my concern that this was going to get a lot more ugly and affect civilians is starting to materialize,"" Michael Kofman, an analyst at CNA, who also predicted the invasion as likely, tweeted late Saturday. U.S. officials caution, though, that Russia still has major combat power yet to be deployed, with roughly half its forces massed near Ukraine still not engaged. A massive 3-mile-long column of hundreds of vehicles has formed up in northern Ukraine after crossing from Belarus and appears to be moving towards Kyiv.",,,,28
2022-02-28,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-agrees-meet-russia-belarus-border/story?id=83144588,Ukraine and Russia meet at Belarus border but no ceasefire agreement reached,"Delegations from Ukraine and Russia held talks Monday morning on Belarus' border in an attempt to end Moscow's invasion as Russian troops continue to attack. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to send a delegation to meet with Russian negotiators during a phone call Sunday with Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine's president's office announced. The two sides began talks Monday at the Pripyat River on the border, north of Chernobyl, the spokesperson said, an area that is currently under Russian military control. Roughly six hours after the talks began, they ended with both sides reporting back to officials in their respective capital cities ahead of a possible second-round to talks. ""The Ukrainian and Russian delegations held the first round of talks today, the main purpose of which was to discuss the issues of a ceasefire on the territory of Ukraine and hostilities. The parties identified a number of priority topics on which certain decisions were outlined,"" Mikhail Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement following Monday's talks. Podolyak added, ""In order for these decisions to get some opportunities for implementation, logistical solutions, the parties leave for consultations in their capitals. The parties discussed the possibility of holding a second round of negotiations in the near future, at which these topics will receive concrete development practice."" Ukraine has said the key issue for the talks is an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops. Russia has signaled it wants to discuss Ukraine adopting ""neutral status."" The Ukrainian delegation included Podolyak; David Arahamiya, a member of the Servant of the People political faction; Oleksiy Reznikov, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine; Andriy Kostin, the first deputy dead of the Ukrainian Delegation to the Tripartite Contact Group; Rustem Umerov, a member of the Parliament of Ukraine; and Deputy Foreign Minister Mykola Tochytsky. Russia's delegation includes officials from the foreign and defense ministries and presidential administration. The talks are the first between the two sides since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion on Thursday, but Zelenskyy, in a televised address, said he had little hope of a breakthrough. ""I will be honest, as always: I do not really believe in the outcome of this meeting, but let them try,"" Zelenskyy said. He added that if there was a ""chance"" to end the war, he should take part in the talks. As the talks got underway, French President Emmanuel Macron and Putin spoke by phone. According to Macron's office, Putin purportedly agreed to halt all strikes against civilian targets, preserve civilian infrastructure and secure main roads, in particular, the road south of Kyiv. During the call, Macron reiterated a request of the international community to end the Russian offensive against Ukraine and reaffirmed the need to implement an immediate ceasefire. Macron also called on Putin to respect international humanitarian law and the protection of civilian populations as well as the delivery of aid in accordance with a resolution brought by France to the United Nations Security Council. According to a readout of the call released by the Kremlin, Putin told Macron Russia is open to negotiations with Ukrainian representatives and expects the talks will lead to the ""desired results."" During the call, Putin denied that Russian forces are attacking civilian targets, according to the Kremlin's readout. The two leaders agreed to speak again in the coming days. Ukraine had earlier rejected a proposal from Russia to hold the talks in the southern Belarusian city of Gomel, on the grounds that Belarus is directly involved in Russia's attack, having hosted the Russian invasion force that is now moving south on Ukraine's capital Kyiv and letting Russia fire missiles from its territory. The Kremlin has signaled it wants to hold talks where Zelenskyy will discuss ""neutral status"" for Ukraine, in effect hoping to negotiate Kyiv's terms of surrender. But Zelenskyy's administration has said while it wants talks to end the killing in Ukraine, it will not make concessions. ""We will not surrender, we will not capitulate, we will not give up a single inch of our territory,"" Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, said at a press conference. While brokering the meeting, Zelenskyy said Lukashenko has promised that no missiles or aircraft would carry out strikes on Ukraine while the negotiations were underway. But in an unpromising sign for the talks, Ukrainian officials said Belarus had launched at least two Iskander ballistic missiles at Ukraine on Sunday after the agreement to meet was reached. It was also Lukasheko who suggested that Russian and Ukrainian delegations meet at the Belarus-Ukraine border, Zelenskyy said, adding that though he is not optimistic a resolution will be reached, he does not want there to be any doubt that he did not try to stop the war. The diplomatic effort came as Russian troops continued to try to press their attack in Ukraine but faced a fierce defense from Ukrainian forces. In Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, in the country's northeast, Ukrainian defenders succeeded in beating back Russian units during street fighting. The momentum of Russian forces in Ukraine appears to have been slowed by fuel and logistics shortages, as well as ""stiff resistance,"" a U.S. senior defense official told ABC News on Sunday. The official also credited the slowdown of the Russian invasion to resistance by Ukraine. ABC News' Fidel Pavlenko and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.",,,,17
2022-02-28,https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-seeks-rewrite-role-bolstering-ukraine-nato/story?id=83159716,"Trump seeks to rewrite his role in bolstering Ukraine, NATO","Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to recast his administration's role in bolstering Europe's security, claiming credit for strengthening NATO and arming Ukraine's military with advanced weaponry. But critics were quick to point out that Trump, whose ""America First"" foreign policy slogan often reflected efforts to pull back from allies, frequently undermined NATO and once threatened to withhold military aide from Ukraine -- a move that was deemed illegal by a government watchdog and became central to Trump's first impeachment trial in Congress. ""It was Trump that undermined U.S. national security and froze military assistance to Ukraine,"" retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a former National Security Council official during the Trump administration who testified at the impeachment inquiry, told ABC News on Monday. ""It was Trump's attacks on NATO and support from the far-right that encouraged Putin to believe that NATO was fragile. Trump has blood on his hands."" Nonetheless, as Russian troops continued to clash with Ukrainian forces Monday, Trump boasted of fortifying Ukraine's defense capabilities and declared that ""there would be no NATO"" if not for his efforts. ""I hope everyone is able to remember that it was me, as President of the United States, that got delinquent NATO members to start paying their dues, which amounted to hundreds of billions of dollars,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Also, it was me that got Ukraine the very effective anti-tank busters (Javelins) when the previous Administration was sending blankets,"" he said. ""Let History so note!"" Despite his claims of saving NATO, an alliance of 29 countries on both sides of the Atlantic, the Trump administration oversaw a period of immense strain with allies in Europe. As president, Trump wavered on his commitment to Article 5 of the NATO charter, which stipulates that an attack on one member state amounts to attack on them all. Mick Mulroy, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Trump administration and now an ABC News contributor, characterized Article 5 as ""what makes NATO the most effective military alliance in history."" Ties with Europe became so strained during Trump's presidency that Trump reportedly discussed removing the U.S. from NATO entirely. Two of Trump's former national security advisers, John Bolton and Gen. John Kelly, have said publicly that Trump expressed an interest in exiting the alliance. ""To the extent President Trump's rhetoric around NATO helped increase defense spending, it was likely more out of a fear that the U.S. commitment to European security was faltering rather than a positive reinforcement of mutual commitments to the Alliance and Euro-Atlantic security,"" said Steven Keil, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund. Critics also took note of Trump's invocation of the Javelin, a shoulder-fired precision missile system designed to destroy tanks and other armored vehicles, in his infamous July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump, in 2018, had approved the $47 million sale of 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launchers to Ukraine -- the first lethal military assistance provided to Ukraine by the U.S. in its fight against Russian-supported separatists since fighting began in 2014. Zelenskyy told Trump in the 2019 phone call that his government was ""almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes,"" according to a readout of the call. Trump responded: ""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" and then pressured Zelenskyy to work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to publicly announce an investigation into then-candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who had previously served on the board of a Ukrainian oil firm. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump over the incident, but he was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. The U.S. Government Accountability Office later found that the Trump administration broke the law in withholding nearly $400 million in congressional appropriations earmarked for Ukraine. The funds were eventually released, and the Trump administration denied any wrongdoing.",,,,20
2022-02-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/meta-disrupts-social-media-misinformation-campaigns-targeting-ukrainians/story?id=83158868,Meta disrupts social media misinformation campaigns targeting Ukrainians,"A pair of social media misinformation campaigns exploiting tensions in Russia and Ukraine were identified and disabled on Facebook over the weekend, according to two senior leaders at the social network's parent company Meta. One operation thwarted by Meta's security team involved about 40 accounts described as ""inauthentic"" with some profile pictures suspected to have been generated artificially, Threat Disruption Director David Agranovich said Sunday night. The fictitious personas operated across the internet, the Meta employees said, including on Twitter, YouTube, Telegram and two Russian social media networks. The campaign also included fake websites resembling news outlets that claimed to be based in Kyiv with the people behind the sites posing as news editors and expert sources. The operation was connected to a campaign previously detected and taken down by Facebook in April 2020. At the time, the activity was found to have come from Russia, the Donbas region and two media organizations in Crimea. ""The campaign had a very limited following across its presence online,"" Agranovich said. When Meta took action against the accounts, they had fewer than 4,000 followers on Facebook and fewer than 500 on Instagram, Agranovich said. The security team did not say how many total impressions or views the inauthentic posts received. Another operation involved the specific targeting of Facebook accounts belonging to members of the Ukrainian military, as well as politicians and a journalist. The profiles were used to share YouTube videos portraying Ukrainians as weak and surrendering to Russia, which Facebook said was done by compromising the accounts likely through personal email. One video appeared to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest waving a white flag. The Meta employees did not disclose the total number of compromised accounts, only referring to them as ""a handful."" They also did not reveal the names behind the accounts, citing privacy concerns. While Facebook described the number of accounts affected as minimal, the phishing operation that led to the compromise was reportedly widespread and attributed by cybersecurity researchers to a previously known misinformation campaign called ""Ghostwriter."" ""Ghostwriter has previously targeted the NATO alliance, seeking to erode support for the organization,"" said Ben Read, director of Cyber Espionage Analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant. ""I wouldn't be surprised if similar operations were seen in the near future."" Mandiant has linked the ""Ghostwriter"" campaign to the Belarusian military, and concerns remain over the exploitation of Ukrainians' personal data. ""Leaking misleading, or fabricated documents taken from Ukrainian entities could be leveraged to promote Russia- and Belarus-friendly narratives,"" Read said. ABC News has tracked the spread of disinformation related to Ukraine and Russia across online forums and social media networks. In one example, a video that appeared to show a man with his leg blown off was shared by a Russian separatist militia on Telegram last week. The stump of the man's leg was blurred. ""Ukrainian punishers continue the genocide of the civilian population of Donbass,"" the video's caption read. But other, unblurred videos of the scene show the man was, in fact, an amputee. There is no blood and the attachment for a prosthetic leg is clearly visible. At Meta, Facebook has increased its fact-checking capacity in Russia and Ukraine and added new features to protect Ukrainians and help them lock down their accounts and check privacy settings. Meta will now also extend some of those features to Russia in an effort to protect the increased targeting of Russian protesters, the company announced. Earlier this week, Russian state media was barred from running ads or monetizing the platform. In response to calls for Meta to shut down Facebook and Instagram in Russia, Vice President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said the company does not want to restrict services for Russians who are protesting and organizing against the war. ""The Russian Government is already throttling our platform to prevent these activities,"" Clegg said in a Tweet Sunday. ""We believe turning off our services would silence important expression at a crucial time."" ABC News' Jack Date and Alice Chambers contributed to this report.",,,,10
2022-03-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/natos-article-pull-us-allies-russia-ukraine-conflict/story?id=83108600,NATO's Article 5 could pull the US and its allies further into the Russia-Ukraine conflict,"President Joe Biden repeatedly has said the United States will not be sending troops to fight Russia in Ukraine, but vowed that the U.S. would defend its NATO allies. ""As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,"" he reiterated in an address Thursday. The main goal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's founding in 1949 was to foster mutual assistance in response to the Soviet Union's expansion in Europe. A key component of the treaty, Article 5, covers ""collective defense,"" which means that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all allies. Amid the current crisis, Article 5 could mandate a more direct response from the U.S. and other treaty members if Russian aggression escalates beyond Ukraine. NATO announced last week it launched its response force, a deployment of about 40,000 troops to provide land, air and naval assistance across the alliance. This is the first time the force has been deployed for a ""deterrence and defence role,"" a NATO spokesperson said. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, told ABC News it is possible Article 5 could be invoked while the U.S. and its allies are providing military aid to Ukraine. “Let's say that Russia succeeds in toppling the government. And it then tries to occupy and pacify Ukraine. Assuming that the U.S. and its allies attempt to get arms to a Ukrainian resistance movement, there's a not insignificant risk that Russia might try to interdict that flow. And that whether by design or by accident, an artillery shell or a missile or a bomb could land in Poland or another NATO country,” Kupchan said. “And then we're looking at the prospect of an attack on NATO territory and the potential trigger of the Article Five collective defense guarantee, which then raises the prospect of potential military conflict between NATO and Russia,” Kupchan said. All participating countries agree to the form of solidarity outlined in the article, making it a key component of the alliance. While Ukraine is not a member of NATO, it borders Poland, Hungry, Slovakia and Romania, which are members. Ukraine has been moving toward the West and away from Russia, attempting to join both NATO and the European Union. Kupchan said its geographical location could be strategic during this conflict. “In the current moment, Ukraine's border with four NATO countries affords it two important advantages,” Kupchan said. “One is refugees are able to seek asylum in NATO countries, and we're seeing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians head west. And the other is that now that Ukraine's airspace is … dominated by Russia, the long border between Ukraine and NATO affords an opportunity to continue to funnel weapons and other sources of support to Ukraine."" The first time Article 5 was invoked was after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The alliance had already identified terrorism as a risk affecting its security in 1999. In response to the attack, NATO engaged in the fight against terrorism, launching its first operations outside the Euro-Atlantic area to patrol the skies over the U.S. In 2008, NATO appeared to open the door for Ukraine's membership saying it would become a member of the alliance, despite a lack of consensus between members, Kupchan said. NATO did not specify a pathway or timeframe for Ukraine to join the alliance. “In 2008, the Bush administration wanted to proceed with what's called a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine and Georgia. And European partners were reluctant, in part because neither Ukraine nor Georgia was ready to join NATO and because of concern that NATO's enlargement to Georgia and Ukraine would be seen as provocative in Russia,” Kupchan said. “Given the lack of consensus within NATO, the alliance agreed to issue a generic statement that Georgia and Ukraine would become NATO members, but didn’t specify a timeframe or a pathway,” Kupchan said. Russian President Vladimir Putin linked the current crisis to Russia's NATO demands, including a guarantee that NATO will stop expanding to the East, in a video address days before Russia invaded Ukraine. Putin accused the U.S. and NATO of ignoring his demands and blamed the West for the Ukraine crisis. ""[Putin] has said explicitly that he wants to see NATO's military presence [reduced] in the eastern flank and that would include the three Baltic countries, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, "" Kupchan said. ""He wants to see NATO pull its capability back."" ""One of the tragic dimensions of this conflict is that the Russians knew full well, that Ukrainian membership in NATO was not under consideration. It was not on the table. And NATO governments were quite explicit about that. Nonetheless, Putin decided to invade the country,"" Kupchan said. Its unlikely Putin would launch an attack on a NATO ally because he would be looking at a ""full-scale war,"" he said. ""My guess is that he understands that this is a non-starter,"" Kupchan said. In addition to NATO's deployment of its response force, it also said it was deploying a quick response brigade of 3,500 troops that could deploy on short notice while the larger unit gathers its troops from various member nations. ""Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory,"" a statement from NATO said last week. Kupchan said it is still unclear how far west Russia will go into Ukraine. ""It's conceivable that there could be a rump in Ukraine that Russia does not try to grab hold of and Western Ukraine has generally been much more integrated into Europe, than into Russia,"" Kupchan said.",,,,27

""The United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs,"" Biden said. ""We are joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We're coming for your ill-begotten gains."" The U.S. says some of the oligarchs have ties to President Vladimir Putin and he uses them to launder or hide hundreds of millions of dollars obtained through corruption. Dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture, the group will investigate and prosecute new sanctions, combat unlawful efforts to undermine restrictions taken against Russian financial institutions by Russians who flout the restrictions, go after oligarchs who use cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions and seize the assets of Russian oligarchs. The department says it will bring ""cutting edge"" resources from the deputy attorney general's office and will be led by a career prosecutor out of the Southern District of New York. ""The Justice Department will use all of its authorities to seize the assets of individuals and entities who violate these sanctions,"" said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a press release. ""We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to investigate, arrest, and prosecute those whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue this unjust war. Let me be clear: if you violate our laws, we will hold you accountable."" The Task Force is designed to ensure the ""full effect"" of sanctions leveled against the Russian government, ""which have been designed to isolate Russia from global markets and impose serious costs for this unjustified act of war, by targeting the crimes of Russian officials, government-aligned elites, and those who aid or conceal their unlawful conduct,"" the Department says. Even if Russian oligarchs can't be prosecuted in the United States, DOJ will still seize assets including personal real estate, financial and commercial assets. DOJ says they will work with their European counterparts around the world to ensure these objectives are met. The move has bipartisan support. Last week, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., floated the idea of a DOJ task force seizing Russian assets, calling it the ""number one priority"" of the supplemental funding bill. ""It is now time for that crowd to lose their yachts loose their luxury apartments, and to pay a price for being part of a thuggish group,"" Graham said.

2022-03-02,https://abcnews.go.com/International/families-torn-amid-mass-exodus-ukraine-face-uncertain/story?id=83163294,Families torn apart amid mass exodus from Ukraine face uncertain future,"When 25-year-old Yulia Yemelianenko crossed the border from Lviv, Ukraine into Poland earlier this week, she broke down in tears. “I cried a lot,” she told ABC News at a train station in Przemysl, Poland. “...I was forced to quit my country, and I didn't want it.” “I want to live in my city with my mother and my friends,” she added. Yemelianenko spoke with ABC News about the difficult journey as she waited at the train station for a friend. She is one of the hundreds of thousands of people who were forced to flee from Ukraine into neighboring European countries like Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary amid ongoing attacks from Russia. Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said on Wednesday the number of Ukrainians who've fled their country has so far climbed to 874,000, which is believed to be the biggest number of people displaced in the shortest amount of time since World War II. “I don't know what will happen in Ukraine,” she said. “I don't know when I will come back.” The emotional toll that the journey took on Yemelianenko was magnified because she had to leave her mother, who is recovering from COVID-19, behind. Asked if she feels that she has been displaced, she said, “I'm trying not to think about this at all, because I don't know when I can see my mother next time.” “Every time I start, like, crying and tears, won’t help in this situation.” She said she hopes to return to Ukraine as soon as possible and reunite with her friends, some of whom stayed back to fight in the war. 'There’s panic, there’s chaos' At the train station in Lviv, Ukraine, volunteers have been working to organize thousands of people seeking to board trains to Poland. According to UNHCR, more than 453,000 of those who fled Ukraine have gone to Poland. “There’s panic, there’s chaos,” Yuliana Shchurko, a volunteer, told ABC News. “Those people are waiting for the train to call and they don't want to go to any other country,” she said, adding that it could be days before the next train would be scheduled to depart for Poland. Amid the congestion, some immigrants and students living in Ukraine expressed fear they are being discriminated against as they wait at the border, hoping to cross into Poland. “The Ukrainians are given priority, which is to children and women,” Adeyemo Abimbole, a student from Nigeria, told ABC News on Sunday, adding that he and a group of African students have been waiting for a train to cross into Poland for nearly three days. “Our lives also matter,” he added. It is unclear if Abimbole and his friends entered Poland. UNHCR's Grandi confirmed during a press conference on Tuesday that “there are instances” of differentiation of treatment at the borders based on race, but said he was assured that “these are not state policies.” “We will continue to intervene, as we have done several times, to try to ensure that everybody is received in the same manner,” he said, urging all nations to welcome those fleeing Ukraine without discrimination. Marcus Lawani, who is also waiting with the group, told ABC News that he believed some of his African friends were “turned back based on their color” because “they want more Ukrainians to leave.” “Mostly they give power to women, children, and their men follow,” he said. Women and children have been given priority at congested border crossings and many Ukrainian men of fighting age have stayed behind after Ukraine began drafting reservists aged 18-60 to fight for their country. A 'heartbreaking' decision Alyona Tec said that her family’s decision to leave Ukraine was difficult and leaving her country has torn her apart. “I felt really bad that I had to leave,” Tec told ABC News on Friday as her family arrived in Korczowa, Poland, explaining that she had wanted to stay behind and help her people in any way she could but left with her husband and son because they worried about the baby's safety. “I couldn't [stay] because I knew [my son] is here and I need to take care of him and I'm responsible,” she said. “It was like heartbreaking for me because I saw people gonna go fight, like regular civilians gonna take up guns and fight, and I'm just gonna leave.” While Tec grapples with guilt as she thinks of those she left behind, her husband Juan Tec said that they initially considered staying in Ukraine. “Things that are happening now in Kyiv are just really bad,” he said. “Shelling, gunfights, tanks, rolling over cars, people getting hurt civilians. And now that I look back, I'm really glad we made that decision.” According to UNICEF, the 7.5 million children in Ukraine are at heightened risk. Many have been traumatized, wounded and at least 13 children have been killed by Tuesday — a number that is expected to rise as the war rages on, UNICEF said. Alyona Tec said that her family’s decision to leave Ukraine was difficult and leaving her country has torn her apart. An uncertain future For families who separated at the border, it is unclear when they can see their loves ones again. In an emotional embrace, husband and wife Sasha and Svetlana Olekciirak said goodbye on Saturday at the Polish border in Korczowa. The couple spoke with ABC News as Sasha dropped off his wife and two children after what they said was a 30-hour trip from Ternopil, not knowing when he will see them again. ""I don't want to go,"" Sasha said, explaining that he wanted to stay in Ukraine to fight for his country. Asked how she felt not knowing when she can see her husband again, a tearful Svetlana said, ""it's fear … you don't know what is your future.” Their story is one of many playing out on the borders of Ukraine, like that of Sergei and Marina, a couple that was also separated at a border. Sergei spoke with ABC News as he waited with his wife Marina and their two children – a 5-month-old and a 3-year-old – at a train station in Lviv. Sergei said that that amid the bombings in Kyiv, he was worried for his family’s safety and decided to send them to Poland while he stayed behind to fight. “I have to ensure that my family [is safe], so that's why we're here,” he said. Asked how she feels about leaving her husband behind, Marina said, “I have no other choice.” “We will start from zero there,” she said. “I will be better for my kids and I don’t care about stuff.” ABC News' Jessica DiMartino contributed to this report.",,,,4

Several House and Senate members wore a ribbon in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag on their congressional pins during the speech. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wore a pin with a combination of the Ukrainian and U.S. flags. Some of those in Congress demonstrated their support beyond their lapels. Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., sported a blue suit and yellow blouse on Tuesday. She told reporters that more members will be wearing those colors during the president's speech. ""We must do everything we can to preserve our democracies from those that wish to hurt them,"" Bustos tweeted. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla., also shared a photo wearing blue and yellow along with several other representatives. In a separate tweet at the start of the State of the Union, Frankel wrote, ""The people of Ukraine are inspiring the world with their bravery & resilience in their fight for the future of democracy."" Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., who was born in Ukraine, also wore a blue suit and yellow blazer Tuesday. Hours before the president's speech, Spartz called on the president to do more for the Ukrainian people. ""This is not a war, this is a genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" she said during a news conference. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., was seen wearing traditional Ukrainian clothing in the chamber. Earlier in the day, the White House tweeted a photo of Biden on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as Biden wore a blue and yellow tie. There was at least one Ukrainian official on hand during the president's remarks, according to the White House. First lady Jill Biden invited Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., as a guest. She sat in the viewing box with the first lady; the second gentleman, Douglas Emhoff; the president’s sister, Valerie Biden Owens; and eight other VIPs. ""She's bright, she's strong and she's got resolve,"" the president said of Markarova, who received a standing ovation and hug from the first lady. Jill Biden had an embroidered appliqué of a sunflower, the national flower of Ukraine, sewn to the sleeve of her dress near her wrist, according to the White House. She also wore blue in support of Ukraine, her office said. ABC News' Mariam Khan and Devin Dwyer contributed to this report.",,,,25

On March 1, dozens of self-identified right-wing nationalists marauded through the city center of Przemysl, Poland, and harassed refugees who looked to be people of color, the witnesses said. Many non-white refugees have arrived in the city while they evacuate Ukraine. As this humanitarian crisis goes on, many fear extremism will continue to cause trouble for refugees of color trying to escape the war. More than 836,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries since Russian forces invaded the eastern European country on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). At least 453,000 of those refugees have escaped to Poland as of March 2, UNHCR said. Near the Przemysl train station on Tuesday, where thousands of refugees are passing through, anyone who looked to be African or Arab were being targeted by the extremists in the attack, witnesses reported. Julian Würzer, a reporter for the German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost who is stationed in Poland, told ABC News that extremists aggressively shouted at refugees to get out of the country and allegedly assaulted them. Online videos seen by ABC News show police in riot gear diffusing the incident, which Würzer said went on for about 20 minutes before police arrived. There have been no reports of injuries. Local authorities did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment on the incidents. These extremists are a minority in the country, however. There has been an overwhelming effort by local citizens to help those fleeing across the Polish-Ukrainian border. ABC News reporters on the ground say that volunteers across the region have been offering to house, feed, and clothe the many refugees. At the border, witnesses tell ABC News that extremists have reportedly been accepting Ukrainians but vowing to “defend” Poland against an influx of non-Christians. These extremists are believed by some to be backed by Russia. Poland's government has aligned itself in recent years with right-wing ideals and has been criticized for anti-refugee sentiment. Last year, Poland refused to let thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the country after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko forcibly drove them out of his country. Commissioner Filippo Grandi of the UNCHR has confirmed that there have been instances of discrimination in the admission of certain refugees from Ukraine. Some third-country nationals have reported being stuck or being rejected from passage in their attempts to flee, he said. Grandi said that state policies are not causing instances of discrimination, and that ""there should be absolutely no discrimination between Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians, Europeans and non-Europeans."" ""Everybody is fleeing from the same risks,"" Grandi said at a March 1 press conference. ""We will continue to intervene, as we have done several times to try to ensure that everybody is received in the same manner.""

Blinken called Markarova ""our new star,"" in the wake of President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech Tuesday night where he called attention to the ambassador who was seated next to first lady Jill Biden. ""It's in the most difficult moments that our faith is tested,"" Blinken said to the audience, including Ukrainian faith leaders and activists, at the Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the Holy Family. He also said this is a moment for faith in democracy, peace, and ""in the conviction that good will prevail over evil."" Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin made a ""horrific, terrible mistake,"" in his aggression against Ukraine. ""We stand with them, we stand with you, and we will prevail in this struggle,"" Blinken said of the Ukrainian people. He praised the Ukrainians who he said have been inspiring the world with resilience, strength and faith. The Ukrainian people are ""insisting on their freedom, insisting on their independence, insisting on their right to go forward as a sovereign, independent country,"" he said. Inside the church, Blinken lit a candle and spoke with a group of Ukrainian leaders, including Archbishop Borys Gudziak and Ukrainian American activist Ulana Mazurkevich. The meeting united leaders of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which separated in 2018. ""We're like one family,"" said the pastor, Fr. Robert Hitchens, ""In family, there are disagreements over things. But, when it comes down to matters of life and death, we pull together, we work together, we pray together and we set aside any differences."" He said Blinken's visit honored Ukrainians in the U.S. and overseas. ""They're not forgotten,"" Hitchens said about those in Ukraine. ""The government of the United States and their sisters and brothers, fellow Ukrainians, and all peoples of goodwill, and this nation are standing with them."" Like many other members of the church, Hitchens said his great-grandparents immigrated to the U.S., but kept their Catholic faith strong. Hitchens said his biggest fear is the threat of extinction for Ukraine, and that the church will be forced underground under Russia's rule. ""In my heart of hearts, I know somehow Ukraine will survive and its people will still survive,"" said Hitchens. ""But not before there's a whole lot of senseless hurt.""",,,,25
2022-03-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-announces-sanctions-russian-oligarchs-enable-putin/story?id=83231852,US announces new sanctions on Russian oligarchs it says enable Putin,"The U.S. on Thursday announced new sanctions against members of the Russian elite, including Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, and said it would block 19 oligarchs and 47 of their relatives and close associates from traveling to the United States. The sanction targets include Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, as well as one of Russia's richest men, Alisher Usmanov, according to the White House. Germany had already seized Usmanov's superyacht, and the White House said both the boat and Usmanov's private jet -- which it said was one of the largest privately-owned aircraft in Russia -- would be blocked for use in the U.S. or by Americans. ""These are significant steps that will impact the people who are closely around President Putin,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.""We want him to feel the squeeze. We want the people around him to feel the squeeze."" President Joe Biden touched on the latest U.S. actions against Russia at the top of the fourth Cabinet meeting of his administration, saying the steps his administration and its allies have already taken are having a ""profound impact."" Biden said the Russian oligarchs being sanctioned ""line their pockets with Russian people's money and while Ukraine and the people are hiding in subways from missiles that are being fired indiscriminately from Russian cities."" In a news release, the Treasury Department said it and the State Department had intensified pressure on Russia by ""sanctioning numerous Russian elites and their family members, identifying certain property of these persons as blocked, and sanctioning Russian intelligence-directed disinformation outlets."" It said the elites sanctioned provided direct and indirect support to the Russian government through their business empires, wealth, and other resources. ""The aid of these individuals, their family members, and other key elites allows President Vladimir Putin to continue to wage the ongoing, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,"" the release said. It described Usmanov as one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires with vast holdings across multiple sectors of the Russian Federation economy as well as internationally. ""Usmanov’s Kremlin ties enrich him and enable his luxurious lifestyle. Evidencing his wealth, Usmanov owns one of the world’s largest superyachts, known as Dilbar ... named after Usmanov’s mother ... This superyacht’s estimated worth is believed to be between $600 and $735 million. Dilbar has two helipads and one of the world’s largest indoor pools ever installed on a yacht. The estimated cost to run Dilbar is $60 million per year,"" Treasury said. Usmanov’s aircraft, an Airbus A340-300, the release said, is believed to have cost between $350 and $500 million. Shortly after he arrived in Brussels for a full day of meetings Thursday with NATO, the G-7, and European Union counterparts, among other allies, Secretary of State Antony Blinken weighed in on the new sanctions. ""These actions make it clear there is nowhere to hide for individuals and entities that support Russia's flagrant war against Ukraine,"" he said in a statement. The statement also said the Department of State is imposing substantial costs on Russia’s defense enterprises by sanctioning 22 defense-related firms. ""These far-reaching sanctions target entities that develop and produce fighter aircraft, infantry fighting vehicles, electronic warfare systems, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles for Russia’s military. These sanctions strike at the core of Putin’s war machine,"" he said. ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",,,,21
2022-03-03,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-fly-zone-option-experts/story?id=83164297,Why a Ukraine no-fly zone isn't an option: Experts,"Ukrainian officials under relentless attack from Russian forces have pleaded with President Joe Biden and members of NATO to impose a no-fly zone over significant parts of Ukraine. It's been used effectively by the U.S. and its allies several times in conflicts around the world, but experts said imposing a no-fly zone in Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces and his nuclear arsenal could lead to military conflict between the U.S. and Russia. In a statement to the news website Axios, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine ""can beat the aggressor"" if Western allies ""do their part."" A no-fly zone bans military aircraft over a designated airspace to protect civilian populations from aerial attack during times of war. Typically, an international organization such as NATO or a group of countries not involved in the fighting will assume the responsibility of policing the airspace to prevent the entry of any combat aircraft to ensure the safety of civilians. Howard Stoffer, a professor of international affairs at the University of New Haven and a former State Department official, told ABC News that a no-fly zone over Ukraine would likely lead to a confrontation between U.S. and Russian jet fighters. ""If someone's in the no-fly zone, you can't just chase them out, you have to shoot them down,"" Stoffer said. The United States has been involved in several conflicts in the past 30 years where no-fly zones were implemented. In 2011, the United Nations Security Council voted to impose one over Libya to force an immediate ceasefire of Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi's forces. In 1991, the United States and its coalition of allies established a no-fly zone in Iraq following the Gulf War. A no-fly zone was also established by NATO in 1993 over Bosnia and Herzegovina. But Stoffer told ABC News that establishing no-fly zones in Iraq, Libya and the Balkans is no comparison to imposing one against Russia. ""First of all, they don't have nuclear weapons,"" Stoffer said. ""Second of all, they didn't have air superiority."" The White House and NATO have ruled out imposing a no-fly zone in Ukraine, concluding it is not a good idea. ""It would essentially mean the U.S. military would be shooting down planes, Russian planes,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an interview with MSNBC on Monday. ""That is definitely escalatory ... That is not something the president wants to do. Those are all the reasons why that's not a good idea."" Instead, the United States has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons. Millions more in lethal aid has been sent by NATO and European Union countries, including Germany and France. Some American lawmakers, however, are still pressing for the U.S. to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, took to Twitter on Friday and called on the United States to declare a no-fly zone to give Ukraine a ""fair fight"" against the Russians. ""The fate of #Ukraine is being decided tonight, but also the fate of the west. Declare a #NoFlyZone over Ukraine at the invitation of their sovereign govt,"" Kinzinger tweeted. Stoffer, who worked on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, said creating a no-fly zone in Ukraine would be one of the fastest ways to trigger a war with Russia. ""The implications with war with Russia are we now have a madman in the Kremlin who is not saying things that sound like you would want to deal with. For example, he's rattling his nuclear weapons, saying they're on higher alert,"" he said. Stoffer added, ""While we all hate what's going on in Ukraine now, it's very hard to sit back and say we have the means to stop this but do we really have the national commitment to go to war with Russia, and I don't think we do.""",,,,3

Adeyemo Abimbole, a Nigerian student studying in Ukraine, told ABC News on Sunday that he and a group of African students had been waiting for a train to cross into Poland for nearly three days, but were told to wait. ""The Ukrainians are given priority, which is to children and women,"" Abimbole said. ""Our lives also matter,"" he added. It is unclear if Abimbole and his friends made it to Poland. Women, children and the elderly have been given priority at border crossings, while many Ukrainian men of fighting age have stayed behind after Ukraine began drafting reservists aged 18 to 60 to fight against Russian attacks. Andrew Geddes, a professor of migration studies and the director of the Migration Policy Centre, told ABC News that prioritizing the safety of women, children and the elderly is ""fairly standard"" during a humanitarian crisis because they are ""seen as more vulnerable."" But Geddes added that this has led some third-country nationals living in Ukraine, including men from Africa and Asia who are not going to join the Ukrainian army, to feel ""trapped in this situation."" According to data from Ukraine's Ministry of Education and Science, in 2019 there were about 80,000 international students studying in Ukraine from 158 countries, the majority of which -- about 23% -- come from India, followed by Morocco, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Nigeria. Reports of discrimination ABC News witnessed train cars heading to Poland that were designated for non-Ukrainian men, but some nonwhite refugees who were held back at various border crossings said they believe that they were discriminated against based on their race. Pyra Diantouadi, an immigrant from Congo living in Dnipro, Ukraine, spoke with ABC News on Tuesday after arriving in Korzcowa, Poland. He said that as he waited to board a train, he was told that only women and children were allowed but then watched as some Ukrainian men were allowed to board. ""The police in Ukraine were taking some men, and we thought, 'How is that possible? You just said women and children, so now you are taking Ukrainians; white people. Why? Are we not people like them?'"" Diantouadi said. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba responded to reports of discrimination in a tweet on Tuesday, saying that ""Ukraine's government spares no effort to solve the problem."" ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has affected Ukrainians and non-citizens in many devastating ways. Africans seeking evacuation are our friends and need to have equal opportunities to return to their home countries safely,"" he tweeted. Kuleba also announced on Wednesday that Ukraine set up an emergency hotline for African, Asian and other students seeking to leave Ukraine. ""We are working intensively to ensure their safety & speed up their passage,"" he tweeted. Russia must stop its aggression which affects us all."" Geddes said that nonwhite refugees fleeing Ukraine, particularly men, are ""falling through the protection cracks."" ""They don't really fit the kind of dominant frame of young Ukrainian men fighting, and the vulnerable groups being evacuated ... they've almost become less visible in the context of this protection crisis,"" he said. Korrine Sky, a Black British medical student living in Ukraine, told ABC News on Wednesday that she and her family were in a line of cars for 40 hours at the Romanian border, and as they reached the front of the line they were aggressively confronted by some Ukrainians who did not want them to enter. Sky said that when she and her husband got out of the car to seek help from the Ukrainian military, they were asked to join a line for those traveling on foot that only included ""people of color."" ""There was, like, evident segregation,"" she said. ""They are prioritizing Ukrainian people leaving Ukraine,"" she added. ""Us students, who've come from different countries to get an education for a better life for our families and friends, we're the least of their worries."" Sky and her family arrived in Romania on Tuesday. Amid reports of discrimination, United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees Filippo Grandi confirmed during a press conference Tuesday that ""there are instances"" of differentiation of treatment at the borders based on race, but said he was assured that ""these are not state policies."" ""We will continue to intervene, as we have done several times, to try to ensure that everybody is received in the same manner,"" he said, urging all nations to welcome those fleeing Ukraine without discrimination. Chaos and congestion The mass exodus of more than 1 million refugees, per UNHCR data released Wednesday, has led to chaos and congestion at border crossings, particularly in Poland, which has taken in more than 453,000 of those who fled Ukraine. Likabiso Lekoatsa, a medical student from Lesotho studying in Dnipro, Ukraine, spoke with ABC News after fleeing Ukraine through Slovakia as she traveled in a car through the Czech Republic, hoping to get to Germany where she has friends. ""It wasn't hard to cross over to Slovakia,"" she said. ""There were no troubles at all,"" she added. ""They just took my passport and I was let through very easily."" Lekoatsa, who was set to graduate in 2024, said she made the decision to flee through Slovakia because a friend of hers, also a medical student from Lesotho studying in Ukraine, told her that she was held back in Poland and waited at the train station for at least three days. ""She was trying to go to Poland and [Ukrainian officials] were saying that they won't let her in until all the Ukrainians have passed,"" Lekoatsa, adding that she has not been able to communicate with her friend to find out if she made it through. On Tuesday, dozens of self-identified right-wing nationalists stormed through the city center of Przemysl, Poland, and harassed refugees who looked to be people of color, witnesses to the incident told ABC News. Julian Würzer, a reporter for the German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost who is stationed in Poland, told ABC News that extremists aggressively shouted at refugees to get out of the country and allegedly assaulted them during the incident. Grandi said that he met with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau on Wednesday, who ""affirmed Poland's commitment to continue receiving all those fleeing, without distinction."" Asked about Grandi's comments, Geddes said that ""practices on the ground might not reflect the policies in central government."" ""It can be quite a long distance between the capital city, the ministry and the people who are actually operating the border control policy,"" he added. According to UNHCR data, the number of Ukrainians who've fled their country has so far climbed to 836,000 -- a mass exodus that is believed to be the biggest number of people displaced in the shortest amount of time since World War II. While addressing the U.N. General Assembly on Monday, Grandi urged European nations not to discriminate in admitting refugees from Ukraine. ""I encourage governments to continue to maintain access to territory for all those fleeing, Ukrainians of course, but also third country nationals living in Ukraine, people there to work and to study. And in some cases, people that are in Ukraine, as refugees, and all of whom are now similarly forced to escape the violence,"" he said. ""At this critical juncture, there can be no discrimination against any person or any group.""

The Russian and Ukrainian delegations gathered in the Brest region of Belarus for the second round of talks in four days. ""The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved,"" Ukraine's presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted following the meeting. Russia’s foreign minister said that Russia will continue to insist that any peace agreement with Ukraine must include a promise that Ukraine will ""demilitarize."" Russia has also signaled it wants to discuss Ukraine adopting a ""neutral status"" and agree to abandon its ambitions of joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Prior to the meeting, Podolyak posted on Twitter that Ukraine’s priorities in the talks are an ""immediate cease-fire,"" an armistice and ""humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians."" Ukrainian officials have previously said they want Russia to withdraw all troops from Ukraine. Following the meeting, Podolyak tweeted the talks did produce a ""solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors."" During a televised briefing on Thursday with foreign journalists, including ABC News, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia is ready to negotiate. Lavrov said Russia would continue its military operation while the talks were ongoing, saying it cannot allow ""military infrastructure"" to remain in Ukraine as a threat to Russia. He said any peace agreement must include a point on Ukraine’s ""demilitarization."" Zelenskyy on Thursday expressed no interest in demilitarizing and issued a warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""You will repay everything you did against Ukraine -- in full,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised news conference. ""And we will not forget those who perished -- and God won't."" Zelenskyy said he is ready to meet and talk directly with Putin and repeated his calls for a ""no-fly"" zone over Ukraine immediately, saying it would act as a deterrent. In an earlier statement posted on Facebook, Zelenskyy said, ""We are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week"" and praised his military forces and Ukrainian civilians who have taken up arms to defend the country. ""I sincerely admire the heroic civilians of Konotop, Bashtanka, Energodar, Melitopol (and) other towns and villages, who do not let the invaders in by blocking the roads. People come out in front of enemy vehicles. This is extremely dangerous. But this is brave. It is also salvation,"" Zelenskyy wrote. But when asked at Thursday's news conference by ABC News senior foreign correspondent Ian Pannell how long Ukraine can hold out against the Russian advance, Zelenskyy said, ""I don't know."" Putin said in a televised meeting of his National Security Council on Thursday that his ""special military operation is going strictly in accordance with the schedule, with the plan."" ""All objectives are being successfully attained,"" Putin said. As he has done previously, Putin called Ukrainians and Russians ""one people"" and that his troops are fighting against ""neo-Nazis,"" a claim that has been debunked by the United States and its Western allies.

2022-03-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-documenting-russian-strikes-ukrainian-civilians-stopping-short/story?id=83213246,US documenting Russian strikes on Ukrainian civilians but stopping short of calling them war crimes,"Russia is hitting civilian targets in Ukraine, killing innocent people and destroying hospitals, schools and critical infrastructure like running water, electricity and gas, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken alleged Wednesday. But President Joe Biden and his administration have stopped short of accusing the Kremlin of conducting war crimes in its invasion of Ukraine so far, with the top U.S. diplomat saying instead they are ""looking very closely at what's happening"" and ""documenting it."" The U.S. and its NATO allies continue to provide Ukraine with assistance, including anti-aircraft missiles known as Stingers, a senior U.S. official confirmed. But that lethal military aid, overwhelming condemnation at the United Nations and the flight of Western businesses and crippling sanctions, including new ones announced Wednesday, have yet to change Vladimir Putin's calculus as he seeks to topple Ukraine's government. Instead, Russia is increasingly switching to using indiscriminate bombardment to terrorize cities into submission -- a tactic Putin's forces honed previously in Chechnya and Syria and that seems to have secured them their first major Ukrainian city, Kherson. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has been pummeled with heavy artillery, rockets and airstrikes, destroying apartment buildings and government offices alike. Another major city, Mariupol, is under ferocious, continual bombardment with rocket barrages and ballistic missile strikes, knocking out the power. Schools, hospitals and residences; buses, cars and ambulances; and infrastructure like drinking water, electricity,and gas amid Ukraine's bitter winter have all been hit. ""These aren't military targets. They are places where civilians work and families live,"" Blinken told reporters, adding, ""This is shameful."" But while Biden said Wednesday morning he believed Russia is intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure, Blinken stopped short of that, saying the U.S. is still assessing particular strikes. ""We're looking very closely at what's happening in Ukraine right now, including what's happening to civilians. We're taking account of it, we're documenting it, and we want to ensure, among other things, that there's accountability for it,"" he told reporters Wednesday. The International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it would launch an immediate investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine after 38 member states, including the United Kingdom and Canada, referred reported atrocities to the ICC. ""Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced,"" ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement. Khan announced Monday that he would request to open a probe, which requires either authorization from a pre-trial ICC chamber or a referral by member states. Ukraine, like Russia and the U.S., is not a member state. Under the ICC's founding document, the Rome Statute, ""intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities"" is a violation of international law. Russia has outright denied that it has struck any civilians or civilian infrastructure. Amnesty International, among other human rights groups, reported Tuesday that it had documented ""the escalation in violations of humanitarian and human rights law, including deaths of civilians resulting from indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure."" ""Strikes on protected objects such as hospitals and schools, the use of indiscriminate weapons such as ballistic missiles, and the use of banned weapons such as cluster bombs may all qualify as war crimes,"" the group said. While Blinken wouldn't go that far, he compared Russia's tactics in Ukraine to previous conflicts, where its forces were ""absolutely brutal in trying to cow the citizenry of a given country, and that includes at the very least indiscriminate targeting and potentially deliberate targeting as well."" To fight back, the U.S. provided several hundred anti-aircraft missiles, known as Stingers, to the Ukrainian military Tuesday, a senior U.S. official confirmed to ABC News. The missiles were part of a $350 million package Biden approved late Friday night, bringing total U.S. military aid to approximately $1 billion. Before Putin launched his war, U.S. aid had been shipped in on regular flights to the capital Kyiv, where the airport has been shut down. Still, the U.S. has been successfully delivering military aid, according to Blinken, who declined to offer details on how. ""We are very actively working -- every day, every hour -- to provide that assistance,"" Blinken said of the U.S. and its NATO allies, adding, ""Vitally needed assistance is getting to where it needs to go."" The U.S. also unveiled new sanctions Wednesday that target Russia's oil and gas sector, its defense industry and its ally Belarus. New export controls will bar oil and gas extraction equipment and refining technology, preventing Russian firms ""from maintaining and upgrading current projects and, to some degree, from launching new projects,"" the White House said. The State Department is also implementing ""full blocking sanctions"" on 22 entities in Russia's defense sector, while the Commerce Department is extending export controls on Russia to include Belarus, to prevent the country from transferring semiconductors and other technology to its powerful neighbor and ally.

2022-03-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/justice-department-putins-cronies-russian-oligarchs/story?id=83227090,Justice Department 'going after Putin's cronies and Russian oligarchs',"A top Justice Department official has a stern warning for Russian oligarchs who attempt to evade U.S. sanctions: Nobody is out of the DOJ's reach. ""The point of going after Putin's cronies and Russian oligarchs who seek to violate our laws and shield their assets is to say that nobody is beyond the reach of our system of justice, beyond the reach of our work and cooperation with our allies, and that these cronies and oligarchs who seek to support and bolster the Russian regime shouldn't be able to get away with that while people are dying,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told ABC News' Byron Pitts. The Justice Department on Wednesday announced a task force to target the assets of Russian oligarchs after President Joe Biden previewed the move in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. The U.S. says some of the oligarchs have ties to President Vladimir Putin and he uses them to launder or hide hundreds of millions of dollars obtained through corruption. Dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture, the group will investigate and implement new sanctions, combat unlawful efforts to undermine restrictions taken against Russian financial institutions, go after oligarchs who use cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions and seize the assets of Russian oligarchs. The deputy attorney general urged U.S. businesses to shore up their compliance with sanctions and make sure they know who they're doing business with. ""Because if they don't and they run afoul of the sanctions, the consequences can be quite severe,"" she said. ""And our investigations are often aided by companies and financial institutions that say, 'You know what, we're seeing some unusual activity,' and sharing that information with us, and that's critically important."" Monaco said the task force is a ""commitment"" from the DOJ to put the full weight of the agency behind combatting ""efforts of oligarchs and Putin's cronies to evade sanctions, to launder money, to violate the sanctions that we're imposing in an unprecedented way with our international partners."" The deputy attorney general juxtaposed the images playing out on TV of people suffering in Ukraine with some of Russia's wealthiest citizens evading sanctions. ""We've got people dying, bombs falling on civilian populations. All the while you've got oligarchs, Putin's cronies who have engaged in corruptly acquiring billions of dollars, shrouding it and hiding it in luxury items in the West,"" she said. ""That cannot stand,"" she added.",,,,29
2022-03-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bipartisan-calls-russian-oil-ban-meet-resistance-white/story?id=83228215,Bipartisan calls for Russian oil ban meet resistance from White House,"Bipartisan calls are growing on Capitol Hill for the United States to ban imports of oil from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but the White House stopped short of an outright ban -- and experts said the impact would be limited. The United States and other Western nations have imposed an unprecedented raft of sanctions on Russia, but they have created exceptions for the oil and gas sector -- from which the Russian government derives much of its income -- because of fears cutting off the supply would drive up energy prices around the world. But Republican members of Congress have for weeks been calling for a ban on imports of Russian crude oil and petroleum products, saying it would kneecap Russian President Vladimir Putin more than the Biden administration's sanctions have so far. ""Putin's major source of revenue is selling oil and gas and Biden's given an exception,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Wednesday. ""You can continue getting billions of dollars to fund the invasion of Ukraine."" Just 1% of Russia's total crude oil exports in 2020 went to the United States, according to U.S. government figures. So while cutting off that trade would force Russia to find other buyers for that relatively small amount of oil, it would not have as significant of an impact as if Europe -- where Russia sends nearly half its oil -- stopped them, experts told ABC News. And the crippling financial sanctions on Russia's banks and other parts of its economy have already turned off potential buyers of Russian oil who are wary of doing business in a country quickly becoming a financial pariah, the experts said. ""Russian oil has already been de facto sanctioned"" by the United States and its partners, Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told ABC News. The global market has already started to react, according to Ben Cahill, an expert on energy security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""For Russia, this is part of a bigger set of challenges -- which is a lot of people don't want to buy their oil,"" Cahill said. ""There's a lot of self-sanctioning happening in the marketplace."" The U.S. relies on Russian oil more than Russia depends on sending its oil to the U.S., with about 7 to 10% of the United States' imports of crude oil and petroleum products coming from Russia in recent years. De Haan said cutting off the supply would likely raise gas prices in the U.S. in the short term. But Cahill said the switch would be ""manageable,"" with the U.S. potentially turning to countries like Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia and Canada to replace the Russian oil. Still, a slew of Democratic senators, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Thursday threw their support behind cutting off Russian oil imports. A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by moderate Democrat Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Republican Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, introduced legislation Thursday that would declare a national emergency and direct President Joe Biden to impose a ban. But Biden already has such authority. And while the White House has not completely ruled out the possibility, it has expressed concern it could lead to higher energy prices for Americans who are already being hit at the gas pump by record-high inflation rates. ""The president's objective has been to maximize impact on President Putin and Russia, while minimizing impact to us and our allies and partners,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday. The group backing Manchin's proposal is bipartisan. Nine Republicans have signed on as co-sponsors. And Democratic supporters span the caucus from traditionally moderate members like Sen. Jon Tester, of Montana, to more progressive members like Hawaii Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz, and Connecticut's Sen. Richard Blumenthal. ""Putin has weaponized energy,"" Tester said. ""I don't believe this country should be importing anything from Russia, but the fact of the matter is energy is something Putin depends upon for his finances, and he is depending on it to fight this war in Ukraine."" Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., has offered a separate bill that would also ban Russian oil imports. In addition, his legislation would require a report identifying entities involved in the import of Russian crude oil and petroleum products into the U.S. -- and impose sanctions on those entities based on the report's findings. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave the effort her stamp of approval Thursday. ""I'm all for that,"" Pelosi told reporters. ""Ban it. Ban the oil coming from Russia."" Manchin said Americans should be willing to make a sacrifice. ""You talk about an inconvenience, can you imagine if you lived in Ukraine right now?"" Manchin said. ""If there was a poll being taken and they said, 'Joe, would you pay 10 cents more a gallon to support the people of Ukraine and stop, basically, the support of Russia?' I would gladly pay 10 cents more a gallon."" Pelosi was clear that she did not back an increase on oil and gas drilling on federal land, which the Biden administration has restricted -- and which Republicans want. While the bipartisan bill makes no mention of domestic production, many Republican lawmakers -- and some Democrats, including Manchin -- see the two policies going hand in hand. An increase in U.S. production would blunt rising oil prices and provide a global alternative to Russian oil, they argue. ""We must dramatically increase domestic production of energy to support the energy needs of American consumers without causing increased financial burden,"" Manchin said in a statement Tuesday. Increasing U.S. oil production is a controversial move. Many Democrats applauded steps taken by the administration for sidelining the Keystone XL pipeline project last year and taking steps to pare back production in favor of greener energy sources earlier this year. But the White House says oil companies have access to plenty of places to drill, and the Biden administration supports investing in clean energy in the long term to prevent a reliance on foreign oil. Cahill said there are signs U.S. producers are already reacting to demand that increased even before the war in Ukraine -- and that most of the new drilling would take place on private land. ""This industry mostly takes its signals from Wall Street, and the market is going to take care of some of this on its own,"" Cahill said. The White House lending its rhetorical support could help, though, he said. Murkowski echoed that sentiment. ""If the president were to come before the American people and give a speech and say we in this country need to embrace the role that we can take on as a full energy producer,"" she said, ""I think that that would do as much to send a signal to help calm the markets to help address what we are seeing with the daily prices of fuel at the pump.""

2022-03-04,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-separatist-regions-crux-russian-invasion/story?id=83084803,What are the Ukraine 'separatist' regions at the crux of the Russian invasion,"The Donbas region of eastern Ukraine was once known for its coal and steel manufacturing, but thanks to a long-running conflict there fanned by Russia, it has played an important role in the Kremlin’s ongoing invasion. The Donbas contains two provinces, Donetsk and Luhansk, that touch the Russian border and since 2014 have been controlled by two puppet separatist governments that Moscow armed and helped establish. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week recognized the independence of the self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, saying he sent Russian troops into Ukraine to keep the peace at the request of rebels in the region. But experts on the long-running conflict said Moscow largely created the separatist movement and is now using that as grounds for the invasion. ""Those two regions have a lot of people who are not just Russian citizens, but also sympathetic to Russia still, unlike most of the country,"" said ABC News contributor Steve Ganyard, a retired U.S. Marine colonel and former deputy assistant secretary of state. ""So the reason that the Russians were able to sort of maintain puppet governments there is that they had people who are sympathetic to Russia and to their cause."" During the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, which toppled the Russian-friendly regime of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Russia responded by annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and throwing its support behind an insurgency in Donbas. Russia-backed fighters, led by former Russian intelligence officer Igor Girkin and supported by Russian special forces, seized several administrative buildings in Donbas, setting off the conflict. In April 2014, the Russian-backed rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk proclaimed the creation of ""people's republics"" and months later held a popular and unrecognized referendum to declare independence from Ukraine in an effort to become part of Russia, experts said. ""Russia sent operatives in, both military and political, to create the appearance of separatist movements, and then they sort of brought them to life. These movements would take over city halls in the region, and we'd see pictures of Russian special forces with them,"" Matthew Schmidt, a national security and political science professor at the University of New Haven, told ABC News. Ukraine used its military to try to regain control of the region, and as the Russian-backed insurgency faltered, Moscow sent its regular forces in to prop them up, covertly sending tank regiments and other units into battle. About 14,000 people have been killed in the eight years of fighting in Donbas, and more than a million residents of the area have been displaced since the fighting broke, according to the Ukrainian government. Amid the fighting, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing 298 people aboard, most of them from the Netherlands. An international investigation determined the jet was hit by a Russia-supplied missile fired from the rebel-controlled territory in Ukraine. Russia denied any involvement in the incident. In early 2015, with Russian troops inflicting heavy damage on Ukraine, Kyiv agreed to a peace deal known as the ""Minsk agreements."" Although the deal ended large-scale fighting, the conflict continued to smolder with both sides dug in along trenches. ""It turned into sort of like a World War I-kind of Western Front stalemate, and it's been that way since 2015,"" Ganyard said, adding that prior to the invasion, indiscriminate shelling occurred on both sides of the conflict. Schmidt added, ""The most important thing about that area is that it has caused this war, or it is the justification for this war."" The 2015 Minsk agreements called for Ukraine to reintegrate the separatist regions by giving them broad autonomy enshrined in its constitution. The Kremlin hoped that by doing so it would create a permanent pro-Russian lever of influence within Ukraine’s government that would act as a veto on the country joining the European Union or NATO. Ukraine refused to fulfill that part of the Minsk deal while Russian troops remained on the separatists’ territory, seeing the separatist governments as puppets of the Kremlin. Any possibility of solving the conflict was made far more difficult because the Kremlin refused to even acknowledge its troops were in the separatist areas, falsely claiming the conflict was entirely an internal civil war in Ukraine, the experts said. Meanwhile, Russia continued to falsely accuse Ukraine of waging a ""genocide"" against Russian speakers in the separatist areas. The Kremlin and the separatist proxies have drawn on a conception of the region dating from the 19th century when it was part of an area known as ""New Russia."" ""So, that's where Putin is starting, and he's saying essentially these people are majority Russian speakers and if you go back to the 19th century they are really part of Russia or should be. And he's used that term New Russia before,"" Schmidt said. But the Ukrainian government counters that Donetsk and Luhansk have been legally recognized as part of Ukraine dating back to 1917. During a referendum in 1991, a majority of people in the regions voted in favor of Ukrainian independence. In the run-up to the current invasion, Russia manufactured a pretext for it by claiming Ukraine was preparing to attack the separatist regions, backing it with a barrage of fake reports and staged videos showing supposed Ukrainian outrages that were quickly debunked by independent researchers. The separatist authorities also ordered mass evacuations of civilians to create the illusion of a large-scale humanitarian crisis. After Russia recognized the ""republics,"" the puppet governments appealed for help from Russia, creating a false pretext for the Kremlin to invade. Putin accused Ukraine of failing to implement the Minsk agreements to justify Russia recognizing the separatist ""republics"" as independent. By recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics, Putin is saying that ""Ukraine is illegitimate in claiming them,"" Schmidt said ""And when he claims them as independent republics, then they are -- in his mind and in Russian legal theory at that point -- capable of asking a neighboring country to assist,"" Schmidt said When the fighting stopped in 2015, the separatist ""republics"" only held around a third of the territory of Donbas that they claim should belong to them. As part of Russia’s invasion, it has launched a full-scale offensive from the separatist areas that it claims is to retake that territory. Many experts say Russia is using the separatist conflict as a pretext for forcing Ukraine to concede to Russian demands that it never join NATO and remain part of Moscow’s orbit. The two separatist regions -- likely enlarged -- could be important in any eventual peace agreement to end the fighting. Ganyard said that while Donetsk and Luhansk have been key to the start of the Russian invasion, they are also a vital ""piece of the puzzle"" to ending it. ""It's one thing to invade a country; it's another thing to hold it -- and it's particularly difficult if you don't have the support of the indigenous people,"" Ganyard said. ""If Ukraine has to give up the Donbas, it's probably not a deal killer. I think that might be part of the deal just to give Putin something to allow him to save face.""",,,,17

The 68-year-old told ABC's ""Nightline"" the situation has united his people in a way that caught Russian forces off guard. ""Russia has never in its history encountered such determination, such a high democratic spirit and spirit for freedom,"" Yushchenko told ABC News in a video interview from an undisclosed location in Ukraine. ""In terms of spirit, [of] understand[ing], a totalitarian Russia cannot defeat Ukraine."" Yushchenko, who served as the country's president from 2005 to 2010, said Ukraine has developed a democracy for the last 20 years despite internal bickering. ""Putin is in an absolute, extreme isolation and that is why, every day, his reputation as the Russian president declines and his political beliefs, including nuclear inclinations, are devaluing fast,"" he said. By comparison, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has worked hard to consolidate the Ukrainian nation, Yushchenko said. ""He’s doing very important work. It's possible,” he added, “that we've not been this united in 30 years. Tragedy and pain can unite."" Zelenskyy has continually released televised updates as Russian forces continue to launch missile attacks and advance on the ground into the country. Zelenskyy has said he is Russia’s number one target in this war, his family, the second. Yushchenko is no stranger to threats against his own life. He survived a dioxin poisoning in 2004 when he ran against a Kremlin-favored candidate for the presidency. Yushchenko's face was memorably heavily disfigured for years and some Ukrainian officials alleged that the Russian government was involved. The Kremlin has never officially responded to those allegations. Yushchenko said his country is appreciative of the steps taken by the U.S. and Western allies to help the Ukrainian people, including sanctions and aid, but he reiterated calls for a no-fly zone. The former president said ""the Achilles' heel of the Ukrainian defense"" is strategic Russian airstrikes. ""When we're talking about what Ukrainian soldiers want to have on the war field, any soldier's first sentence would be 'close airspace over Ukraine,'"" he said.

2022-03-06,https://abcnews.go.com/International/nato-implement-measures-isolate-putin-targets-civilians-analysis/story?id=83270236,NATO could implement measures to isolate Putin as he targets civilians: ANALYSIS,"The reports of Russia targeting civilian areas in Ukraine may not be surprising to most. Over the past decade, Russian President Vladimir Putin's military has allegedly killed thousands of civilians sheltering in cities across Syria. Putin reportedly used thermobaric weapons in attacks there to save Bashar Assad's regime. The Russian army was accused of killing Syrian civilians between May and July of 2016 with 47 separate cluster munition attacks. The Russian air force also conducted massive airstrikes, allegedly targeting civilians in Hama and Aleppo at schools and hospitals. Allegedly with Russian support, the Assad regime was accused of using chemical weapons in Douma, Syria, on April 7, 2018, reportedly killing between 40 and 50 people, including women and children. Together, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France responded on April 14, 2018, with airstrikes against regime facilities used to manufacture and facilitate the use of chemical weapons. Some experts fear Putin might turn to chemical weapons again, this time to terrorize the Ukrainian people if his military continues to perform poorly. Many believe he views chemical weapons as a legitimate means to fight in urban terrain to penetrate underground shelters, killing combatants and non-combatants alike. As the Russian military continues to fail in its efforts to conquer Ukraine, Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of turning to attacks against the civilian population and the use of weapons like cluster bombs and thermobaric munitions on residential areas. As a result of the Russian military's apparent inadequacies, many expect the targeting of Ukrainian civilians to increase. The International Criminal Court announced it has launched an investigation into allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed in Ukraine by Russia. Everyone in the Russian chain of command carrying out illegal orders to target civilians could be prosecuted under international law. And, if Russian officers can be positively identified, some will seek to publicly name them. If they travel anywhere outside of Russia, every country could be required to detain and deport them to the Hague. If they hide in Russia, no sanctions would be removed until Russia voluntarily sends them to the Hague. Officials across the world will look to consequences for countries and individuals who deliberately target innocent civilians. Targeting civilians is not what soldiers do. It's what war criminals do. At some point, the international community will ask: When do we stop Putin? After 5,000 Ukrainians are killed? 10,000? 100,000? Never? Do we take the risk of escalating the conflict with a nuclear-armed state run by a dictator? Along with severe sanctions, the United States could act to get Russia removed from the United Nations Security Council immediately. Countries could also expel all Russian diplomats, shuttering Russian embassies in the process, while making all of those that keep Putin in power for their benefit isolated by targeting the oligarchs and his inner circle. Putin wants to restore Russian power and prestige. The U.S. and its allies could seek to make it clear he knows that invading a sovereign country is not the path to achieve this; it is a path leading away from it. A key goal would be to ensure that Putin doesn't push his army further westward. NATO would establish a buffer zone dividing Russia from the rest of Europe, patrolled by NATO military aircraft and air defense systems. It would clarify to Putin that an incursion into another country neighboring by Russia will not be permitted. NATO's aim would be to not allow him to build up his forces to invade another country. Military deterrents would be accompanied by expediting the inclusion of Finland, Moldova, and Sweden into NATO if they request to join. President Putin might see that his actions have led to the very circumstances he claimed to be concerned were happening. Putin has already deemed NATO's current sanctions ""akin to a declaration of war."" But NATO could look past Russia's ""manufactured threats,"" choosing to moving forward with the defense of its member nations. NATO could isolate Russia economically, diplomatically, geographically, and double down on military support to the Ukrainians in their effort to save their country.

2022-03-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/red-hot-prices-gas-pump-set-soar-higher/story?id=83296829,Red-hot prices at the gas pump set to soar even higher. Here's why,"Red-hot prices at the pump are not only showing no signs of cooling down -- but are instead set to soar even higher. The national average price for a gallon of gas hit $4.06 on Monday, up a staggering 45 cents from a week ago, to reach its highest level since July 2008, according to AAA. Analysts say consumers can expect new record high gas prices as soon as this week, as strong demand and supply disruptions, fueled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, send crude oil prices soaring. ""A big price factor for the market is risk, and at the moment this entire escalation for the conflict appears very risky,"" AAA spokesperson Devin Gladden told ABC News. ""The market puts that risk premium back onto consumers."" GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan tweeted the national average for a gallon of gas has now increased at its fastest weekly pace since Hurricane Katrina, adding prices have already eclipsed their all-time highs, according to GasBuddy data. Crude oil surging as geopolitical risk rises Crude oil prices, which account for more than half of the cost of retail gasoline, have spiked roughly 30% in the nearly two weeks since the war began. ""The big question will be how high crude goes,"" Gladden said. Oil had already been edging higher at the start of the year, as consumer demand outpaced global supply. Major oil producers slashed supply during the pandemic – and it takes time to ramp up production again as more drivers hit the roads and travelers take flights, requiring more fuel. ""We were already in a relatively tight market,"" John Kilduff, an energy expert and partner at Again Capital, told ABC News. Traders fear the market will become even tighter if Russia's oil supply to the rest of the world is cut off. Russia is the third-largest producer of crude oil in the world, accounting for about 12 percent of global crude exports, according to the Information Energy Agency.""The problem is it's a global market,"" Kilduff said. Supply constraints There are already signs of supply constraints from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Analysts at J.P. Morgan estimated last week about 66% of Russian oil is currently struggling to find buyers. A growing number of companies are pulling business from Russia, facing hurdles from new sanctions on the banking and payments system, and fearing global backlash from customers. ""The commercial entities involved in this market are shunning the supply,"" Kilduff added. ""We are already in the process of losing a chunk of Russian crude oil supplies."" Import bans on Russian oil would further exacerbate supply shortages. While the U.S. only imports a fraction of its crude oil from Russia, analysts say a coordinated move between the U.S. and European allies would drastically alter supply to the critical European market. The International Energy Agency reported European countries imported 34% of their oil from Russia in November 2021, the latest month official oil statistics are available. Oil traders expect it will take time for other countries to ramp up production and fill the void if that supply is cut off. So as long as oil prices remain near multi-year highs in anticipation of further disruptions in the global market, consumers and businesses will feel the pinch. ""When the price of oil goes up, the cost of everything goes up because oil is used as a component in manufacturing and a range of products,"" AAA's Gladden said.",,,,23
2022-03-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-invokes-putins-dead-brother-accusing-russia-starving/story?id=83298231,Blinken invokes Putin's dead brother in accusing Russia of 'starving' Ukraine's cities,"As Russian forces continue to advance across Ukraine, the U.S. is accusing the Kremlin of ""starving"" besieged Ukrainian cities, in the words of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who on Monday appealed directly to Russian leader Vladimir Putin to ""end the war, end it now."" Blinken even appealed to Putin's family history, comparing the Kremlin's siege of Ukrainian cities to Nazi Germany's siege of Russian cities during World War II, which killed Putin's one-year-old brother Viktor. But amid calls like his, the Ukrainian government, led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is urging U.S. and Western leaders to do more -- beyond condemnations and the historic amount of defensive aid and provide warplanes, missile defense systems, and a no-fly zone. U.S. allies in the Baltics are increasingly nervous about Putin's advances in Ukraine, with Lithuania's president warning Monday that the strongman leader ""will not stop."" Blinken's visit is meant to reassure these NATO allies that the U.S. will defend ""every inch"" of member states' territory, as he reiterated Monday -- stopping short of promising to make permanent any U.S. military deployments to the region. Over 1.7 million Ukrainians have now fled the country from invading Russian forces, shelling and bombing cities across Ukraine and killing at least 406 civilians, according to the United Nations, which warned the actual figures are ""much higher."" After noting that huge spike in refugees, Blinken said alongside Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs, ""Many more people are trying to flee, but they cannot get out of besieged areas. ... Women and children, the elderly, wounded civilians, people with disabilities are trying to escape cities where there's no heat, no electricity, and where they're running out of food and medicine and there continue to be reports of attacks by Russian forces on agreed-upon humanitarian corridors."" Russia has denied that its forces have violated ceasefires over the weekend, but those claims were proven false by their continued shelling in cities like Mariupol in the south. These sieges echoed Nazi Germany's siege of Leningrad, Blinken said, where Nazi forces ""systematically starved and intentionally destroyed"" the city, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths, Blinken said. ""That siege affected millions of Russian families, including President Putin's, whose one-year-old brother was one of the many victims. Now, Russia is starving out cities like Mariupol. It is shameful. The world is saying to Russia stop these attacks immediately. Let the food and medicine in. Let the people out safely, and end this war of choice against Ukraine,"" he said. Putin's older brother Viktor died of diphtheria during the siege of Leningrad before Putin was born. Putin has claimed his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is about ""de-Nazifying"" the country's government, a lie that Holocaust museums and memorials have denounced as warping history -- including the Babyn Yar memorial in Kyiv that was damaged by Russian shelling. Blinken has previously invoked his own family history to condemn Putin's claim, as his stepfather was renowned writer and lawyer Samuel Pisar, who survived the Holocaust. The top U.S. diplomat's quick tour through the Baltic countries -- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- is meant to reassure these nervous NATO allies right on the frontlines of the war that the U.S. will defend them in the face of Russian aggression. That anxiety is apparent. Standing with Blinken, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda made a strong appeal earlier on Monday. ""Antony, deterrence is no longer enough, and we need forward defense here in place because otherwise it will be too late here, Mr. Secretary. Putin will not stop in Ukraine. He will not stop. It is our collective duty and obligation to help Ukraine with all means available and when I say all, I mean all means available if we want to avoid the Third World War. The choice is in our hands,"" he said during a photo op with Blinken. That ""forward defense"" means permanent deployment of U.S. forces. Latvian Foreign Minister Rinkēvičs made a similar public request, saying his country ""would like to have permanent solutions to this,"" but he smiled and said they ultimately defer to the U.S. Blinken made clear that no decision had been made yet on that, instead pointing repeatedly to the U.S. reinforcements that have arrived in recent weeks, including U.S. troops and the advanced F-35 fighter jets. The Biden administration is ""on a regular basis reviewing the global posture of our forces to include of course here in Europe and we have to factor in any developments, any changes in the threat, and we will do that,"" Blinken added. To those nervous smiles, Blinken also reiterated what Biden has said repeatedly: ""We will defend every inch of NATO territory against aggression coming from anywhere at any time. Our commitment to Article 5 -- an attack on one is an attack on all -- is ironclad. The president has called it sacrosanct. And no one -- no one -- should have any doubt about that."" But stopping that umbrella at protection at NATO's borders has been condemned by Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian leaders. ""We believe that the rejection of the idea of the no-fly zone is based in the lack of confidence in the strength of NATO as an alliance,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who met Blinken on Saturday at the Polish-Ukrainian border, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" Monday. ""The military might of NATO is incomparably bigger compared to Russia, so why would Russia dare to shoot down a NATO plane, knowing it is doomed, eventually doomed, if a war with NATO begins?"" he added. But that's precisely why, Blinken said, the Biden administration opposes a no-fly zone. ""Our efforts are all in the direction of ending this war as quickly as possible, ending the suffering as quickly as possible, and what we don't want to do is to widen it and to widen it to our own countries, to our own territory... [That] is in no one's interest, including in the interest of the Ukrainian people,"" he said Monday in Riga. Blinken also met with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid in Latvia's capital after Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's trip to Moscow over the weekend, saying the U.S. appreciate ""all efforts by friends and allies to look for a diplomatic resolution."" To that end, he has added a stop in Paris on Tuesday to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, who has also tried to play a mediating role. Blinken declined to comment on either country's efforts to reach out to Putin, but added, ""There's certainly no change in our message to Moscow, to Russia, to President Putin: End the war. End it now.""",,,,16
2022-03-08,https://abcnews.go.com/International/europes-unified-ukrainian-refugees-exposes-double-standard-nonwhite/story?id=83251970,Europe's unified welcome of Ukrainian refugees exposes 'double standard' for nonwhite asylum seekers: Experts,"Before Russian attacks on Ukraine led to mass displacement, Europe was already grappling with the Syrian refugee crisis – an issue that had bitterly divided European Union nations in recent years over what to do with the 1.1 million Syrians who sought refuge in Europe. Meanwhile, neighboring European nations have swiftly met the influx of more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24 with a united show of solidarity. Although it is unclear if disagreements over burden-sharing will follow, according to those who study migration in Europe, experts say Ukrainian refugees face a more welcoming environment because they are white. Andrew Geddes, Director of the Migration Policy Centre, told ABC News that there's a stark contrast between Europe's ""very warm welcome"" of Ukrainian refugees, compared to the largely ""hostile"" response to Syrians and other asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East. ""It's night and day,"" Geddes said. ""I think the strongest contrast is with a bunch of central European countries that were very hostile to Syrian refugees, and are now quite much more favorable to Ukrainian refugees,"" Geddes added, referencing Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic – European Union members that were ""the most resistant"" to welcoming Syrian refugees. Meanwhile, many nonwhite refugees fleeing Ukraine, including students from Asia and Africa, have reported instances of discrimination on the borders of Ukraine, with some telling ABC News that differential treatment based on race led to difficulties in crossing into countries like Poland. But others from Africans and the Middle East have said they crossed into Poland without any issues. United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees Filippo Grandi confirmed during a press conference last Tuesday that ""there are instances"" of differentiation of treatment at the borders based on race, but said he was assured that ""these are not state policies."" Grandi said he met with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau last Wednesday, who ""affirmed Poland's commitment to continue receiving all those fleeing, without distinction."" Meanwhile, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba responded to reports of discrimination last Tuesday, tweeting that ""Ukraine's government spares no effort to solve the problem."" He also added that Ukraine set up an emergency hotline to assist African, Asian and other students seeking to leave Ukraine. 'Exclusionary' asylum policies European countries host over 1 million of the 6.6 million Syrian asylum-seekers and refugees, but the vast majority are hosted by only two countries – 59% in Germany and 11% in Sweden, according to United Nations High Commission on Refugees data. But according to Kelly Petillo, coordinator of the Middle East and North Africa programme and the European Council on Foreign Relations, this ""didn't come immediately."" ""It came after quite a bit of internal back and forth and lack of disagreement,"" Petillo said, adding that the majority of Syrian refugees were allowed to enter Europe in 2016 -- four years after the war in Syria began -- only after the European Union struck a deal with Turkey, which was facing immense pressure at the time from the surge of migrants and asylum seekers. The Europe Union provided financial support to Turkey to slow the flow of migrants and asylum seekers crossing into Europe by returning ""irregular migrants"" attempting to enter Europe through Greece to Turkey, as Turkey works ""to prevent new migratory routes from opening,"" according to the Migration Policy Centre. As part of the deal, which was intended to slow migration to Europe, ""the European Union agreed to resettle Syrian refugees from Turkey on a one-to-one basis,"" per MPC, and the European Union also paid 6 billion euros to aid Turkey's Syrian migrant communities. ""Since the Syria crisis erupted more than 10 years ago, we've seen that there was a high level of reluctancy from Europeans to share the burden amongst themselves,"" Petillo said. Austria, Greece, the Netherlands and France host between 2 to 5% of Syrian refugees in Europe, and other countries host below 2%, according to UNHCR. Some of the Eastern European countries that largely rejected Syrian refugees have been at the forefront of welcoming Ukrainians, Geddes said, pointing to Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. ""For migrants from outside of Europe ... it's a very, very powerful, exclusionary approach,"" Geddes said. ""The EU is much more willing to internalize a refugee situation where the people who are being forced to flee are white Europeans, and has been much more reluctant to offer protection for people who are from Africa and the Middle East,"" he added. And that ""double standard,"" Petillo said, is not only shaped by race, religion and culture, but also by politics. Poland received 1.2 million of those fleeing Ukraine, according to UNHCR data, and on Friday Polish President Andrzej Duda toured a border crossing facility in Korczowa, where he met with Ukrainian refugees and told reporters that Poland would welcome them with open hearts. Geddes said that Poland's handling of the Syrian refugee crisis was the ""opposite."" As Poland continued to push back against pressure from the European Union to take in asylum seekers from Syria, Jarosław Kaczyński, leader of Poland's rightwing party and current Deputy Prime Minister, argued in 2017 that doing so would be ""dangerous"" and would ""completely change our culture and radically lower the level of safety in our country."" The European Union's top court ruled in April 2020 that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic broke EU law by refusing to host refugees to relieve some of the burden from countries like Turkey and Greece. And in November 2021, Poland was ""involved in a military standoff"" with Belarus to prevent asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East from crossing the Polish border, Geddes said. More than 2,000 people were trapped in a makeshift camp on the Belarusian side as Poland blocked aid. At least 15 died in the cold last year. And in January, Poland began building a metal wall on the border of Belarus to block migrants. ""When it comes down to it, Ukrainians are seen as European,"" Geddes said, saying that there are ""very strong"" historical and cultural links between Poland and Ukraine -- Many refugees from Ukraine have family and friends in Poland who have taken them in. Meanwhile, asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East ""are fundamentally seen as being different, racially, socially, culturally,"" he added. Islamophobia and politics Those sentiments, which Petillo described as ""othering,"" were evident over the past week in the rhetoric of several prominent political leaders and various Western media figures, who made controversial statements that went viral on social media. One journalist described Ukrainians as ""civilized"" in an attempt to differentiate them from other refugees and others suggested that it's more difficult to witness the plight of Ukrainians because they ""look like us."" ""These people are intelligent, they are educated people,"" Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said of Ukrainians earlier this week, according to The Associated Press. ""... This is not the refugee wave we have been used to, people we were not sure about their identity, people with unclear pasts, who could have been even terrorists."" And Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who declared, ""we're letting everyone in,"" regarding Ukrainian refugees, has made an anti-immigration platform a central part of his reelection campaign, arguing that an influx of non-Christian migrants is a threat to the culture. ""We do not want to be an immigrant country,"" Orban said in January, according to The Associated Press. In the wake of the global War on Terror following the 9/11 terror attacks, Petillo said that Islamophobic language that ""linked terrorism to Islam"" became common in a ""dangerous"" political discourse regarding refugees from the Middle East. Geddes said those anti-immigrant sentiments have been weaponized by various leaders of ""the radical right"" in Europe and ""played a part in this exclusionary approach to migration."" At the height of the refugee crisis in 2015, Czech President Milos Zeman referred to the influx of Syrian and Iraqi refugees seeking asylum in Europe as ""an organized invasion."" Meanwhile, the Czech Republic has so far welcomed tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees, per UNHCR. Slovakia, which has so far taken in more than 140,000 Ukrainian refugees, per UNHCR data, said in 2015 that it would only accept Christians from Syria, according to The Associated Press. According to Geddes, while other European countries were not as ""explicit"" as Slovakia in favoring Christians, they did so ""implicitly"" with their policies. In a historic vote, the European Union agreed on Thursday to give Ukrainians immediate temporary protective status that allows them to work and live in EU countries and provides them with access to health care and other social services. This marks the first time that the EU has invoked this protection since it became a part of EU law two decades ago, Geddes said. Although Germany and Sweden have made some efforts to provide protections for Syrian refugees, many remain ""stuck in limbo"" without access to employment, education or other social services, Petillo said. ""[They're] not coming out officially with policies saying we want Syrians to return, but they're doing anything they can to disincentivize Syrian refugees from staying,"" Petillo said, adding that ongoing humanitarian crises have led to an ongoing flow of refugees to Europe. Since 2014, more than 20,000 asylum seekers from the Middle East, Asia and Africa arriving to the Mediterranean by land or by sea in hopes of crossing into Europe have died – some drowning – or gone missing, per UNHCR data, including 154 so far in 2022.",,,,2
2022-03-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/putin-angry-frustrated-cia-director-double-ukraine/story?id=83318093,"Putin 'angry and frustrated,' CIA director says, likely to 'double down' in Ukraine","Top U.S. intelligence agency officials on Tuesday offered a sobering assessment of Russian President Vladimir Putin's objectives in Ukraine, and how the invasion could affect the safety and security of the United States. ""The [Intelligence Community], as you know, provided warning of President Putin's plans, but this is a case where I think all of us wish we had been wrong,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the House Intelligence Committee at its annual hearing on worldwide threats. Russia's failure to rapidly seize Kiev and overwhelm Ukrainian forces has deprived Moscow of the quick military victory they probably had originally expected would prevent the United States and NATO from being able to provide meaningful military aid to Ukraine."" Adding that the U.S. is seeing an ""ill-constructed plan, morale issues and considerable logistical issues"" among Russian troops, Haines said it is ""unclear"" whether Russia will pursue a plan to capture all of Ukraine, but that it's already loosening its rules of engagement. ""Russian forces are at the very least operating with reckless disregard for the safety of noncombatants, as Russian units launch artillery and airstrikes into urban areas as they have done in cities across Ukraine and near critical infrastructures such as the nuclear plant, and the IC is engaged across the interagency to document and hold Russia and Russian actors accountable for their actions,"" she said. ""We assess Putin feels aggrieved. The West has not given proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,"" Haines said. CIA Director William Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow who has studied Putin for years, concurred that the Russian president is ""angry and frustrated"" by the situation in Ukraine, and will likely step up his efforts. ""He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,"" Burns testified. ""He has no sustainable political endgame in the face of what is going to continue to be fierce resistance from Ukrainians."" ""Putin has commented privately and publicly over the years that he doesn't believe Ukraine's a real country,"" Burns continued. ""He's dead wrong about that -- real countries fight back. And that's what the Ukrainians have done quite heroically over the last 12 days."" ""I think he's been unsettled by the Western reaction and allied resolve particularly some of the decisions the German government has taken. I think he's been unsettled by the performance of his own military,"" he said. ""The big countries don't get to swallow up small countries just because they can."" He called Putin's actions in the past two weeks ""premeditated and savage."" Asked about Putin's mental state, Burns did not answer directly, but did say Putin's views on Ukraine have ""hardened over the years."" ""I think he's far more insulated from other points of view and people who would challenge or question his views in but in my opinion that doesn't make him crazy, but it makes them extremely difficult to deal with because of the hardening of his views over time and a narrowing of his inner circle,"" he said. National Security Agency Director Gen. Paukl Nakasone said the U.S. had gamed out scenarios for a Russian cyberattack. ""We have to get better , we have to harden our infrastructure and have ability to be resilient,"" he said.

2022-03-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/95-putins-forces-intact-plan-surround-kyiv-pentagon/story?id=83317142,"95% of Putin's forces still intact, plan to surround Kyiv: Pentagon update","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Tuesday: Russian forces mostly still intact Nearly all Russian forces arrayed at the Ukrainian border for the invasion have now gone in, according to the official. Despite losing troops, ground vehicles and aircraft in the fighting, the official estimated these forces remain roughly 95% intact. Russian ground efforts stalled in the north Russian troops approaching Kyiv have made little progress in recent days, according to the official. ""We continue to see Ukrainian resistance efforts slow down the Russians, particularly in the north,"" the official said. Another factor is that ""they still seem to be plagued by logistics and sustainment challenges,"" including fuel and food shortages, the official said. The Pentagon also continues to see fighting and resistance against the Russian advance in the northern cities of Chernihiv and Kharkiv. The farthest the main Russian force heading to Kyiv seems to have been able to reach is Hostomel Airport, a site of intense combat some 20 miles northwest of the city. But their intent is clear, the official said: ""We still have every reason to assess that their effort is to encircle and force the surrender of Kiev."" A new Russian approach emerges Further out than those advance troops, a Russian push toward the capital is emerging in the northeast, just above the town of Sumy, the official said. These troops are roughly 37 miles from Kyiv. Russians try to ""sow fear and confusion"" in the city While the main invading force has not reached Kyiv, the official was in ""no position to refute"" reports of minor, isolated skirmishes between Russian ""reconnaissance elements"" and Ukrainian forces inside the city. ""We think that these reports of street fighting in Kyiv are really the result of their efforts to sow fear and confusion and and try to set the stage for what could be coming later,"" the official said. Strikes on civilians continue Russian air and missile attacks are increasing as their ground effort has been frustrated, according to the official. ""Whether intentionally or not, they're hitting military and government infrastructure as well as residential areas and civilian targets,"" the official said. Russians see more success in the south Russian troops advancing to the northwest out of Crimea are about 25 miles from Mykolayiv, the official said. The official noted that while there is speculation that the move on Mykolayiv is meant to put troops in position to attack the port city of Odessa from the north as amphibious troops assault from the coast, ""we don't see any evidence of amphibious landings"" at this point. On the Sea of Azov coast, Russian forces have isolated Mariupol and continue to bombard it with long-range attacks. Thousands of troops put ashore in an amphibious landing on the second day of the invasion are approaching the city from the southwest as more troops push down from Donetsk. U.S.-Russia deconfliction line in working order Last week Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced it had set up a ""deconfliction line"" with Russia to ""reduce the chances of miscalculations and try to bring down the tensions as that contested airspace over Ukraine now bumps up against NATO airspace."" The senior defense official said that as of Tuesday, the two countries have used the line about a dozen times, but so far only for test calls to make sure ""somebody's picking up on the other end."" A problem for any proposed no-fly zone ""Much of the airspace of Ukraine, north and south, is under some umbrella of Russian surface-to-air missile capability,"" the official said.",,,,6
2022-03-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-ban-russian-oil-imports-energy-products/story?id=83315763,"Biden announces ban on Russian oil imports, other energy products","President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. will ban imports of Russian oil and other energy products, but will not be joined in doing so by many European allies and partners. The move is expected to trigger sharply higher gasoline and other energy prices in the U.S. and worldwide. Speaking from the White House, he said ""the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia's economy"" and said it means ""the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine."" The decision was made in ""close consultation"" with U.S. allies, Biden said, some of whom he said would not be ""in a position"" to do the same, but he stressed the alliance remained united. Biden has been under growing political pressure from both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill to go forward with a ban even though the White House had initially resisted, saying it wasn't in the U.S. ""strategic interest"" to limit the world's energy supply and drive up gasoline prices. On Monday, top lawmakers announced they had come to a deal on bipartisan legislation that would punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, by banning the import of Russian oil and other energy products -- as well as suspending normal trade relations with Russia and a House vote was expected this week. Biden's announcement is likely to cause gasoline prices in the U.S. -- already at record highs -- to soar even higher. ""I'm going to do everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home,"" Biden said. ""To the oil and gas companies and to the finance firms that back them, we understand Putin's war against the people of Ukraine is causing prices to rise. We get that. That's self-evident,"" he said. ""But, it's no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits or any kind of effort to exploit the situation or -- American consumers, exploit them. Russia's aggression is costing us all. And it's no time for profiteering or price gouging. I want to be clear about what we'll not tolerate."" As he arrived in Fort Worth, Texas, Tuesday afternoon, Biden took a quick question from reporters about his message on gas prices. ""They're gonna go up,"" Biden said. ""Can't do much right now. Russia's responsible,"" he added. About 8% of U.S. imports of crude oil and petroleum products came from Russia last year, according to preliminary U.S. government data; 3% of U.S. oil came from Russia. White House officials also say the impact on Russia, which sent just 1% of its oil exports to the U.S. in 2020, would not be great -- especially when its oil and gas sector is already ""de facto sanctioned"" because of harsh restrictions on Russian banks. But in an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll last week, 69% of Americans said they supported economic sanctions on Russia even if they resulted in higher energy prices in the U.S. There is less appetite in Europe for a ban on Russian oil and gas imports, since European nations rely heavily on Russia for their energy needs -- nearly half of Russian oil exports go to Europe, according to U.S. government figures -- and analysts say a ban would raise Europe's energy prices significantly.",,,,23
2022-03-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-pleads-western-war-planes-us-deliver/story?id=83298160,Ukraine pleads for Western warplanes. Will the US help deliver?,"Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made repeated and passionate pleas now for the U.S. and NATO to implement a 'no-fly' zone over his country and ground Russian warplanes -- through intimidation or force. But he's also made another ask -- one that President Joe Biden's administration said it is working with allies like Poland to facilitate -- for fighter jets to replenish the Ukrainian air force. ""We know where these Soviet planes are stationed, which countries host them, and we asked these countries,"" Zelenskyy told ABC News's David Muir in an exclusive interview Monday, adding Biden ""can do more, I'm sure he can, and I would like to believe that, that he's capable of doing that."" U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have said the administration is working to address this, including by possibly replenishing Poland's air force with U.S. jets. But amid growing pressure from U.S. lawmakers to do so, the White House and Pentagon said Monday it's not as simple as handing over keys -- especially as Russian leader Vladimir Putin eyes growing Western military aid for Ukraine as inching toward a direct role in the war. ""We are not, certainly, preventing or blocking or discouraging Poland -- that is, they are a sovereign country. They make their own decisions. But it is not as easy as moving planes around,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. ""It's just a discussion about the possibility of, should there be a nation that would want to give aircraft to the Ukrainians and would ask for a backfill from the United States -- should that happen, what would that look like?"" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said shortly after. Putin has warned that any country attempting to implement a 'no-fly' zone over Ukraine would ""immediately"" become ""party to the military conflict"" -- the kind of slide to a wider war that U.S. and NATO officials said they're working to avoid. But U.S. officials are concerned that increasing U.S. military support to include warplanes could be seen as a step too far for Putin, too. In dramatic fashion, the U.S. and several Western countries have shifted what aid they're willing to provide, including shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles known as Stingers. Germany, long opposed to providing lethal military aid to war zones, has moved to boost its defense spending and agreed to provide Stingers as well. Whereas the Obama administration once held off on providing anti-tank missiles known as Javelins, the Biden administration and other U.S. allies have provided thousands in just the last couple weeks, according to a U.S. official. But so far, that line has been drawn at military aircraft and advanced missile defense systems. ""In addition to assisting getting the Ukrainians fighter aircraft and letting them fly out of Polish airfields with full NATO protection, we need to provide them medium- and long-range air defense systems,"" said Mick Mulroy, a former top Pentagon official and retired CIA officer. ""The Stinger system is very effective, but its range is limited. Russian planes are flying at altitudes that make them out of reach."" Polish officials have expressed strong opposition and deep concerns about precisely that, with the fear that Putin would strike Polish airfields for supporting Ukrainian fighter jets. Psaki brushed aside Putin's role, telling reporters, ""We're not waiting for the advice of Vladimir Putin on what we're going to do here as it relates to backfilling planes."" But she added again it's Poland's right to decide. For now, it seems Warsaw is the one opposed. The Polish prime minister's office called reports the country would provide Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets and Su-25 attack aircraft ""FAKE NEWS‼️"" in a tweet Sunday -- adding, ""Poland won't send its fighter jets to #Ukraine as well as allow to use its airports. We significantly help in many other areas."" It's possible the U.S. could provide enough protection to calm Polish nerves and enough support to make it worth Poland's while, according to some analysts. Chief among them would be giving Poland more F-16 fighter aircraft. But that's a lengthy process that could leave Poland without air cover as it waits on those U.S. replacement jets. Either way, Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials said they need air support now, including during a briefing Zelenskyy held with more than 300 U.S. lawmakers and staff on Saturday that bolstered bipartisan support for his government. In the days since, several top lawmakers have publicly urged the Biden administration to ensure Ukraine gets more warplanes, including several top Democrats openly pressuring the president. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in a letter Monday to push NATO allies to provide aircraft ""without delay."" ""Asking them to provide their own aircraft, especially as Russia's military aggression edges closer to their own borders, would be unthinkable except in the direst circumstances. Unfortunately, that is the situation the world faces. Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures and sacrifices,"" he wrote to the cabinet officials. In the meantime, some 70% of the latest package of U.S. military assistance -- which totaled $350 million and brought aid in the last year to $1 billion -- is already in Ukrainian hands, Blinken said Monday. But he conceded Russia's military outguns and outmans Ukraine's, saying the Kremlin has ""the ability to continue to grind down the Ukrainian military and, of course, to take horrific actions against the Ukrainian people, including attacking civilians.""

Results show a deeply divided country with 48.56% of ballots going to Yoon, and his rival Lee Jae-myung of the ruling Democratic Party garnering 47.83%. The race had been marred by negative campaigning plagued by a series of scandals involving corruption, malfeasance and even rumors about wives and a child. Yoon, set to serve a five-year term, will lead Asia's fourth-largest economy which has been hit hard by the pandemic, surging home prices and still faces threats from North Korea's nuclear weapons program. His biggest foreign policy challenge will be to navigate his country stuck in between growing rivalry among two of its biggest trading partners, the U.S. and China. As president he is likely to revive conservative foreign policies by taking a tougher stance against North Korea centered around a stronger U.S. alliance. ""Peace can only be maintained when there is strong deterrence. A war can only be prevented by securing a preemptive strike capability and showing the will to pursue it. As we have seen in Ukraine, a country's national security and peace cannot be protected by paper and ink,"" he said during a presidential debate last month. A newcomer into politics, Yoon spent 27 years of his entire career as a prosecutor rising to prominence by prosecuting big political players. His team of conservative policy specialists will likely advocate a militarily stronger South Korea with heavy investments in national defense. ""A sense of national security crisis have heightened in South Korea as North Korea's nuclear threat intensifies and also especially after Russia invaded Ukraine. Yoon will make a rational decision,"" Bong Youngshik of Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies told ABC News. Yoon was also open to seeking additional deployment of the U.S. THAAD anti-missile system into his country as deterrence from North Korea's nuclear threats. ""He will demand North Korea to denuclearize before any negotiations. Instead of pursuing dialogue, Yoon intends to deploy additional units of the U.S. THAAD anti-missile system and strengthen joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises in proportion to North Korea's missile threats."" Cheong Seong-Chang, researcher at the Seoul-based Sejong Institute, told ABC News. ""Yoon's government will take a different stance from the Moon administration in dealing with North Korea. He won't be offering sanctions relief unless North Korea makes significant steps to denuclearize, if there happens to be any."" Shin Beom Chul, director of the Center for Diplomacy and Security at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, told ABC News.

""When you're in space and you're flying around the Earth at 17,500 miles an hour and in a very hazardous environment, cooperation is the most important thing,"" said former astronaut Scott Kelly. The ISS is divided into two sections: the Russian Orbital Segment operated by Russia and the United States Orbital Segment run by the U.S. American and Russian astronauts were the first to step inside the ISS in 1998. Watch the full story on ""ABCNL Prime"" TONIGHT at 9 p.m. ET on ABC. From there, the partnership has continued. When the U.S. shuttle program ended in 2011, U.S. astronauts like Cady Coleman relied exclusively on Russian rockets to get her on board the station. Coleman said once on board the craft, where you came from didn't matter, and it was all about how to work and live with one another. ""Space is hard and space is dangerous. And in my experience ... with our Russian partners it means sitting down, having a meal together,"" said Coleman. ""It means talking about what's hard for you, what's hard for them and how together we can get this accomplished. [We] look each other in the eye and realize that we're all about the same thing."" Coleman said that American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts would cooperate on everything from life-or-death missions to the mundane. ""I was up there with the three Russian cosmonauts,"" said Coleman.""[We] share a goal of exploring space ... and that goal doesn't change whether we're on the Earth or living up on the space station."" NASA's reliance on Russian rockets ended in 2020 when SpaceX debuted its Crew Dragon Capsule, but talks are underway to allow Russians on future SpaceX flights. Russian cosmonauts continue to train at NASA's facility in Houston. Astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who holds the ongoing record for longest space flight, is set to end his 355 days in space in just three weeks. The plan is for him to land in Kazakhstan with two Russian cosmonauts on a Russian spacecraft. But unprecedented sanctions against Russia could put Vande Hei's return on hold. After Russia invaded Ukraine nearly two weeks ago, President Joe Biden announced new sanctions, including cutting more than half of Russia's high-tech imports. ""It'll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program,"" Biden said during a White House address Feb. 24. Shortly after the remarks, NASA released a statement on U.S.-Russian civil space cooperation, saying that ""no changes are planned"" and that the agency will continue to support ""ongoing in orbit and ground station operations."" Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia's Space Agency and a close ally to Russian President Vladimir Putin, responded to Biden in a series of hostile tweets. On Feb. 26, he posted a video in Russian that threatened to leave Vande Hei behind in space and detach Russia's segment of the space station altogether. Kelly said he felt compelled to speak up and engaged with Rogozin on Twitter. ""I was just enraged that he, the [cosmonauts], said that they were going to leave an American crew member behind. I never thought I would ever hear anything so outrageous,"" said Kelly. NASA has remained silent on Rogozin's threats to abandon Vande Hei in space. Prior to the conflict in Ukraine, Russia had announced plans to pull out of the space station as early as 2025. Although war continues to wage on Earth, Kelly said he hopes that the U.S.-Russian partnership in space can be mended. ""I've known [people at the Russian Space Agency], many of them for well over two decades, I trust them. I've literally trusted them with my life before,"" said Kelly, who added that the U.S. should still ""prepare for the worst"" and ""hope for the best."" Kelly said the ISS is an example of where peace is possible because all astronauts share a common goal: to explore and learn. ""I just hope people realize and want to keep this partnership together because it is one of the few things that unites all of humanity together,"" said Kelly. ""I think one of the biggest successes of the International Space Station is the international aspect of giving us something to work on together, that makes us friends.""",,,,8
2022-03-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russias-dumb-munitions-causing-civilian-casualties-pentagon-update/story?id=83340613,Russia's use of 'dumb' munitions causing more civilian casualties: Pentagon update,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what defense officials told reporters on Wednesday: Pentagon against rejects sending fighter jets to Ukraine On Tuesday evening, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby dismissed a surprise offer from Poland to send all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. air base in Germany ""and place them at the disposal"" of the U.S. government. ""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said in a statement, adding that ""we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one."" On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to his Polish counterpart about the MiG-29 offer, thanking him for Poland's willingness to help Ukraine, but rejecting the notion of using the U.S. as an intermediary for any aircraft transfer. ""He stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either,” Kirby said during a press conference at the Pentagon. Kirby characterized the idea as high risk, low reward -- the risk being possible escalation by Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""The intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of military escalation with NATO,"" he said. In addition to that risk, the U.S. believes other forms of military support are more effective. ""We believe the best way to support Ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems that they need most to defeat Russian aggression,"" Kirby said. ""In particular, anti-armor and air defense."" The U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military aid into Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons such as the Javelin and Stinger systems. Earlier on Wednesday, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Russian anti-air capability now spans much of Ukrainian airspace, which also makes aircraft less viable in the fight against the invaders. Kirby added that the Ukrainian air force still has several squadrons of ""fully mission-capable"" aircraft of its own. ""We assess that adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities. While the U.S. has rejected the idea for now, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has continued to call for more aircraft. ""This is about people's lives. We ask again: make the decision faster. Don't throw the responsibility -- send us the jets,"" Zelenskyy said in a Wednesday speech. And the skies above Ukraine are not yet dominated by Russia. On Wednesday morning, the U.K. Ministry of Defense tweeted an intelligence update saying ""Ukrainian air defenses appear to have enjoyed considerable success against Russia's modern combat aircraft, probably preventing them from achieving any degree of control of the air."" ""Although Russian air capabilities are significant, their effectiveness has been limited due to Ukrainian ... air-defense systems, surface-to-air missiles, and MANPADS,"" Kirby said. Patriot batteries arrive in Poland Late on Tuesday evening, U.S. European Command confirmed that two Patriot anti-missile systems already in Europe would be moved to Poland. By Wednesday they had arrived, according to the senior U.S. defense official. ""We're not going to talk about where they are, I'm not going to talk about their operational status, but they are in Poland and they are manned,"" the official said. The Patriot systems are capable of detecting and intercepting incoming ballistic missiles. Russian missiles and 'dumb' munitions Russia has now fired more than 710 missiles against Ukraine, with about half launched from within Ukraine using mobile platforms, according to the official. The U.S. has also seen indications Russia is using ""dumb"" munitions, meaning ordnance that is not precision-guided. The official said it is not clear if these imprecise weapons are being used as part of the original Russian plan or due to problems with their guided missile targeting process. ""What we see manifested is increasing damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties,"" the official said. Russian combat power Russia has about 90% of its invading combat power still intact, the official said. On Tuesday, the estimate was 95%, but the official emphasized that these numbers are rough estimates, so it doesn't necessarily mean 5% of Russian forces were taken out of the fight overnight. No sign Putin preparing reserve forces The U.S. still sees no indications Putin is trying to gather any more troops in addition to the more than 150,000 originally designated for the invasion, the official said. Russia's ground effort Since Tuesday, Russians have further closed in on Kharkiv, gaining about 12 miles of ground. ""It's still heavy, heavy fighting there,"" the official said. ""We don't assess that they've taken the city by any means."" The U.S. has not seen any significant Russian movement toward Kyiv or Chernihiv in the last 24 hours, and there is still no sign of an an immanent amphibious assault on Odessa. Ukrainians have mounted a strong resistance in Mariupol, but Russians continue to surround and bombard the city.",,,,11
2022-03-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-rejects-polands-plan-make-us-provide-ukraine/story?id=83324397,Pentagon again rejects Poland's plan to make US provide Ukraine fighter jets,"The Pentagon on Wednesday, for the second day in a row, rejected a plan by Poland to provide Ukraine with its Soviet-era warplanes through U.S. hands, saying the proposal would risk wider war between Russia and NATO. Poland's announcement Tuesday, which shocked U.S. officials, peaked hope in Ukraine that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's calls for more fighter jets would be answered. But Poland's proposal essentially punted the responsibility to the U.S. by calling for America to take control of the MiG-29 fighter jets at a U.S. air base in Germany and then provide them to Ukraine -- an idea the Pentagon roundly rejected as ""not tenable."" Hours after the White House left the door open to a deal Wednesday, saying ""logistical and operational"" details were being discussed among the U.S., its NATO allies, and Ukraine, there was another surprise: The Pentagon roundly rejected the idea altogether. ""We do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian Air Force at this time and, therefore, have no desire to see them in our custody either,"" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday. The back-and-forth by both NATO allies has sparked confusion and exasperation. Poland originally opposed a transfer while the U.S. backed it -- until Poland suddenly proposed doing so through the U.S., which now opposes it. ""This is not pingpong. This is about people's lives. We ask again -- make the decision faster. Don't throw the responsibility. Send us the jets,"" Zelenskyy said in a speech Wednesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, recounting what she said was a 45-minute call with Zelenskyy about the U.S. providing lethal aid, said, ""He wants the planes, the planes, the planes."" Russia has warned any country from allowing Ukraine to use its airfields to support military aircraft, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Wednesday, ""This is an extremely undesirable and potentially dangerous scenario."" U.S. intelligence has concluded the same thing, according to Kirby, who added that sending Ukraine additional fighter jets is not what Kyiv needs now in its fight against invading Russian forces and their overwhelming bombardment. ""There are alternative options that are much better suited to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia. We will continue to pursue those options,"" Kirby told reporters Wednesday. Ukraine's air force already has ""several squadrons of fully mission capable aircraft,"" he added, and the U.S. instead plans to continue providing ""the systems that they need most to defeat Russian aggression -- in particular, anti-armor and air defense."" The U.S. has provided Ukraine with Stinger missiles -- shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles that previous administrations had viewed as too escalatory to provide. The United Kingdom announced Wednesday it would provide its similar system known as Starstreak. But for now, the U.S. is drawing the line against fighter jets, which U.S. officials say would be logistically difficult to deliver to Ukraine without risking Russian retaliation. ""The intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of the military escalation with NATO,"" Kirby said. Just days ago, however, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. had given ""a green light"" to Poland to provide the planes directly to Ukraine, although he said it was Poland's choice. Polish officials opposed the idea, fearing exactly the scenario Kirby laid out -- with Russian strikes on Polish airfields. The Polish prime minister's office even called reports the country would provide warplanes ""FAKE NEWS‼️"" in a tweet Sunday. But two days later, Poland stunned the U.S. by saying it would provide over two dozen MiG-29 fighter jets to the U.S. ""immediately and free of charge,"" sending them to Ramstein Air Base and ""at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America."" ""That actually was a surprise move by the Poles,"" Victoria Nuland, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, told the Senate hours later, adding, ""It wasn't pre-consulted with us."" Surprise turned to opposition, with the Pentagon calling the plan ""not tenable"" for the risk it would pose to U.S. service members. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called Polish Minister of National Defense Mariusz Błaszczak Wednesday, thanking him, but expressing outright opposition, per Kirby. Western countries have significantly escalated their military aid to Ukraine, providing thousands of anti-tank missiles in recent weeks alone, according to a U.S. official. But warplanes now seem to be a step too far, along with a no-fly zone. U.S. and NATO officials have repeatedly warned their forces will not get involved in the conflict in any way, fearing a Russian attack that could quickly spiral into war between nuclear-armed states. Calls for a ""limited"" no-fly zone -- over western Ukraine to allow for refugees to exit and aid to enter, or over humanitarian corridors -- have fallen flat, too. ""Introducing, in our case, American service members in Ukraine, on Ukrainian territory or soil, or American pilots into Ukrainian airspace, whether on a full or on a limited basis, would almost certainly lead to direct conflict between the United States, between NATO and Russia, and that would expand the conflict. It would prolong it. It would make it much more deadlier than it already is,"" Blinken said Wednesday. To some analysts, a no-fly zone would not be a silver bullet here either, with the Kremlin using long-range artillery, even indiscriminate shelling, to grind Ukrainian forces and civilian targets down. Russia has now launched more than 710 missiles against Ukraine -- about half of which have been launched from within Russian territory, according to a senior U.S. defense official. ""The best way to help protect the skies is through anti-air weaponry, which the U.K. is now going to be supplying to Ukraine,"" British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said alongside Blinken at the State Department. While the Biden administration has said repeatedly it's consulting with allies and partners on what other military aid to provide, it's unclear what else it could be. Some 75 percent of a $350 million package approved by Biden late last month has already made it into Ukrainian hands, according to officials. But beyond individual missiles, the U.S. may be considering anti-missile batteries like the Patriot system. Nuland declined to speak publicly about that option, but told a Senate panel Tuesday there are ""other things"" on Ukraine's ""list that we think we can do, and I'll leave it at that.""

2022-03-10,https://abcnews.go.com/International/strangers-african-students-ukraine-amid-russian-invasion/story?id=83301114,How 2 strangers came together to help African students in Ukraine amid the Russian invasion,"The two women had never met in a real life, but through social media they found a common interest: helping African students stranded in Ukraine during the Russian invasion. Patricia Daley and Tokunbo Koiki, both Black British women, said they were appalled hearing reports of discrimination against minority refugees from Ukraine as they tried to cross into European countries. After seeing a Twitter thread on Africans struggling during the crisis, Daley said she reached out to people on the site to see how she could help and was connected to Tokunbo, who was doing the same. ""As soon as we found out...and the police were heavily discriminating against black and brown individuals. We started up an organization to support these individuals, make it so that they would not be prosecuted,” Daley, an attorney and activist, told ABC News. Koiki, a social worker, says she knew she had to help because it “aligns with who I am.” “I decided to use a blanket “black in Ukraine” hashtag that was already being used previously for our campaign because I wanted to highlight and I want to put focus on the situation… I'm used to helping you know, jumping in and doing what I can where I can,” Koiki told ABC News. So far, Daley and Koiki said they have raised over 100,000 dollars on GoFundMe, created a place for Africans in Ukraine to connect on the texting app Telegram and have helped hundreds of mostly African but also Caribbean students get out of the country safely. They said they are also working to help another 300 individuals who are still in Ukraine, including Bukala Adu, a Nigerian medical student at Sumy State University. “We are literally stuck here. Food is running short…So the situation here, day by day gets kind of worse. I don't know how it's going to be in a couple of days from now, we really need to leave here right now,” Adu told ABC News. According to data from Ukraine's Ministry of Education and Science, in 2019 there were about 80,000 international students studying in Ukraine from 158 countries. The majority of these students -- about 23% -- come from India, followed by Morocco, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Nigeria. Adu says her school continued holding classes right up until the first attack. “It’s really hard because I don't think anybody wants to be in a condition where they can’t sleep completely because you have to [look out and see] when there is going to be an explosion,"" Adu said. ""So it's actually really scary because when you hear like gunshots or explosions, you have to run to the bunker."" While Adu has not yet tried to leave Ukraine herself, she says she was not surprised to learn of the reports of discrimination against minorities trying to cross the border into other countries. “I would say I don't really experience much of racism, but based on my friends and complaints, they have a darker skin complexion than I do,"" Adu said. ""They complain that they see racism…I feel really upset because I don't know why people should be seeing colors. We are all human beings, so we should all be treated like human beings shouldn't be differentiated. “I think it's very upsetting and disheartening to hear that these students not only have to deal with the fear of fleeing a war, on top of that to deal with discrimination and racial prejudices that we have to deal with every day,"" Daley said. As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, thousands are still struggling to find a way out, with many minorities facing additional hardships. Many Africans living in Ukraine have reported being denied entry to neighboring countries like Poland. ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine has affected Ukrainians and non-citizens in many devastating ways. Africans seeking evacuation are our friends and need to have equal opportunities to return to their home countries safely,"" Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba tweeted in response to the reports of discrimination last week. Kuleba also announced that Ukraine set up an emergency hotline for African, Asian and other students seeking to leave Ukraine. United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees Filippo Grandi also last week said that he met with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau who ""affirmed Poland's commitment to continue receiving all those fleeing, without distinction."" Meanwhile, Daley and Koiki said their initial social media efforts have led to the creation of a nonprofit organization, Black Women for Black Lives, with the goal of assisting people long after the crisis in Ukraine. “I think that's what they're understanding now is that this anti-Blackness is a global thing…whether you're in the UK, whether you're in Europe, whether you're in the United States…And so for me, what I want people to take away is that it can happen to anybody. It can happen to any of us,” Koiki says.",,,,2

At least three people, including a child, were killed in the airstrike, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Another 17 people, including women, children and medical workers, were wounded, he said. The Ukrainian leader accused Russian state media of lying about the lack of patients inside the hospital at the time of the attack. ""War crimes are impossible without propaganda that covers them,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address Thursday. ""You will bear responsibility as well as those who give orders to throw bombs on peaceful people."" Zelenskyy had posted a video on social media Wednesday that he said showed the heavily damaged children's hospital and maternity ward in the southeastern Ukrainian port city. ""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,"" he said, calling on the international community again to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?"" Pavlo Kirilenko, the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, claimed in a post on Facebook that a Russian aircraft deliberately targeted the 600-bed hospital. ""City center maternity hospital, hospital, children's ward and therapy -- all destroyed during a Russian aviation flight to Mariupol,"" he said. ""The Russians! You have not only crossed the border of unacceptable relations between states and peoples. You have crossed the line of humanity."" Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed during a daily briefing Wednesday that Ukraine had put firing positions inside the children's hospital in Mariupol, though there is currently no evidence to support that allegation. The comment, however, appears to be an implicit acknowledgment that Russia deliberately targeted the hospital, as Kirilenko had claimed. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said she was ""horrified"" by the reported attack on the hospital. ""We do not yet know the number of casualties but fear the worst,"" she said in a statement. ""This attack, if confirmed, underscores the horrific toll this war is exacting on Ukraine's children and families. In less than two weeks, at least 37 children have been killed and 50 injured, while more than 1 million children have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries."" The besieged city, which sits on the Sea of Azov, has been without power or water amid steady Russian bombardments. In a video conference Wednesday, Mariupol deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov said the city is on the ""brink of a humanitarian catastrophe"" and that ""'Russia is trying to wipe Mariupol from the face of the earth."" Orlov reported that 1,207 people have died in the city because of shelling and aerial attacks -- and that half of those killed were ethnic Russians. Among the casualties was a child who died from dehydration, according to Zelenskyy. The city has been burying its dead in a mass grave on the outskirts of Mariupol as it endures heavy shelling. New satellite imagery collected by commercial satellite company Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning, before the reported shelling of the hospital, showed extensive damage to civilian infrastructure in and around the city, including residential homes, high-rise apartment buildings, grocery stores and shopping centers. Orlov accused Russia of indiscriminately bombarding the city because its forces were unable to break through its defenses, but he said that Mariupol would not surrender. He also called on the international community to impose a no-fly zone, an escalation that the White House and NATO allies have opposed. ""The Russian army cannot break our defenses and win on the ground, and this is why they are just bombing us relentlessly to break our spirit,"" he said. ""Our spirit is strong but we need help. To the outside world we say: Help us save our city! Close the skies! Impose a no-fly zone!""' ABC News' Patrick Reevell, Yulia Drozd and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.",,,,15
2022-03-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-escalates-false-chemical-weapons-claims-us-ukraine/story?id=83366504,"Russia escalates false chemical weapons claims about US, Ukraine by bringing them to UN","Russia is doubling down on its false claims that the U.S. and Ukraine are developing chemical or biological weapons for use against invading Russian forces, bringing the accusation to the United Nations Security Council on Friday. A web of disinformation, not only from Russian state media but also Chinese propaganda outlets and even some American voices, have increasingly spread the conspiracy theory this week. That's prompted heightened concern among U.S. and Ukrainian officials that Russia itself may be planning to deploy chemical or biological weapons against Ukrainian targets or as part of a so-called ""false flag"" operation. ""This makes me really worried because we've been repeatedly convinced if you want to know Russia's plans, look at what Russia accuses others of,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a televised address late Thursday, a sentiment the White House first shared Wednesday. Ukraine does not have biochemical weapons laboratories. Instead, there are public health and veterinary health labs operated with U.S. support in Ukraine and several other former Soviet countries that provide technical support to a government's health ministry and study disease, like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. support originated with the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, launched in 1991 to help secure and dismantle the remnants of the former Soviet Union's biochemical weapons program in newly independent states, including Ukraine. The U.S. has talked openly about the program throughout its history, working with 26 facilities in Ukraine on issues like biosafety and scientific mentorship training, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, an independent nonprofit dedicated to science and global security. But in recent years, Russia, as well as China, has escalated accusations that these labs constitute a secret U.S. biochemical weapons program, at one point even claiming in state-run media outlets that they created the COVID-19 pandemic. In bitter irony, these labs have helped detect and stop the spread of COVID-19, according to public health officials. Those false claims have skyrocketed this week, with Russian now bringing them to one of the world's brightest spotlights -- the U.N. Security Council. Russia's mission in New York called for an emergency meeting Friday, 24 hours after its defense ministry falsely claimed it uncovered ""U.S. secret military biological projects in Ukraine,"" per state-run media. ""We're not going to let Russia get away with gaslighting the world or using the U.N. Security Council as a venue for promoting their disinformation,"" Olivia Dalton, the spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the U.N., told ABC News Thursday. It's unclear if the U.S. will try to stop the meeting, currently scheduled for 10 a.m. ET. Procedural matters, like holding a meeting, require nine of the chamber's 15 envoys to vote in favor, and no country can veto a meeting being held. While the false claims have escalated this week, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ranted back in December that Ukraine, with U.S. mercenary help, was preparing a chemical weapons attack. In 2018, Russia also made similar accusations against Georgia, the small former Soviet state that the Kremlin invaded a decade earlier as its government, like Ukraine's, sought NATO membership. Russian forces still occupy two regions of the country, recognizing them as independent states -- just as it did last month in eastern Ukraine before launching its invasion. ""The Russian allegations appear to be part of a disinformation campaign that has grown in response to scrutiny of Moscow for using and enabling the use of chemical weapons,"" the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists reported in 2018 when Russia's claims about Georgia were proven false. The Kremlin record of ""using and enabling the use of chemical weapons"" runs deep, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, especially against individuals deemed enemies. No one is higher on that list right now than Alexey Navalny. The opposition leader and anti-corruption activist was poisoned in August 2020 with the nerve agent Novichok by agents from the FSB, Russia's principal security agency. He was flown to Germany and recovered before returning in January 2021 to Moscow, where he was almost immediately arrested. Another notable example before Navalny were the Skripals. Sergei Skripal, a former Russian officer who was a double agent for the United Kingdom, was also poisoned with Novichok in March 2018 in Salisbury, England. His daughter Yulia and a police officer were also hospitalized by the attack, but all three recovered. In contrast, Ukraine has been in full compliance with the chemical and biological weapons conventions since signing them in 1972 and 1993, respectively, according to the State Department. Asked about Ukraine's biomedical facilities, CIA Director Bill Burns told the Senate Thursday, ""In any public health system around the world, there's going to be work done in the interests of wider public health, to ensure that we have a grip on issues like that. But that's in no way threatening. That's not something that can be weaponized in the way that the Russians have clearly demonstrated -- by their own actions against their citizens and people outside their country -- their willingness to use."" It's unclear whether U.S. intelligence has any evidence that Russian forces are preparing for a chemical or biological attack. The White House, State Department and Pentagon publicly pointed only to ""Moscow's track record"" and ""increasingly concerning rhetoric,"" in the words of State Department spokesperson Ned Price. But a senior Pentagon official told reporters, ""We have picked up indications that the Russians could be making these claims -- these false claims -- about us and Ukrainian work in bio defense as a way of creating a pretext of their own, to perhaps use these kinds of agents in an attack."" Pressed on what ""indications"" they were referring to, they added, ""I have to leave it with you with indications, and [I'm] not going to be at liberty to go in more detail than that today."" For those in Ukraine, where Russian forces have shown there's little they won't do to subjugate the country, the fear is real. ""The manic obsession with which various Russian officials fantasize about non-existent biological or chemical weapons or hazards in Ukraine is deeply troubling and may actually point at Russia preparing another horrific false flag operation. This tweet is for the record,"" Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Thursday. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report from the Pentagon.",,,,29

Biden announced new trade sanctions on Russia Friday and reiterated his position from the White House that ""we will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine,"" but so far, economic sanctions from the international community have not stopped Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion. The Biden administration has warned this week that Putin could use chemical or biological weapons, but officials have repeatedly refused to say if a chemical attack would cross a red line or whether they have intelligence that an attack is imminent. ""Your White House has said that -- that Russia may use chemical weapons, or create a false flag operation to use them,"" a reporter asked the president Friday. ""What evidence have you seen showing that, and would the U.S. have a military response if Putin does launch a chemical weapons attack?"" ""I'm not going to speak about intelligence,"" Biden said, ""but Russia would pay a severe price if they used chemical weapons."" It was the only question he took before leaving the room. White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates, briefing reporters on Air Force One after the remarks, echoed Biden that there would be ""severe consequences,"" but also declined to go into specifics about what those would look like for Russia. ""They have used chemical weapons, which again, they are the only country in the mix here who possesses those, in Syria, and time again, we have warned about this particular pretext, and so it is something that we are being attentive to,"" he said. ""Russia is the only country in this equation with a chemical and biological weapons program in violation of international law."" And Pentagon press secretary John Kirby, asked Friday about a Russian false flag to justify Russian chemical weapons use, would only say, ""We don't have firm indications right now,"" but that it's something they're watching for. ""I don't want to get into intelligence assessments,"" he said, explaining the U.S. was trying to preempt any Russian pretext. ""One, this is a country that has a reputation for using those kinds of weapons on people, and we know they have a program,"" Kirby added. ""And two, we continue to watch for the potential -- and I want to stress the word potential -- potential that they could be banging this drum with the intent of creating some sort of false-flag event, that they could use it as an excuse to escalate the conflict even more."" Russia escalates false chemical weapons claims Russia, meanwhile, has doubled down on false claims that the U.S. is helping Ukraine develop chemical or biological weapons, bringing the accusations to the world's stage at the U.N. Security Council Friday in an emergency session. ""I can foresee what the reaction will be from our Western colleagues, who I am sure are going to be saying now that all of this information is fake and Russian propaganda, but this is self-delusion and I do not think this will be helpful to the European people in case there are outbreaks in Ukraine and neighboring states,"" said U.N. Ambassador for Russia Vassily Nebenzya. Russia has not supplied any credible information to support their claims, but a web of disinformation spread the conspiracy theory this week -- heightening concern among U.S. and Ukrainian officials that Russia itself may be planning to deploy chemical or biological weapons against Ukrainian targets or as part of a so-called ""false flag"" operation. ""I will say this once: Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program, and there are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States. Not near Russia's border or anywhere,"" rebutted U.N. Ambassador for Linda Thomas-Greenfield. ""Ukraine owns and operates its own public health laboratory infrastructure,"" she continued. ""It has absolutely nothing to do with biological weapons."" Reports of Russia sending chem-bio suits to Ukraine A senior administration official told ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz that aside from the so-called ""false flag operations"" -- in which Russians are accusing Ukraine and the U.S. of a possible chemical or biological attack -- the U.S. is receiving reports that the Russians are starting to bring in chem-bio suits to Ukraine. ""We believe it is an ominous sign they are possibly doing it for cover,"" the official said of the Russian pretext. The official also said that as much as one-fifth of the Russian force is now ""inoperable"" -- meaning they are either dead, wounded or don't have the support or equipment needed to continue right now -- but there are still fears forces could take Kyiv as it wears down Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a televised address late Thursday, that Russia falsely accusing Ukraine of preparing for a chemical attack ""makes me really worried, because we've been repeatedly convinced if you want to know Russia's plans, look at what Russia accuses others of."" Thomas Greenfield added Friday, ""In fact, it is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law. It is Russia that has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons. It is Russia who is the aggressor here,"" she said, pointing out the Kremlin's recent history of poisoning political enemies and supporting the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons in Syria. Pentagon pushes back against Russia's false claim A senior defense official said Friday that despite the barrage of claims from China and Russia, the U.S. is not helping Ukraine create any chemical or biological weapons. ""We have nothing to hide, and the only reason why we elevated the discussion is because the Russians and the Chinese decided to lie about it -- just flat out lie,"" the official added. But they would not offer any U.S. intelligence assessment of the likelihood of Putin deploying chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. ""We know that the Russians have had -- and we assess that they still have -- a sophisticated chemical and biological weapons program. I'm not going to talk about intelligence assessments about what they may do with that program or what, if any, designs they might have on Ukraine in that regard,"" the official said. A Pentagon official told reporters Thursday it has ""picked up indications that the Russians could be making these claims -- these false claims -- about us and Ukrainian work in biodefense as a way of creating a pretext of their own, to perhaps use these kinds of agents in an attack."" Pressed on what ""indications"" they were referring to, they added, ""I have to leave it with you with indications, and [I'm] not going to be at liberty to go in more detail than that today."" Amid the looming threat, the World Health Organization has urged Ukraine to now destroy pathogen samples because Russia's war in the country risks an ""accidental spill."" ""This is part of us providing public health advice to every country to try to ensure there is a minimized risk of any harm to population because of any possible accidental leak of pathogens,"" said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarević said from Lviv, Ukraine.

2022-03-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-forces-move-miles-kyivs-city-center-pentagon/story?id=83374275,Russian forces move within 9 miles of Kyiv's city center: Pentagon Ukraine update,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Thursday: Russians approaching Kyiv The Russian forces closest to the heart of Kyiv are coming from the northwest, in the area of the Hostomel Airport. Since Wednesday, these troops fought their way three miles closer, bringing them within roughly nine miles of the city center, according to the official. The airport is only about five miles as the bird flies from the outer city limits. Two parallel lines of advance from the northeast are also making progress on their push to the capital, the closest of these troops now about 25 miles from the center of Kyiv. Some Russian troops from one of those lines, emanating from above the town of Sumy, seem to have turned around, heading back northeast. The official said the reason for the about-face is unclear. Russian bombardment continues Russian forces have now fired more than 775 missiles against Ukraine, the official said. This is up from an estimate of 710 on Wednesday. No Patriots to Ukraine The official said there is no talk at the Pentagon of sending Patriot systems to Ukraine, as they would require U.S. troops on the ground to operate them. ""It's not a system that the Ukrainians are familiar with. And as we have made very clear, there will be no U.S. troops fighting in Ukraine,"" the official said. Other air-defense options for Ukraine Security assistance continues to flow into Ukraine, even in the last 24 hours, according to the official. While the U.S. is sending its own anti-armor and anti-aircraft weapons, it is also working with other countries to send items the U.S. doesn't have in its arsenal but could be used effectively by Ukrainian troops. When asked, the official said this includes air-defense systems that are ""more sophisticated"" than the shoulder-fired Stinger missiles being sent by the U.S. So, while the Pentagon has rejected the idea of sending Patriot missile batteries, it could be helping facilitate the transfer or replenishment of similar systems that Ukrainians are trained on. Ukraine making little use of its fighter jets The official repeated the Pentagon's rejection of a Polish proposal to pass its fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine by using the U.S. as an intermediary. ""We do not support a proposal whereby jets would be transferred to our custody, then to be brought into Ukraine,"" the official said. The Defense Department views sending aircraft to be an inferior form of support for Ukraine, despite Ukrainian officials' requests. ""They are not flying their fixed-wing aircraft very much on a daily basis. We're not making a judgment here, it's just a fact. What they are using very effectively to slow the Russian advance, particularly in the north, are their own surface-to-air missile systems and MANPADS, as well as ... anti-armor munitions,"" the official said.",,,,11
2022-03-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-siege-biden-announces-sanctions-squeeze-russia/story?id=83389256,"With Ukraine under siege, Biden announces new trade sanctions to 'squeeze' Russia","Stepping up the economic pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin as he continues to attack Ukraine, President Joe Biden announced Friday that in conjunction with other G-7 nations and the European Union, the U.S. will move to revoke ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia. ""As Putin continues his merciless assault, the United States and allies and partners continue to work in lockstep to ramp up the economic pressures on Putin and to further isolate Russia in the global stage,"" Biden said from the White House. ""Revoking PNTR (permanent normal trade relations) for Russia is gonna make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States."" The move to strip Russia of its favored nation status would allow the U.S. and others to impose tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods. Biden also announced the U.S. is banning the export of luxury goods to Russia as well as banning imports of certain goods from Russia, including seafood, vodka and diamonds. He also said the G-7 is adding new names to the list of targeted oligarchs it was sanctioning. ""Putin is an aggressor -- is the aggressor, and Putin must pay the price. He cannot pursue a war that threatens the very foundation to which he's doing -- the very foundations of international peace and stability and then ask for financial help from the international community,"" Biden said. He added that the U.S. will speak to the G-7 about Russia's ability to borrow the from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Additionally, Biden said he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Friday morning ahead of his remarks, and ""told him -- as I have each and every time I've spoken to him -- that the United States stands with Ukraine as they bravely fight to defend their country."" While each country will have to suspend normalized trade relations on their own, the announcement is another example of Western unity against Putin as nations tighten the squeeze on Russia. It follows the U.S. imposing an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports earlier this week. Over the past two weeks, Russia has widened its attacks on major cities across Ukraine. The United Nations said Thursday that at least 549 civilians, 41 of whom were children, have died since Russia's invasion began. At least 2.5 million have already fled the country. ""Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and airstrikes,"" the office said. As the threat of Russia taking over Kyiv and overthrowing Zelenskyy looms, the 40-mile Russian military convoy that was last seen northwest of Kyiv has repositioned around the capital city, appearing to take attackable positions. ""We remind Russian authorities that directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects as well as so-called bombardment in towns and villages and other forms of indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes,"" said the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights spokesperson Elizabeth Throssell on Friday. But Russia has doubled down, instead, on its false claims that the U.S. and Ukraine are developing chemical or biological weapons for use against invading Russian forces. Russia is expected to bring the false accusation to the United Nations Security Council on Friday -- one day after a senior U.S. defense official warned that the U.S. has seen ""indications"" of Russia using a potential false flag operation biochemical weapons as a pretext for the potential use of ""these kinds of agents in an attack."" Asked about the accusation Friday, Biden said he wouldn't comment on intelligence but warned Russia not to make such a move. ""Your White House has said that Russia may use chemical weapons, or create a false flag operation to use them,"" a reporter said. ""What evidence have you seen showing that, and would the U.S. have a military response if Putin would launch a chemical attack?"" ""I'm not going to speak about intelligence but – but – but Russia would pay a severe price if they used chemical weapons,"" he replied. Moments earlier, Biden reiterated his position that ""we will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine."" ""We'll defend every single inch of the NATO territory with the full might of the united and galvanized NATO,"" Biden said, but adding, ""Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III, something we must strive to prevent."" As the situation on-the-ground escalates, Republican senators have urged the Biden administration to send Ukraine 29 MiG fighter jets Poland offered to provide to Ukraine – but only if the U.S. transports them, which the Pentagon has not agreed to. ""Enough talk. People are dying. Send them the planes that they need,"" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said at a press conference Thursday. Ukraine, meanwhile, has pleaded with NATO, unsuccessfully, to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. In response to claims that Russia may view the transfer of MiGs as escalatory on behalf of the U.S., the GOP group scoffed, saying it was time for the U.S. to project strength in this conflict and have Putin fear the U.S. for a change. Vice President Kamala Harris, making stops across Europe to address the crisis, said Thursday that the administration is inching closer to acknowledging war crimes by Russia, saying ""Absolutely there should be an investigation and we should all be watching,"" while White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. must go through ""the legal assessment and review to make a formal conclusion."" Biden also noted the $13.6 billion in assistance for Ukraine included in the government funding bill passed Thursday night, which he said he looked forward to signing ""immediately.""

2022-03-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-limiting-technology-exports-hurting-russias-ability-wage/story?id=83396451,"US, by limiting technology exports, hurting Russia's ability to wage war in Ukraine: Officials","As the war in Ukraine continues, one office inside the Commerce Department in Washington is at the crossroads of innovation and national security when it comes to sanctions on Russia. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has been controlling and enforcing exports from the United States, and when Russia invaded Ukraine, the bureau jumped in. Export controls, according to Thea D. Rozman Kendler, assistant secretary of commerce for export administration, are a ""national security tool"" to keep ""sensitive American technology"" from countries that would otherwise use it maliciously. Some examples, she said, are goods, technology and software. ""Russia relies on foreign technology for most of its high-technology production,"" she explained. ""They need our parts and components, our technologies to make and repair weapons, planes, tanks, communications equipment, whatever they need to wage war when Russia attacks Ukraine we were ready with our allies and partners to impose tough restrictions on what could be sold to Russia. With a common goal of degrading Russia's military capabilities."" Kendler said as Russia's military equipment runs out, it will need software updates and won't get them due to the export controls the BIS placed on goods. ""Russia cannot make those weapons of war without us and partner country technology,"" she explained. ""And if we cut off [those] technologies, which is what we have tried to do in the last two weeks, we are directly limiting their ability to wage war."" Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary for export enforcement, said it is not in Chinese companies interest to flout these controls and Chinese companies that continue to supply Russia with goods on the the list would face harsh penalties. ""If there is a plant in China that's making semiconductors and sending them to Russia, the type of semiconductors that aren't allowed, they're not able to do that without U.S. technological help, including software updates, including on site teams that will help with the software and the tooling,"" he explained Axlerod said that if U.S. companies willfully violate some of the export and import bans placed on Russia there could be serious consequences, even jail time. ""If we find that people are willfully violating a law and shipping items to Russia that are prohibited by the rules, that's a criminal violation. And people I work with every day are federal criminal law enforcement agents,"" he said. ""We bring cases in connection with the Justice Department ... across the country against companies that that criminally violate the export control rules."" Both Axelrod and Kendler served as prosecutors in the Justice Department and they say that experience has aided them in this job. ""I prosecuted export controls cases, I looked at how we can take regulations and support them through enforcement if you have willful violators,"" Kendler said. ""So I certainly take that into account as I craft regulations. I think about the enforceability and the clarity of rules for industry, also, so that industry doesn't inadvertently stumble into a violation. I think we have excellent partnerships with industry who want to comply with the rules and who want to be on the side of democratic values, particularly during the situation we're facing in the world right now.""",,,,21
2022-03-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-drones-great-effect-russian-forces-pentagon-updates/story?id=83391603,Ukraine using drones to 'great effect' on Russian forces: Pentagon updates,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Friday: Russia flying 20 times as many sorties as Ukraine Russian military planes are flying an average of 200 sorties per day, compared to only about 10 per day flown by Ukraine, according to the official. Much of the airspace above Ukraine is heavily guarded by both Ukrainian and Russian surface-to-air missiles, making air operations risky for both sides. But Russian aircraft don't have to enter Ukrainian airspace to do damage. ""You can launch cruise missiles from aircraft from a great distance away. And if your target is relatively close, you don't need to enter the airspace,"" the official said. For the first time, the official gave details on the total number of functioning Ukrainian fighter jets and how much they're being used. ""They have 56 available to them now, fully operational, and they're only flying them five to 10 hours a day,"" the official said. Ukraine needs drones, not jets: Official Noting Russia's vast umbrella of anti-aircraft capability over Ukraine and its larger air force, the official repeated some of the arguments we heard from the Pentagon earlier this week about the relative ineffectiveness of sending more aircraft to Ukraine. ""It makes little sense to us that additional fixed-wing aircraft is going to have somehow solve all these problems. What they need are surface-to-air missile systems, they need MANPADS, they need anti-armor, and they need small arms and ammunition, and they need these drones, because that's what they're using with great effect. And so, that's what we're focused on,"" the official said. Ukrainian forces are making ""terrific"" use of drones, especially against Russian ground movements, according to the official. The drones can be also used both for reconnaissance and surveillance. ""They're trained on how to use them, they can fly below radar coverage by the Russians,"" the official said. They are also much cheaper than fighter aircraft, and being unmanned, don't risk pilots being killed or captured. Chemical weapons and false flags The official said that despite claims from China and Russia, the U.S. is not helping Ukraine create or use any chemical or biological weapons. ""This is bio research with regard to two things: One, helping Ukraine over the years decrease the pathogen inventory that they had under Soviet years, and then to develop strategies to defeat pathogens going forward,"" the official said. ""It's scientific research, it's not bio-weapons capabilities."" The official said the U.S. has nothing to hide, and that information on its role in scientific work in Ukraine was already publicly available. ""The only reason why we elevated the discussion is because the Russians and the Chinese decided to lie about it -- just flat out lie,"" the official said. The official would not offer any U.S. intelligence assessment of the likelihood of Russian President Vladimir Putin deploying chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine. ""We know that the Russians have had -- and we assess that they still have -- a sophisticated chemical and biological weapons program. I'm not going to talk about intelligence assessments about what they may do with that program or what, if any, designs they might have on Ukraine in that regard,"" the official said. The official said Russia's ""ridiculous narrative"" could possibly ""be building a pretext for some sort of false flag event."" State of the invasion The push to Kyiv: Russians have not moved any closer to Kyiv from the northwest since yesterday, still approximately 9 miles from city center. But the U.S. has seen rear elements move up closer to those advance troops. Russians advancing on the capital from northeast now 12-19 miles out. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Friday that the Russians coming from the east, while further from Kyiv, are gaining more ground than those to the northwest near the Hostomel Airport. ""We do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the east, not quite so much from the north,"" Kirby said. Kharkiv: Russians are ""closing in,"" but the city is well defended and hasn't been taken yet. Mariupol: The port city is under increasing pressure today. It is surrounded from northeast and southwest, under heavy bombardment, but Ukrainians are fighting back there. Kherson: The city remains under Russian control: ""We continue to assess that they have Kherson,"" the official said. Mykolayiv: Russian forces remain to the northeast of the city, though it is under increasing pressure. ""We've observed the Ukrainians are continuing to defend the city, and the Russians are just outside the city,"" the official said. Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk: The Russians struck airfields in each city Friday. ""Obviously, they wanted to eliminate the Ukrainians' ability to use these airfields,"" the official said. The official did not know how much the Ukrainians were using these two airfields or how extensive the damage was. ""What's unusual about it is that [the Russians] haven't been striking in western Ukraine,"" the official said of the strikes. Russian missile strikes The Russians have now launched nearly 810 missiles against Ukraine -- almost half have been fired from within Ukraine using mobile platforms. The rest have been fired from Russia, Belarus, and a small number from the Black Sea. This is up from an estimate of 775 missiles offered by the official Thursday. Majority of combat power intact Russia still has roughly 90% of its invading combat power still viable, with Ukraine falling just under 90%, the official said.",,,,6
2022-03-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/base-russia-struck-poland-funnel-weapons-pentagon-ukraine/story?id=83437698,Base Russia struck near Poland not used to funnel weapons: Pentagon Ukraine updates,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Monday: Fallout from deadly airstrike near Polish border On Sunday, Russian long-range bombers launched ""more than a couple dozen"" cruise missiles at a western Ukrainian training facility near Yavoriv, about 10 miles from the Polish border. All of the missiles were launched from Russian airspace, damaging at least seven buildings, according to the official. The attack left at least 35 dead and 134 wounded, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia also hit two airfields in western Ukraine on Friday in the towns of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankovsk. During a Monday press briefing at the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby said the strikes in western Ukraine are part of a broadening Russian assault across Ukraine. ""I wouldn't think that that we would consider this or the other strikes in western Ukraine as some sort of turning point,"" Kirby said, but adding, ""The Russians clearly are expanding some of their targets sets."" ""If Mr. Putin was trying to signal his displeasure about a strong, united NATO with this war of his then he's failed, because he's getting exactly what he says he doesn't want -- a strong, united NATO on his Western flank,"" Kirby said. While there were 150 Florida National Guardsmen training Ukrainians on part of the base as recently as February, all U.S. troops and contractors were pulled from the country before the beginning of the invasion. The strike occurred after the Kremlin claimed arms shipments to Ukraine are ""legitimate targets,"" but the U.S. official said no security assistance sites were hit in this case. Kirby confirmed the training center was not being used to funnel U.S. weapons to Ukrainian forces. ""I would just tell you that we have multiple routes to get security assistance into the hands of the Ukrainians,"" Kirby said. In total, Russia has now launched more than 900 missiles against Ukraine, according to the senior U.S. defense official. This estimate is up from 810 on Friday. Reports of Russia seeking military supplies from China ""I would just say that we're going to watch that very, very closely. And as others in the administration have said, if China does choose to materially support Russia in this war, there will likely be consequences for China,"" the official said. Cease-fire talks ""We want to see the violence stop,"" the official said. ""All I can do is tell you what we're seeing on the ground, and what we're seeing on the ground is a continued military effort to subdue these population centers and to do it now with ever more violence using more and more long-range fires, which are increasingly indiscriminate in terms of what they're hitting."" Russian advance mostly stalled ""Almost all of Russia's advances remain stalled,"" the official said. Kyiv: The Russians closest to Kyiv are still near Hostomel Airport to the northwest, about 9 miles (15km) from city center. Some troops are moving in behind those advance forces, ""but not at a great pace,"" the official said. The forces approaching from the east are still about 12-19 miles from the heart of Kyiv, according to the official. This was the same estimate given by the official on Friday. ""No real progress to speak to,"" the official said of these forces. They're facing heavy resistance from the Ukrainians. The U.S. assesses the defenders still have control of Brovary, just east of the capital, where in videos published last week we saw a column of Russian tanks hit. Kharkiv: Significant fighting continues over Kharkiv, with Russians relying more and more on long-range missile attacks. The U.S. sees a new line of advance with 50 to 60 vehicles moving from the southwest of Kharkiv down toward the town of Izyum. ""The assessment is that they are trying to block off the Donbass area and to prevent the flow westward of any Ukrainian armed forces that would be in the in the eastern part of the country, prevent them from coming to the assistance of other Ukrainian defenders near Kyiv,"" the official said. Mariupol: The city remains isolated and under heavy bombardment, with Russian forces to the north and east. Ukrainians continue to fight back, the official said. Mykolayiv: Russian forces remain roughly where they were Friday, about six to nine miles northeast of the city. Ukrainians continue to resist. It is unclear what the Russian plan is for Mykolayiv. ""It could be a left turn to move on Odessa from the ground or it could be they go north up towards Kiev,"" the official said. Odessa: The Pentagon still sees no sign of any looming amphibious assault on Odessa, according to the official. Ukrainians going after Russian supplies ""The Ukrainians, as we've said all along, they've been quite creative here. They're not simply going after combat capability -- tanks and armored vehicles and shooting down aircraft -- although they're doing all that. They are also deliberately trying to impede and prevent the Russians' ability to sustain themselves,"" the official said, citing the long Russian convoy as one example.",,,,6
2022-03-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-missile-strike-poland-raises-tough-questions-biden/story?id=83436540,Russian missile strike near Poland raises tough questions for Biden,"President Joe Biden's dual promises to consider NATO's Article 5 a ""sacred obligation"" but also not to have U.S. forces engage with Russia in Ukraine may be increasingly difficult as Russian President Vladimir Putin expands the scope of his attack -- with a barrage of missiles striking near Ukraine's border with NATO ally Poland over the weekend, along with intense shelling in Kyiv overnight. The U.S. has also warned about a possible chemical weapons attack and a senior administration official told ABC News earlier Monday that Russia is ""desperately"" asking for Chinese help -- with China ""considering"" giving the Russians ""airstrike capabilities."" But amid signs that Putin is escalating, it remains unclear what consequences Russia would face from the U.S. Russian forces targeted a military training site over the weekend in western Ukraine that had housed Western volunteers and members of the Florida National Guard training Ukrainian counterparts before the invasion. At least 35 people were killed and 134 injured, according to Ukrainian officials. There were ""no Americans at all working there,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Sunday. In what some are considering a provocative message to the West, the attack -- just 10 miles from Ukraine's border with Poland -- has raised the prospect of the Kremlin being increasingly likely to target Poland or other NATO allies helping to supply Ukraine. That comes on top of concerns that Russia is laying the propaganda groundwork to use chemical weapons in Ukraine and falsely accuse the Ukrainian military of doing so first. ""They are clearly expanding some of their target sets here,"" Kirby said at a Pentagon briefing Monday. ""I want to be careful here that we're not reducing the kind of damage and death he's causing to some sort of message signaling. I think that's being way too generous to what the Kremlin is trying to do inside Ukraine."" At Monday afternoon's White House press briefing, a reporter presented press secretary Jen Psaki with a list of horrors witnesses in Ukraine -- ""maternity wards being bombed, illegal weapons being used, pediatric hospitals being targeted"" -- and asked where Biden draws the line on military intervention, noting former President Barack Obama drew a red line for Syria with chemical weapons. ""You have to weigh how you can lead the world, how you can make very clear that actions are horrific, that they are not acceptable, they're not aligned with global norms -- while also thinking about our own national security interests,"" Psaki said. ""And starting World War III is certainly not in our national security interests. Putting U.S. troops on the ground in Ukraine to fight a war with Russia is not in our set national security interests."" Pressed again later, Psaki repeated that Biden does not intend to send U.S. troops to Ukraine and would not specify what ""severe consequences"" Russia would face if it uses biochemical weapons. Asked then if it's possible the White House has no consequences left to inflict on Russia, with severe actions like a no-fly zone, transporting jets and putting U.S. troops on the ground currently off the table, Psaki called that characterization ""inaccurate."" ""Those are conversations that will happen continue to happen with our national security team and with our partners and allies around the world,"" Psaki said. Meanwhile Russia has repeatedly threatened to target other countries working to resupply Ukraine, declaring them parties to the conflict -- and raising fears that an attack could trickle into Poland, a NATO nation, potentially prompting NATO allies to enter the war. After the strike near the polish border over the weekend ABC News Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz asked Pentagon press secretary John Kirby on ""This Week,"" ""If they strike in Poland, what happens?"" ""We take our Article 5 commitment very seriously,"" Kirby said. ""An armed attack against one is considered an armed attack against all. That is why, Martha, we continue to flow and to move and to reposition forces and capabilities along NATO's eastern flank to make sure that we can defend every inch of NATO territory if we need to."" ""Now, there's no reason we should need to because there's no reason that there should be war in Ukraine as it is, and we've made it very clear to Russia that NATO territory will be defended not just by the United States, but by our allies,"" he later added. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, at a roundtable at the University of South Carolina's School of Law on Monday, said while he is against a no-fly zone over Ukraine, he would support one if Russia used chemical weapons -- which the senator called ""a war crime of monumental proportion."" ""If there's a chemical attack by the Russians in Ukraine, that would be a war crime of monumental proportion and all the treaties we've tried to construct around the use of chemical weapons will be considered a joke if he doesn't pay a price. So, I would be for a no-fly zone then,"" Graham said Negotiators from Russia and Ukraine met Monday to see if they could broker a ceasefire and a potential peace deal, but the virtual meeting was stopped due to what Ukraine's presidential adviser called a ""technical pause."" The talks are scheduled to continue Tuesday. The fourth round of talks come as a senior U.S. official told Raddatz on Monday that Russian attacks on Ukraine will increase, with the western city of Lviv, a highly-populated area, among potential targets. Russia may target the city because ""they want to create more terror,"" the official said. Over the weekend, Biden approved the shipment of $200 million in additional lethal aid to Ukraine, including antitank and antiaircraft weapons, after Congress approved a new aid package, with those materials expected to arrive in Ukraine from prepositioned U.S. military stations in Europe and the U.S. Largely unified on the issue, Congress this week will also vote to codify Biden's executive action taken Friday, which downgraded normal trade relations with Russia -- the latest example of how lawmakers have pushed the White House to take forceful steps against Russia. And amid fears China could supply ally Russia with weapons, national security adviser Jake Sullivan met in Rome on Monday with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in the first high-level, in-person meeting since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

2022-03-15,https://abcnews.go.com/International/civilians-war-amid-ukraine-conflict/story?id=83178098,What to know about civilians in war amid Ukraine conflict,"In the Ukraine conflict, reports of civilian casualties have dominated the headlines as Russian troops siege cities around the country. Civilian buildings have been hit by Russian forces, with hospitals and residential buildings shelled, causing thousands of civilian casualties and massive human suffering. Russia has denied they are deliberately targeting civilians and insisted in some cases that enemy fighters were hiding within the buildings. Russia is also reported to have used unguided ""dumb"" bombs in Ukraine, which greatly increase the risk of missing targets and hitting civilian infrastructure. Many countries, including the United States, along with independent monitors, like Amnesty International, have condemned Russia's actions. ""We've all seen the devastating images coming out of Ukraine and are appalled by Russia's brutal tactics,"" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said Friday. ""Pregnant women on stretchers, apartment buildings -- buildings shelled, families killed while seeking safety from this terrible violence. These are disgusting attacks; civilian casualties are increasing. If Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that would be a war crime."" But whether or not these attacks constitute war crimes has been debated. U.S. officials and the United Nations have been more reserved, saying legal assessments must be done, but Ukrainian officials have clearly condemned Russia's attacks as violations of international humanitarian law. Making matters murkier is the issue of civilians taking up arms to resist the Russian advance and the fact that the front lines often disappear in the realm of urban warfare. Here's what you need to know about the laws of war pertaining to civilians: Civilians off limits, except when they take up arms In an armed conflict, countries are not allowed to deliberately target or indiscriminately attack civilians, the civilian population or civilian properties, according to the rules of international humanitarian law, or IHL. IHL covers the rules of war, specifying what parties can and can't do during an armed conflict. The Geneva Conventions, four treaties adopted in 1949 and signed by 196 countries, are the core of IHL, according to the humanitarian organization International Committee of the Red Cross. Additional protocols were later adopted in 1977 and 2005. The conventions and protocols regulate the conduct of armed conflict and seek to minimize its effects. Russia signed Protocol 1 in 1977, but Russian leader Vladimir Putin revoked Russia's acceptance in October 2019, citing potential abuse of a commission set up to investigate war crimes. But the protections for civilians who participate in an armed conflict by taking up arms are different, Allen Weiner, the director of the Stanford Program in International and Comparative Law, told ABC News. ""The rule is that civilians can be targeted, but only for such time as they are directly taking part in hostilities. So while a civilian is shooting at you, they become a permissible target. When they go back home, they cease to be permissible target under the law of armed conflict,"" Weiner said. Principles of distinction, proportionality, precautions Under the Geneva Conventions, signatory states must abide by the IHL principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions during an armed conflict. Distinction requires all sides to distinguish between civilian populations and combatants at all times, including distinguishing between civilian and military infrastructures, according to the ICRC. This distinction is important, as the rules of war forbid countries from launching attacks on civilians and civilian objects or even launching indiscriminate attacks that hit military targets and civilians or civilian objects without distinction. ""Essential infrastructure must be spared, including water, gas and electrical systems that, for instance, provide civilian homes, schools and medical facilities with vital water and electricity supplies,"" the ICRC told ABC News. Russia, for instance, has captured the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants and attacked at least 26 health care facilities, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, last week. Russia has also hit other gas and electric infrastructure. ""There's not really different tiers of immunity; civilian objects are immune, period. So a civilian house is immune, a school is immune and a hospital is immune. And there's really only one degree of immunity, which is, it can't be targeted,"" Weiner said. The ICRC said that the use of ""weapons with wide area effects must be avoided in populated areas"" and that ""attacks carried out with new technologies and cyber means must also respect international humanitarian law."" The Russian army has been accused of using cluster bombs by Ukraine, including at Central City Hospital in Vuhledar on Feb. 24, reports the Office of the OHCHR called ""credible."" Proportionality prohibits states from launching attacks against military targets if the attack is expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects. Attacks may only be launched against a military objective if the potential civilian losses are not expected to outweigh the foreseen military advantage, according to the ICRC. Parties to a conflict must ""at all times take action to minimize civilian harm,"" Cordula Droege, the chief legal officer for the ICRC, told ABC News in an interview. In a conflict, countries are required to take constant precautions to spare civilians and their objects, which includes doing everything possible to verify that targets are military objects and giving advance warning of attacks that may affect the civilian population when possible, according to the ICRC. ""Civilians should be spared,"" Droege said. Consequences There are consequences for breaking the rules of war. War crimes are documented and investigated by governments and international courts, such as the International Criminal Court. Individuals can also be prosecuted for war crimes, according to the ICRC. Russia has been accused of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructures during its invasion of Ukraine, which is considered illegal under international law. Russia has denied the accusations and in some cases claimed enemy fighters were hiding behind civilians and in civilian buildings. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of hitting civilian targets in Ukraine, killing innocent people and destroying hospitals, schools and critical infrastructure such as running water, electricity and gas, all of which is protected under international law. But while the U.S. has said it is documenting the incidents, officials have stopped short of saying Russia is guilty of war crimes. ""States are obligated to prosecute people who commit these crimes. ... If the Russians are doing it, they have a legal obligation to prosecute their own,"" Weiner said. ""A lot of militaries do actually prosecute their own people if they violate the rules."" The ICRC is ""extremely worried about the protection of civilians"" in Ukraine, Droege said. ""We are engaging all parties to the conflict on a bilateral and confidential dialogue to ensure they abide by their [IHL] obligations, including the respect of civilian objects, such as essential infrastructure, and, more broadly, all other IHL rules on the conduct of hostilities,"" the ICRC said. Even though Ukraine did not sign on to be a party to the International Criminal Court, it issued a declaration recognizing the jurisdiction of the court in 2015 -- a year and a half after Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, seizing the Crimean Peninsula and launching a separatist war in the eastern provinces Donetsk and Luhansk. That declaration gives the ICC the ability to prosecute criminal cases in the country, while the Ukrainian government has also said it is collecting evidence to be able to prosecute Russian service members they capture who have violated IHL. Theoretically, Weiner said, there could be a prosecution of Russian soldiers or even Russia civilians in command of the army, such as the head of state or minister of defense, in the case of ""ordering or directing these violations of international humanitarian law."" While Weiner said the evidence gathered will show what, if any, violations of international humanitarian law have occurred, one thing is clear to him. ""This is really unusual in terms of being one of the most flagrant violations that I have seen of the basic idea that one country can't simply invade another and try to take its territory by force, or to replace its government,"" Weiner said.",,,,13
2022-03-15,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-lady-olena-zelenska-issues-plea-world-stop/story?id=83433675,Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska issues plea to the world: 'STOP WAR',"With targets on the backs of her and her husband and from an undisclosed safe place, Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska sent out a desperate two-word plea to America and the world: ""STOP WAR."" In an exchange of written messages with ABC News, Zelenska described the blitz of Russian missiles raining on Ukraine and the deaths of civilians, including at least 71 children, as ""genocide."" ""I guess my message is very similar to the one the whole world delivers. Only two simple words: STOP WAR,"" the 44-year-old Zelenska wrote, unable to speak by phone or in-person due to high-security risks. After her husband of 18 years, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was elected president of Ukraine in 2019, Zelenska launched an initiative as the first lady to improve the quality and nutrition of food in schools. But on Feb. 24, her priorities were dramatically altered when Russian tanks and troops invaded her country, leaving crisscrossed trails of destruction and death and prompting a diaspora of refugees, now topping 2.8 million. Zelenska has become an inspiration to women across her war-torn land and the world, an outspoken mother of two beseeching the West to ""help us to stop Russian atrocity in Ukraine."" To reflect the stark realities of war, she has frequently posted images and videos on social media of hospital wards full of wounded citizens. She has also called Putin out for disingenuously describing the invasion as a ""special operation."" ""When Russia says that it is 'not waging war against civilians,' I call out the names of these murdered children first,"" she wrote in a 1,000-word ""testimony"" she publicly released last week. In her exchange with ABC News on Sunday, day 18 of the war, Zelenska said one of her greatest concerns is the well-being of her husband, who Ukrainian officials claim has been the target of several assassination attempts. ""As every woman in Ukraine, now I fear for my husband,"" Zelenska wrote. ""Every morning before I call him, I pray everything goes well. I also know how strong and enduring he is. He is able to withstand anything, especially when he defends people and things that he loves."" Referring to Putin and his supporters in the Kremlin, she expressed doubt as to ""whether they have ordinary and sincere human feelings."" ""Ask yourself these questions and you will understand the difference of views on this war,"" she wrote. While imploring the West to help Ukraine, she has not shied away from criticizing Western leaders for being silent in response to Putin's crackdown on the rights of his own citizens and his previous encroachments of her country's borders. ""Today, our country and our civilians pay a very high price for the silence and hesitation regarding this issue. Yesterday, it was innocent women and children in the maternity hospital in Mariupol. We have lost more than 71 children because of the Russian war -- it is genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" Zelenska wrote to ABC News. She added, ""Moreover millions of people are suffering in Mariupol, Kharkiv, Irpin, Sumy and other cities. They don't have water, food and medicine. Russian soldiers are blocking humanitarian aid. We need to stop it. By saying 'we,' I mean the whole world."" Zelenska asked ""citizens of America, Europe and the whole world"" to hold their leaders accountable for ""silently observing for decades while the regime, where you cannot express your opinion, where the nation has been turned into slaves, grew and strengthened."" ""Leaders have lost their chance for respect. But you haven’t yet!"" Zelenska said. ""Today, the key life decisions are made in the offices of people who YOU elected as leaders in your countries. These are YOU who gave and keep giving the right to act on your behalf. And when they do not act, when they let our kids die -- these are YOU who give them this right."" She said it ""is essential"" for the West to understand that Ukraine ""is now protecting Europe and our shared values."" ""Every day of our fight increases the price that Ukraine pays for securing these values,"" Zelenska wrote. ""Surely, in this fight as a nation, we become stronger and tougher. I wish the sanctions against Russia from the U.S. and E.U. become the same: stronger and tougher."" She repeated her husband's call for NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a request that has been rejected by the White House and the international community for fears it could start World War III if a Russian military jet is shot down in a confrontation with U.S. and NATO aircraft enforcing such a zone. ""We ask NATO to close our sky on behalf of all the people of Ukraine, or at least provide us with aircraft so we can defend our sky by ourselves,"" Zelenska wrote. Zelenska directed a special message to Ukrainian women. ""You are giving life in the bomb shelters, calming children with lullabies, while Russian aviation keeps destroying our peaceful Ukrainian cities,"" she wrote. ""I admire your power. The power that becomes tougher than a hammer."" She also directed a message specifically to American women. ""I appeal to you, women in America, and ask to support Ukrainian women and children who escaped from war and are looking for a shelter in your country,"" she said. ""These days every act of kindness and humanism is vital while we are bravely fighting for freedom for Ukraine, for Europe, for the whole world.""",,,,25
2022-03-15,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-bike-tour-guide-refugee-now-raises-money/story?id=83360102,"Once a Ukrainian bike tour guide, a refugee now raises money for the troops","KOSICE, Slovakia -- Yurii Panchenko, who fled Ukraine with his wife and only daughter hours after the first Russian missile exploded near his house, has begun raising funds through his Ukrainian mountain bike business, offering tours in and around Kyiv via Airbnb. There are no actual tours taking place, as Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, continues to face indiscriminate missile strikes and shelling by the Russian military. But money, which will be used to support the Ukrainian defense, keeps flowing into Panchenko’s account. “People from all over the world have booked tours for several months ahead just to support us,” Panchenko said, adding, “Except for Russians. We haven’t had bookings from there yet.” Before the war, Panchenko’s tours were called “Mountain Biking In Kyiv” and the business had about one request per week. He renamed them “Support Ukrainian Army Mountain Bike Tours in Kyiv"" and demand flew off the chart. The idea came a few days ago, with a booking request for a bike tour on a day when bombs were falling on the Ukrainian capital. “First, I didn’t understand. Then I read a note from the customer, where they said they didn’t want to take the tour and they just wanted to support us,” Panchenko, who’s now living with his family in Vienna, Austria, said. Since then, he’s had more than 500 tours booked, raising more than $15,000, despite dropping his prices to make the symbolic adventure more affordable. Panchenko is one of many Airbnb hosts in Ukraine using the platform to raise money. More than 14,300 Airbnb Experiences were booked in Ukraine in the week prior to March 9, the company told ABC News. Hosts received about $360,000 in the same time period, the company said. Airbnb earlier this month announced it was temporarily waiving guest and host fees for bookings in Ukraine. “We are so humbled by the inspiring generosity of our community during this moment of crisis,"" said Haven Thorn, a company spokesperson. While there's no way to know how recipients use the donations, Airbnb said it's ""actively evaluating"" the listings in Ukraine to ""detect and deter fraudulent activity."" ""The vast majority or most of our hosts are everyday people sharing the home in which they live,"" Thorn said. ""People considering booking to donate can also look at a Host's profile to see how many listings they have and check the history of reviews on the listing to see how long the listing has been active.” The bike mechanic from Kyiv said he has used the money to buy fuel and medicine in support of evacuation efforts in Ukraine. He said he also purchased a special thermal camera worth about $1,700 for one of Ukraine’s elite military units. “We are also planning to send the troops other special devices, body armours and helmets,” Panchenko added. Panchenko said his family has barely anything to spare, yet they’re not planning to keep any of the Airbnb proceeds for their personal use. They fled to Vienna through Romania on a four-day ride, having packed a single bag of clothes and essentials while carrying less than a thousand dollars. They managed to find free temporary accommodation and support in the Austrian capital, where Panchenko now works as a bike mechanic in a repair shop. “We’ll be here for at least three weeks. We’re faring much better than other families who are still stuck in Ukraine. We’re trying to help those in need as much as we can,” Panchenko said. Panchenko’s family home is near the city airport in Kyiv, but when the first Russian cruise missiles hit dangerously close, they were gone in 15 minutes, he said. They hopped into their car and headed off early in the morning. “We were actually ready for something like this to happen and had some essentials pre-packed. But we never expected ballistic missiles to be raining down on us,” Panchenko said. He managed to escape with his family before Ukraine banned all men aged 18-60 from leaving the country and started conscripting them into the military. “I am not a military man and I knew I could be useful from elsewhere, like sending help from abroad,” Panchenko said. Panchenko said his family has no discernible plan for the future. “We’re currently living in the moment. We don’t know what’s going to happen to us next week,” Panchenko said. He wants to return to Ukraine with his family once the war is over and rebuild his life, he said. “But if they’ll need me to go back and fight, I’ll be ready,” he said.",,,,7
2022-03-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-admin-ways-fast-track-bringing-ukrainian-refugees/story?id=83534298,Biden admin considering ways to fast-track bringing Ukrainian refugees to US,"The Biden administration is considering ways to fast-track bringing Ukrainian refugees to the U.S. amid the historic surge across Europe of Ukrainians fleeing Russia's war, according to U.S. officials. But the administration faces some legal hurdles to doing so, especially to giving Ukrainians refugee status, and has instead repeatedly emphasized that ""the vast, vast majority of refugees want to stay in neighboring countries,"" as White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday, adding, ""That is where we have been focus our energies at this point."" That focus comes in the form of U.S. assistance: $293 million so far, with another $4 billion specifically for humanitarian aid in the new funding bill President Joe Biden signed earlier this week. But as the needs grow -- as cities like Warsaw and countries like Moldova are overwhelmed -- there's growing pressure on the White House, including from some U.S. lawmakers, to do more. The refugee resettlement process, however, is complex and time-consuming, with very few avenues to expediting cases from the point they are referred to the U.S. by the United Nations refugee agency, through the vetting process, to their resettlement in a local community. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the administration is ""looking at things that we can do ourselves and do directly."" ""As this and if this goes on, as the numbers increase, as the burden increases for European partners, we will certainly do everything we can to help,"" he added Thursday, saying it was ""something we're very focused on right now"" and previewing ""more to say on this in the coming."" So far, the White House has ordered some steps. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had granted Temporary Protected Status for Ukrainians already in the U.S. by March 1, allowing them to stay legally and work for at least the next 18 months. In addition, U.S. embassies and consulates in the region have been expediting visa processing for immediate family members of U.S. citizens, but they are overwhelmed. ""We are throwing many, many resources at the assistance for U.S. citizens in this region as well as visa processing, but the demand, as you can imagine, is very high,"" a senior U.S. administration official said. ""We are not able to process the volume of the people who are thinking about that as an option."" That pool of people is also already limited. Immigrant visas only apply to immediate family members as defined under U.S. law -- spouses, unmarried children under 21, and parents. If a U.S. citizen's family member doesn't fall into those categories, there's a process to petition U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to approve their case, but that is not being expedited, according to the senior administration official, meaning their application could take months, even years. Refugee advocates, however, say there are potentially thousands of Ukrainians for whom the USCIS has confirmed their familial relationship, but haven't yet fully approved their petition -- arguing their cases can and should now be expedited. It's unclear if the administration is weighing that. Blinken told reporters Thursday they were ""looking at steps we may be able to take on family reunification."" Wait times for nonimmigrant visas are often shorter, and applicants can request your application be expedited. But the senior administration official said there's a risk of being denied because these are ""not the appropriate tool to begin an immigrant, refugee, or resettlement process."" ""If your plan is to go to the United States and you have absolutely no idea what you'll do after that -- which I have to say on a human level is very understandable -- as U.S. consular officers who are charged with executing U.S. immigration law, they [Ukrainian applicants] would be well advised to have much more of a plan afterward,"" they said. The Department of Homeland Security also has the ability to provide another kind of temporary legal status known as humanitarian parole that allows a foreigner to enter the U.S. usually for up to a year. Reuters has reported that Customs and Border Patrol agents have been granting humanitarian parole to Ukrainians crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. DHS declined to comment to ABC News about those reports. ""We address an individual's claim for humanitarian relief as they are presented to us,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday. ""We are looking at other programs that we can implement to expand the avenues of humanitarian relief."" But DHS continues to use a public health authority known as Title 42 to send the majority of adults attempting to cross the border back to their country of origin. The policy was enacted at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by the Trump administration, and despite intense pressure from immigrants' rights group and progressive Democrats, the Biden administration has yet to lift it. Mayorkas said DHS has issued guidance to all CBP officers on the border reminding them of the exceptions to the Title 42 authority and how it relates to Ukrainian nationals ""and everyone else"" attempting to make credible fear claims at the southern border. But Psaki said revoking Title 42 ""wouldn't be done in response to a war in a European country. It's done by -- a decision would be made by the CDC and then it would be implemented."" The push to ""fast track"" the refugee process, however, is unlikely to yield results, with the program defined by law and requiring a referral and thorough vetting. The senior administration official said it ""is not an emergency response program, so our goal would be to provide humanitarian assistance to keep people safe where they are for now"" instead. For many refugees seeking to move to the U.S., it is a years-long process. There are already 7,000 Ukrainian refugees who have been in the pipeline for resettlement, according to Church World Service. While Blinken said ""of course we will take referrals"" for new refugees, he also emphasized the administration is ""looking at steps that we can take in the near term."" Refugee resettlement agencies say the administration is considering using the Lautenberg program as one way to potentially expedite refugee status. The Cold War-era program allows religious minorities, including Ukrainian Greek Catholics and Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Christians, to bring family members to the U.S. with refugee status. One agency told ABC News there are thousands of Ukrainian applications that the U.S. could swiftly admit, but it's not clear the administration agrees. ABC News's Ben Gittleson and Sarah Kolinovsky contributed to this report.",,,,2

The missiles hit the area near Lviv's airport, about 4 miles from the city center, according to the mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi. No casualties were reported after the attack, according to Sadovyi. Lviv is about 50 miles from the border with Poland. An aircraft repair plant was hit and destroyed and windows in the buildings of the communal transport enterprise were damaged in the strike, Sadovyi said. Six missiles, likely X-555, were fired from the Black Sea, according to preliminary data from the Ukraine's western military command. Two of the missiles were destroyed by anti-aircraft missile troops, command said. In an address Friday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country's air force is ""not enough to ensure safety."" ""Russian forces continue to bomb and shell our cities -- from Lviv to Kyiv, from Kharkiv to Chernihiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, cities of Donbas especially Mariupol. They fire missiles, drop bombs and launch GRADs. We try to intercept and shoot down whatever we can: aircraft, helicopters and missiles although we don't yet possess the adequate anti-missile weapons, modern systems,"" Zelenskyy said. He added that his appeals for weapons will be ""more forceful."" ""We'll remind those leaders that they will suffer moral defeat if they don't provide us with adequate and modern weapons promised to us, weapons that could quite literally save thousands upon thousands of Ukrainian lives. Russian missiles will not be shot down by age-old rifles that certain parties try to supply to us instead of modern equipment,"" Zelenskyy said. A senior U.S. official told ABC News Thursday that Russians have been using more long range systems, mobile systems repositioned from inside Russia to the border, but on the Russian side. There is apparently concern if they move across the border, guerilla fighters will intercept them.",,,,11

Now, many around the world are left wondering how to help Ukrainians amid the onslaught. Here are some ways to support the effort: Razom for Ukraine The nonprofit is collecting donations for its emergency response project to provide medical supplies, humanitarian aid and support volunteers on the ground. The group is also partnering with other Ukrainian-targeted organizations like Nova Ukraine, United Help Ukraine, Revived Soldiers Ukraine, Sunflower for Peace, and Euromaidan-Warszava, according to its website. The organization says it will use funds to purchase ""tourniquets, bandages, combat gauzes, sterile pads, and satellite phones."" It also says it is arranging ""warehouses and points of delivery in Poland and Ukraine."" Global Giving The charity organization GlobalGiving has started a Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund which will provide shelter, food and water to the 500,000 refugees and counting. The money will also be used for health and psychosocial care, as well as education and economic assistance, according to the organization's website. ""All donations to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund will support humanitarian assistance in impacted communities in Ukraine and surrounding regions where Ukrainian refugees have fled,"" the fund page reads. ""GlobalGiving's local partners are bringing relief to terrified and displaced communities, and they need resources to continue their life-saving work."" International Rescue Committee The International Rescue Committee is collecting financial donations that will go toward supporting resources and aid to displaced families. The organization specializes in helping refugees around the world who have been forced from their homes. They target communities where people lack vital resources for resettlement and recovery from crises. They also play a role in resettlement efforts in the United States. Doctors Without Borders Doctors Without Borders, an organization that provides medical care during humanitarian crises, still has workers in Ukraine despite the ongoing conflict. Donations to Doctors Without Borders will fund these services as well as mass casualty kits, emergency medicine and preparedness training for local hospitals and more. ""[The] teams in Ukraine are deeply worried about the consequences of the conflict for Ukrainian people and communities,"" the website reads. ""As hostilities continue, ensuring people’s access to health care and medicines will be critical."" United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the refugee agency for the United Nations, is accepting donations to provide health care, legal assistance and on-the-ground supply support to refugees from Ukraine. ""UNHCR has stepped up our operations and capacity in Ukraine and neighbouring countries,"" the organization's website read.

2022-03-19,https://abcnews.go.com/US/maryland-georgia-move-temporarily-suspend-gax-tax-amid/story?id=83548760,"Maryland, Georgia move to temporarily suspend gas tax amid nationwide high prices","Some states are pressing ahead in an attempt to relieve the pain at the pump many Americans are feeling these days by temporarily suspending gas taxes to help lower high prices. Maryland on Friday became the first state in the nation to suspend its gas tax after Gov. Larry Hogan signed legislation which waives the 36.1 cents per gallon tax on gasoline and its 36.85 cents per gallon tax on diesel, effective immediately, for the next 30 days. ""This is, of course, not a cure-all, and market instability will continue to lead to fluctuations in prices, but we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to provide relief for Marylanders,"" the Republican governor said in a statement. Also on Friday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar bill that would eliminate the state's roughly 29 cents per gallon tax on gasoline through the end of May. Kemp made a similar move in 2021 when he temporarily waived state taxes on motor fuels to offset prices after a key pipeline that carries fuel to much of Georgia and the East Coast, shut down following a cybersecurity attack involving ransomware. The closure at Colonial Pipeline in May, which transports approximately 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast, had raised prices and gas stations throughout the Southeast and caused reported fuel outages as motorists rushed to the pump. Gas prices overall were already gradually on the rise last year due to several factors as the country began to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic and fuel demand increased among Americans and businesses. The current spike in gas prices is due in part to Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month and the U.S. ban on imports of Russian oil and other energy products that followed. About 8% of U.S. imports of crude oil and petroleum products came from Russia last year, according to preliminary U.S. government data; 3% of U.S. oil came from Russia. The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline soared to record-highs last week, peaking at $4.326 per gallon, according to AAA -- levels not seen since July 2008. As of Friday, the national average price of regular-grade gasoline was at $4.262 per gallon. And it's not just Maryland and Georgia looking to suspend state gasoline taxes. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer also called on a temporary suspension of its tax on fuel -- a move she said ""will provide drivers relief at the pump right now -- not next year."" ""I'm ready to work across the aisle with the legislature to negotiate a bipartisan solution that cuts taxes and lowers costs for drivers, seniors, and working families,"" Whitmer said in a statement. In California, state lawmakers proposed a $400 gas rebate to help drivers with the soaring gasoline prices. A group of 10 California Democrats brought the proposal forward Thursday, saying that they would use $9 billion of the state's budget surplus to provide a $400 rebate to every California taxpayer. The rebate would cover the state's current gas tax for an entire year for cars with 15-gallon tanks, ABC-owned Los Angeles station, KABC reported. Evidence of the need for relief at the pump couldn't have been more visually apparent than the scenes that played out in the Chicago area this week. Traffic was backed up at various gas stations across the city Thursday as drivers vied for $50 in free gas. Former Chicago mayoral candidate and businessman Dr. Willie Wilson donated $200,000 worth of gas to participating gas stations ""to alleviate some of the pain that Chicagoans are experiencing because of the highest fuel prices in 14 years,"" he said. On Friday, Wilson announced another giveaway planned for March 24 worth $1 million and expanded to include 50 participating locations in Chicago and suburban Cook County. Local carpenter Ricky Kimmons who participated in the giveaway, told ABC owned Chicago station WLS it costs him $147 to fill up SUV due to the high prices. ""I was like, 'Is this for real?' And then I seen it on the news, so I started trying to find out the locations, and I was like 'oh, there's one right here by the house five minutes away.' Got right up, came right over here,"" Kimmons said. ""It helps me tremendously, a whole lot, just don't know how much I appreciate free gas right now.""",,,,22
2022-03-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/putins-war-russian-peoples-war-marina-ovsyannikova/story?id=83552852,"'It's Putin's war, not [the] Russian people's war': Russian anti-war journalist","Russian people do not support Russia's actions in Ukraine, Marina Ovsyannikova, the Russian journalist who made headlines after staging an anti-war protest on live TV, said Sunday, branding the unprovoked invasion ""Putin's war."" ""It's Putin's war, not [the] Russian people's war,"" Ovsyannikova told ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos in her first interview with an American broadcast network. Ovsyannikova ran onto the set of the main Russian state news live broadcast last Monday with an anti-war sign to protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine, standing behind a Channel One anchor as they were speaking. The sign read, ""NO WAR,"" and ""Don't believe the propaganda. They're lying to you here,"" in English and Russian, respectively. The program cut away within seconds, and officials took Ovsyannikova into custody, where she stayed overnight. The court fined Ovsyannikova 30,000 rubles (about $280) after being charged with an “administrative offense” stemming from an earlier video she recorded calling on Russians to take part in demonstrations against the war. Under a newly enacted censorship law, any person speaking out against the Russian government's narrative about the war, including by calling it a ""war"" or ""invasion,"" faces up to 15 years in prison. Ovsyannikova could still be charged under this law. Stephanopoulos asked Ovsyannikova why she took the risk of speaking out. ""As soon as the war began, I could not eat. I could not sleep,"" Ovsyannikova said.""What we showed on our programs was very different from what was going on in reality."" Ovsyannikova told Stephanopoulos she wanted to do something that would attract more attention than protesting in the square, as well as to show the rest of the world that Russians do not support the war. ""I could show to the Russian people that this is just propaganda, expose this propaganda for what it is and maybe stimulate some people to speak up against the war,"" Ovsyannikova said. Ovsyannikova encouraged people to analyze information from multiple sources to understand what is really happening. An independent protest monitoring group reports that as of Sunday, more than 15,000 people have been detained in Russia for protesting against the country's war against Ukraine. Stephanopoulos asked Ovsyannikova if she is worried for her safety, despite rejecting France's offer of asylum. ""I am very worried for the safety of my children,"" Ovsyannikova replied. ""I have publicly refused to take political asylum in France because I am a patriot; I want to live in Russia."" She acknowledged Russia is in a ""very dark and difficult"" period, but she encouraged people to speak up. Stephanopoulos followed up, asking Ovsyannikova what her message is for President Vladimir Putin and the West. Ovsyannikova said she wanted to show the world that not all Russians believe the same thing. She said that the sanctions against Russia are not just impacting Putin and his oligarchs. ""Ordinary people, ordinary Russian citizens who are against the war are also being affected,"" Ovsyannikova said. Ovsyannikova then gave her final message to her fellow citizens: ""to think critically and analyze the information that is being presented to them critically.""",,,,7
2022-03-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-recognizes-myanmars-atrocities-rohingya-genocide/story?id=83582997,US recognizes Myanmar's atrocities against Rohingya as 'genocide',"The U.S. government has determined the attacks by Myanmar's military against the Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority, constituted genocide and crimes against humanity, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Monday. The legal determination comes nearly five years after the brutal violence killed approximately 9,000 Rohingya and drove nearly 1 million from the Southeast Asian country across the border into Bangladesh, fleeing murder, rape and arson. Despite calls from Congress, human rights advocates, and other bodies to designate the atrocities a genocide, the State Department had held out. But now, with many of the same military leaders that were responsible for the genocide in power as part of a military coup last year, Blinken said recognizing the genocide was a key part of promoting accountability for its victims. ""The day will come when those responsible for these appalling acts will have to answer for them,"" Blinken said firmly during remarks at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The determination is only the eighth such one made by the State Department in the decades since the Holocaust, including in Bosnia and Rwanda, by ISIS and the Chinese government. It doesn't bring with it any automatic punishment. Instead, Blinken vowed to continue efforts toward accountability, including by announcing $1 million in new funding for the United Nations' Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. U.N. investigators have already found that the military committed ""genocidal acts,"" but the IIMM is collecting evidence for potential future prosecutions of military commanders involved in atrocities, just as investigations continue at the International Criminal Court and elsewhere. The U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice, also ruled in January 2020 that Myanmar must ""take all measures within its power"" to prevent the genocide of Rohingya after The Gambia, a small West African country, filed a lawsuit against Myanmar on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a coalition of countries with significant Muslim populations. Still, activists and human rights groups say Blinken's historic announcement could help spur action, ahead of the fifth anniversary of the military's deadly campaign this August. ""Rohingya faced genocide, one of the most terrible crimes imaginable, and then faced the international community not even acknowledging it had happened. Today, the U.S. has gone a long way to correcting that,"" said Tun Khin, a Rohingya activist. But Myanmar, still called by its former name, Burma, by the U.S. government, is now led by the military commanders who oversaw and orchestrated the genocide, including Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the leader who deposed Myanmar's democratically-elected government and its civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Myanmar has denied it has committed a genocide, instead calling it a military operation against Islamist extremists. It has rejected the ICJ's findings and refused to cooperate with the ICC probe. The Trump administration stopped short of designating the atrocities a genocide, in part because of concerns that pushing Myanmar's government too strongly would cause a military coup that collapsed the power-sharing civilian-military government. But critics have argued the impunity the military largely faced laid the groundwork for its February 2021 coup, just days after President Joe Biden took office. Trump's first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, called the attacks ""ethnic cleansing"" and his successor, Mike Pompeo, quietly released a State Department report documenting the atrocities, but declined to speak to its significance. But that report was one ""key"" basis for Blinken's determination, he said Monday. When he took office, he said the department would conduct a new review of the evidence and make a determination. Conducted in 2018, the State Department report documented through interviews with victims of grisly crimes that approximately three-quarters personally witnessed a killing, a majority witnessed sexual violenceand one-fifth witnessed a ""mass casualty event"" in which more than 100 people were killed or injured. Blinken didn't just cite those statistics Monday, he also read the firsthand accounts of some victims, including those documented by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's exhibit, ""Burma's Path to Genocide,"" which he toured before his remarks. ""It's painful to even read these accounts, and I ask you -- I ask each and every one of you listening -- put yourself in their place. ... These stories force us to reckon with the immeasurable pain wrought by every heinous abuse. That pain ripples outward -- from the individual victims and survivors to loved ones, to friends, to entire communities,"" he said -- adding a reference to his stepfather Samuel Pisar, a Holocaust survivor and renowned author, who he said ""carried"" that pain ""for the rest of his life."" But despite that pain, Myanmar's military leaders have suffered few consequences for their bloody actions -- not just the genocide, but last year's coup -- according to some activists. Successive rounds of U.S., European Union, British and Canadian sanctions, including on key economic sectors and military-owned enterprises, have not changed their course, especially amid continued support from Russia and China. ""Stronger actions must be followed to punish perpetrators, to protect remaining Rohingya in Myanmar, rebuild our lives,"" Wai Wai Nu, a Rohingya activist, tweeted Monday. Since the coup, the military has widened its attacks on civilians across the country and on other ethnic minority groups, while the same systems of persecution and violence that repressively targeted Rohingya for decades and presaged the genocide remain in place. ""We urge the administration, and the international community, to continue to do more to hold the military junta accountable, redouble efforts to restore democracy and bring about a genuine national reconciliation to Burma,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and James Risch, R-Idaho, the chair and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But that kind of reconciliation seems increasingly out of reach. Over a year after the coup, the armed forces have killed more than 1,600 people and detained thousands more. An opposition ""National Unity Government"" has received some backing from the U.S., but the country is heading toward a protracted civil war with increasingly dangerous implications for Myanmar and the region, according to some analysts.",,,,13
2022-03-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-demurs-biden-confirms-russia-fired-hypersonic-missile/story?id=83587994,"After Pentagon demurs, Biden confirms Russia fired hypersonic missile: Ukraine Day 26","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 26: Russia uses hypersonic missile against Ukraine: Biden President Joe Biden confirmed Monday night that Russia has used a hypersonic missile in Ukraine, saying it’s “the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty.” ""It doesn't make that much difference, except it's almost impossible to stop it. There's a reason they’re using it,"" Biden said at the Business Roundtable’s CEO Quarterly Meeting in Washington, D.C. Earlier on Monday, a senior U.S. defense official could not confirm Russia's claims to have used hypersonic missiles in Ukraine, but said it's not clear why it would. ""It's a bit of a head-scratcher to be honest with you, because it's not exactly clear why, if it's true, would you need a hypersonic missile fired from not that far away to hit a building?"" the official said. One of the major advantages of hypersonic weapons is the ability to evade radar detection from distant targets. But for hitting nearby Ukraine, the advantages are less obvious. One reason Russia might have used such a weapon could be due to running low on precision-guided munitions, or to send a message to the West and Ukraine in order to gain leverage in negotiations, the defense official said, adding that it is not practical from a purely military perspective. No Russian progress on the ground Russian forces are no closer to Kyiv than they were more than a week ago, the official said. ""They haven't achieved anything in terms of what we assessed to be their objectives, which was population centers so that they could occupy and take over Ukraine,"" the official said. The official added that you can count ""on one hand"" the cities Russian forces have taken, noting that Donetsk and Luhansk were already under their control before the invasion. ""So what have they gained in now 26 days? They got Melitopol, they got Berdyansk, and they got Kherson. That's it. They don't have Kharkiv, they don't have Mariupol,"" the official said. Ukrainian forces even mounted a counter-attack to try to retake Kherson, according to the official. ""It's very clear that the Ukrainians are showing no signs of stopping the resistance and no signs of slowing down their attacks on the Russians,"" the official said. The official said most credit for the stalled Russian efforts goes to the Ukrainian forces and citizens, and the leadership of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""President Zelenskyy has been quite inspirational, as you've all seen, and has really motivated his forces and his citizens, because some average citizens are picking up arms and fighting,"" the official said. But weapons and training from the U.S. and others are also playing a major role. ""It's not just about pointing and shooting,"" the official said. ""They're able to be nimble and creative because they were so well trained over the last eight years."" Despite setbacks, Russian forces have most of their forces intact and are trying to overcome. ""They are looking for a chance to gain some momentum -- not even regain momentum ... because they never really had it. And that's what's so frustrating for them,"" the official said. The frustrated Russian ground effort is leading to more missile strikes and artillery bombardment on cities, which makes things ever more dangerous for civilians, according to the official. ""This is not a military known for precision,"" the official said of the invaders. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Monday the Pentagon believes Russia is in some cases deliberately targeting civilians. “We certainly see clear evidence that Russian forces are committing war crimes,"" Kirby said. ""And we are helping with the collecting of evidence of that. But there's investigative processes that are going to go on and we're gonna let that happen. We're going to contribute to that investigative process.” Failure to launch The U.S. assesses Russia has fired more than 1,100 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. And there are indications it is having ""inventory issues"" with its precision-guided munitions, which could be one reason we're seeing greater use of unguided ""dumb bombs,"" the official said. The official added that Russia still has the majority of its missile stocks available. But the Pentagon is also seeing problems with the reliability of Russia's precision weapons. Some Russian missiles are ""failing to launch, or they're failing to hit the target, or they're failing to explode on contact,"" the official said. More Russian naval action near Odessa While there is still no sign of an imminent amphibious assault, the U.S. has seen more naval activity in the northern Black Sea, where Russia has more than a dozen surface warships of varying types. ""Clearly they're using surface combatants for shelling purposes, and for the long-range fires in and around Odessa,"" the official said. ""Whether this is a prelude to an amphibious assault is not clear."" Russian combat power Russia's invading force has ""just below"" 90% of its combat power intact, according to the official. ""We recognize that they are taking casualties every day. They are losing aircraft, they are losing armor and vehicles -- there's no doubt about that. Tanks, APCs, artillery units, helicopters, fixed wing jets,"" the official said. As for Ukraine, the Pentagon assesses it still has more than 90% of its combat power intact. The official credits this to the constant arms replenishment coming in from the U.S. and others. Also keep in mind that while this estimated percentage is slightly higher for Ukraine than Russia, Russia has more total power to lose. So far, the U.S. hasn't seen any movement of additional Russian troops to Ukraine. Russia lacks small-unit leadership The official could not confirm Ukrainian claims to have killed six Russian generals, but said it makes sense that there would be senior officers on the ground with the invading force. First, this is a major operation for the Russian military Second, ""they don't organize their military the way we do, they don't have an equivalent to a noncommissioned officer corps. And their junior officers don't have the same wherewithal, flexibility -- they don't invest in their junior officers the kind of initiative that we do,"" the official said. While the U.S. military instills a sense of battlefield leadership starting at the junior NCO ranks (corporals and sergeants on up), the Russian military has no such ethos, according to the official. ""The fact that there might be senior leaders on the field perhaps involved at a more tactical level than we would have a two star or a one star, it's apples to oranges in terms of how they organize themselves and how they lead,"" the official said, adding that Russian forces seem to be having command-and-control problems. $800 million weapons package from US shipping soon Initial shipments of the new $800 million U.S. weapons package to Ukraine will arrive ""very, very soon,"" the official said. This package includes thousands of shoulder-fired anti-armor/air systems, small arms, and 100 small Switchblade drone systems. The Pentagon has not seen any attempts by Russia to hit incoming weapon shipments so far. ABC News' Justin Gomez and Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",,,,6

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday on Day 27: Russian forces estimated below 90% combat capability for first time ""Let me remind, that is of the combat power that they assembled in Belarus, and in the western part of their country prior to the invasion, it is not an assessment of all Russian military power,"" the official said. ""But we assessed it for the first time they may be just a little bit below 90% on that. And no indications, no tangible indications of reinforcements being brought in from elsewhere in the country, no tangible indications of foreign fighters that have flown into the country ... no indications that they've moved in foreign fighters from Syria or elsewhere. ""And on resupply, again, no tangible indications that they are making an effort to resupply from outside the theater there that they're pulling in from elsewhere around the around Russia. But we do continue to see indications that they are having these discussions and that they are making those kinds of plans."" ""It's our assessment that as they look at reinforcements, it's probably the most likely scenario that they would want to pull in from places not inside Russia. I'd remind you that of the battalion tactical groups that Mr. Putin has available to him across Russia, he's used about 75% in this particular operation. So, I think our assumption would be he'd pull from outside the country first, but that's an assumption and I really don't want to get any more detailed than that,"" the official said. On whether troops in Belarus were massing on border with Ukraine, this official said, ""I don't have anything specifically with respect to Belarusian intentions, we're watching this as closely as we can. But nothing specific to report to in terms of Belarusian activity towards moving in."" Forces still stalled outside Kyiv, frostbite now an issue, missiles fired top 1,100 For the most part Russian troops remain stalled around Kyiv at the same distances we've heard for more than a week, the official said. ""We haven't seen any major repositioning by them around Kiev. Again, it's kind of been static 15 kilometers or so to the north, west and 30 kilometers to the to the east. They just haven't. We have not seen a lot of movement on their part."" The logistical and resupply issues continue to plague Russian troops with the official noting that Russia now has concerns about fueling the ships in the Black Sea. In addition to lack of food and equipment Russian troops are now enduring frostbite. ""We've picked up some indications that some of their soldiers are suffering from frostbite because they lack the appropriate cold weather gear for the environment"" said the official who added that some of those soldiers have been taken out of the fight as a result. The number of Russian missiles fired in Ukraine remains above 1,100, the official said. Ukrainian troops on offensive ""We have seen indications that the Ukrainians are going a bit more on the offense now,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said at a briefing later on Thursday. ""They have been defending very smartly, very nimbly, very creatively in places that they believe are the right places to defend and we have seen them now in places particularly in the south, near Khersan, they have tried to regain territory. Again we don't have great fidelity of tactical movements, but we have seen them, make these make these efforts."" He noted how the Ukrainians had said a few days ago that they were planning counterattacks and ""I think we have seen indications that they're that they're moving in that direction."" He said later, ""We do assess it in some places they are they are attempting to take back territory that the Russians have captured or occupied."" Russian siege of Mariupol ""The Ukrainians are fighting very, very hard to keep Mariupol from falling,"" said the official. The official said Ukrainian forces have mounted a strong resistance inside of Mariupol against the ""significant number"" of Russian forces that have made their way into the city including Russian separatist forces from the Donbas. For the most part, the Russian forces now pressing on Mariupol are forces that came south from Donetsk. The significant artillery and long-range bombing of Mariupol continues, but what's news is that the U.S. has observed over the last 24 hours ""that the Russians have likely been firing into the city from the sea from the Sea of Azov"" where the Russians have seven ships. The official said the U.S. assessed that the Russian push toward Mariupol is intended to be the ""southern pole"" of an effort by the Russians to cut off Ukrainian troops in the Donbas. ""So that Ukrainian forces can't ... come to the defense of cities further to the west, including Kyiv. So, Mariupol serves as an anchor for that effort, if you will, on the southern stretch of Ukraine."" ""A lot of significant fighting going on. Ukrainians are not giving up on Mariupol. They're fighting hard to prevent that. I'm sure that they don't need to be reminded about the importance of that city to this entire effort,"" the official said. In the Black Sea, the official said, there was ""no indication that there is an imminent amphibious assaults on or near Odesa and again we did not observe, at least from the navy side, we did not observe showing over the last 24 hours."" The Russians have 21 ships in the Black Sea. Twelve of them are surface combatant ships and nine of them are amphibious ships. Ukraine invasion raises questions about US troops in eastern Europe Kirby acknowledged that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed the security situation in Europe and that NATO's meeting this week may need to address new questions such as whether to keep troops in eastern Europe in the long term. ""We've got to think about it in a completely different way, no matter how this all ends up,"" Kirby said. Kirby said he couldn't get ahead of the NATO meeting and President Joe Biden's participation but recalled that during Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's trip to NATO last week that the alliance was ""taking steps to bolster deterrence and readiness"" in the wake of Russia's invasion, including the formation of new battle groups. ""The degree to which they exist long term is really going to be an alliance decision, not something that the United States will be able to decide unilaterally,"" said Kirby. Noting that the U.S. has boosted its troop levels in Europe from 80,000 to 100,000, Kirby said he couldn't predict the future but ""I can tell you that the secretary wants to preserve his options to a unilaterally be able to continue to bolster the eastern flank."" He added, ""We're not sure where this is going to go but the secretary is convinced that wherever it goes, the security environment on the European continent is now changed. And we've got to think about it in a completely different way, no matter how this all ends up.""",,,,6
2022-03-23,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-formally-accuses-russian-forces-committing-war-crimes/story?id=83627208,US formally accuses Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday announced that the State Department has made a formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. ""Based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources,"" Blinken said in a statement. The assessment does not come with any new U.S. sanctions, but it backs a global push for accountability for Russia's artillery and airstrikes on civilians and civilian infrastructure. President Joe Biden has said he believes Russian leader Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal,"" an accusation that the Russian government said threatened diplomatic relations between the two countries, already strained to their breaking point over Putin's war against Ukraine. But whether the war crimes assessment means Putin himself is a war criminal will depend on an individual court of law, according to U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack. ""There are doctrines under international law and domestic law that are able to reach all the way up the chain of command,"" she told reporters Wednesday, but whether that includes the Russian leader ""would depend on a court that has jurisdiction,"" she said. Van Schaack wouldn't say how the U.S. will push for accountability for what it has now deemed war crimes, adding, ""Everything's on the table. We're considering all the various options for accountability."" That includes the International Criminal Court, which has opened an investigation into potential war crimes, and domestic courts, including in neighboring countries who may gain custody of Russian service members or conduct trials in absentia. But the U.S. legal system is ill-equipped to handle cases, Van Schaack said, because the U.S. War Crimes Act limits prosecutions to U.S. citizens who are perpetrators or victims. Congress is considering amending that law, she said. Because the U.S. is not a party to the ICC, she said they have no ""affirmative cooperation duties,"" but left open the possibility for cooperating with it. Russia and Ukraine are also not parties to the ICC, but Ukraine reached an agreement with the court to grant it jurisdiction to investigate potential war crimes dating back to Russia's first invasion in 2014 when it seized the Crimean Peninsula and sparked the separatist war in eastern provinces known as the Donbas. Van Schaack declined to speak to individual attacks that backed up the new U.S. assessment, but she and Blinken pointed to Russia directly targeting sites that were clearly marked for civilian use. ""Russia's forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded. Many of the sites Russia's forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians,"" Blinken said in his statement. This includes the Mariupol maternity hospital and ""a strike that hit a Mariupol theater, clearly marked with the word 'дети' -- Russian for 'children' -- in huge letters visible from the sky. Putin's forces used these same tactics in Grozny, Chechnya, and Aleppo, Syria, where they intensified their bombardment of cities to break the will of the people,"" Blinken added. Van Schaack said individual Russian service members who conducted these attacks could be prosecuted, but so too could their commanders who were responsible for them and were either complicit in the attacks or even just because they didn't stop their forces from conducting them. The State Department will continue to compile evidence of war crimes and share them with the appropriate bodies, including Ukraine's prosecutor general's office, which has said it's recorded over 2,400 ""crimes of aggression and war crimes"" in the month-long war and identified 127 suspects, prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova told the AFP. That evidence includes not just video, photos, and other publicly available information, but U.S. intelligence, including intercepted communications between Russian service members, according to Van Schaack, who said all of it is being preserved for future trials. ""We don't want to lose that evidence. We don't want that evidence to be tampered with. So it's extremely important that it be collected now and preserved with an eye towards future accountability,"" she told reporters. For weeks, U.S. officials, up to and including Biden, hinted that the U.S. was seeing evidence that Russia was committing war crimes, but deferred to a formal assessment from Van Schack's office, the State Department's office of global criminal justice. Still, Biden told reporters last week he believed Putin is a ""war criminal"" -- a comment that the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. ambassador John Sullivan over, warning it put U.S.-Russian relations ""on the brink of collapse.""",,,,13
2022-03-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/north-korea-tested-biggest-long-range-missile-foreign/story?id=83645211,North Korea may have tested its biggest long-range missile yet in another foreign policy crisis for Biden,"North Korea launched a long-range missile with its highest peak yet on Thursday, marking a full return to its dark days of saber-rattling and a critical step in its mission to perfect the nuclear weapons program that has made it an outlaw state. The missile, which analysts say is capable of reaching the entire United States, presents another foreign policy challenge for President Joe Biden, already facing crises on multiple fronts, including Russia's war on Ukraine and negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. The launch, the twelfth this year, is the first intercontinental ballistic missile launch that demonstrated a long range since 2017 when North Korea test-fired two ICBMs -- sending this new missile over 3,700 miles in the air in a lofted trajectory. The U.S. ""strongly"" condemned the launch as ""a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. But with Biden in Europe to rally allies against Russia, it seems the world is largely distracted as North Korea makes further advances in its ballistic missile technology. ""Right now, the U.S. is going to be totally distracted. The Biden administration really has not lifted a finger to begin negotiations"" with North Korea over dismantling its nuclear weapons program, said retired Marine Col. Steve Ganyard, an ABC News contributor and former State Department and Pentagon official. Repeated attempts by the Biden administration to start negotiations with Pyongyang have been met with silence. Last fall, North Korea's strongman leader Kim Jong Un said that U.S. outreach was ""nothing more than a façade to mask their deception and hostile acts"" and has instead turned inward as North Korea struggles with an economy crippled by sanctions and COVID-19 restrictions. But rather than ease the suffering of the North Korean people, Kim's regime continues to pour funds and energy into an expanding nuclear weapons program that it sees as a guarantor of its security. This year alone, North Korea has now tested 12 missile tests -- tying a record for the most in one month in January -- but Thursday's was perhaps the most significant to date. ""It's a massive missile ... [that], if the kilometric data proves out, can reach any point in the United States,"" Ganyard said. ""Kim knows that the world is distracted, and so what better time to test a very, very provocative and destabilizing missile."" According to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, the missile launched from North Korea's west coast, heading east and high. It flew for approximately 71 minutes, landing in the waters of Japan's exclusive economic zone, which Tokyo sees as a direct threat. It flew an estimated 684 miles to a maximum height of 3,728 miles -- marking the highest apogee yet for a North Korean launch. That high launch is meant to keep the missile from directly flying over an adversary like Japan or even an ally like Russia, given the risk that would pose. Analysts are still studying the launch and determining what kind of missile it was, but it may be the same one North Korea paraded out in October 2020 to much fanfare. Either way, ""you can interpolate this [data] and accurately predict this missile can range all of the land mass of the continental United States,"" said ret. Gen. Robert Abrams, an ABC News Military Contributor and former commander of U.S. Forces Korea. ""I'd say now there is no doubt,"" Abrams added, that North Korea could strike anywhere in the U.S. Still, key questions remain about that capability, including whether the missile has the ability to integrate a nuclear warhead that can survive reentry and strike accurately, according to Abrams. But he added, ""It is certainly within their grasp, I would say."" That marks a new step in Pyongyang's quest to perfect its nuclear missile program. But the White House seemed to downplay the significance, pointing to two other ICBM tests earlier this year and declining, so far, to call it an ICBM, like South Korea and Japan did. On Feb. 26 and March 4, North Korea conducted ballistic missile tests that the U.S. later concluded involved a new ICBM system -- the same one believed to be used in Thursday's test. But those launches did not demonstrate the same long range that the missile is capable of, ""likely to evaluate this new system before conducting a test at full range in the future,"" the Pentagon said at the time. That future may have arrived Thursday. Beyond statements of condemnation from the White House, State Department, and Pentagon, it's unclear what the Biden administration will do about it -- or even can. North Korea is already under heavy U.S. and U.N. sanctions, although some analysts argue more could be done. Further action at the U.N. Security Council is all but guaranteed to be blocked by North Korea's allies China and Russia. And Pyongyang continues to reject diplomacy.

2022-03-24,https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-accept-100000-ukrainian-refugees/story?id=83645980,"US says it will accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees","President Joe Biden on Thursday will announce that the U.S. will accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, according to a senior administration official. “To meet this commitment, we are considering the full range of legal pathways to the United States and that includes U.S. refugee admissions program, parole and immigrant and non-immigrant visas,” the official told reporters. The official also said the commitment to take in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees was not tied to any particular time frame. The official reiterated that the administration still believed the majority of refugees would prefer to stay in neighboring countries or elsewhere in the European Union. Eastern European cities and countries have become overwhelmed with refugees. A senior administration official told ABC News last week that the U.S. refugee program ""is not an emergency response program, so our goal would be to provide humanitarian assistance to keep people safe where they are for now."" The process for refugees to stay in the U.S. is complex. Vetting it required as well as a referral from a United Nations agency. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the administration is ""looking at steps that we can take in the near term."" The White House did not announce specifics on how it will process these refugees. Administration officials said specifics will be announced ""in the coming weeks."" The refugee resettlement process can also take years. In February, the U.S. admitted 427 Ukrainian refugees out of 2,133 refugees in total, according to Department of State data. Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, more than 3.6 million refugees have fled the country, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. The majority of the refugees have fled to nearby countries, with more than 2 million people crossing into Poland. U.S. embassies and consulates in the region are processing emergency visa applications but are overwhelmed. ""We are not able to process the volume of the people who are thinking about that as an option,"" a senior administration official said last week. According to U.S. law, immigrant visas only apply to immediate family -- meaning spouses, unmarried children under 21 and parents. Family not in that category can submit a petition to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to approve their case. Biden on Thursday will announce more than $1 billion in new funding for humanitarian assistance for those affected by Russia’s war. ""This funding will be additional to money that we have already provided and will provide food, shelter, clean water, medical supplies and other forms of assistance,"" a senior administration official told reporters. The U.S. will also provide $11 billion over the next five years to address food security threats and malnutrition across the world. This will be done through the Feed the Future initiative.

2022-03-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/oligarchs-crosshairs-alleged-western-enablers-attract-fresh-scrutiny/story?id=83627663,"With oligarchs in the crosshairs, alleged Western 'enablers' attract fresh scrutiny","As governments scramble to seize high-profile assets owned by Russian oligarchs, a quiet effort is gaining momentum in the West to target their alleged “enablers” – the lawyers, lobbyists and money-handlers who critics say help them hide, invest and protect their vast wealth in U.S. and European institutions. “The yachts and jets and villas get the most attention, but a lot of the oligarchs’ money is in private equity and hedge funds – places we can’t see,” said Maira Martini, a researcher with the corruption watchdog Transparency International. “That’s the money that really matters to them.” For decades, wealthy business tycoons with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin have enlisted the services of reputable bankers and lawyers in the West to navigate loopholes that obscure their identity. While it's not necessarily illegal to use obscure entities and agents to protect finances, critics say the laws need to be strengthened to create more transparency. Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a global investigative reporting platform that focuses on corruption, organized crimes and illicit financing, claims to have uncovered over 150 assets worth $17.5 billion held by 11 Russian elites and their alleged enablers, while a Forbes report identified more than 82 properties across the world -- a collective of $4.3 billion -- held by 16 sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Assets that have surfaced are likely only a fraction of these oligarchs' actual wealth. The true extent is difficult to track because they often use a convoluted network of shell companies, obscure entities and stand-ins to keep their finances hidden, experts said. But now, with war raging in Ukraine, lawmakers and corruption watchdogs are calling on governments to close those loopholes and crack down on the middlemen who know how to exploit them. “Putin’s oligarchs cannot operate without their Western enablers, who give them access to our financial and political systems,” said Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn. “These unscrupulous lawyers, accountants, trust and company service providers and others need to do basic due diligence on their clients to ensure that they are not accepting blood money. This isn’t rocket science – it is common sense policy to protect democracy.” In Washington, Cohen and others have introduced the ENABLERS Act, which would require real estate brokers, hedge fund managers and other entities to “ask basic due diligence questions whenever somebody comes to them with a suitcase full of cash,” said Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., the lead sponsor of the bill. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a global network of journalists and newsrooms that have tracked the wealthy's tax havens and financial secrecy, has identified at least a dozen networks of facilitators, offshore agents and banks across the world that have allegedly helped Russia's elites move and hide their money based on its analyses of public records and leaked financial documents the group has obtained over the past decade. This includes a range of actors, from global offshore law firms that create shell companies and other obscure entities to help wealthy Russians keep their finances clouded, to one-man shops in offshore tax havens that help set up ""nominee"" shareholders and paid stand-ins to conceal the real owners of entities. ICIJ also points to the roles of major law firms in helping shape the modern tax avoidance system as well as the roles of big financial institutions and banks in helping wealthy Russians move their money. Last year, The Washington Post, as part of its collaboration with ICIJ's Pandora Papers project, reported on how South Dakota, with its limited oversight, vague regulations and trust secrecy, has become a tax haven for secretive foreign money. Malinowski stressed that the United States ""has become one of the easiest places in the world for corrupt kleptocrats around the world to hide money."" “What we've basically allowed is a system where people can steal their money in countries without the rule of law and then protect their money in countries like ours where they can count on property rights and courts and privacy rules to safeguard his loot for life,"" Malinowski said. ""We should not be complicit in the theft that supports dictatorships like Putin."" Experts warned that sanctions and asset seizures, while effective in the short term, may be toothless over time if secrecy loopholes remain in place. On Wednesday, Transparency International published an open letter calling on Western leaders to take steps to stem rules that foster opacity. “To disguise their wealth and keep them out of the reach of law enforcement authorities, kleptocrats will turn to lawyers, real estate agents, banks, crypto-service providers and banks in your countries,” the letter reads. “You must redouble your supervision efforts over the gatekeepers of the financial sector.”",,,,29

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 28: Russian troops face major setback east of Kyiv and moving into defensive positions In a significant movement, Ukraine's military forces have pushed back Russian forces east of Kyiv to 55 kilometers from the city center, according to a senior defense official. For weeks, and as recently as Tuesday, Russian forces have been kept at bay approximately 20 to 30 kilometers from the center of the capital city. The official said that Ukrainian forces near Bovary ""have been able to push the Russians back to about 55 kilometers east and northeast of Kyiv."" The ability to push back Russian forces nearly twice as far as where they had been for weeks is in line with what the official had said on Tuesday were indications that in some areas Ukrainian forces were attempting to retake territory taken by Russia. ""Ukrainians are not only in some of these places up sufficiently defending they're going on the offense in some of these places and actually pushing the Russians backwards, or in the case of Kiev, they're, they're basically forcing them into a defensive position,"" the official said Wednesday. The U.S. now assesses that Russian troops that have been stalled 12 to 15 kilometers north of the city are ""digging in"" and establishing defensive positions according to the official. ""They're forcing them into a defensive position"" the official told reporters on Wednesday. ""So it's not that they're not advancing, they're actually not trying to advance right now,"" said the official. ""They're taking more defensive positions."" ""We're starting to see him sort of dig in around Kyiv but really trying to go more on the offense than they have been, more energy applied, in that eastern part of Ukraine"" said the official. Ukrainians pushing back Russian troops in Cherniviv Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops in the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, have also succeeded in slightly pushing back some of the Russian forces that have surrounded the city for weeks. The official described Ukrainians forces there as continuing to fight ""very hard"" against Russian forces to keep them out of the city and in some cases Russian troops have been ""ceding ground."" ""They are actually moving in the opposite direction, but not by much,"" the official said of Russian forces around the city. Russian troops now prioritizing operations in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region The official said Russia appears to be ""starting to prioritize"" their operations in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, particularly around Luhansk, to cut off Ukraine's military that has been fighting there against Russian separatists for the past eight years. ""We still believe that the Russians are trying to basically cut it off and therefore pin down Ukrainian forces that are that are in the Luhansk, Donetsk area,"" said the official. ""What we're seeing now is indications that the Russians are really starting to prioritize that part of eastern Ukraine,"" said the official. ""We believe that they are now going to start to apply, actually, they have applied a lot more energy in the Luhansk, Donetsk area, particularly around Luhansk. You're seeing them really put more energy and effort into that part of Ukraine."" The official has previously said that it appears that the Russian forces fighting to take over the southern port city of Mariupol so they can then push north into the Donbass to cut off the Ukrainian military. Meanwhile, the fighting in that city remains ""very very contested"" according to the official who also described the fighting there between Russian and Ukrainian troops as being ""hardcore."" The official noted that Russian forces continue to heavily bombard the city with artillery and long range missile fire. Meanwhile, it appears that recent Russian military activity around the western port city of Odessa that led to speculation of an attack on the city may have been a feint intended to ""pin down Ukrainian forces."" ""It's not entirely it's not entirely obvious that they actually will make a move on Odessa,"" said the official. ""So we're just we're just kind of watching that to see to see where it goes."" More US troops going forward to eastern Europe? The official said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is always assessing the U.S. military presence in eastern Europe and has not ""taken off the table"" the possibility ""that he will flow more forces in from the United States or reposition from elsewhere in Europe."" But for now there are no announcements to make said the official who added that it's unclear what the U.S. military posture in eastern Europe will look like going forward. ""Certainly, the security environment in Europe is different now. And it will be different that it will be different no matter what the outcome is of this war,"" said the official. ""I think it's safe to say that the United States as well as other NATO nations will be taken a hard look at what it whether we have the footprint right and whether the posture is appropriate to the new security environment that results from all this,"" the official said. Russia has lots of missiles left to use According to the official, Russia has now launched more than 1,200 missiles into Ukraine, but ""we still assess that they have the vast majority of their of their assembled available inventory of surface to air missiles and cruise missiles available to them."" Though the Russian military has expended a lot of the missile inventory readied for operations in Ukraine the official noted that ""they still have an awful lot left."" The official said that Russia's military is ""running the lowest on our air launched cruise missiles"" but that they still have ""over 50% of what they had assembled prior to the invasion. But they still have a significant number of ground launched cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and medium range ballistic missiles.",,,,6
2022-03-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-lead-negotiator-talks-russia-months/story?id=83626948,Ukraine's lead negotiator says talks with Russia could take months,"Ukraine's lead negotiator in peace talks with Russia has said he believes the negotiations with Moscow are ""absolutely real,"" but has warned it may take months to reach a deal to end the war. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke to ABC News inside the heavily guarded compound of the presidential office in central Kyiv. ABC News reporters were brought through several rings of security into the building's darkened corridors, piled with sandbags to protect against shelling and empty except for Ukrainian special forces soldiers armed with assault rifles standing every few yards. Podolyak has been leading Ukraine's delegation at the talks that began within days after Russia's invasion. The first rounds were held in Belarus but recently the sides have switched to sessions by video link. Podolyak said the talks are now taking place every day by video, mostly at the level of working groups. Both sides in the last week have said the talks are making progress and that they are moving closer to a compromise, despite intense ongoing fighting. Ukrainian and American officials though have expressed doubts whether Russia is negotiating in good faith or might be using the talks just to buy time for its forces to regroup to press on with its war. But Podolyak said he was certain Russia was now genuinely negotiating, aware that it has no choice. ""They're absolutely real negotiations,"" Podolyak said. ""There's no attempt to stall for time. That's definitely not there."" But he warned that reaching an agreement could still take ""months."" Heavy losses inflicted on Russia, devastating Western sanctions and its failure to take any key cities, including Kyiv, have forced the Kremlin to moderate its demands, Podolyak said, meaning the two sides' positions are now far closer. ""Twenty-eight days of war have shown that Russia is not a country that can dictate conditions,"" he said. ""It seems to me they really do want to resolve some issues in negotiations, because there is the sanctions pressure, military pressure from Ukraine. We have already put them in their place."" But he said that more pressure from Ukraine's military, as well as international sanctions, was still needed to push Russia into negotiating positions that would allow for an agreement. Russia's core demand remains that Ukraine renounce its ambition to join NATO. In recent days, Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have signaled they understand Ukraine will not join the alliance but have emphasized Ukraine wants security guarantees from Western countries to protect it from any future Russian aggression. Last week, the Financial Times and The Washington Post reported Russia and Ukraine were discussing a 15-point peace plan that would see Ukraine give up its NATO ambitions and accept some limits on its military in return for security guarantees from allies like the U.S., U.K. and Turkey. Russia is also demanding Ukraine recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and the independence of two Russian-occupied separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, as well as legal provisions protecting the rights for the Russian language in Ukraine. Podolyak denied there is a 15-point plan as reported, saying it simply represented Russia's proposals. He said both sides had ""several drafts"" outlining their own positions but there was no ""agreed project."" Podolyak avoided saying whether Ukraine was now ready to give up its NATO ambitions, but stressed Ukraine is now seeking separate guarantees from willing NATO countries rather than membership in the alliance. He suggested that such guarantees from Western countries were essential to Ukraine if it is to sign any agreement. Those security guarantees appear a significant obstacle to a deal since it is unclear how any promise from a NATO country to defend Ukraine would differ from Ukraine de facto joining the alliance. Asked what sort of guarantees Ukraine is seeking, Podolyak suggested as an example that it could be ""legally enshrined"" that a no-fly zone will be imposed over Ukraine in the event of a new Russian attack. He declined to say which NATO countries Ukraine was discussing such guarantees with, since negotiations are ongoing, but he did not deny the U.S. was among them. Ukraine wants security guarantees so ""that Russia does not attack us in the future,"" he said. ""This requires not amorphous structures returning to the U.N., OSCE [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe] or NATO, but effective alliances that will make it clear to Russia that it is not necessary to attack Ukraine's borders, as this will have very, very bad consequences."" The U.S. and other NATO countries have already repeatedly ruled out imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine because it would lead to a direct conflict with Russia. The Kremlin's spokesman said Tuesday the talks were progressing ""much more slowly and less substantively than we would like"" and Russia has insisted it will still achieve the goals set at the beginning of its operation against Ukraine. Podolyak said that Russia's positions have already become far more ""appropriate,"" but that it still had ""illusions"" that Ukraine can be made to accept ultimatums. The danger, he said, was that the two countries were now moving into a phase of bloody stalemate that would see Russia cause heavy civilian casualties before it was finally forced into accepting a compromise. The timing to end the war, Podolyak said, would depend on how much Western support Ukraine now received. He said Ukraine needs more air defenses and anti-tank weapons and called for Western countries to impose a full embargo on Russian oil and stricter financial sanctions. The U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars in weaponry to Ukraine, including a new $800 million cache now being delivered. ""I think right now they are in a state of shock and are trying to understand how low they might lower their demands so that we will start to agree with them on something,"" said Podolyak. ""It's a difficult process for them. For eight years they lived in illusions -- they thought they were world champions on the level with the United States."" He said continuing pain inflicted by Ukraine's military and more sanctions would force Russia to come to terms with the reality of its position. ""Russia will become more and more adequate and will come to the negotiating position, which will allow for the signing of an agreement not only with Russia -- for there's no point to a peace agreement with Russia -- but a multilaterally guaranteed agreement, where first of all there will be guarantor countries,"" he said.",,,,7
2022-03-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-admin-avoiding-red-line-russian-chemical-weapons/story?id=83670622,Biden admin avoiding 'red line' over any Russian use of chemical weapons in Ukraine,"The Biden administration official is steering clear of defining any use by Russia of chemical weapons in Ukraine as a ""red line,"" a senior administration official told ABC News. ""We learned our lesson"" the official said in describing the Obama administration's ineffective response to Syria's use of chemical weapons in 2012. Instead, the administration is considering a new round of economic sanctions against Russia as a potential response should Russia use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, according to a senior administration official. A senior administration official told ABC News that the U.S. would most likely respond to Russia's use of chemical and biological weapons ""with dramatically stepped-up"" sanctions that could target Russia's gold reserves or Russian leadership. However, the official noted that developing additional rounds of sanctions might be difficult to put into play given the wide range of international sanctions against Russia that have been put in place since Russia's invasion. ABC News has previously reported that the Biden administration and NATO are looking to get chemical and biological detection systems into Ukraine in light of the concerns raised about the possible Russian use of the weapons. In recent weeks, American officials have expressed concerns that Russia has been preparing a false-flag operation -- claiming Ukraine's use of chemical or biological weapons -- that Russia could use as a justification for its use of such weapons. Following meetings with NATO leaders in Brussels on Thursday, President Joe Biden said the United States would respond to Russia's use of chemical and biological weapons, but did not lay out specifics for possible responses. ""We would respond if he uses it,"" Biden said at a news conference. ""The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use."" ""We are working through contingency planning for a range of different scenarios,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling with the president on Friday. ""In broad terms, I believe that there is convergence around the fundamental nature of how the alliance would respond to these issues."" ""Any use of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical, biological, Russia would pay a severe price for the use of those weapons, as the president has previously said,"" Sullivan added. ""We have spoken to our allies, we've done contingency planning within our own government, and we have communicated directly to the Russians."" The administration also is weighing how it would respond should Russia target the supply lines inside Poland and other NATO countries that are flowing in thousands of American-made Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine's military. The administration will most likely pursue a response of ""careful reciprocity"" to avoid escalation according to the official. Such a response might include the proportional targeting of any Russian weapons system involved in an attack on supplies inside of Poland said the official. Contemplating a tougher response is tempered by the reality that ""everyone knows what that would lead to"" said the official.",,,,16

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 30: In apparent shift, Russian offensive toward Kyiv stopped, troops now in defensive positions The official described how Russian forces around Kyiv appear to have stopped offensive operations toward the capital city and are moving into defensive positions as they seem to be prioritizing offensive operations in the Donbas, the eastern part of the country. ""It appears that the Russians are at the moment not pursuing a ground offense or ground offensive towards Kiev,"" said the official. They are digging in. They are establishing defensive positions."" However, the official said that the bombardment of the city using long-range weapons is continuing. ""They don't show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground,"" said the official. ""And that is in keeping with our assessment of a couple of days ago that they are going to prioritize the eastern part of the country with in terms of ground offense. And that is exactly what we're seeing."" Earlier on Friday, a top Russian general told reporters that Russia's initial military operations had been completed and that operations would now focus ""on the most important thing, the complete liberation of Donbas."" ""They have stopped trying to move forward and what they have started to do is try to defend what they have,"" said the senior U.S. defense official. ""We're seeing the Ukrainians really go now on the offense on them around Kyiv and that includes to the west of it."" The official described heavy fighting in the towns of Bucha and Irpin northwest of Kyiv where he said the Ukrainians are 'trying hard to dislodge the Russians.'"" Russian military now prioritizing operations in Donbas in eastern Ukraine ""They are putting their priorities and their effort in the east of Ukraine and that's where still there remains a lot of heavy fighting,"" said the official. ""We think they are trying to not only secure some sort of more, more substantial gains there as a potential negotiating tactic at the table, but also to cut off Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country."" ""They are more focused on the Donbas,"" said the official, describing the easternmost area of the country where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting against Ukraine's military for the past eight years. ""The defensive crouch that they're now taking in Kyiv, we think is consistent with their desire now to be more on the offense and to be more aggressive in the east and Donbas."" And that includes increased air bombardment in the region including in the port city of Mariupol that continues to see what the official described as ""vicious vicious fighting."" Russian forces lose full control of strategic southern city of Kherson In a significant setback, Russian forces have lost full control of the strategic southern city of Kherson according to the official. If the Ukrainians were to retake the city, it would mark the first time that Russian troops will have been pushed out of a major city seized by Russia. ""It doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before,"" said the official. ""The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson, but we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again."" If Ukrainian forces were to retake the port city, it ""would be a significant development, no question about that in terms of the southern part of the war,"" the official said. If that happened Russian troops would be ""sandwiched"" between Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv to the west and Kherson, the official said. ""That would put them smack in the middle and that would make it very, very difficult for them to make any kind of ground movement on Odessa. If in fact, that was their plan,"" the official said. Russian reinforcements headed to Ukraine from Georgia ""We've seen our first indications that they are trying to send in some reinforcements from Georgia,"" said the official. ""We have seen the movement of some number of troops from Georgia. In recent days, U.S. officials have said that it appeared that Russia was seeking reinforcements for its military operations in Ukraine, but interestingly from outside of Russia. ""We don't have an exact number,"" said the official. ""I couldn't tell you whether it's a whole BTG (battalion tactical group) or how many troops."" Russian troops have been in breakaway Russian areas of Georgia since 2008. Russian missile failure rates between 20% and 60% The senior U.S. defense official did not dispute press reports that Russian missiles are failing to launch between 20% and 60% of the time. ""It's hard for us to assess that perfectly in terms of numbers, but we have seen some failures,"" said the official. ""The ranges I've seen in the press from anywhere from 20 to 60%. I would not push back on that assessment,"" said the official. ""But again, it's a range, and it's very nearly from day to day, but we have seen times ... when our assessment is they have they have experienced a significant amount of failure in their missiles,"" the official added. While the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, the official said that Russian planes are now flying about 300 sorties a day and are continuing to fire a lot of missiles that are causing their supplies to dwindle. ""They still have more than 50% but that's the air launch cruise missiles in particular the thing that they're running the lowest on,"" said the official.

2022-03-27,https://abcnews.go.com/US/effective-gas-tax-holidays-helping-motorists-wallets/story?id=83654489,How effective are gas tax holidays at helping motorists' wallets?,"As gas prices continue to soar across the country, three states have opted to temporarily waive their gas tax to provide relief for motorists. Other states are mulling similar plans. Last week, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed legislation that suspended their states' gas taxes for a limited period. On Thursday, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont signed a legislative package that included a tax holiday on the state's gas tax during the spring. While the move may save drivers around 30 cents per gallon at the pump, economic and policy experts warn that it is only a stop-gap solution. ""They may not lower [gas] consumption and they might increase it,"" Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at gas price app GasBuddy, told ABC News of the tax holidays. ""I would love to pay less at the pump too, but this is a Band-Aid solution."" The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is $4.24 as of March 25, according to AAA. Some states, particularly those on the West Coast, are seeing average prices of over $5 a gallon, AAA's data shows. Last month, the national average price was $3.57 a gallon and a year ago, it was $2.87, according to the association. Georgia's effort suspends its tax of 29 cents a gallon until the end of May, Maryland's rule suspends its tax of 36.1 cents per gallon until mid-April and Connecticut's rule suspends the state's tax of 25 cents per gallon until June 30. The governors of the three states said drivers were feeling the pinch every week at the pump and they needed to take immediate action. ""We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to provide relief for Marylanders,"" Hogan said in a statement last week after signing his state's legislation. The leaders also said their state budgets have the money from surpluses and the federal relief package to offset the lost tax revenue. ""Connecticut is in a stronger fiscal position than ever before, and I am determined to use every tool available to provide relief for our residents,"" Lamont said in a statement. Other state leaders have said they are considering similar gas tax holidays, including ones in Michigan and California. Giacomo Santangelo, senior lecturer of economics at Fordham University, told ABC News the nation's rising gas prices are caused by a number of factors outside of the control of the states, including the global supply chain problems and the ongoing Ukraine-Russian conflict. Political pressure and desperation from commuters, businesses and other motorists have forced state leaders to think outside of the box, he said. ""The bottom line is gas prices aren't going to go down anytime soon and people do need help,"" Santangelo told ABC News. Santangelo, however, said that those leaders are taking a big risk by implementing a temporary gas tax holiday. There is no indication that gas prices will return to under $4 a gallon in the coming weeks, he noted. ""If what they are doing is they are giving a 25-cent break on their gas, then what happens when gas goes up 25 cents in a few weeks anyway? You're now back in the same situation and the government is in a worse place. There are a lot of unknowns,"" Santangelo said. De Haan said there is a potential longer-term problem by creating a gas tax holiday -- increased demand for gas when supply is still low. He said temporary tax suspension will spur some drivers to take trips that may not have been necessary, and they will gas up when they won't need to. ""The right way to handle this situation is not to reduce the price, it's to tell motorists to reduce consumption,"" he said. Santangelo said that lowering the price through a gas tax suspension does set up expected demand from motorists. He noted that this isn't the first time the country has experienced surging gas prices and it won't be the last time and a gas tax holiday may not work, especially if supply doesn't change. ""Demand was going to go up anyway, because we're heading into the summer season. The question we have to ask is, 'Do we want to have demand so high and risk shortages?'"" he said. Santangelo cautioned that solutions involving rebates or cash incentives could also create this demand. California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a program last week that would provide $400 per vehicle to offset rising gas prices, for up to two vehicles per resident. The money would be funded with the state's budget surplus. ""It could turn into is something that the government keeps getting sucked into,"" Santangelo said. ""You're able to give $400 now but would you be able to sustain that if prices don't go down?"" Representatives for Kemp, Hogan and Lamont told ABC News that their gas tax suspension proposals were planned out with the intention of helping their state's motorists while at the same time avoiding any long-term economic problems. They also stated their individual state surpluses would cover the lost revenue generated from the taxes, which generally pay for road repairs and other transportation costs. ""At this point, we have seen no issues related to supply and demand,"" Michael Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan's office, said in a statement to ABC News on Friday. A spokeswoman for Kemp's office also said Georgia isn't seeing any increases in gas demand since the gas tax holiday went into effect. Kemp tweeted Friday that the state's average gas price dropped by 24 cents a gallon. ""We're going to keep working to get Georgians relief from sky-high prices & inflation!"" he tweeted. Max Reiss, a spokesman for Lamont, told ABC News that the state's gas tax suspension is part of an overall $100 million package to help residents, and included a one-week clothing sales tax suspension and free bus rides for a month. ""What our residents are looking for is that their government is listening to their concerns. We are trying to do something in our power to do something,"" Reiss told ABC News. Reiss added that the state continues to push residents to lower their demand for gasoline with programs such as tax incentives for electric car purchases. The economic experts warned that there is no way to determine when gas prices will come down, especially if the Ukraine-Russia conflict continues into the summer. More importantly, they warned that gas prices will likely decrease at a far slower rate compared to the rate they have jumped in recent weeks. De Haan said it is imperative that states not rely on the gas tax holidays as their only solution during the gas crisis and that they need to encourage motorists to curb their driving plans as best they can. ""There's not going to be a quick shift to lower prices and we all need to be ready for that,"" he said.",,,,22
2022-03-28,https://abcnews.go.com/International/cost-damage-ukraines-infrastructure-amid-russias-invasion/story?id=83719126,What's the cost of damage to Ukraine's infrastructure amid Russia's invasion?,"LONDON -- The cost of direct damage to Ukraine's infrastructure amid Russia's ongoing invasion has reached almost an estimated $63 billion, according to an analysis by the Kyiv School of Economics. Shocking images and videos have emerged in recent weeks showing just some of the devastation across Ukraine since Russian forces attacked on Feb. 24. Where businesses, homes, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure once stood, there are now massive piles of unrecognizable rubble and crumbling shells of concrete. The KSE Institute, an analytical unit of the Kyiv School of Economics in Ukraine's capital, has been collecting and analyzing data from the ""Russia Will Pay"" project, launched in collaboration with the Ukrainian president's office and the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy. Through the resource, Ukrainian citizens, government officials and local authorities can confidentially submit reports on the loss of or damage to physical infrastructure across the country as a result of the war, including roads, residential buildings, businesses and other facilities. Analysts at the KSE Institute then assess those reported damages and estimate the financial value. ""It is aimed at collecting information about all the facilities destroyed as a result of the war that Russia waged against Ukraine,"" the KSE Institute said in a recent statement about the ""Russia Will Pay"" resource. ""The Ukrainian government will use this data as evidence in international courts for Russia to compensate for the intended damages."" The latest analysis shows that, as of March 24, at least 4,431 residential buildings, 92 factories and warehouses, 378 institutions of secondary and higher education, 138 health care institutions, 12 airports, seven thermal power plants and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, destroyed or seized in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24 -- totaling an estimated $62,889,000. Compared to the previous estimate published on March 17, net growth amounted to $3.5 billion, according to the KSE Institute. Meanwhile, Ukraine's overall economic losses due to the war -- taking into account both direct losses calculated from the project as well as indirect losses, like GDP decline -- range from $543 billion to $600 billion, according to an estimate by the KSE Institute and the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy. Before updating its calculations, the KSE Institute said it received ""detailed data"" from the Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure on the destruction of its facilities, which allowed analysts to clarify and, in some cases, reduce the assessment of losses. The KSE Institute said it has improved the methodology of assessing losses from the destruction of residential real estate ""based on the World Bank’s experience in analyzing losses in Syria and Iraq, as well as the recommendations of the leading Ukrainian investment company Dragon Capital."" ""These calculations are based on the analysis of several thousands of public notifications from Ukrainian citizens, the government, local authorities about losses and damages throughout the country, as well as indirect assessment methods such as calculating the estimated area of the war-damaged property in the most affected cities,"" the KSE Institute said. ""These estimates are not exhaustive: information on numerous damages and destruction may be missing due to the inability of citizens, local and state authorities to promptly record the damage in each city and town.""",,,,18
2022-03-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukrainian-forces-retake-trostyanets-town-northeast/story?id=83722292,"Ukrainian forces retake Trostyanets, town in northeast","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 33: Ukraine retakes town south of Sumy The U.S. assesses that Ukrainian forces retook the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in northeast Ukraine, from Russian forces. ""They continue to make progress in that regard,"" said the official, who could not confirm reports of other areas having been retaken by the Ukrainians as was reported by Ukraine this weekend. The official added that Russian forces remain around in a defensive posture, ""and the Ukrainians are continuing to try to take back ground,"" which they've seen in the south and north. Last Friday, the official said Russian troops north of Kyiv had moved into defensive positions around the city and were putting a priority on operations in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The official said Monday that Russian troops around Kyiv have stopped making advances towards the city, though they continue using long-range fires. Russian troops remain 15-20 miles north/northwest of the city and about 35 miles east. Russia has now fired more than 1,370 missiles into Ukraine. ""Static situation on the ground there, except for the fact that we continue to see Ukrainians defend the city and try to to push Russians back as well,"" said the official. The southern strategic city of Kherson remains ""contested territory,"" said the official. On Friday, the official said Kherson, which was seized by Russia early in the fighting, was no longer under full control of Russian forces. Russia prioritizing the Donbas, but US not sure why The official said Russian forces appear to have prioritized operations in eastern Ukraine. The official described Russian forces moving southeast from Izyum as making ""incremental progress"" towards Donbas. ""We're not exactly sure what's behind this reprioritization. All I can tell you is what we're seeing,"" said the official. The U.S. believes it could be to attempt to cut off Ukrainian troops in the east from the rest of the country, to gain leverage for future peace talks or to refocus their strategic goals. Heavy fighting and shelling continues in Mariupol ""The Ukrainians are slugging it out in Mariupol and they are keeping the Russians at bay there so far,"" said the official. Russian troops entered the southern port city after pounding with artillery and long-range missiles, apparently destroying entire sections of the city. ""We continue to see Mariupol getting slammed by long-range fires,"" the official said. ""We are certainly aware of reports that inside Mariupol the Ukrainians are not only fighting very, very hard, but that they are experiencing their own challenges because you're surrounded,"" the official added. ""It is under incredible pressure by the Russians, but the Ukrainians continue to defend it."" US troop extensions in eastern Europe? A major decision of last week's NATO leaders summit in Brussels was that the alliance would establish a long-term presence in eastern Europe as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This includes an additional 6,000 American ground forces moved into eastern Europe to reassure NATO countries that border Russia ahead of that invasion. Now, there are questions about if they will remain there longer than what has been described by the Pentagon as a temporary deployment. The official noted that when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered additional troops to Europe in recent months, ""We made it clear at the time that they will be there for as long as we believe they were necessary to be there, and the secretary continues to believe that they're necessary."" The official characterized them as temporary deployments and said Austin is constantly discussing U.S. troop posture with Gen. Tod Wolters, the commander of U.S. European Command and the top commander of NATO forces, and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Those troops are still there and the secretary assesses that they need to stay there, and so I have no announcements or changes to that posture except for those six Growlers that we talked about this morning and as we as we can talk about, we certainly will,"" said the official. On Monday, the Pentagon announced that six U.S. Navy EA-18 Growler aircraft capable of jamming radars with electronic warfare equipment were being deployed to Germany to reinforce NATO's eastern flank and to deter Russia. ""They are not being deployed to be used against Russian forces in Ukraine,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby stressed in making the announcement. ""They are being deployed completely in keeping with our efforts to bolster NATO's deterrence and defense capabilities along that Eastern flank. They are not being sent because of some sort of acute threat that was perceived or some specific incident that happened."" ""This is in order to bolster readiness, enhance NATO's collective defense posture and further increase air integration capabilities with our allied and partner nations,"" Kirby said.",,,,6
2022-03-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-dubious-russian-withdrawal-north-kyiv-expects-troops/story?id=83740519,"Pentagon dubious of Russian 'withdrawal' north of Kyiv, expects troops will move to eastern Ukraine","The Pentagon is seeing ""small numbers"" of Russian troops repositioning to the north of Kyiv but is not labeling it a withdrawal as Russia has characterized it. Instead, it believes the troops might be used in an offensive elsewhere in Ukraine, possibly into the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. After holding talks with Ukrainian negotiators in Turkey, Russia's defense ministry said it was withdrawing forces from around Kyiv and Chernihiv as ""a good faith"" measure in the talks. However, the move coincided with the Russian military's lack of success in its moves on the two northern cities. ""We're seeing a small number now that appears to be moving away from Kyiv,"" John Kirby, the Pentagon's top spokesman, told reporters Tuesday. ""This on the same day that the Russians say they're withdrawing, but we're not prepared to call this a retreat, or even a withdrawal. What they probably have in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere."" ""It's certainly not a significant chunk of the multiple battalion tactical groups that Russia has arrayed against Kyiv,"" Kirby said. ""It's not anywhere near a majority of what they have arrayed"" around Ukraine's capital. He noted the Russians have said in recent days that it has made the Donbas area a priority. ""We believe that it is likely more repositioning to be used elsewhere in Ukraine. Where exactly we don't know,"" he said. ""We all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over. "" Kirby expressed similar skepticism about the Russian announcement from other top Biden administration officials, including President Joe Biden. ""We're not taking anything they say at face value,"" Kirby said. ""We're not we're not prepared to buy the Russian argument that it's a withdrawal. Again, our assessment is that their intention is to reposition forces and bolster their efforts elsewhere."" Though Kirby said Russian troops had repeatedly failed in their military objectives in Ukraine, particularly in taking Kyiv, he declined to characterize the Russian move as a defeat. ""I don't think we're prepared to slap a bumper sticker on this thing right now,"" Kirby said. ""I mean, there are still people dying. There's still bombs falling. There's still missiles flying. And they're still give and take on the battlefield. So I don't think we're ready to call it one way or another here."" Earlier on Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, the top U.S. military commander in Europe, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Russia's invasion was ""a pivotal moment in Europe with generational implications"" that had strengthened the NATO alliance. Wolters said American troop levels in Europe had risen from 60,000 to 100,000 due to the invasion and said more troops might be needed. ""My suspicion is we're going to still need more,"" Wolters said. ""And obviously, there's always a mix between the requirement of permanent versus rotational and there are pluses and minuses of each one. We'll have to continue to examine the European contributions to make a smart decision about where to go in the future."" During his press conference Tuesday, Kirby announced some Marine forces that had recently participated in NATO's Cold Response exercise in Norway would be redirected to Lithuania and Eastern Europe. The Marine units included a command and control unit being sent to Lithuania along with 10 FA-18 fighters and several C-130 transport planes. Wolters praised Ukraine's military and its ability to stall Russian military operations throughout the country, especially through the weapons systems being provided by the U.S. military. ""I think we can, and we will continue to maintain our support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces,"" Wolters said. ""... We've made dramatic improvements in our information and sharing and intelligence sharing."" That support has included the key delivery of American-made Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that have helped the Ukrainian military stall the progress of Russian troops throughout Ukraine. Wolters said the supply line of weapons to the Ukrainians had been successful and had not come under attack. ""They've been delivering right to the right location at the right time,"" Wolters said.",,,,7
2022-03-29,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-skeptical-peace-talks-russia-claims-pull-back/story?id=83742105,US still skeptical of peace talks as Russia claims to pull back from Kyiv,"RABAT, Morocco -- The U.S. remains skeptical that Russia is engaging genuinely in negotiations with Ukraine to end its monthlong war against its neighbor. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Kremlin's negotiators had still not shown ""signs of real seriousness,"" even after the two sides discussed potential elements of a peace deal shortly after talks in Turkey on Tuesday. Russia's military said it would ""fundamentally"" scale back its military operations near Ukraine's capital Kyiv and the northern city Chernihiv to give those talks a chance. But Blinken declined to say whether the U.S. had confirmed a real shift in Russian strategy nearly five weeks after Russian leader Vladimir Putin launched his invasion and aimed for a swift takeover of the Ukrainian government. ""There is what Russia says and what Russia does, and we're focused on the latter -- and what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people, and that continues as we speak,"" he told reporters in Rabat, Morocco. ""I have not seen anything that suggests that this is moving forward in an effective way because Russia is not showing signs of real seriousness, but if Ukraine concludes that there is, that's good, and we support that,"" he added. President Joe Biden also weighed in Tuesday on Russia's claim that it will move forces, saying ""we'll see if they follow through on what they're suggesting."" ""I don't read anything into it until I see what their actions are,"" he said during a joint press statement with Singapore's prime minister at the White House. Biden noted the ongoing negotiations in Turkey between Ukraine and Russia and said there is consensus among Western allies to ""see what they have to offer."" ""We'll find out what they do,"" he added. ""But in the meantime, we're going to continue to keep strong sanctions. We are going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with their capacity to defend themselves and we are going to continue to keep a close eye on what's going on."" Ukrainian negotiators have laid out a detailed framework for a peace deal, where Ukraine would remain neutral and not joined the Western military alliance NATO -- but it would join the European Union and its security would be guaranteed by several regional and world powers, including the U.S. Asked Tuesday whether the U.S. would join that pact, Blinken expressed support: ""If there is some kind of outcome, and if our support for Ukraine can be part of that, can include our support in the future for its defense and security, of course that's something we'll want to pursue."" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Tuesday's talks made ""meaningful"" progress, with ""a consensus and common understanding"" on some issues, according to the Associated Press. But Blinken was more skeptical, saying it could be Moscow ""trying to deflect and deceive people into thinking that it's not doing what it is doing, whether it's simply trying to regroup given the heavy losses that it's suffered - I don't know."" Russian forces had already been pushed back from east of Kyiv and moved into defensive positions north of the city, Pentagon officials said last week -- a sign the Kremlin was suffering major losses in its efforts to seize the capital and decapitate the Ukrainian government. Late last week, Russia said its ""main goal"" was now on the eastern provinces known as the Donbas, where Moscow has led separatist forces for over eight years against the Ukrainian government. The top U.S. diplomat engaged with his Russian counterpart repeatedly before the war, saying the U.S. had to give diplomacy a chance. But after the Kremlin launched its brutal invasion, he's been far more skeptical -- accusing the Kremlin of not negotiating in good faith and, instead, using the cover of diplomacy to continue its attacks. After Biden spoke to his British, French, German and Italian counterparts earlier on Tuesday, the British government echoed the same skepticism. ""The Prime Minister underscored that we must judge Putin's regime by their actions not their words,"" a spokesperson for Boris Johnson said.

""We have received proposals from Ukraine to consider their clearly formulated position on inclusion in the treaty,"" Medinsky told reporters following the session. Ukrainian negotiator Alexander Chaly said the next talks in about two weeks could involve other countries in the negotiation process. David Arakhamia, another Ukrainian negotiator, added, ""We believe that enough material has already been developed to involve the presidents of Ukraine and Russia in the talks."" Medinsky noted that Tuesday's ""substantive conversation"" could clear the way for a meeting between the heads of state. ""The proposed format is like this: first an agreement will be drafted, then the agreement will be approved by the negotiators and signed by the foreign ministers at a meeting, and then the possibility of a meeting between the heads of state will be discussed in order to sign this agreement,"" Medinsky said. The in-person talks were held in Istanbul and Turkish President Tayyip Recep Erdogan addressed the opposing parties before the negotiation session started. ""It is in the hands of the parties to stop this tragedy,"" Erdogan said in his opening remarks, which were carried live on Russian TV. Erdogan said Turkey sees both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""valuable friends."" Also participating in the negotiations was Roman Abramovich, the billionaire Russian oligarch whose assets have been frozen by sanctions imposed by the West due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Previous in-person peace talks have been held in Belarus and representatives of both parties have also been communicating via video conferencing. Russia initially only presented Ukraine with ultimatums but has changed its strategy as its troops have met tough resistance from Ukrainian forces, which have managed to re-take some towns and villages. Prior to Fomin's announcement that Russia was de-escalating its military activities in Kyiv and Chernihiv, a U.S. defense official said Monday that Russian troops around Kyiv have stopped making advances toward the city, though they continue using long-range fires. Russian troops remain 15-20 miles north/northwest of the city and about 35 miles east. ""Static situation on the ground there, except for the fact that we continue to see Ukrainians defend the city and try to push Russians back as well,"" the U.S. official said on Monday. Before Tuesday's negotiations, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned the Ukrainian delegation to be on guard for sabotage, including poisoning. ""I advise to everyone who's going to any negotiations with Russia, not to eat or drink anything, and also not to touch any surfaces,"" Kuleba said.",,,,17
2022-03-30,https://abcnews.go.com/International/warsaw-mayor-calls-international-community-increase-aid-ukrainian/story?id=83763723,Warsaw mayor calls on international community to increase aid to Ukrainian refugees,"Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Poland has taken in 300,000 Ukrainian refugees, according to Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. While Trzaskowski told ABC News' Linsey Davis Tuesday that the city and its residents have welcomed these families and doing their best to accommodate their needs, they still face uphill challenges as more refugees arrive. ""We are going to welcome whoever needs help, but if a strain on the public services, schools, [and] health system [becomes] huge, the solidarity might wane in a few weeks,"" the mayor told ABC News. As the number of refugees is expected to grow while the conflict continues, Trzaskowski is calling on leaders around the world to assist with the refugee efforts. As of March 29, over 4 million Ukrainians have fled to nearby countries to escape the war, according to data from the United Nations. Poland has taken the majority of those citizens, 2.3 million, according to the U.N. Trzaskowski said his city's refugee response has been ""improvised"" as the local government, regular citizens and organizations have come together to provide the hundreds of thousands of families with support. Ukrainian citizens have been granted access to free education and free health care in Poland and 13,000 Ukrainian children are already attending Warsaw schools, according to the mayor. ""This is really a huge challenge also financially, but you know, we have to organize it,"" Trzaskowski said. He added that the city's social workers are overburdened with the daunting task of registering over 300,000 people with Polish social service agencies and programs. ""So now I'm thinking how to put more people at a task of doing it as quickly as possible,"" he said. The mayor tweeted on Monday that the city's refugee assistance efforts requires more investment and personnel and called on the European Union to offer direct support. ""We need a system because we don't know [if] maybe we are going to have another wave of refugees in just in just a week or two. We need to be prepared,"" he said. World leaders have recently pledged to help the growing number of families who are fleeing Ukraine. Last week, President Joe Biden announced the U.S. would accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and other countries, such as Canada have promised to take them. Trzaskowski said he is hopeful that more countries and the United Nations will step up their efforts and alleviate some of his country's burdens, but in the meantime he pledged that his citizens will continue to welcome the refugees as one of their own. ""Ukrainians are among us but they're with us they're not as if relegated to the margins of the society they're in our homes they are participating in our life and that's that's the beauty of it,"" he said.",,,,2
2022-03-30,https://abcnews.go.com/International/map-ukrainian-refugees-heading/story?id=83178031,Map: Where Ukraine refugees are heading,"At least 4,019,287 people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries since Russian forces invaded the eastern European country on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. The majority of refugees have escaped to Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary and Slovakia. The U.N. reports 3,090 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 1,189 deaths and 1,901 injuries as of March 28. However, the organization says the real toll is much higher. At least 202,000 of the refugees are third-country nationals, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Shortly after the crisis began, UNHCR staff reported lines that were miles long at the Polish border. In Romania, people were waiting up to 20 hours to enter, according to agency staff. The 37-mile trek from the Ukrainian city of Odessa to the border of Moldova took some refugees 24 hours to make, the agency said. In Hungary, arrivals were “steady and waiting times vary.” Ukrainian citizens have also been displaced within the country, according to Filippo Grandi, the UNHCR commissioner, but it remains unknown how many. He also said there is a “growing number of unaccompanied and separated children."" In what Russian President Vladimir Putin has called a ""special military operation,"" Russian forces continue to try and push through Ukraine, as Ukrainian forces hold steady in the fight. Many reasons have been cited as Putin's reasoning for the attacks, including the threat of Ukraine's membership in NATO, the Western military alliance. But Putin has also tried to question Ukraine's legitimacy as a country and claimed that the country needed to be liberated from Nazis. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed to remain in Kyiv and fight against Russian forces. ""We are all here. Our military are here, as are our people and whole society,"" Zelenskyy said in a video posted to Facebook. ""We're all here defending our independence and our country. And we'll go on doing that. Glory to our defenders! Glory to Ukraine.""",,,,2
2022-03-30,https://abcnews.go.com/US/nasa-astronaut-mark-vande-hei-returns-earth-record/story?id=83759099,NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei returns to Earth after record-breaking spaceflight,"NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei returned to Earth Wednesday, after spending a record-breaking 355 days in low-Earth orbit. Vande Hei shared a spacecraft with two Russian cosmonauts as tensions between the Russia and the U.S. continue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Vande Hei returned in a Soyuz spacecraft with Russian cosmonauts Pyotr Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov, making a parachute-assisted landing at 7:28 a.m. in Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. The trio had departed the International Space Station at 3:21 a.m. ET. Vande Hei broke the record for the longest spaceflight by a NASA astronaut by 15 days. The record was previously held by retired astronaut Scott Kelly. On this spaceflight, Vande Hei completed 5,680 orbits of the Earth and a journey of more than 150 million miles, roughly the equivalent of 312 trips to the Moon and back, according to NASA. This trip gave Vande Hei a lifetime total of 523 days in space. ""Mark's mission is not only record-breaking, but also paving the way for future human explorers on the Moon, Mars, and beyond,"" NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a press release. ""Our astronauts make incredible sacrifices in the name of science, exploration, and cutting-edge technology development, not least among them time away from loved ones."" Nelson added: ""NASA and the nation are proud to welcome Mark home and grateful for his incredible contributions throughout his year-long stay on the International Space Station."" According to NASA, Vande Hei contributed to dozens of studies from the hundreds executed during his mission, including six science investigations supported by NASA’s Human Research Program. As NASA plans to return to the Moon, under the Artemis program, and prepares for the exploration of Mars, the agency said Vande Hei's extended mission will provide researchers the opportunity to observe the effects of long-duration spaceflight on humans. After the crew goes through post-landing medical checks, they will be flown to the recovery staging city in Karaganda, Kazakhstan, on Russian helicopters. Vande Hei will then board a NASA plane to Cologne, Germany, for refueling, prior to his return home. Shkaplerov and Dubrov will be flown home to Star City, Russia, on a Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center aircraft. ABC’s Jim Ryan reports:",,,,8

Also, The White House said Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his top advisers about military developments in Russia, a development that the Pentagon labeled as ""disconcerting."" ""We have seen over the last 24 hours the repositioning of a small percentage of the troops and the battalion tactical groups that Russia had arrayed against Kyiv,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Wednesday. ""Probably in the neighborhood of 20% of what they had, they are beginning to reposition some of those troops."" Specifically, Kirby said the Russian troops near the Hostomel airport north of the city have been seen moving north towards Belarus. The airport had been the scene of heavy fighting from the opening hours of Russia's invasion. Separately, a senior U.S. defense official said some Russian troops had also been seen moving out of the Chernobyl nuclear facility. However, it remained unclear if they would all be leaving. Some of those troops are being moved into Belarus, said Kirby, who added that none of the units have been seen returning to their home bases. ""If the Russians are serious about de-escalating, because that's their claim here, then they should send them home, but they're not doing that, at least not yet,"" Kirby said. ""That's not what we're seeing."" Kirby said he was intentionally using the term reposition instead of a withdrawal to describe the movement of Russian forces ""because the way it's being spun by the Ministry of Defense is that they're that they're pulling back and they're trying to de-escalate and depressurize the situation and we just don't believe we haven't seen any evidence of that."" Instead, Kirby said the U.S. assesses that the Russians are ""going to refit these troops, resupply them, and then probably employ them elsewhere in Ukraine."" A senior U.S. defense official said U.S. intelligence believes that Russia may intend to shift some of these troops towards the fight in the Donbas region, which would be in line with public statements from Russian officials that they want to make that region a priority of their operations. Even as some of the Russian troops around Kyiv move away, Kirby and the rest have established defensive positions. Kirby noted that Russian forces continue to launch missiles and artillery at the city and surrounding suburbs. Kirby said that without getting into intelligence, the Pentagon concurred with comments in news reports attributed to a U.S. official that Putin is not being fully advised of Russia's performance on the battlefield in Ukraine. ""We would concur with the conclusion that Mr. Putin has not been fully informed by his Ministry of Defense at every turn over the last month,"" Kirby said Wednesday. Kirby described that assessment as ""disconcerting"" and ""an issue of concern."" ""The fact that he may not have all the context, that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that's a little discomforting, to be honest with you,"" Kirby said. ""If he's not fully informed of how poorly he's doing, then how are his negotiators going to come up with an agreement that is enduring? Certainly one that respects Ukrainian sovereignty,"" he added. ""The other thing is you don't know how a leader like that is going to react to getting bad news,"" Kirby said. '",,,,6

U2's frontrunner Paul ""Bono"" Hewson visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday as he continued to lobby lawmakers to adopt a global plan to vaccinate 70% of the world's population globally by September as additional COVID funding remains stalled. The ONE Campaign, an international anti-poverty organization co-founded by Bono, is behind the effort. There are still 2.8 billion people around the world waiting to get their first COVID vaccine shot, according to a United Nations analysis. While on the Hill, Bono also took time to thank Capitol Police officers for defending democracy on Jan. 6, 2021, telling them that they're respected around the world for their bravery. ""I haven't been back since Jan. 6, and you guys saved America as far as I'm concerned from so much awfulness on that day,"" Bono told them in a video the Capitol Police posted on Twitter. ""And I just want to say, people around the world really respect you."" Bono was in Washington for a Thursday evening ceremony where he'll be awarded the Fulbright Prize for International Understanding for his ""commitment to seek justice by fighting to end extreme poverty, tackle global health crises, and spur economic development in the poorest parts of the planet."" Past recipients include former President Jimmy Carter and former South African President Nelson Mandela. His visit also comes two weeks after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi read a poem he wrote aloud at a St. Patrick's Day Luncheon -- which names Ukraine's Volodymyr President Zelenskyy as a saint -- amid Russa's ongoing invasion. ""I got this message this morning from Bono,” Pelosi said of the Ireland-born singer. ""And they struggle for us to be free, from the psycho in this human family. Ireland’s sorrow and pain, is now the Ukraine, and Saint Patrick’s name now Zelenskyy,"" she read, quoting Bono. Bono was spotted by reporters leaving Pelosi's office on Wednesday. He was on the Hill to meet with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate about the need for supplemental COVID funding for the international vaccine response, according to the ONE campaign. The global superstar is no stranger to the Capitol Rotunda. He also made stops there while on tour in the nation's capital in 2017 and 2018 to thank lawmakers on behalf of the ONE Campaign for various funding.

2022-03-31,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-weighing-release-million-barrels-oil-day-reserves/story?id=83785013,Biden blasts US oil companies in announcing plan to combat gas prices,"Attempting to combat what's he's labeled ""Putin's price hike,"" President Joe Biden announced a plan on Thursday to release roughly 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve over the next six months to reduce energy and gas prices. Biden told Americans ""there is no firm answer"" as to when gas prices will go down, but predicted they will go down ""fairly significantly."" ""Today I want to talk about one aspect of Putin's war that affects and has real effects on the American people: Putin's price hike that Americans and our allies are feeling at the pump. I know how much it hurts,"" Biden began. ""As you've heard me say I grew up in a family, like many of you, where the price of gasoline was discussed at the kitchen table. None of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war."" Biden blamed ""two roots"" for the high energy costs: Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the lingering economic effects of COVID-19. ""When COVID struck, demand for oil plummeted, so production slowed down worldwide. Because of the strength and the speed of our recovery, demand for oil shot back up much faster than the supply. That's why the cost of gas began to rise last year. The second root is Vladimir Putin,"" he said. Biden predicted Americans could pay ""anything from 10 cents to 35 cents a gallon"" less at the pump, setting up the national average would fall below $4 a gallon. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for Gas Buddy, pointed ABC News to a tweet in which he raised some skepticism. ""I do believe the national average could eventually fall under $4/gal in the weeks ahead, but I don't necessarily think this SPR release is the event that will be the primary catalyst for it,"" he said in a tweet Thursday. ""If anything it could help get us there quicker, but again, likely at the expense of long term stability."" Biden announced the major step during a scheduled event to discuss actions his administration is taking to rein in soaring energy prices that have spiked even further following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""The action I'm calling for will make a real difference over time, but the truth is, it takes months, not days, for companies to increase production. That's why the next part of my plan is so important,"" he said. ""Today I'm authorizing the release of 1 million barrels per day over the next six months."" He said the release was coordinated with allies and partners around the world. Speaking directly to oil company executives, Biden told them “enough of lavishing excessive profits” and passing on the cost of oil to consumers, adding that they have “everything they need” and “nothing is standing in their way” to boost production. “They don't want to increase supply because Putin's price hike means higher profits,"" Biden said. He went on to propose a ""use it or lose it"" policy, calling on Congress to create legislation to tax companies if they're sitting on idle wells and lands that aren't producing for Americans. ""No company should take advantage of a pandemic or Vladimir Putin at the expense of American families,"" Biden said. ""Production and innovation, that's what they should do."" ""Invest in your customers,"" he added, noting that it's not only ""the patriotic thing"" but ""it's good for your business as well."" Senior administration officials also acknowledged relief at the pump may be delayed. ""We're not focused right now on sort of the immediate short-term price movements,"" an official said on a call with reporters earlier Thursday, adding that the focus is on addressing the gap in supply as Russian oil comes off the market. The first barrels from the announcement are set to come to the market in May for delivery that month. Officials said all the funds from the sale of the oil will go to restocking the reserves. ""We expect that to occur once the oil price has come down, we are no longer in an emergency,"" an official told reporters. About 3 million barrels a day of Russian oil will come off the market in April due to Western sanctions, according to the International Energy Agency, and this plan could help alleviate pain at the pump by helping to replace that loss. This would be the third time Biden has had to tap into the strategic petroleum reserve. In November, he authorized the release of 50 million barrels as gas prices surged ahead of the holidays, and along with 30 other countries, the U.S. released 30 million barrels following the start of the war in Ukraine, though that did little to ease skyrocketing prices. As of Friday, there were more than 568 million barrels of oil in the reserve, according to the Department of Energy. Given the complexity and volatility of the oil market, many geopolitical and economic factors feed into oil prices and there is no guarantee this release will keep prices down for an extended period of time. Overnight, crude oil prices were down roughly 5% in reaction to Biden's expected announcement, which means the price at the gas pump could also dip in the coming days. The current national average for a gallon of gas is $4.23, according to AAA, $1.35 higher than this time last year.",,,,23
2022-04-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-neighboring-countries-welcoming-refugees/story?id=83747902,How Ukraine's neighboring countries are welcoming refugees,"Omar Alshakal was just 17 when he left war-torn Syria behind before swimming his way to Europe. Almost a decade later, the Syrian refugee and his non-governmental organization welcome Ukrainian families fleeing Russian bombardment as they enter Romania through the border town of Siret. ""It's a really hard feeling to flee from your home,"" Alshakal, 28, founder of Refugee 4 Refugees, told ABC News during a recent interview in Siret. ""Women are crying when they cross the border because they just said goodbye to someone they love."" Since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, more than 4.1 million people have fled Ukraine and over half of Ukrainian children are displaced, according to the United Nations. The response from European governments in favor of refugees was swift. One week after Russia launched its invasion, the Council of the European Union unanimously agreed to offer temporary protection to those fleeing Ukraine. In France, the government has launched a campaign called ""Je m'engage pour l'Ukraine,"" or ""I get involved for Ukraine,"" which connects regular French citizens with Ukrainian refugees in need of assistance. ""They say some of the politicians in Europe, they make it very clear those people believe in the same religion we believe in"" Alshakal told ABC News, comparing his situation to that of Ukrainian refugees. ""That's why we [in Europe] are helping them because they are scared of Muslim people and they are scared of those people from different country."" ""As a person I was really upset, but as [the founder of] an NGO I can’t complain because we are here to help people,"" he added. ""We don't care about where they're from. We don't care about the religion. We don't care if they are black or white."" Although Alshakal wishes he had received similar treatment as a Syrian refugee, he empathizes with Ukrainians because of his own escape from war. ""I still have the hope that I'm going back to my city, to my place, to my house,"" he said. According to the U.N., more than 390,000 of those fleeing Ukraine have crossed into neighboring Moldova, the smallest nation to share a border with Ukraine. Like Ukraine, Moldova declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Despite being the poorest country in Europe, Moldova opened its border to Ukraine's refugees, letting in the equivalent of 15% of its population in a matter of weeks. In the Moldovan capital of Chisinau, 17-year-old Katalina volunteers after school at an abandoned cinema-turned-temporary shelter for refugees. ""I visit Ukraine, I have relatives, my grandfather is from Ukraine,"" Katalina, who only gave ABC News her first name, said during a recent interview in Chisinau. ""They are our brothers, our neighbors, and I'm sure that if Moldova has some problems, they would help us without thinking about it."" Another Moldovan citizen, Dan Romanescou, also does what he can to help by offering accommodation to Ukrainian families. ""I helped a family who were really in need,"" Romanescou, 30, recalled during a recent interview with ABC News in Chisinau. Romanescou was born in the disputed territory of Transnistria, which borders western Ukraine and where at least 400 Russian peacekeepers are posted. ""We are scared because it's war nearby,"" he said. ""My grandparents were deported in Siberia in 1943 -- it was during Soviet Union."" ""Now, we face the situation that Russia wants to rebuild somehow the ex-Soviet Union space, which Moldova was a part of,"" he added. After fleeing their home in Ukraine and crossing into Slovakia, Irigna jumped on a bus with her son Yaroslav and daughter Sophia. ""We are going to the school for one night,"" Irigna, who only gave her first name, told ABC News during a recent interview in Kosice, eastern Slovakia. ""Next, maybe Vienna ... but we don’t know."" According to the U.N., more than 292,000 of those fleeing Ukraine have crossed into neighboring Slovakia. In the eastern Slovakian village of Inovce, less than a mile from the border with Ukraine, Father Pavol Novak serves as the priest of a Catholic church. ""I never thought that there would be a war. I just didn't want to accept that,"" Novak told ABC News during a recent interview in Inovce. ""But when it actually happened, it wasn't a question of yes and no; it was duty. We felt like there's no choice, we had to help people at any cost."" Novak's church has housed more than 100 refugees from Ukraine since the start of the war. ""We don’t know what could happen to us and maybe we will be in this situation in the future, and maybe we'll need help,"" he said. ""So maybe if we help now, people will help us in the future.""

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 36: Russians being hunted as they withdraw from Kyiv area The U.S. continues to see roughly 20% of the Russian forces that were arrayed against Kyiv repositioning away from the capital, the official said. And Ukrainian forces are attacking these troops as they withdraw from the area. ""As these forces begin to reposition, the Ukrainians are moving against them,"" the official said. Most of the Russian forces that are repositioning were located to the north and northwest of Kyiv. Most notably, they seem to have abandoned Hostomel airport, which has been a site of intense fighting at various points since the beginning of the invasion. ""We believe that they have very likely abandoned Hostomel airfield,"" the official said. Although some troops are repositioning, long-range strikes on Kyiv continue. ""Despite the rhetoric of de-escalation, we're still observing artillery fire and airstrikes in and around Kyiv,"" the official said. Shifting focus to Donbas ""This repositioning that they're doing around Kyiv and other places in the north, and this reprioritization on the Donbas, clearly indicates that they know they have failed to take the capital city, that they know they have been under increased pressure elsewhere around the country,"" the official said. While Russia might be dedicating more forces to taking control of the Donbas region, the Ukrainians are primed to make it a tough fight. ""The Ukrainians know the territory very, very well. They have a lot of forces still there, and they're absolutely fighting very hard for that area, as they have over the last eight years,"" the official said. ""So just because they're going to prioritize it and put more force there or more energy there doesn't mean it's going to be easy for them."" Russian ships can hit Donbas While there are still no signs of any imminent amphibious landings, Russia has several ships in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov that could be used to threaten the Donbas region with cruise missiles, the official said. Putin not getting full picture from advisers ""Our assessment is that the planning for this war was done with a very small circle of people, and that Mr. Putin's advisers do not count many. And, you know, our assessment is that they have not been completely honest with him about how it's going,"" the official said. The official said Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept to a ""very, very close circle,"" a leadership style that inherently limits access to information. ""I can't account for the fact that the people advising him have chosen to obstruct certain information or omit certain information. All we can say is we don't believe that he has been getting the full picture,"" the official said. Odesa under blockade ""We know that the Russians have continued to blockade Odesa,"" the official said. ""So obviously it's having it's having an economic impact there."" Kherson contested ""We assess that they're still fighting over Kherson. We know that the Russians are in the city, but we aren't prepared to call it for one side or the other at this point. I mean, it had been in Russian control, but the Ukrainians are attempting to retake Kherson, so it's still being fought over,"" the official said. Bombardment of Mariupol continues ""I don't have an update on the degree to which a cease-fire is being applied in Mariupol. What I try to give you is what we've seen, you know, in the last 24 hours since we last talked, and we have continued to see Mariupol will come under airstrikes,"" the official said.",,,,6
2022-04-01,https://abcnews.go.com/US/key-lessons-ukraine-conflict-conventional-warfare/story?id=83746590,Key lessons from the Ukraine conflict about conventional warfare,"More than a month into Russia's invasion, the Ukrainian military has fared better than many expected given its smaller size, budget and number of munitions compared to its adversary. This week, Ukrainian forces reclaimed a town in the northeastern part of the country, while Russian ground forces have stalled around the capital, with some troops moving away from Kyiv and nearby Chernihiv, U.S. officials said. Intelligence experts had initially anticipated that Russia would take Kyiv within days of its attack on Ukraine. ""They failed to take Kyiv, which we believe was a key objective,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters this week. ""Not only do they not manage to take Kyiv, they've not managed to take any population centers and the Ukrainians have been fighting back very hard."" Among the factors shaping the ""David and Goliath"" conflict up to this point has been Ukraine's ""smart tactical use"" of its anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, alongside poor planning on the part of Russia, according to retired Gen. Robert Abrams, an ABC News contributor and the former commander of U.S. forces in Korea. ""'They [Russia] have numerical superiority, that's a fact. … They have an enormous missile inventory compared to Ukrainians,"" he said. ""That being said, what we overestimated though, is their ... warfighting competence."" Within days of its invasion, Russia was struggling with fuel and logistics supplies, and verified images and videos of destroyed Russian military vehicles and tanks circulated online. In its latest casualty numbers, Russia’s general staff said late last week that 1,351 Russian soldiers have been killed so far, though NATO last week estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 had died. The West has worked quickly to send weaponry to Ukraine since the start of the invasion. The U.S. and NATO supplied Ukraine with more than 17,000 anti-tank weapons, including Javelin missiles, in less than a week, the New York Times reported in early March. The U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military aid into Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons such as the Javelin and Stinger systems, which can be fired by just one or two people. Other countries, including Germany and the U.K., have provided similar weapons. The shoulder-mounted Javelin in particular has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Known as a ""fire and forget"" weapon, the Javelin uses an infrared guidance system to travel toward a target, allowing the gunner to fire and then immediately take cover. The missile system can destroy tanks and other armored vehicles. The shoulder-fired Stinger missiles target low-flying aircraft. During a Congressional hearing Tuesday, Gen. Tod Wolters, the top U.S. military commander in Europe, praised Ukraine’s military and their ability to stall Russian military operations throughout the country, especially through the weapons systems being provided by the U.S. military. ""The Ukrainian armed forces show a very, very positive learning curve, and so I'm optimistic about being able to force additional stalling on behalf of the Russians,"" he said. The Javelin and Stinger, which have been used by the U.S. military for over 30 years, are ""very, very effective at what they're intended to do,"" Abrams said. A lone defender could help keep the attacking enemy at bay up to 2 miles away, and aircraft about 6 miles away, he said, showing the power of their range and precision. With enough weapons, ""a defender can keep a much larger enemy force that's mounted in their armored vehicles and trucks, and can keep them at bay because they can't ever get close enough to touch the defenders,"" he said. ""That's really what the advantage is of using these systems."" Anti-tank weapons aren't always a guarantee of success, Abrams said, noting that the attacking force could use a strategy known as combined arms maneuver to defeat them. That might look like firing artillery in advance of armored columns, using smoke -- an obscurant -- to prevent the Ukrainian gunners from seeing the Russian targets and integrating helicopters, he said. To Ukraine's advantage, the Russians are not utilizing this strategy, according to Abrams. ""Frankly, they've made it much, much easier for the Ukrainian defenders with these weapon systems that are getting so much notoriety,"" Abrams said. At the same time, the Ukrainians have carefully chosen where to use these weapons systems ""to maximum advantage"" on their home turf, he said. ""What we're seeing though is such poor tactics by the Russians, it has compounded the effects of the Ukrainian's use of these anti-tank weapons systems,"" Abrams said. The Ukrainians are ""putting up one heck of a fight,"" he added. ""They're utilizing excellent tactics where they are maximizing the effect of their weapons system with the terrain. … I don't want to minimize that. But the Russian army has been equally inept, and it's been a tactical disaster."" Russia's military said last week that it had generally accomplished the ""first stage of the operation"" and reduced the Ukrainian forces ""considerably,"" and would focus on its"" ""top goal"" -- liberating the Donbas region. Russia has claimed to have destroyed thousands of Ukraine's military vehicles, including tanks, and hundreds of aircraft during its so-called military operation. Amid pleas from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more weapons, one potential concern is supply. There is not an unlimited supply of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, Abrams said. ""I suspect as the defense industry cranks up production, that there's going to be some supply chain problems,"" he said. ""For Ukraine specifically, they're going to have a supply management challenge, whereby they're going to have to be very smart in how they distribute these key munitions."" Another ""decisive factor"" in Ukraine's war-fighting competence has been training, Abrams said. After Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, military aid from the West has included helping Ukrainian soldiers improve their tactical fighting. ""Russia clearly has the numbers, they have the technological advantage, but we're seeing the value of high-quality training, tough realistic training,"" combined with ""this very precise, exquisite capability for anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons systems,"" Abrams said. ""They are achieving success and they have denied Russia and their initial objectives in this war."" Ukraine has also begun developing a noncommissioned officer corps -- considered the backbone of the military, who have extensive education and are empowered to lead soldiers, the retired general said. Russia, by contrast, has not made a commitment in noncommissioned officers, and instead is very centralized in who has the authority to give orders and has had several senior Russian army leaders reportedly killed in action, Abrams said. ""We're seeing the benefits of this training, in this professional development, as it plays out on the battlefield,"" Abrams said. ""We're seeing these small groups of Ukrainian soldiers seemingly outnumbered and outgunned achieving amazing success."" ""When you have the power of junior leaders and non-commissioned officers with the right equipment, and they have freedom of action to make decisions to seize the initiative when initiative appears, to take initiative and make those tough decisions without having to call someone -- that is often the difference between victory and defeat on the battlefield,"" he said.

2022-04-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-give-remarks-march-jobs-report/story?id=83809417,Biden on jobs report: 'Americans are back to work',"President Joe Biden touted the nation's economic recovery on Friday while also acknowledging the financial hardships currently intensified by the war in Ukraine. ""Americans are back to work,"" Biden said from the White House. ""Record job creation. Record unemployment decline. Record wage gains."" U.S. employers added 431,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.6%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. ""Even though we created a record number of jobs we know -- I know -- that this job is not finished. We need to do more to get prices under control. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world,"" Biden continued, noting his unprecedented order Thursday to release up to 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He placed blame on Putin's invasion of Ukraine for driving up gas and food prices worldwide in what the Biden White House has labeled as ""Putin's price hike."" ""Nations are coming together to deny Putin the ability to weaponize his energy resources against American families, not only American families but families in Europe and around the world,"" Biden added. He did not take reporters' shouted questions on inflation following his prepared remarks, telling them that there will be ""plenty of time to answer questions"" next week. Though the March report came in slightly below economists' expectations, the numbers for January and February were revised higher to show 95,000 more jobs added in those months. The report also showed that notable job gains continued in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade and manufacturing. The labor force participation rate, or the number of people in the economy looking for work, is inching almost back to where it was before the pandemic. As employees head back to the office, teleworking fell to 10% from 13% the previous month. March marks the 11th consecutive month of job growth above 400,000. According to The Wall Street Journal, this is the strongest job growth in the U.S. since 1939. More than 19.9 million of the 22 million jobs lost at the peak of the pandemic have now been recovered, with economists expecting a full recovery by the summer. ""The March jobs report was right down the fairway – lots of jobs, lower unemployment, and higher labor force participation. The job market is rip-roaring. While not quite back to full-employment, the economy is close, and at the current pace of job growth will be there by summer,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote on Twitter. ""But it is somewhat disquieting in that the job market must cool off quickly, or inflation, our number one economic problem, will soon be a much bigger one."" The report, while strong, comes amid soaring gasoline prices and 40-year high inflation, which has cost Biden in the polls ahead of this year's midterm elections. Seventy percent of Americans disapprove of his handling of inflation, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll released earlier this month. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve just two weeks ago raised short-term interest rates for the first time since 2018 and said it will raise them six more times this year in an attempt to offset inflation.

2022-04-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-russias-killing-ukrainian-civilians-war-crime/story?id=83865128,Biden calls Russia's killing of Ukrainian civilians a war crime but not genocide,"The killing of Ukrainian civilians committed by Russian forces in Ukraine is a war crime, President Joe Biden said Monday -- repeating his accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a ""war criminal"" who needs to be held ""accountable."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of ""genocide"" on Sunday after hundreds of Ukrainian civilians were found killed in Bucha, a suburb of the capital Kyiv that was retaken by Ukrainian forces. Some of the civilians were buried in mass graves, others found dead in the street with their hands tied behind their backs. ""These are war crimes, and they will be recognized by the world as genocide. You are here today and can see what happened. We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women, murdered children. I think it is more than -- this is a genocide,"" Zelenskyy told reporters in Bucha Monday. The U.S. has stopped short of using the term ""genocide"" because of its strict legal definition and the heavy implications it carries. Asked whether the latest reported atrocities are genocide, Biden told reporters, ""No, I think it is a war crime."" He called again for an investigation and trial, even seeming to suggest that Putin himself should face trial himself. ""We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight, and we have to gather all the detail so this can be an actual -- have a war crimes trial,"" Biden said. ""This guy is brutal and what's happening with Bucha is outrageous, and everyone's seeing it,"" he added. While stopping short of labeling it ""genocide,"" Biden's call for for a possible war crimes trial raises the pressure on the international community's response to Russia's war, which has killed thousands and displaced more than 10 million people in less than six weeks. Biden said he would seek more sanctions against Putin and his government over the atrocities in Bucha, although it's unclear if more economic pressure will do anything to bring an end to Putin's campaign, even as it has shifted away from the Kyiv area to the south and east. In Bucha and other towns outside Kyiv, the U.S. has also seen ""credible reports of torture, rape, and civilians executed alongside their families,"" according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price -- all of which would be considered war crimes under international law. In southern Ukraine, especially around the besieged city Mariupol, the U.S. is aware of ""reports of tens of thousands abducted or deported by Russia's forces and shocking descriptions of rape, assaults, and murders perpetrated by Russia's forces,"" Price added. The Kremlin has suggested that the scenes out of Bucha, reported publicly by eyewitnesses, reporters, and Ukrainian government officials, were fabricated -- a tactic used repeatedly by Russian officials. Last month, the State Department announced it had made a legal assessment that Russian forces were committing war crimes in Ukraine, including targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure and indiscriminately firing on civilian areas. That assessment was based on public reporting and U.S. intelligence, including intercepted communications between Russian forces, according to U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack. That could implicate Putin himself, according to Van Schaack, who told reporters it depended on what jurisdiction was hearing cases. Her office at the State Department has continued to document and analyze evidence in preparation for trials. But while her office also assists in genocide determinations, U.S. officials have so far avoided using the term. ""We have seen atrocities. We have seen war crimes. We have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide, but again, that's something we'll continue to monitor,"" Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday. Genocide is an attempt ""to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group,"" according to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the 1948 treaty that banned it. It can involve acts of killing or harm, as well as preventing births, forcibly transferring children, or imposing dire conditions that are ""calculated to bring about its physical destruction,"" per the treaty. While Russian forces have targeted Ukrainian civilians, including now with executions, it seems that for U.S. officials, the scale is at this point not large enough to prove an intent to destroy the Ukrainian people. Sullivan used the terms ""mass death"" and ""mass incarceration"" and added that if there is ""a level of atrocity, a level of killing, a level of intentional activity that rises to meet our definition of genocide, we'll call it for what it is."" There are several international investigations underway right now into potential war crimes in Ukraine. The International Criminal Court, which conducts individual prosecutions, launched an investigation in early March, while the United Nations Human Rights Council voted to create a panel of experts to investigate, finally naming its members last week. The U.S. is also supporting a multinational team of independent war crimes investigators, including American experts, that are working with Ukraine's prosecutor-general on her office's probe of Russian war crimes, Price announced. But while the State Department supports those various investigations, its genocide determinations can take years to complete. Last month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced he had determined that Myanmar's military had committed genocide against the Rohingya -- nearly five years after the Muslim ethnic minority faced a campaign of terror that killed thousands and displaced nearly one million to neighboring Bangladesh.

2022-04-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sickening-atrocities-bucha-70-russian-troops-kyiv-withdrawn/story?id=83866706,"'Sickening' atrocities in Bucha, nearly 70% of Russian troops near Kyiv have withdrawn: Pentagon update Day 40","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 40: Nearly 70% of Russian troops near Kyiv have withdrawn About two-thirds of the Russian forces that were arrayed against Kyiv have withdrawn toward Belarus, according to the official. This is up from an estimated 20% late last week. Before repositioning, there were close to 20 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) bearing down on Kyiv from the north and northwest, with each group comprised of 700-900 troops. Roughly 13 of those BTGs are now either in Belarus or on their way there, the official said. The Pentagon believes these forces will be resupplied and possibly reinforced in the north before heading back into Ukraine to fight elsewhere. ""Our best assessment -- and it is only an assessment -- is that they will be applied in the eastern part of the country in the Donbas region,"" the official said. During a briefing Monday afternoon, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Ukrainian troops are pursuing the Russians as they retreat. ""As they're moving out, Ukrainians are attacking them,"" Kirby said. ""And I'm not a military strategist or a historian, but my understanding of a retreat is that you're moving back as you're getting pushed back, and that's what's happening. So I think that's a very accurate description of what's going on."" The U.S. has also seen some Russian troops leave the Ukrainian city of Sumy to head north to the Russian border, according to the official. Despite these movements, the official said the ""vast majority"" of the more than 125 BTGs that Russia committed to the invasion are still inside Ukraine. 'Sickening' Russian atrocities in Bucha The official said that while the U.S. cannot independently verify Ukrainian claims of Russian atrocities committed against civilians in Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv recently retaken by Ukrainian troops, there is no reason to doubt them. ""It's sickening, it's disgusting,"" the official said, adding that the claims should be included in the growing list of alleged Russian war crimes to be investigated. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the town, where he accused Russia of genocide. Ukrainian officials have said more than 400 civilians were found dead there, many with hands tied behind their backs, shot at close range. ""We have long said that the Russians would be brutal in their execution of this war. They have been,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. ""We said more than a week ago that we clearly believe the evidence pointed to war crimes by Russian forces. And what we're seeing out of Bucha certainly reinforces those concerns."" Kirby went a step further his briefing. ""It's fairly obvious not just to us but to the world that Russian forces are responsible for the atrocities and Bucha,"" he said. ""Now exactly who, what units, whether they're contractors or Chechens, I don't think we're able to say right now."" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ""expressed outrage at the apparent atrocities that were committed by Russian forces in Bucha"" on a call with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov, according to Kirby. Austin also committed to using ""every tool available"" to help document and share information to help hold responsible parties to account. President Joe Biden put blame on directly on Russian President Vladimir Putin while speaking to reporters Monday. ""You may remember I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal,"" Biden said. ""Well, the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha ... he is a war criminal."" Russia shifting airstrikes In addition to moving some of its troops away from the capital, Russia has also refocused its long-range strikes elsewhere, largely in the eastern and southern parts of the country, the official said. ""Clearly they're still hitting Mariupol, but we have not seen the same level of airstrike activity on Kyiv,"" the official said. ""So there's been a declination there over the last few days."" Russia has fired more than 1,400 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. Military aid being rushed into Ukraine The U.S. has continued to rush small arms, anti-tank and aircraft missiles and medical supplies into Ukraine, and has coordinated shipments from a half dozen other donor nations in the last 24 hours, according to the senior defense official. ""Everything we're doing with respect to Ukraine is being expedited -- everything,"" the official said.",,,,6
2022-04-05,https://abcnews.go.com/International/germany-shuts-worlds-largest-darknet-market-us/story?id=83892093,Germany shuts down world's largest illegal marketplace on darknet with US help,"German authorities took down the world’s largest illegal marketplace on the darknet with the help of U.S. law enforcement agencies, they said. Hydra Market was a Russian-language marketplace that had operated via the Tor network since at least 2015 and was known for extensive drug trafficking, according to German authorities. The market's 17 million known customers were also known to buy and sell forged documents and stolen credit cards, they said. In 2020, its sales amounted to well over $1 billion euros. German authorities said they seized Hydra’s server infrastructure and about $25 million in bitcoin on Tuesday. “The seizures carried out today were preceded by extensive investigations that have been conducted…since August 2021 and in which several US authorities were involved,” the German federal police announced. Numerous U.S. agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS Criminal Investigation and others were involved in the operation, they said. The investigation targeted the operators and administrators of Hydra, according to German authorities. Among other things, authorities said the market was being used for criminal transactions, money laundering and abundant sales of illegal narcotics. Hydra was the illegal marketplace with the highest turnover worldwide, German authorities said. Its sales amounted to at least 1.23 billion euros in 2020 alone. It also offered a service for obfuscating digital transactions, complicating crypto investigations for law enforcement agencies. In addition to the law enforcement actions taking down Hydra's illegal marketplace, the U.S. sanctioned the company, along with a virtual currency exchange based in Estonia, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement. “The global threat of cybercrime and ransomware that originates in Russia, and the ability of criminal leaders to operate there with impunity, is deeply concerning to the United States,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement. “Our actions send a message today to criminals that you cannot hide on the darknet or their forums, and you cannot hide in Russia or anywhere else in the world."" Hydra accounted for some 86% of illicit Bitcoin transactions in Russia in 2019, according to the U.S. Treasury, while Estonian exchange Garantex was used for over $100 million in virtual currency transactions associated with illicit actors. Estonian authorities stripped Garantex of its license in February, but it continued to operate ""through unscrupulous means,"" the department said. These sanctions are an attempt by the Biden administration to show that virtual currency will not be able to evade U.S. and international sanctions on Russia or other criminal actors. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ""is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance,"" the department said.",,,,29
2022-04-05,https://abcnews.go.com/International/photos-show-devastation-bucha-wake-russian-invasion/story?id=83872938,Photos show devastation in Bucha in wake of Russian invasion,"A man lay sprawled by the roadside in the Ukrainian city of Bucha on Sunday, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation. Bucha's deputy mayor, Taras Shapravskyi, said 50 of the dead residents, found after Russian forces withdrew from the city late last week, were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops, and the officials have accused Moscow of war crimes. Russia's defense ministry said in a statement issued Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and claimed no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Reuters was not able to independently verify who was responsible for killing the dead residents. But three bodies seen by Reuters reporters on Sunday -- the corpse with the hands bound and two others that did not have bound hands -- bore bullet shots to the head consistent with what Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk and his deputy described as executions. In all three cases, there were no signs of any other significant injuries elsewhere in the body. All three people shot in the head were male, and all three were dressed in civilian clothing. On the body of the person whose hands were bound, there were powder burn marks on his lips and face. Such marks can mean a person was shot at close range. The cloth used to bind the man's hands appeared to be a white armband. Russian troops, while they were in Bucha, required that local residents wear the armbands to identify themselves, according to one woman who was still wearing hers. Reuters sent questions to the Kremlin and the Russian defense ministry about the corpses that its reporters had witnessed but received no immediate reply. Russia's defense ministry in its statement Sunday said: ""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions."" It added that before Russian troops withdrew on March 30, they delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians around the Kyiv region. Shapravskyi, the deputy mayor, said some 300 people were found dead after the Russian withdrawal. Of these, he said, officials so far have logged 50 as executions carried out by Russian forces. Reuters could not independently verify those figures. The others were either killed in crossfire, or their deaths are so far unexplained. ""Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians. The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk, the mayor, said as he showed Reuters reporters one of the bodies. Reuters also spoke to one local resident who described a person being found dead after Russian troops detained them, and another resident who described two people found dead with single gunshot wounds to the head. Reuters was not able to independently verify the descriptions provided by the residents. Sobbing as she gestured at her husband's shallow grave, a shot of vodka topped with a cracker resting on freshly dug earth, Tetyana Volodymyrivna recounted an ordeal at the hands of Russian troops in this city 23 miles northwest of Kyiv. She said she and her husband, a former Ukrainian marine, were dragged from their apartment when Russian troops set up their command center in their building. The soldiers held them prisoner in the apartment building where they lived. She said the Russians, when they arrived in the city, asked people who they were and demanded to see documents. She said a fighter with the Russian forces who she believed was from Russia's semi-autonomous Chechnya region warned he would ""cut us up."" She did not say how she knew he was Chechen. Reuters sent a request for comment to the office of the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, a Kremlin loyalist, but received no reply. Tetyana, who identified herself by her first name and patronymic but did not give her family name, was released after being held for four days. Her husband was nowhere to be seen for several days, until she was told about some bodies in a basement stairwell of the building where she and her husband lived. ""I recognized him by his sneakers, his trousers. He looked mutilated, his body was cold,"" she said. ""My neighbor still has a picture of his face. He had been shot in the head, mutilated, tortured."" Reuters reviewed the photograph, which showed that the face and body were badly mutilated. The news agency could not determine if there was a bullet wound. After recovering her husband's body, she and some neighbors buried it in a garden plot near their building, just deep enough ""so dogs wouldn't eat him,"" she said. Another corpse still lay in the stairwell where her husband was found, a Reuters reporter saw. Local residents covered the body with a bedsheet as a mark of dignity. Around the corner, another grave contained the remains of two men, a resident told Reuters. She said the men had been taken away by Russian troops, but she did not witness them being killed. When the bodies were found, both had been shot through the left eye, she said. Six other residents gathered near the grave said her account was correct. One of the residents said she recognized one of the dead men as a tenant in the apartment complex, who she said was a retired member of the Ukrainian military. Bucha was captured in the days immediately after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces who swept south, capturing the defunct nuclear reactor at Chernobyl and moving southward toward the capital. Bucha and the northern outskirts of nearby Irpin were the point at which the Russian advance from the northwest was halted after they met with unexpectedly fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. The area witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle for the capital, until Russian forces pulled back from north of Kyiv. Moscow said in late March it was regrouping to focus on battles in eastern Ukraine. On Saturday, Ukraine said its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv and that it now had complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion. On Sunday, roads in Bucha were littered with unexploded ordnance. Rockets poked out of the tarmac near burned-out wrecks of tanks. Some residents scrawled ""Beware, mines"" on their walls in chalk after finding booby traps or missiles on their premises. Resident Volodomir Kopachov said Russians troops had set up a rocket system in a vacant lot next to his garden. When a Reuters reporter visited, boxes of ammunition and spent shell casings littered the ground. Kopachov, a Ukrainian dog breeder, was in mourning. He said his 33-year-old daughter, her boyfriend and a friend were shot dead by Russian troops after firing a party streamer toward them just days before the pullback. Kopachov's wife said they fired the streamer as a gesture of defiance, not with the intent of harming the soldiers. ""It is so hard to go through it all,"" said the 69-year-old, as 10 Alabai, a breed of prized Central Asian Shepherd dog, barked in his backyard. Kopachov said he had not ventured beyond the gates of his house for a month. ""They were killing [people] on the spot. No one asked: 'Who you are, why you are out?' The men were simply shot."" The Kremlin denies that it has invaded Ukraine, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and is targeting military installations rather than carrying out strikes on civilian areas. Speaking in Hostomel, near Bucha, on Sunday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said: ""This is not a special operation, these are not police actions. ... These are inhumans who simply committed crimes against civilians."" Reporting by Simon Gardner for Reuters",,,,19
2022-04-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ag-garland-vows-hold-responsible-atrocities-ukraine-accountable/story?id=83908445,AG Garland vows to hold those responsible for 'atrocities in Ukraine' accountable,"Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday expressed outrage over the ""horrible images"" of killed civilians in Ukraine and said the U.S. is working with international partners to identify those responsible. ""This Department has a long history of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes,"" Garland said. ""We have seen the dead bodies of civilians, some with bound hands, scattered in the streets. We have seen the mass graves. We have seen the bombed hospital, theater, and residential apartment buildings. The world sees what is happening in Ukraine. The Justice Department sees what is happening in Ukraine."" Garland said investigators are in the ""collection of evidence"" stage of any war crime prosecution and he is not calling for anything similar to the Nuremberg Trials at this point, but he notably said the Justice Department has a ""long history"" of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes. ""One of my predecessors -- Attorney General Robert Jackson -- later served as the chief American prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials,"" he said. Garland told reporters he personally spoke on Tuesday with the Justice Department's chief prosecutor in Paris who has been meeting with the French war crimes prosecutor. On Monday, Garland said prosecutors from the department's Criminal Division met with prosecutors from Eurojust and EUROPOL to ""work out a plan for gathering evidence with respect to Ukraine."" ""At the same time, the United States is at the request of the Ukrainian prosecutor assisting in the collection of information with respect to the atrocities that took place in Ukraine and that are still taking place,"" Garland said. His remarks come as the Justice Department on Wednesday announced a myriad of actions against Russian oligarchs and Russian darknet operations. DOJ charged Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev with sanctions violations, alleging Malofeyev as one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea, and for providing material support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic. These actions are part of the Justice Department's KleptoCapture Task force, established last month and is aimed at seizing Russian oligarch assets. ""After being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe,"" Garland told reporters. ""We are also announcing the seizure of millions of dollars from an account at a U.S. financial institution, which the indictment alleges constitutes proceeds traceable to Malofeyev’s sanctions violations."" One of Malofeyev's co-conspirators, according to DOJ, Jack Hanick a former U.S. television producer, was arrested last month in the United Kingdom where he had been living for violating U.S. sanctions stemming from Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. The Justice Department also announced the disruption of a global botnet run by the GRU, which DOJ says the Russians have used similar infrastructure to attack the Ukrainians and were able to shut the system down before it was able to be used against thousands of network devices it had reportedly infected. FBI Director Christopher Wray told reporters the team behind the global botnet was behind some of most infectious cyberattacks in recent memory -- including the cyberattacks against the Winter Olympics in 2018, attacks on Ukrainian power grid in 2015 and the attack on the country of Georgia in 2019. ""We're going to act as soon as we can with whatever partners are best situated to help,"" Wray said. ""The Russian government has show that it has no qualms about conducting this kind of criminal activity and they continue to pose a threat."" Garland echoed Wray's comments, saying, ""We were then able to disable the GRU’s control over those devices before the botnet could be weaponized."" The Justice Department seized a yacht that belongs to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg in Marina Real in the Spanish port of Palma de Mallorca, according to court documents unsealed Monday. In addition to the seizure of Vekselberg's yacht, U.S. authorities also obtained seizure warrants unsealed in Washington, D.C., Monday that target roughly $625,000 associated with sanctioned parties that's being held at nine U.S. financial institutions, the Justice Department said. ""It does not matter how far you sail your yacht. It does not matter how well you conceal your assets. It does not matter how cleverly you write your malware or hide your online activity. The Justice Department will use every available tool to find you, disrupt your plots, and hold you accountable,"" Garland said.",,,,29
2022-04-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-targets-putins-adult-daughters-round-russian-sanctions/story?id=83908763,US targets Putin's adult daughters in new round of Russia sanctions,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters -- Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova -- are included in the latest round of sanctions on Russia the U.S. announced on Wednesday. Before delivering unrelated remarks to the North America's Building Trades Unions Legislative Conference, President Joe Biden took to the bully pulpit to announce the new sanctions on Wednesday afternoon and to denounce the atrocities witnessed in Bucha, a suburb of Ukraine's capital city Kyiv. ""Bodies left in streets as Russian troops withdraw. Some shot in the back of head with hands tied behind their backs. Civilians executed in cold blood. Bodies dumped into mass graves. A sense of brutality and humanity left for all the world to see unapologetically,"" Biden said. ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes. Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable. And together with our allies and our partners, we're going to keep raising economic costs, and ratchet up the pain for Putin and further increased Russia's economic isolation,"" he continued. The new round of sanctions includes a ban on all new investments in Russia, increased sanctions on two major financial institutions in Russia -- Sberbank and Alfa-Bank -- as well as on major Russian state-owned enterprises, and sanctions on Russian government officials and their family members -- including Putin's daughters. ""We, along with our European allies, are adding the names to the list of Russian elites and families we are sanctioning,"" Biden added -- but not calling out Putin's daughters by name. ""Look, these oligarchs and their family members are not allowed to hold on to their wealth in Europe or the United States and keep the yachts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, luxury vacation homes, while children in Ukraine are being killed, displaced from their homes every single day."" According to the White House, the U.S. has sanctioned Putin's two adult daughters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's wife and daughter, as well as the remaining members of Russia's National Security Council that weren't already hit with full blocking sanctions, including former president and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. While Putin for years has closely guarded his daughters' privacy, the U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday that Tikhonova is a tech executive whose work supports the Russian government and defense industry, while Vorontsova leads state-funded genetics research programs that Treasury says the Kremlin has given billions of dollars, with personal oversight by Putin. A senior administration official said on an earlier call with reporters that the U.S. has reason to believe that Putin and his cronies hide their wealth with family members, and said, ""We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden, with family members and that's why we're targeting them."" ""These individuals have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people. Some of them are responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin's war on Ukraine. This action cuts them off from the U.S. financial system and freezes any assets they hold in the United States,"" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the sanctions. Since Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in late February, the U.S. has sanctioned more than 140 oligarchs and their family members and more than 400 Russian government officials and has now fully blocked more than two-thirds of the Russian banking sector, which held about $1.4 trillion in assets before the war. In conjunction with the G-7 and European Union, the U.S. also announced Wednesday it was cutting off Russia's ability to use its previously frozen central bank funds to make debt payments -- forcing it to find other sources of dollars to avoid defaulting. In his remarks Wednesday, Biden also applauded corporate America for ""stepping up for a change"" and choosing to leave the Russian market on their own accord. ""Russia will very likely lose its status as a major economy, and it will continue a long descent into economic, financial, and technological isolation,"" a senior administration official told reporters. According to the White House, under the new sanctions, Russia's GDP will contract up to 15% this year, wiping out the last 15 years of economic gains. Inflation, already spiking above 15%, is expected to rise, and supply chains will be further disrupted as more than 600 private sector companies have already left the Russian market. ""At this rate, it will go back to Soviet-style living standards from the 1980s,"" the official added. Asked if the U.S. was concerned about any downsides to detaching Russia from the global market to the point where it would become more concerned with disrupting it, rather than getting back in, the official seemingly brushed off the concern, saying that the U.S. was using a ""negative feedback loop"" to deter Putin, but that can be stopped if Putin also stops. ""None of this is permanent. The only aspect that's permanent of the lives that he's taken away, and he can never bring those back. But the sanctions, the sanctions are designed to be able to respond to the conditions on the ground, and to create leverage for the outcome we seek,"" the official said. The announcement follows Biden on Monday saying he was seeking further sanctions in response to apparent war crimes in Bucha -- but as national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned this week, the White House acknowledges that further sanctions against Russia will not change Putin's behavior overnight. ""Sanctions are intended to impose costs so Russia can't carry on these grotesque acts without paying a severe price for it,"" Sullivan said during Monday's briefing. ""We don't expect that that shift in behavior will be caused by sanctions overnight or in a week. It will take time to grind down the elements of Russian power within the Russian economy, to hit their industrial base hard, to hit the sources of revenue that have propped up this war and propped up the kleptocracy in Russia,"" he added.

2022-04-06,https://abcnews.go.com/International/north-korea-test-nuclear-device-week-us-envoy/story?id=83921065,"North Korea could test nuclear device next week, US envoy warns","With North Korea set to celebrate its most important holiday next week, the U.S. is concerned that Pyongyang ""may be tempted to take another provocative action,"" including a possible nuclear test. ""We, in cooperation and coordination with our allies and partners, are prepared to deal with whatever they may undertake, and I want to emphasize that we obviously hope that they will refrain from further provocation,"" U.S. Special Envoy for North Korea Sung Kim said. North Korea will celebrate the birth of the country's founder, Kim Il Sung, on April 15. Kim is the grandfather of current dictator Kim Jong Un. The isolated country has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017, its sixth on record. As Russia's war in Ukraine exacerbates tensions between the Kremlin and the West, Kim said Russian and Chinese diplomats at the United Nations have obstructed any U.S. effort to condemn North Korea's recent spate of missile launches -- including the kind of long-range one that Russia and China used to condemn back in 2017. ""Unfortunately, I cannot report that we have had productive discussions with"" China or Russia about a new U.N. Security Council resolution, Kim told reporters during a briefing Wednesday. The two countries have blocked even a public statement from the U.N. Security Council condemning the 13 recent launches, per Kim, even though they violate multiple U.N. resolutions. Still, the U.S. and its allies are pursuing a new resolution to condemn North Korea's launches because ""the Security Council needs to respond to these blatant violations of multiple Security Council resolutions,"" Kim said. ""This is about the credibility of the United Nations."" Kim, who also serves as the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, traveled to Washington this week, including to meet his Chinese counterpart Tuesday for a ""very long and detailed discussion."" He said despite Chinese opposition, he remains ""convinced that Beijing shares our goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" Part of the U.S. outreach to China on this issue is because North Korea has rejected all U.S. entreaties under the Biden administration. ""We have sent several messages, both public and private, inviting them to a dialogue without any conditions,"" Kim told reporters, but North Korea has yet to respond, which Kim called ""very disappointing."" He declined to speculate on why, but said the COVID-19 pandemic could be one reason. North Korea ""finds itself isolated in unprecedented ways and has shut itself off during the COVID pandemic. Only the resumption of diplomacy can break this isolation,"" he said. Instead, the U.S. has heard more fiery rhetoric from Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, who this week warned of a nuclear response if South Korea prepared to strike. Kim said the U.S. was ""concerned"" by the ""provocative"" comments. With Biden's North Korea policy going nowhere fast, Kim argued it is still having an important effect. While Pyongyang remains committed to perfecting its nuclear weapons program, U.S. sanctions and pressure ""are constraining their progress,"" he said.",,,,1
2022-04-06,https://abcnews.go.com/International/bucha-survivors-recount-senseless-horror-emerge-hiding/story?id=83904795,Bucha survivors recount 'senseless' horror as they emerge from hiding,"As Mykola Pavlyuk stood outside his apartment building in Bucha, tears streamed from his eyes, cutting through the grime on his face. He was desperate to share his story but shook from the trauma of it. Pavlyuk, 53, was one of the surviving residents of the besieged Ukrainian town, northwest of Kyiv, where gruesome evidence of killings and torture has come to light following the withdrawal of Russian forces. He told ABC News that when Russian troops came to his apartment building, they killed all the men who were younger than 50, including two of Pavlyuk's friends. Pavlyuk said he was given 20 minutes to bury them. He showed ABC News the shallow graves he hastily dug in the backyard, each marked with a plank of wood and topped with a religious icon. He wanted to give them whatever dignity he could. ""But it's too shallow,"" Pavlyuk said. ""I just wanted to protect them from the dogs."" Pavlyuk and other residents spoke with ABC News in the days after Russian forces departed Bucha, leaving an apparent trail of death, destruction, terror and trauma that has shaken the international community. Hundreds of people were said to have been killed during the occupation. When ABC News arrived on Tuesday, bodies still lay in the streets. World leaders have called for an investigation into whether war crimes, including genocide, were committed. When Russian troops arrived in Bucha in late February, they asked everyone for documentation and forced the men to strip down naked to reveal any tattoos, according to Pavlyuk. They immediately shot and killed anyone whom they deemed a threat, without asking any questions, he said. The mayor of the nearby village of Motyzhyn, Olga Sukhenko, and her family appear to have met the same fate. ABC News witnessed their lifeless bodies in a wooded area. Another Bucha resident, who declined to give her name, told ABC News her husband was also forced to remove his clothes to show whether he had any tattoos. Russian soldiers took over Pavlyuk's apartment building, turning the homes of Ukrainian families into wartime dormitories for drunk, violent thugs, he said. Rooms that Pavlyuk showed ABC News were strewn with blankets and old food. Pavlyuk said he and his wife lived in the basement for more than month with little food or water, only leaving to cook on a stove outside. He told ABC News they faced the constant fear of an arbitrary killing or a random act of violence, like when a friend was killed by a grenade he said was thrown as a joke by a drunk soldier. The friend's body parts lay outside on the ground for days until Pavlyuk was allowed to gather them, put them in a bag and bury them in a grave next to his two other friends, he said. More bodies were dumped in a mass grave outside a church. Residents had gone out to collect some of the dead from the streets while the town was under Russian occupation. The trench was filled with bodies in black plastic bags that lay on top of other victims, who were either wrapped in sheets or nothing at all. Locals told ABC News there could be as many as 90 people buried there. Russian forces invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, seizing territory and bombing entire cities. As the war grinds on, Russia faces strong resistance from Ukraine, whose troops managed to take back some territory in recent days as Russian forces retreated. According to Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova, at least 410 civilians have been found dead in Bucha and other recently recaptured towns near Ukraine's capital, where there's an ongoing investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces. Graphic images have emerged from Bucha showing unarmed individuals in civilian clothes who appear to have been executed with their hands or legs bound, sparking outrage from the United States as well as a number of other nations and institutions. Russia has denied responsibility, calling the images ""fake"" and saying all of its units withdrew completely from Bucha around March 30. An ABC News analysis of videos and satellite imagery confirms some of the bodies seen lying in the streets of Bucha were there as early as March 19, when the town was still occupied by Russian forces, contradicting Russia's claims that the scene was ""staged"" after its troops left. While in Bucha, ABC News encountered a Human Rights Watch team gathering evidence of war crimes. ""What we've seen so far and what we've heard from residents -- what we've been documenting -- is really horrific, including reports that Russian forces have pulled people out of their homes, briefly interrogated them and then executed them,"" said Richard Weir, a researcher in the Crisis and Conflict division at Human Rights Watch. A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross was also on scene in Bucha, assessing needs and delivering humanitarian aid. ""Humanitarian situation is dire,"" ICRC spokesperson Alyona Synenko told ABC News. ""We have seen extremely vulnerable people -- elderly, people with limited mobility, people who are sick, who are alone in their unheated apartments with no electricity, with no running water, with medical needs."" Bucha residents Tatyana Chernysh and her husband told ABC News they must have survived ""by God's will"" when so many of their neighbors did not. ""At any time, the occupiers could enter our premises and do with us whatever they wanted,"" said Chernysh's husband, who said he was too frightened to give his first name. ""It was terrifying. It was awful."" The couple didn't leave their house while Russian troops occupied the town. They said ""good people"" brought them food and medicine. Although the Russian soldiers camped away from their home, Chernysh and her husband said they heard unyielding gunfire and that stray bullets pockmarked their house. Since the withdrawal of Russian forces and the recent arrival of aid, Chernysh and her husband have finally come out of hiding to see what remains of their battered town. They recalled seeing bodies strewn across the streets and sidewalks. ""It is obvious their intention was to destroy Ukraine, destroy our people, destroy our economy, destroy our culture,"" Chernysh's husband said of the Russian troops. ""They claimed they came to liberate. They didn't. They are terrorists."" After surviving such ""senseless"" horror, the family said they ""feel safe"" and intend to stay in Bucha, despite a lack of electricity, running water and reliable communication. ""It's where we live. We don't want to yield our homes to occupiers,"" Chernysh's husband said. ""It is our town. It is our home. We are going to stay."" Although he admitted they might think twice if Russian forces return. ""Hopefully they won’t come back,"" he added, ""but with them you can never tell.""",,,,19
2022-04-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-fully-withdraws-kyiv-region-ukrainians-drone-training/story?id=83914701,"Russia fully withdraws from Kyiv region, Ukrainians get drone training in US: Pentagon update Day 42","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 42: All Russian troops withdrawn from around Kyiv and Chernihiv The tens of thousands of Russian troops arrayed against Kyiv and Chernihiv have withdrawn north across the borders of Belarus and Russia to consolidate before likely redeploying to eastern Ukraine, according to the senior defense official. ""We are assessing that they have completely withdrawn from Kiev and from Chernihiv,"" the official said. But even with the Russian forces, the territory remains treacherous. ""There are some indications that they left behind mines and things like that, so the Ukrainians are being somewhat careful in some areas north of Kyiv as they begin to clear the ground and clear the territory and re-occupy it,"" the official said. On Monday, the Pentagon estimated that roughly one-third of the Russian forces apparently originally designated to take the capital remained. Before the withdrawal, there were about 20 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) consisting of 800-1,000 troops each in the areas north and northwest of Kyiv, and another 20 BTGs near Chernihiv, according to the official. While the U.S. hasn't yet seen these troops redeploy elsewhere in Ukraine, it's likely to happen soon, according to the official. ""Our assessment is that they won't want to spend too much time on refit and resupply because they have made a very public show of saying that they're going to prioritize their efforts on the Donbas region,"" the official said. But the timing will depend on how much work is needed to get the Russian forces back into fighting condition. ""Some of these units have been much more depleted than others, and it's possible that the Russians could combine units to make new BTGs as a result, we just we just don't know,"" the official said. Of the roughly 130 BTGs Russia dedicated to the invasion, about 80 are still inside Ukraine, according to the official. More than 30 are already in the Donbas region. US sending 'urgent' shipment of anti-tank missiles for fight in Donbas Ukrainian forces are preparing for a major fight in the east as Russia prepares as many as 40 BTGs to join 30 more battalions already in Donbas. ""They're not waiting,"" the official said. ""They are already adapting to increased Russian activity in the Donbas region and doing the best they can."" On Tuesday, the Biden administration authorized a $100 million drawdown package to ""meet an urgent Ukrainian need for additional Javelin anti-armor systems,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. The senior U.S. defense official said this move was specifically to help in Donbas. ""One of the reasons why you saw us describe this $100 million drawdown package last night as an urgent need for Javelins was in fact because of the activity in the Donbas and the Ukrainians wanting to make sure that they're ready for increased Russian activity there,"" the official said. Ukrainians get drone training in US A small number of Ukrainians currently in the U.S. for ""professional military education"" were pulled aside for a couple days of training on Switchblade drones, which the U.S. is sending overseas as part of its military aid, according to the official. ""Although it's not a very difficult system to operate, we took advantage of having them in the country to give them some rudimentary training on that,"" the official said. ""And there may be some additional rudimentary training while they're here."" The official said fewer than 12 Ukrainians were given this U.S.-based training. Pentagon blames Russia for nitric acid explosion The official said the Pentagon is ""monitoring"" an apparent nitric acid explosion in the Luhansk region, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. ""We've seen the Russians claim that this was a Ukrainian attack on this. We do not believe that is true,"" the official said. ""We do believe that the Russians are responsible, but exactly what they used when they did it, why they did it, what the damage is, we just don't have that level of detail,"" the official said. 'Premeditated' Russian atrocities in Bucha ""When you see individuals with their hands tied behind their backs and evidence of being shot in the head, that certainly appears to be premeditated,"" the official said, again calling for Russian war crimes in Ukraine to be investigated. Long-range strikes shifting east Russia has now launched more than 1,450 missiles against Ukraine, according to the official. The Pentagon is seeing more airstrikes targeting the east than Kyiv as Russia shifts its overall focus to the Donbas region.",,,,6
2022-04-06,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/big-oil-ceos-testify-congress-amid-skyrocketing-gas/story?id=83867580,'Big Oil' CEOs testify before Congress amid skyrocketing gas prices,"Six oil company executives were grilled by lawmakers Wednesday about skyrocketing gas prices amid a political messaging battle over pain at the pump. BP America, Chevron and ExxonMobil executives are among the leaders who faced questions from members of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. The hearing came after costs for gas rose following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted the U.S. to put a ban on imports of Russian oil and gas. Though the price of gas has dropped slightly in recent days, Americans were still paying an average $4.16 as of Wednesday, according to American Automobile Association data. ""While American families are forced to pay record-high prices at the pump, frankly this committee is not going to sit back and allow this system -- which forces American taxpayers to pay oil companies out of both pockets, first at the pump and then through tax breaks -- to continue in its current form,"" said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., chair of the subcommittee, in her opening remarks. Oil executives took turns defending themselves and their companies, pushing back on accusations of price gouging. ""I want to be absolutely clear: We do not control the market price of crude oil or natural gas, nor of refined products like gasoline and diesel fuel, and we have no tolerance for price gouging,"" Chevron CEO Michael Wirth said. The executives cited the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason for cost increases and promoted increasing production to offset the spike. ""While there is no quick fix, the answer in the near term, until there are more widely available and affordable alternatives, is straightforward. We need to increase the supply of oil and natural gas,"" ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods said. With politicians on both sides of the aisle continuing to spar over who's to blame for gas prices, Democratic lawmakers on the subcommittee weren't buying the oil companies' explanations. ""One bad year does not excuse the practice of ripping off American consumers,"" Rep. Ann Kuster, D-N.H., said. ""It's a matter of patriotism,"" Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., added. ""Something must be done on your part."" Democrats have worked hard to pinpoint Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the source of the rise in gas prices, with President Joe Biden coining it ""Putin's price hike."" Republicans, on the other hand, are quick to argue that the higher costs kicked in long before the war began and that Biden's energy policies are what's hurting Americans' pocketbooks. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, accused House Democrats of hosting a ""show trial"" with the hearing. ""It's kind of an annual right of passage bringing forward energy oil and gas executives,"" he said. ""You know what a show trial is, the subject of the trial being flogged for something that is usually the fault of the very officials conducting the trial."" Senators described the increase of energy prices as ""purposeful"" -- arguing that the Biden administration intentionally raised gas prices to advance green energy policies. ""When it costs you 100 bucks to fill the tank of your truck that is Joe Biden's fault,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said. ""When it costs 100 bucks to fill the families minivan that is Joe Biden's fault."" Patrick De Haan, head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy, told ABC News the reasons behind the cost of gas are more complicated than any one of the partisan narratives suggests. ""There's too many political games being played in too many political points trying to be won. Neither side is portraying it accurately,"" he said. ""There's a lot of factors that go into this and the politicians on both sides of the aisle are, you know, just using buzzwords and phrases and they're using regurgitated, establishment talking points by their own parties ... "" De Haan also noted the ""extremely volatile"" situation gas companies are in with regard to fluctuating oil prices. ""Stations are not eager to lower prices right now. Not necessarily because of, you know, they're greedy or something but because the market is extremely volatile,"" De Haan said, adding that ""if they were to pass along a decrease one day, they may have to raise prices another 25 to 50 cents the day after if the market goes back up."" Instead, he said, the ""stations are essentially smoothing out the incredible volatility and they're cautiously passing along decreases once they are kind of certain that they're not going to have to raise prices again."" PolitiFact also noted that ""experts who study the price of oil and gas said it can take weeks for gasoline prices to respond to changes in crude oil costs"" and that ""Russia's invasion of Ukraine, increased labor costs, the pandemic and additional taxes and inflation have all contributed to rising gasoline prices."" When pressed on why gas prices remain high despite crude oil prices dropping, BP President David Lawler said it was ""complex."" ""It is a very complex set of factors that impact the price of gasoline,"" he said. Later, some lawmakers called out the executives for their lack of straight answers. ""Can't you bring more clarity to this than just saying that everything is so complex,"" Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., quipped. Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, a nonprofit focused on climate policy and holding corporations accountable, says Democrats aren't wrong to place the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""The Democrats aren't making something up to point out how this is a really acute example of what dependency on oil and gas would get you. That's exactly right. And the oil companies, they don't care at all,"" he said. But Wiles noted that gas prices started rising long before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""Oil companies are bad in war and peace,"" he said. As the oil company executives faced members of the House, lawmakers are also scrambling to pass legislation to provide immediate relief as a consequential midterm season quickly approaches. Most recently, Biden announced the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day from oil reserves to combat high gas prices; though, senior White House administration officials couldn't say how quickly Americans will start to feel relief from it. At her weekly press conference last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress is looking to help as long as the benefit goes directly to consumers, likely in the form of a rebate card or a direct payment. House Republicans on the Natural Resources Committee introduced a package of bills last week reversing the Biden administration's moratorium on federal onshore and offshore lease sales. And some progressive Democrats are renewing their push toward more long-term investments in renewable energy to end oil dependency. A report from the House Committee on Oversight and Reform released Monday showed oil companies are continuing to invest more in stock buybacks than their commitment to cleaner fuels. ""We found that as profits rose last year, Exxon, Chevron, BP, and Shell spent more than $44 billion to enrich investors with stock buybacks and dividends,"" the report said, ""while committing less than half that amount to urgently needed lower-carbon investments."" Some executives Wednesday wouldn’t commit to reducing buybacks and dividends while increasing production. Others wouldn't comment. Executives from Pioneer Natural Resources and Devon Energy said they’re increasing output but said ""no"" to decreasing returns to shareholders. Chevron and Shell executives said they could do both.",,,,23

Buildings are seen burned and completely destroyed, surrounded by rubble left behind by Russian forces that failed to overtake the Ukrainian capital. Widespread destruction was seen in the suburbs surrounding Kyiv, including Bucha, Irpin and Borodyanka. Burned-out cars litter the roadways. ABC News foreign correspondent James Longman, who reported from Borodyanka on Wednesday, described an apartment complex ""cut in half"" and another building that had so much of its exterior blown off that it's possible to ""see right into people's homes."" The town of Borodyanka, about 30 miles northwest of Kyiv, ""is almost destroyed,"" Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv Oblast, said Tuesday after visiting the Borodyanka. After Ukrainian officials began to discover the atrocities committed in Bucha, Ukrainian prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova said the situation in Borodyanka, about 50 miles northwest of Kyiv, could be worse. ""In fact, the worst situation, when we talk about civilian casualties in Kyiv region, is in Borodyanka,"" Venediktova said Monday on Ukrainian TV. The death toll in Borodyanka and other liberated cities may be even higher than in Bucha, where at least 300 people were killed or tortured, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address on Monday. Russian troops occupied Borodyanka even longer than Bucha. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible -- everything to punish them,"" Zelenskyy said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" Haunting drone video filmed in early March showed the extent of devastation and destruction in residential areas of Borodyanka after strikes from Russian forces began. Humanitarian corridors from Borodyanka had been established as Ukrainian nationalists moved into residential areas of the town, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on March 3. It is unclear how many were able to flee the small town of about 13,000. Zelenskyy began recounting the annihilation of Borodyanka as early as March 5, detailing destroyed schools and the Kharkiv Assumption Cathedral, which had been badly damaged in the air raids. ""Look what Russia has done,"" Zelenskyy said in a March 5 address. ""It did it right in front of your eyes. Protect yourself!""

2022-04-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-accused-mobile-crematoriums-incinerate-civilians-mariupol/story?id=83932376,Ukrainian officials accuse Russia of using 'mobile crematoriums' in Mariupol,"In one of the creepiest allegations to emerge from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin is being accused by Ukrainian officials of using ""mobile crematoriums"" to incinerate dead civilians in a deliberate effort to cover-up alleged war crimes in the hard-hit city of Mariupol. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko made the charge this week, saying he heard eyewitness accounts of Russian soldiers driving around Mariupol with crematoriums on lorries and collecting bodies of civilians while at the same time barring the International Committee of the Red Cross from entering the city with humanitarian aid. ""The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of Nazis concentration camps,"" Boychenko said on Tuesday. ""The Russians have turned our entire city into a death camp. Unfortunately, the creepy analogy is getting more and more confirmation."" In a statement released on its Facebook account, the Mariupol City Council said, ""witnesses have seen evidence Russia is operating mobile crematoria in Mariupol, burning the bodies of dead civilians and covering up evidence of war crimes."" The statement added ""this is why Russia is not in a hurry"" to let the ICRC and other human rights watch groups into Mariupol to rescue civilians still trapped there. Boychenko and the city council said the portable human furnaces showed up in Mariupol after reports of alleged atrocities at the hands of Russian troops emerged in Bucha, a suburb of the capital city Kyiv. Ukrainian officials reported that at least 410 civilians were killed in Bucha, including many found with their hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Boychenko said his once-thriving port city of 400,000 people has been completely decimated by bombing raids and estimated that around 5,000 people there have been killed. U.S. defense officials told ABC News they have not confirmed the allegations that Russia is using mobile crematoriums to hide evidence of war crimes. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts, told ABC News on Thursday that he is not surprised by the reports. Moulton, a former Marine and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that during a 2015 fact-finding mission in Ukraine that he went on with other House members, ""credible sources"" informed him that the Russian Army was using mobile crematoriums on its own soldiers in the Russian occupied Crimea, Ukraine. He said the sources told him Russia was using the devices to cover up the number of its soldiers killed in Crimea. ""We heard this from a variety of sources over there, enough that I was confident in the veracity of the information,"" Moulton said. ""None of that has changed. That is absolutely what was going on back then and I'm now hearing reports, unsurprisingly, that it's happening again."" Moulton said he has no reason to discount reports from Ukrainian officials that Russia is using the incinerators to hide new war crimes. ""The bottom line is this is nothing new for the Russian Army and Vladimir Putin,"" Moulton said. In an interview with Turkish media this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alleged that Russian soldiers were ""cleaning up"" before allowing aid workers into the heavily bombed Mariupol. Pressure has been mounting from the international community to bring war crimes against Putin and other Russian officials. The international criminal court in The Hague has launched an investigation into the atrocities allegedly committed against Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops since the invasion started on Feb. 24. A report released Thursday by Amnesty International claims Russian forces have committed numerous war crimes throughout Ukraine. The organization said its crisis response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns near Kyiv and many claimed to have witnessed civilian executions. The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday voted to pass a resolution to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council in response to Russian forces' alleged killings of civilians in Ukraine. ""I'm not sure who needs more proof that Russia is committing war crimes,"" Moulton told ABC News. ""They're trying to cover their tracks."" Russia has denied committing atrocities and targeting civilians.",,,,15
2022-04-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/genocide-legal-threshold-crossed-ukraine/story?id=83883901,What is genocide and has the legal threshold been crossed in Ukraine?,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of committing genocide after he said hundreds of civilians were found dead in the town of Bucha following the Russian military's withdrawal. Ukrainian officials have said more than 400 civilians were killed in Bucha, many with hands tied behind their backs, shot at close range. Russia's defense ministry said in a statement Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and claimed no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Russia has claimed all its units withdrew completely from Bucha around March 30. An ABC News analysis of videos and satellite imagery confirms some of the bodies seen lying in the streets of Bucha were there as early as March 19, when the town was still occupied by Russian forces, contradicting Russia's claims that the scene was ""staged"" after its troops left. President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and the alleged acts committed by Russian troops ""war crimes,"" but fell short of calling it genocide. Experts say this could, in part, be a political decision. ""To say that a genocide is occurring, is also to say, we can't sit on our hands and do nothing here,"" David Simon, a senior lecturer and the director of the Genocide Studies program at Yale University, told ABC News. The U.S. government also has an internal process for designating whether genocide has occurred. It took the State Department five years to designate that a genocide had occurred in Myanmar, Simon said. This story explains the legal term ""genocide"" in relation to the war in Ukraine. What is genocide? Genocide is defined as an act ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,"" according to the United Nations' Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Acts of genocide against members of a group listed in the convention include killings; causing them serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting life conditions calculated to being about its physical destruction; imposing measures to prevent births; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Genocide is not just any large scale violence, or violence that becomes particularly gruesome or grisly, Simon said. There has to be intent by the perpetrators to destroy the group, he said. Killings are also not the only form of genocide that could have occurred in Ukraine, another expert said. ""Other attempts to diminish the group, by placing them in harsh conditions of life, like if you think about starving a group to death, and you actually think of some cities in Ukraine today, where through bombardment and cutting off the flow of humanitarian aid, people are potentially going to be starving,"" Alex Hinton, the director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights and UNESCO Chair on Genocide Prevention, told ABC News. Whether or not these violent acts allegedly committed by Russian forces against civilians are found to be acts of genocide, they are illegal under international law and warrant a response from the international community, Simon said. ""What we're seeing in Ukraine almost certainly involves crimes against humanity, war crimes, and then to less well defined terms, ethnic cleansing and mass atrocities,"" Simon said. Legal threshold for defining genocide The legal definition of genocide does not define a threshold for an amount of violence that has to have happened in order for it to be considered genocide. ""The importance of intent within the definition of genocide means really, that there is no legal threshold. Particularly because the convention says the 'intent destroy in whole or in part',"" Simon said. In practice, though, Simon said the possibility of genocide has usually come up when the number of deaths are in the thousands. As of Wednesday, at least 1,480 civilians have been killed and 2,195 others have been injured in Ukraine since Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Consequences for genocide The U.N.'s convention on genocide tells countries to take claims to one of the organs of the United Nations for the further prevention and suppression of acts of genocide. However, with Russia's veto power, it is unlikely the Security Council, the organ primarily responsible for ensuring international peace and security, would be able to take action, Simon said. There are a number of things states or geopolitical actors can do, Hinton said. Organizations, including Human Rights Watch, and government actors are currently on the ground gathering evidence for a possible trial of those who may have committed crimes. An inquiry could also be launched to investigate the alleged war crimes committed. The International Criminal Court has begun active investigations into potential war crimes committed, but Simon said it could take years for this to be litigated. ""In most cases, the ICC is able to act only after a conflict is essentially over,"" Simon said. The ICC's investigation into crimes committed in Myanmar is still primarily in the investigation phase, despite the most intense parts of the violence happening in 2017, Simon said. Investigators will need to prove it was Russia's intent to destroy Ukraine or Ukrainians as a group. This evidence would be any articulation of the idea on social media, public broadcasts, in writing or even private communications, Simon said. But, ""there can be no actual case until those individuals that are under warrant are arrested and brought to the Hague for trial,"" Simon said. Radovan Karadzic, who committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia during 1992 and 1993, and was convicted in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, was at large until 2008. ""His trial, which included genocide charges, took place something like a decade and a half after the acts he undertook,"" Simon said. Experts say leaders should act either way This violence could push actors to take a stronger stance against Russia, which could have included military action if Russia wasn't a nuclear power, Simon said. Biden has repeatedly said American troops will not join the war in Ukraine, warning that going head-to-head would lead to 'World War III.' Biden has also denied requests from Zelenskyy for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""But it may push Europeans to have more of a taste to expand sanctions to include Russian exports of gas and oil, which could be far more devastating to the Russian economy than the sanctions that are in place up to this point,"" Simon said. Hinton agreed that additional sanctions could be imposed, but said lines of diplomacy need to be kept open, Hinton said. ""There has to be a way to get out of the conflict, so diplomacy is absolutely critical,"" Hinton said. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators last held virtual talks on Friday where they discussed the proposed security guarantee treaty. Ukraine proposed a new system of security guarantees similar to NATO's collective defense clause which would legally require ""guarantor countries"" to provide arms and impose a ""no-fly"" zone over Ukraine, in the event of an attack. Simon said the term ""genocide"" can often be used politically, to describe crimes that do not fit its legal definition. ""People tend to use genocide as a label for anything that upsets them. Indeed, the Russians have used Neo-Nazis and genocide against Russians as the pretext for invading in the first place, when there's absolutely no evidence of anything, especially intent to destroy Russians within Ukraine,"" Simon said. Hinton agreed, saying, ""genocide has always from the very beginning, been a sort of political football. It's used and misused by states to serve their interest."" A designation that the crimes committed against Ukrainian civilians amounts to genocide should not make a difference in the response, according to Simon. ""There are clearly violations of international law that are causing great harm to civilian populations. And that alone should should trigger a stronger response,"" he said. ""We have enough evidence of crimes against humanity, that if we think that mass atrocities are a reason for ratcheting up pressure, militarily or otherwise, against the perpetrator force, we have that evidence with us now and we don't need to have a determination of genocide to decide whether or not we find bodies in the street of Bucha repulsive or revolting,"" Simon said.",,,,13
2022-04-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/amnesty-international-russian-forces-executed-civilians-ukraine/story?id=83927829,"Russian forces executed civilians in Ukraine, Amnesty International says","Russian forces have executed civilians in Ukraine in apparent war crimes, Amnesty International said Thursday. The London-based international human rights group published new testimony after conducting on-the-ground research in areas around Ukraine's capital amid Russia's invasion. Its report adds to a growing body of evidence that Russian troops have committed war crimes amid Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine -- a charge that U.S. and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly made, but that the Kremlin vehemently denies. Amnesty International said its crisis response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns near Kyiv, many of whom claimed to have witnessed or have had direct knowledge of Russian soldiers committing horrific acts of violence against unarmed civilians across the region. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement Thursday. ""Testimonies show that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" The organization noted that deliberate killings of civilians, rape and torture, as well as inhumane treatment of prisoners of war, are human rights violations and war crimes, and that those who commit them should be held criminally responsible along with any superiors who knew or had reason to know about such atrocities but did not attempt to stop or punish the perpetrators. The International Criminal Court, a United Nations Human Rights Council commission of inquiry and Ukraine's prosecutor general have all opened investigations into possible war crimes by Russian forces. But the interviews conducted by Amnesty International and published Thursday provide a harrowing window into these kinds of attacks with grisly detail. According to the report, one of the interviewees -- 18-year-old Kateryna Tkachova -- told Amnesty International that she was at home with her parents in the village of Vorzel, northwest of Kyiv, on March 3 when several tanks painted with the letter ""Z,"" which Russian forces have used to mark their vehicles during the invasion of Ukraine, rolled down their street. Tkachova said her mother and father, who were unarmed and dressed in civilian clothing, left the basement where they were hiding to go into the street, after telling her to stay put. Tkachova said she then heard gunshots. ""Once the tanks had passed by, I jumped over the fence to the neighbor's house. I wanted to check if they're alive,"" Tkachova told Amnesty International. ""I looked over the fence and saw my mother lying on her back on one side of the road, and my father was face down on the other side of the street. I saw large holes in his coat. The next day I went to them. My father had six large holes in his back, my mother had a smaller hole in her chest."" Seven days later, an unnamed volunteer assisting with evacuations from the areas around Kyiv helped Tkachova leave Vorzel. The volunteer told Amnesty International that he had seen the bodies of Tkachova's parents lying in the street near her house, according to the report. Amnesty International said it has also verified video showing the volunteer and Tkachova writing her parents' names, dates of birth and dates of death on a piece of cardboard before placing it beside their bodies, which were covered with blankets. An unnamed 46-year-old woman told Amnesty International that Russian troops entered her village of Bohdanivka, southeast of Kyiv, on March 7 or 8. On the night of March 9, the woman said she heard gunshots through the downstairs windows of her home, where she lived with her husband, 10-year-old daughter and 81-year-old mother-in-law. She told Amnesty International that she and her husband shouted that they were civilians and that they were unarmed. When they came downstairs, two Russian soldiers pushed them and their daughter into the boiler room. ""They forced us in and slammed the door,"" she told Amnesty International. ""After just a minute they opened the door, they asked my husband if he had cigarettes. He said no, he hadn't smoked for a couple of weeks. They shot him in his right arm. The other said, 'Finish him,' and they shot him in the head."" ""He didn't die right away. From 9.30 p.m. to 4 a.m. he was still breathing, though he wasn't conscious,"" she added, according to Amnesty International. ""Blood was flowing out of him. When he took his last breath, I turned to my daughter and said, 'It seems daddy has died.'"" A neighbor told Amnesty International that they witnessed Russian soldiers breaking into the woman's house that night and also confirmed seeing her husband's body slumped in the corner of the boiler room. The woman and her child escaped from Bohdanivka later that day. The woman's mother-in-law, who has limited mobility, was left behind, according to Amnesty International. Another woman, from an unidentified village east of Kyiv, told Amnesty International that two Russian soldiers entered her house on March 9, killed her husband and then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid nearby in the boiler room, according to the report. The unnamed woman managed to escape from the village with her son and they fled to Ukrainian-controlled territory. ""The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime,"" Callamard said. ""These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command."" Interviewees also told Amnesty International they had lost access to electricity, water and gas in the early days of the Russian invasion and that there was very limited access to food. There was poor cellphone service in the region, and some interviewees said Russian soldiers had confiscated or destroyed mobile phones whenever they saw residents carrying them, or threatened them with violence for having one. Amnesty International found that threats of violence and intimidation were also widespread. One man in Hostomel, a town northwest of Kyiv, reported seeing an entire dormitory of people who were sheltering from shelling and were forced to go outside, where Russian military officers immediately fired gunshots over their heads, forcing them to drop to the ground. Two men from Bucha, another town northwest of Kyiv, also said snipers regularly shot at them when they went to salvage food from a destroyed grocery store near their home, according to Amnesty International. Russian forces invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, seizing territory and shelling entire cities. But they have faced strong resistance from Ukrainian troops, who have retaken some territory in recent days as Russian forces retreated. According to Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova, at least 410 civilians have been found dead in recently recaptured towns near Kyiv, particularly in Bucha, which has galvanized global outrage, while graphic evidence of the atrocities has emerged, including eyewitness testimony along with videos and images, Russia has claimed the scenes were ""staged."" Amnesty International said it has obtained evidence that civilians were also killed in indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv and Sumy Oblasts, documented an airstrike that killed civilians queueing for food in the northern city of Chernihiv, and gathered evidence from civilians living under siege in the battered cities of Kharkiv, Izium and Mariupol. ""As these horrendous accounts of life under Russian occupation continue to emerge,"" Callamard said, ""the victims in Ukraine must know that the international community is determined to secure accountability for their suffering.""",,,,19
2022-04-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/couple-recounts-daring-escape-rain-bombs-mariupol/story?id=83908643,Mariupol couple recounts escape from bombed Ukraine city,"A scar left by a piece of shrapnel runs from just above Nadiya's right eyebrow up to her hairline. She said it is a memento of a harrowing 140-mile escape to safety she, her husband and her mother-in-law made from their bombed hometown in Ukraine, a nerve-racking odyssey in which they dodged death twice. When Nadiya and her husband, Igor, spoke to ABC News this week in Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, smiles finally appeared on their faces as they took their first steps on peaceful ground in more than 40 days. The couple said they are lucky to be alive after fleeing their home in Mariupol, a town that has been under siege by Russian forces and rocked by daily rocket attacks since the onset of the invasion on Feb. 24. Nadiya said she, Igor and his mother were sheltering in the basement of their home when it was struck by a bomb. ""We lived on the left side of the city. We were in the private house, in the basement,"" Nadiya said while at a shopping center turned into an assistance center for thousands of displaced citizens. ""But when the house became uninhabitable, we had to flee. We were taken out by a neighbor."" Nadiya said she, Igor and her mother-in-law, Alla, ended up taking refuge in a drama theater with hundreds of other terrified residents. ""We stopped for half an hour to warm up in the drama theater and stayed for 11 days,"" Nadiya said. Then the theater was hit by a rocket, Nadiya said. ""I miraculously remained free and not under the rubble,"" Nadiya said. ""My husband and my friend were overwhelmed under the rubble. We dug them up with my friend's nephew. In 40 minutes we dug them up. In the smoke. Panting from the smoke, they finally ran outside."" Igor recalled that as he lay buried under stones and other debris from the destroyed theater, his mind raced with thoughts that his wife and mother were killed in the blast. ""When the explosion happened, it was just one moment,"" Igor recalled. ""Then darkness, dust. I was under the rubble... She (Nadiya) and the nephew of a friend dug me up. Then we ran to look for my mom."" Nadiya said that when they were unable to find evacuation buses to get them out of harm's way, she, her husband and mother-in-law fled to the Mariupol seashore and walked west for miles amid the shelling that continued around them. ""We walked 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) just ourselves on foot. Walking with a retired mother. With bags of stuff. Under shelling,"" Nadiya said. She said they ended up in the coastal town of Berdyansk where they managed to catch an evacuation bus to Zaporizhzhia and freedom from Russian occupation. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told reporters this week that his once-thriving port city of 400,000 people has been completely decimated and estimated that around 5,000 people there have been killed. Boychenko also alleged that Russian troops were roaming the city with mobile crematoriums collecting and burning bodies in an attempt to get rid of the evidence of war crimes -- an accusation that has not been verified by international humanitarian groups working in the region nor by U.S. officials monitoring the situation. ""The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of Nazis concentration camps,"" Boychenko said. ""The Russians have turned our entire city into a death camp.""

2022-04-08,https://abcnews.go.com/International/50-killed-attack-ukrainian-train-station/story?id=83960097,At least 50 killed in attack on Ukrainian train station,"At least 50 people, including five children, were killed in a rocket attack on a train station in eastern Ukraine on Friday, authorities said. Two Russian rockets struck the station in Kramatorsk in Donetsk Oblast on Friday morning, according to Ukraine's state-owned railway company, which in a statement via Facebook called the attack ""a purposeful strike on the passenger infrastructure of the railway and the residents of the city of Kramatorsk."" Donetsk Oblast Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said 38 of the 50 people killed died at the scene while 12 died in hospitals. At least 100 people were injured, according to the governor. Graphic images provided by Ukrainian officials showed the aftermath of the attack -- bodies lying on the ground next to scattered luggage and debris, with charred vehicles parked nearby. The remains of a large rocket with the words ""for our children"" in Russian painted on the side was also seen on the ground next to the main building of the station. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement via Facebook that a Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile was used in Friday's attack. Russia has denied involvement in the attack. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed involvement of Russian forces was already ruled out by the Russian Ministry of Defense, based on the type of missile that was used -- a Tochka-U short-range ballistic missile. ""Our Armed Forces do not use missiles of this type,"" Peskov told reporters during a press briefing Friday. ""No combat tasks were set or planned for today in Kramatorsk."" According to a senior U.S. defense official, the initial assessment by the U.S. is this was a short-range ballistic missile fired by Russian forces from inside Ukraine. The attack occurred as ""thousands"" of civilians fleeing the Russian invasion were at the train station waiting to be taken to ""safer regions of Ukraine,"" according to Kyrylenko, who accused Russian forces of ""deliberately trying to disrupt the evacuation of civilians."" ""The evacuation will continue,"" the governor added. ""Anyone who wants to leave the region will be able to do so."" Nate Mook, CEO of Chef José Andrés' World Central Kitchen, told CNN he was near the train station picking up supplies when the station was hit. He said he saw thousands of women, children and elderly waiting for a train, and less than two minutes later, he heard five to 10 booms. Mook tweeted, ""Innocent women & children were murdered here today."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the attack ""yet another horrific atrocity"" but stopped short of calling it a war crime without further investigation. ""Obviously the targeting of civilians would certainly be a war crime and we've already called a range of the actions we have seen to date a war crime, but we're going to be supporting efforts to investigate exactly what happened here,"" she said. Psaki also said that although the sanctions package announced Wednesday was ""augmented as a result of the atrocities"" seen in Bucha, the administration would assess how this new attack would impact additional sanctions. ""What we have done to date and will continue to do is look at, unfortunately, the continued atrocities that we're seeing in the country and assess how that's going to impact sanctions, consequences, and obviously additional security assistance,"" she said. ""And I'm certain given the video footage we have seen and on air waves across the world, and photos, that this will be a part of the discussion that our national security officials are having with their counterparts moving forward."" Earlier this week, large crowds of people were seen waiting on the platform to board trains at the Kramatorsk railway station as they fled the city in eastern Ukraine's disputed Donbas region. Since 2014, Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled two breakaway republics of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the Donbas. The separatists have been fighting alongside Russian troops to seize more territory there, after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Now, the Russian military is said to be refocusing its offensive in the Donbas as its troops withdraw from northern Ukraine.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday on Day 44: U.S. sending Patriot system to backfill Slovakia After repeated pleas from Ukraine for help defending itself against Russian air strikes, Slovakia is sending its sole S-300 surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine, it announced Friday, and at the same time, the U.S. announced it is moving one of its Patriot missile batteries to Slovakia to replace it. ""At my direction, and at the invitation of Slovakia, U.S. European Command will reposition one Patriot missile system, manned by U.S. service members, to Slovakia,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Friday. ""Their deployment length has not yet been fixed, as we continue to consult with the Slovakian government about more permanent air defense solutions."" There has been talk of such an arrangement since last month when Slovakian defense minister Jaroslav Nad’ said his country was ready to deliver its Soviet-era S-300 to Ukraine on condition Slovakia's air-defense capability be immediately backfilled. ""Should there be situation that we have a proper replacement or that we have a capability guaranteed for a certain period of time, then we will be willing to discuss the future of S-300 system,"" Slovakia's Prime Minister Eduard Heger said in a joint press conference with Austin on March 17. A U.S. military Patriot battery based in Germany was pre-positioned in Poland for this purpose, and that system will soon be moving to from Poland to Slovakia to replace its S-300, according to a senior U.S. defense official. The Slovak military has previously said it had about 45 missiles for its S-300 system. US 'not buying' Russia's denial of hitting railway station The Pentagon is ""not buying"" Russia's denial of responsibility, a senior U.S. defense official said. ""They originally claimed a successful strike and then only retracted it when there were reports of civilian casualties,"" the official said. ""It's our full expectation that this was a Russian strike -- we believe they used a short range ballistic missile, an SS-21."" Why might the Russians have targeted it? The official said the station is a major rail hub in a ""very strategic location,"" just south of the key city of Izyum. ""And we've been talking now for days and days about how Izyum was so important to them because it lies almost in the middle of the Donbas,"" the official said. Russian units 'eradicated' Some of the Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that have withdrawn back across the Belarusian and Russian borders have been essentially gutted from hard fighting in Ukraine, according to the senior defense official. ""We've seen indications of some units that are literally, for all intents and purposes, eradicated. There's just nothing left of the BTG except a handful of troops and maybe a small number of vehicles,"" the official said. In terms of total losses -- counting troops, tanks, aircraft and missile inventory – Russia has lost between 15-20% of the combat power it originally had arrayed against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, according to the official. Russia hoping to recruit 60,000 new troops Some of the Russian forces withdrawn from around Kyiv and elsewhere are now heading to the Russian cities of Belgorod and Valuyki, to the northwest of Donbas. But there are ""no indications"" that fresh troops are waiting there to join them. For now, degraded Russian BTGs, usually made up of roughly 800-1,000 troops, are ""exploring the option of"" consolidating, banding together remaining forces and supplies to form new units. ""It's really going to depend on the unit and how ready they are to get back into the fight, but we don't believe that in general this is going to be a speedy process for them given the kinds of casualties they've taken and the kind of damage that they've sustained to their to their units' readiness,"" the official said. Russia is also aiming to recruit upwards of 60,000 new troops, according to the official. ""They hope to get reinforced by new conscripts -- there's a whole new conscription schedule coming up here in May,"" the official said, adding that Russian conscripts serve for one year. ""It remains to be seen how successful they'll be on this, and where those reinforcements would go, how much training they would get,"" the official said. Additionally, the U.S. sees indications Russia has begun mobilizing reservists. After Russian BTGs rebuild, ""the most likely course of action would be for them to move immediately south right into the Donbas,"" the official said. The Pentagon estimates more than 40 Russian BTGs are already positioned in or near the Donbas region. The estimate was ""more than 30"" on Wednesday, meaning up to 10,000 more troops have arrived in recent days. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",,,,6
2022-04-09,https://abcnews.go.com/International/eyes-londongrad-uk-seeks-overhaul-ties-russian-oligarchs/story?id=83879996,"With eyes on 'Londongrad,' UK seeks to overhaul ties to Russian oligarchs","LONDON and WASHINGTON -- To Daria Kaleniuk, a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist, Russian President Vladimir Putin ""has two armies."" ""One is visible and obvious, it operates in Ukraine,"" Kaleniuk said Wednesday during a congressional hearing in Washington. ""But another army is invisible."" As Ukrainian forces fight to defend their country from Russia's protracted invasion, experts say a second battle is being waged in London. In the 22 years since Putin swept into power, many in Russia's billionaire class have gone abroad. Critics say in many cases it is to launder their money and reputation, finding a home in friendly real estate markets and cultural hubs. Now, the wealth they've amassed abroad has come under great scrutiny. According to the anti-corruption NGO Transparency International, at least £1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) worth of U.K. property is owned by Russians with links to the Kremlin or those suspected of financial crime. Due to the prevalence of opaque, offshore companies, the true scale of illicit wealth is likely far higher, hence the capital city's nickname in some quarters: ""Londongrad."" Of course, not every wealthy Russian in London is an oligarch or is linked to illicit money. And wealthy oligarchs in London are not uniform in how close they are to Putin and how they accumulated wealth, but many do have in common ties to the Russian state, according to Thomas Mayne, an expert in corruption studies and visiting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. ""It's a 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' type system,"" he told ABC News. ""You're allowed to become unfathomably wealthy. But, on the other hand, you will be required depending on who you are at various times to support whatever the Kremlin wants you to do."" Roman Abramovich, the now-sanctioned owner of Chelsea F.C., is perhaps the best known of these oligarchs. For almost two decades he enjoyed a privileged position in British society, investing a fortune in the London soccer club, ushering in an unprecedented era of success. But Abramovich has ""had a close relationship for decades"" with Putin, according to the British government, which has announced sanctions against a host of oligarchs. Abramovich has repeatedly disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Putin. He has not been sanctioned by the U.S. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office specifically mentioned Abramovich's dealings with Evraz PLC, a manufacturing company that is said to be supplying steel to make some Russian tanks used in the war with Ukraine. Abramovich has not commented on the sanctions since they were imposed. Abramovich has found himself in a bizarre position, and his role at the Ukraine-Russia negotiations -- where he suffered a suspected poisoning along with Ukrainian delegates -- has been the subject of a great deal of media intrigue. Another investor in U.K. culture is Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who was the top shareholder of yet another major soccer club, Arsenal, until 2018. He maintained his deep ties to the Premier League until just last month, when Liverpool-based soccer club Everton suspended multimillion-dollar sponsorship deals with Russian companies linked to the oligarch. He was sanctioned by the U.K. shortly after. The war in Ukraine has thrown London's role as a hub for Russian money into sharp focus, spurring a response unseen after previous Russian actions, including the poisonings of Russian defectors Sergei Skripal in 2018 and Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the Georgian war of 2008. The U.K. has now sanctioned over 1,000 individuals and businesses it says has links to the Russian state, according to the foreign office. The total asset value of the banks sanctioned is upwards of $650 billion, and the total wealth of oligarchs and their families sanctioned is upwards of $190 billion, according to official data. ""These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price,"" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in announcing the latest round of sanctions. ""Putin should be under no illusions -- we are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine. There will be no let-up."" In terms of tackling illicit wealth and corruption of Russian origin, the response has been ""robust"" and ""positive,"" Mayne said, though questions remain about the sheer depth of Russian influence in the U.K. ""It's perhaps surprising simply because of readiness in the last 20 years to accept this corrupt capital, this dirty cash,"" he said. ""You know, we've known for a long time Russia is a bad actor. But the big question is, you know, how did we let this happen in the first place?"" Experts say the assets that have surfaced likely reflect only a fraction of Russian wealth in the UK. As with elsewhere in the West, many oligarchs and other wealthy individuals from foreign countries have hidden their assets in a complex network of shell companies or under the names of their family members. Critics say future sanction packages should take these loopholes into account. ""In the U.K., sanctioning oligarchs should include visa bans for [the oligarchs themselves] … but also for their family members,"" Kaleniuk said during Wednesday's hearing. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), a network of investigators and journalists, found five properties linked to Usmanov in the U.K., a network of investigators and journalists, estimated to be worth more than $200 million. In announcing Usmanov's sanctioning last month, the U.K. government said two of Usmanov's large properties, Beechwood House, in London, and the 16th century Sutton Place estate, in Surrey, were among his frozen assets. But some of his wealth has proved more elusive -- with the OCCRP reporting large portions have been transferred into trusts, out of reach of the British government, with his family holding the beneficial rights. In 2020, a parliamentary committee released The Russia Report, which was commissioned following the poisoning of Skripal on the streets of Salisbury with a Novichok agent. Skripal and his daughter survived, though one other British national died and another became severely ill. The report, which was critical of government measures to combat Russian influence, said many Russians with links to Putin had integrated into London's ""business and social scene,"" some with connections to the ""highest levels"" of British politics. Lawyers, accountants and estate agents helped enable Russian influence, it added, describing it as the ""new normal."" A Golden visa scheme, guaranteeing residency for foreign investors, which reportedly helped 2,600 Russian investors in the U.K. since 2008, was only revoked on the eve of the Ukraine war. ""The Russia Report said that the security services have taken their eye off the ball when it came to the threat posed by Russia,"" Mayne told ABC News. ""And that has to be tied in with the obscene amounts of capital flowing into London from Russia, which they've been quite happy to accept, even though it's been dubiously acquired. Now we're only realizing that the folly of that position."" Downing Street officials hope the new wave of sanctions -- with potentially more to come -- as well as a new Economic Crime Bill, will follow through on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's warning issued at the outset of war: that those attempting to launder money in the U.K. have ""nowhere to hide."" The U.K. government hopes that targeting Russian oligarchs will have a dual effect: preventing funds from reaching the Kremlin to finance the war in Ukraine, and also curtailing the lavish lifestyles of Russian elites who have enjoyed what their riches can buy them in the West. When the U.K. announced its first seizure of a Russian owned yacht in British waters at the end of last month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it served as a ""a clear and stark warning to Putin and his cronies."" By their nature, sanctions are a ""freeze, not a seize,"" Mayne said, but the nature of Putin's government means that targeting individuals could potentially, as the government hopes, have an effect. The Economic Crime Bill will be paired with a National Security Agency tool, introduced in 2018 to tackle alleged dirty money, called ""Unexplained Wealth Orders."" When they have been used they have been high profile -- such as to target the wife of a disgraced Azeri banker who went on a major spending spree at Harrod's -- though so far only a handful have been meted out. In an extract from his new book entitled ""Butler to the World"" published in The Times of London, financial journalist Oliver Bullough said sanctions will likely be challenged in court. The bill ""contains nothing that will help to drive kleptocratic wealth out of this country,"" he wrote. ""This really comes back to the question of what London has become, and whether this will truly be a line in the sand,"" Mayne said. ""Do we just sit back and continue to be happy to accept this money? Or do we start to realize that corruption poses a national security threat as Biden as identified in the U.S.? My suspicion is that, because London is the world's largest financial center, we will go back to the way it was, with perhaps a bit of a caveat on specifically Russian cash.""",,,,29
2022-04-11,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-villagers-count-dead-weeks-confined-school-basement/story?id=83980961,Ukrainian villagers count the dead after weeks of being confined in a school basement,"The names of the dead are scrawled on the peeling wall of a school basement where residents say more than 300 people were trapped for weeks by Russian occupiers in Yahidne, a village north of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Halyna Tolochina (pictured above), a member of the village council, struggled to compose herself as she went through the list, scribbled in black on the plaster of a green door, in the gloomy warren where she said she and hundreds of others were confined. To the left of the door were scrawled the seven names of people killed by Russian soldiers. To the right were the 10 names of people who died because of the harsh conditions in the basement, she said. ""This old man died first,"" Tolochina said, pointing at the name of Muzyka D., for Dmytro Muzyka, whose death was recorded on March 9. ""He died in the big room, in this one."" She said Muzyka's body lay for a few days in a boiler room until, during a break in shelling, some people were allowed to take the dead to be buried in hastily dug graves in the village cemetery. Reuters spoke to seven residents of Yahidne who said that, in total, at least 20 people died or were killed during the Russian occupation. No official death toll has been released by Ukrainian authorities. Reuters was not able to verify independently the villagers' accounts. Reporters saw one freshly dug grave in a field by the village and two bodies wrapped in white plastic sheets. The Kremlin did not respond to requests for comment on the events in Yahidne. The accounts of what happened in the village add to growing testimony from Ukrainian civilians of suffering in the towns around Kyiv during the weeks of occupation by Russian forces following the invasion launched on Feb. 24. The last victim recorded on the walls of the basement, Nadiya Budchenko, died on March 28, Tolochina said, two days before Russian troops withdrew from the village when their drive toward the Ukrainian capital stalled. As well as those, mostly elderly, who died of exhaustion in the stifling, cramped conditions, Tolochina named others she said were killed by Russian soldiers, including Viktor Shevchenko and his brother Anatolii, known as Tolya. ""This one was buried in the yard,"" she said, pointing to the name Shevchenko V. ""And this one, they said he is there (buried in the village), somewhere,"" she said, pointing to the name Shevchenko T, whose body has not been recovered. Reuters interviewed six other residents, who corroborated Tolochina's account and described being held in the bare concrete rooms of the basement, with around 60 children, little food or water, no electricity and no toilets. Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of war crimes, following the unearthing of mass graves in towns around Kyiv, such as Bucha and Motyzhyn, and the discovery of bodies whose hands had been tied and shot in the head. Russia has denied allegations of extra-judicial killings, torture and abuse of civilians. The Kremlin has said its forces are not targeting civilians and accused Ukrainian authorities and the West of fabricating evidence. LOOTING Two of the villagers interviewed by Reuters said that at first some Russian troops, which arrived in early March, behaved well, offering to share their rations and expressing surprise at the village's prosperous appearance. But others began to loot immediately. ""They started looting, took everything they could grab,"" said 71-year old Petro Hlystun, who witnessed the scene. ""There was a light torch, a tablet computer my son brought from Poland. They took it all."" On March 5, the villagers said they were ordered into the school basement where they were to spend the next 25 days, with only brief breaks to relieve themselves or stretch their legs. The Russian soldiers told them the confinement was for their own protection, the villagers said. They described sharing buckets for a toilet and taking turns to sleep in the small, crowded rooms as there was not enough space for everyone to lie down. ""It was almost impossible to breathe,"" said Olha Meniaylo, an agronomist who said she was in the basement with her 32-year-old son, his wife and their children -- a 4-month-old baby boy and an 11-year-old girl. She said the Russian soldiers demanded a list of the people in the basement to organize food and she had tallied 360. Two other villagers said there were more than 300 people. ""For the elderly, it was difficult to stay there in the dark without fresh air, so it was mostly the old who died,"" she said. She said that the first burial -- a man killed by the soldiers and four elderly people who died in the basement -- took place on March 12. Russian soldiers allowed out some youths to dig shallow graves. ""As soon as they started digging, there was shelling,"" Meniaylo said. ""The people who were doing the digging had to lie on the dead bodies in the graves to protect themselves from the shelling. My husband was there."" A woman who had a cow was led under escort one morning to get some milk for the children. Others were let out occasionally according to the whims of the Russian soldiers. When they returned to their homes, villagers found everything from television sets to women's underwear had been taken. BODIES EXHUMED It was not until the Russians started their withdrawal on March 30 that those trapped in the basement ventured out permanently, said 64-year-old Tamara Klymchuk. ""We opened the door. We were getting out as though we had been born again,"" said Klymchuk. Yahidne, a small farming village of just five streets, had been a popular place for city people from nearby Chernihiv to take a holiday cottage. It is now a desolate ruin of burned-out houses scattered with cast-off military gear. An abandoned tank stands concealed across the road from the school. Ukrainian military, police and explosive disposal technicians sift through the wreckage, exhuming bodies and recovering unexploded ammunition. ""We had a very good life,"" said Klymchuk, whose son-in-law was 50-year-old Viktor Shevchenko, one of the two brothers who villagers say were killed by Russian soldiers. ""We never thought such grief would come upon us."" Viktor, she said, was shot on March 3. He had stayed behind to guard his house after sending his wife and two children to the school basement. Russian soldiers had told the villagers that Viktor had been wearing a military uniform and was armed with a shotgun. Klymchuk did not witness the killing herself but said she saw Viktor's body after sappers exhumed his body from a mass grave at her request once the town was retaken by Ukrainian forces. He was dressed in blue jeans and a black jacket, she said. ""They just shot him in the head.""",,,,19
2022-04-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-commander-depravity-brutality-pentagon-update-day-47/story?id=84018303,"New Russian commander, same 'depravity and brutality': Pentagon update Day 47","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 47: Russia's new invasion commander The U.S. assesses that Putin has appointed Gen. Alexander Dvornikov to lead the invasion effort. But the change in leadership can't erase the logistical and operational problems that have plagued Russian forces, according to the senior U.S. defense official. ""They have high challenges to surmount, and the choice of a general doesn't mean that they're poised for greater success,"" the official said. Dvornikov previously led Russian forces in the south of Ukraine. ""He was the commander of the southern military district. And in the early days and weeks of the conflict, the Russians did achieve more success in the south than they achieved certainly in the north. I have no idea that was a factor in his selection,"" the official said. The official noted that Russian efforts in the south are now largely stalled, with no progress against Mariupol since last week, and no success advancing on Mykolayiv. ""If Mr. Putin's decision to pick Dvornikov was because he had some success, it wasn't that much,"" the official said. New commander, same 'depravity and brutality' The official said it is unclear how Dvornikov's selection could affect the fighting, but said a pattern of brutality remains a constant. ""What is clear is that the Russians continue to sink to new lows of depravity and brutality, as we saw with the missile strike on the train station last week,"" the official said. The death and destruction in Mariupol is also a concern. ""We're all bracing for when the rest of the world gets to see what happens in Mariupol, what has happened. I think we're certainly bracing ourselves here for some for some potentially really, really horrible outcomes,"" the official said. Russians moving troops and supplies toward Donbas Some of the Russian units that withdrew from the northern Ukraine area are starting to move east toward the Russian cities of Belgorod and Valuyki. A long convoy of Russian vehicles is beginning to head south to Donbas from that area. ""We believe that this line of vehicles that we talked about that are north of Izium came out of the Belgorod/Valuyki region, from there to the south,"" the official said. Last week, the official said the Pentagon assessed Russia would use that region to refit and resupply its battalion tactical groups (BTGs) that have been worn down by hard fighting near Kyiv and other areas of Ukraine. Some Russian units are too gutted to fight. ""At least in the grouping that we're aware of, it's not an insignificant number of their BTGs are combat ineffective. And what does that mean? It means a lot of things. It can mean that they don't have the manpower that they need to effectively conduct a mission, or it could be ammunition and supply. It could be vehicles, depending on what the BTG does -- not all of them are just infantry,"" the official said. The Pentagon believes the convoy is still north of Izyim and is an effort to reenforce and resupply their forces in Donbas with command and control elements, armored vehicles, and possibly helicopter and infantry support. Artillery is also a part of the reinforcement effort. ""We've seen evidence that the Russians are beginning to reinforce some of their positions southwest of Donetsk. They're doing that largely with artillery units,"" the official said. Military aid flowing to Ukraine by air and land Eight to 10 flights per day are bringing military supplies into the region, and ""near constant convoys on the ground"" are flowing materiel into Ukraine, the official said. U.S. intelligence assisting Ukraine In addition to providing support in the form of missiles, drones and small arms, the U.S. is also giving intel to assist Ukraine in the fight. ""We are providing good intelligence to the Ukrainians to help them with their self-defense,"" the official said. No evidence Russia took out Slovakian S-300 system in Ukraine While the Pentagon assesses Russia damaged airport infrastructure with an airstrike Sunday, there is no indication that any S-300 surface-to-air systems were destroyed, as Russia has claimed. ""We have no evidence to conclude that they destroyed an S-300 system and we have no evidence to conclude that it was in fact the Slovakian one,"" the official said. Slovakia recently gave its sole S-300 battery to Ukraine. US considering training more Ukrainians on new weapons A small group of Ukrainian troops in the U.S. for planned military training in the U.S. when Russia invaded their country just returned home Sunday. The Pentagon took advantage of their presence to train them on the explosive Switchblade drones the U.S. is sending to aid Ukraine. The official on Monday said the U.S. is looking into training more Ukrainians, possibly in the States. ""It kind of follows that the Ukrainians are busy right now and that they obviously will want as many hands on deck there ... to fight this war. But there's been no policy decision that I'm aware of that would prevent them from coming to the United States,"" the official said. But the Pentagon is considering several possibilities. ""As for additional training on systems like the Switchblade, we are reviewing and thinking about and considering a number of different options for how we could manage to get more Ukrainians trained on that system,"" the official said. ""It's a small number of systems as you know, but it's a new system that they're not familiar with.""",,,,6
2022-04-11,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-preparing-attack-east-russian-forces-zelenskyy/story?id=84008413,"Ukraine is 'preparing' for attack in the east by Russian forces, Zelenskyy says","LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that an attack from Russian forces in the east is looming. But he said Ukrainian troops are ready. ""Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They can use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address late Sunday. ""But we are preparing for their actions. We will respond. We will be even more active in providing Ukraine with weapons. We will be more active in the international arena. We will be even more active in the information field."" After Russian forces invaded Ukraine from the north, east and south on Feb. 24, they quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv, but ultimately failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and other major cities in the north. Russian forces were met with strong resistance from Ukrainian troops, despite weeks of relentless bombardment that decimated entire neighborhoods and claimed civilian lives. The Russian military announced on March 29 it would scale down activities in the north around Kyiv and Chernihiv and instead focus its efforts on the ""liberation"" of the contested Donbas region in the east, which is home to a mostly Russian-speaking population. Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled two breakaway republics of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Donbas since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. The Russian troops that have retreated from northern and northeastern Ukraine in recent days are now resting and resupplying in neighboring Belarus and Russia, according to observers, who noted it could take weeks before those troops are redployed for a fresh attack in the east. ""At least some of these forces will be transferred to East Ukraine to fight in the Donbas,"" the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update on April 8. ""Many of these forces will require significant replenishment before being ready to deploy further east with any mass redeployment from the north likely to take at least a week minimum."" Nevertheless, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that ""this is a crucial phase of the war."" ""In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea,"" Stoltenberg said at a press conference on April 5. Satellite images collected on April 8 by Maxar Technologies show a large military convoy of hundreds of vehicles, including tanks, that extends for at least 8 miles, moving south through the eastern Ukrainian town of Velykyi Burluk, about 55 miles east of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and some 65 miles from the border with Russia. Ukrainian authorities have warned citizens in the east that this is their last chance to flee, as Russian forces are expected to push south from Kharkiv and north from Donetsk in an attempt to encircle the battle-hardened Ukrainain troops in Donbas. In an interview with The Associated Press published Saturday, Zelenskyy said his country holds a strong position in the east and at the negotiation table because it maintains control of the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has been under Russian bombardment for more than a month. Although Russian forces have failed to capture the strategic port to secure a coastal corridor to Crimea, artillery and air raids have largely reduced Mariupol to rubble and killed thousands of residents, according to local officials. ""Mariupol is the heart of this war today,"" Zelenskyy told the AP. ""The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position in the east of the country."" In his address on Sunday night, Zelenskyy said this coming ""week will be no less important than"" the previous ones. ""It will be just as tense and even more responsible. Russia will be even more afraid. Afraid to lose,"" he said. ""I will continue to address the parliaments and nations of the world. We will meet our partners, leaders of other states in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. We will attract even more funds and resources to help Ukraine.",,,,28
2022-04-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-mask-chemical-weapons-riot-control-agents-pentagon/story?id=84039751,Russia could mask chemical weapons with riot control agents: Pentagon update Day 48,"The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to fight back. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday on Day 48: Russia could use riot control agents to mask chemical weapons A defense official said the U.S. cannot confirm whether Russia has used any chemical weapons in Mariupol or elsewhere in Ukraine, but the Defense Department has seen evidence Russia could consider disguising use of chemical weapons by making them look like more benign riot-control agents. ""In the past we've had indications that that could be one thing that the Russians look at, is the potential mixing of agents with the with the idea that they could disguise a more serious attack by using the vehicle and the techniques of riot control agents,"" the official said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby put out a similar statement Monday night addressing social media reports claiming Russia used a chemical weapon in Mariupol. ""These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia's potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine."" Kirby, like the official on Tuesday, emphasized the U.S. cannot confirm the allegations. On Tuesday, Kirby told reporters the U.S. is looking into the matter. ""We're obviously taking it seriously and we're monitoring it,"" Kirby said. ""We're trying to do the best we can to figure out what, if anything, happened."" Russian convoy creeping south The Russian convoy approaching Izuim is still roughly 40 miles to the north of the key Ukrainian city, according to the official. ""We do assess that it's moving, but not at breakneck speed,"" the official said. While the Pentagon doesn't have a pristine view of what capabilities make up the convoy, it seems to be support-heavy. ""It includes some command and control elements, some enablers, and we think it's also intended for resupply, perhaps an effort to amend their poor performance in logistics and sustainment in the north,"" the official said. Heavy fighting continues to the south of Izuim, with Russian forces about 12 miles from the city. Mariupol stands While Russian forces have devastated the coastal city of Mariupol with long-range strikes and have cut off essential supplies to the populace, Ukrainians continue to defend it. ""You've seen the devastation that Russian airstrikes have wrought on Mariupol in the city, but our assessment is that the Ukrainians are are still fighting for it,"" Kirby said. Mariupol is strategically important for both the Ukrainians and Russians. ""It's obvious that the Russians want Mariupol because of its strategic location there at the south of that Donbas area and right on the Sea of Azov,"" Kirby said. ""It's a major, important city... it would provide them unfettered and unhindered land access between the Donbas and Crimea."" Meanwhile, Ukraine has its own clear incentives to keep Mariupol. ""It also has great significance to the Ukrainian people because of what it represents to their economic life, because it is their city and it's part of their country,"" Kirby said. ""They haven't given up on it, and we're not giving up on them, either."" Military aid for Ukraine The $800 million military aid package for Ukraine authorized by President Joe Biden last month has mostly been delivered, and will be completed in the coming days, according to the official. ""Yesterday, two U.S. flights arrived in the region with everything from small-arms ammunition, machine guns, body armor, grenades and other explosives,"" the official said. So far, the U.S. has sent 19 out of an expected 20 flights needed to deliver the $800 million package. While U.S. officials have said Russia has not hit support shipments coming over the border, there is an effort more broadly to disrupt Ukrainian forces' ability to resupply themselves. ""They certainly have shown an interest in trying to hit logistics and sustainment for the Ukrainians, and they have certainly tried to go after Ukrainian air defense as well,"" the official said.",,,,6
2022-04-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-blames-putins-price-hike-gas-prices-depend/story?id=84034646,"Biden blames 'Putin's price hike,' says gas prices shouldn't depend on his committing 'genocide'","President Joe Biden traveled to Iowa on Tuesday for his first time as president to announce new efforts to bring down gas prices as the administration faces an 8.5% jump in the consumer price index compared to a year ago, which it attributes mostly to what he called ""Putin's Price Hike."" ""Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should on hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide a half a world away,"" Biden said, appearing to ad lib that Russia's actions in Ukraine amount to ""genocide"" for the first time. The U.S. government has an internal process for designating whether genocide has occurred, and other Western nations haven't made the determination. Biden was asked directly last week if he thought the atrocities in Bucha were genocide, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed, but responded at that time, ""No, I think it is a war crime."" But on Tuesday, he said: ""Yes, I called it genocide. Because it has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian. And the evidence is mounting."" The president also offered brief remarks on the subway shooting in New York City from Menlo, Iowa, before pivoting to his plan to ease gas prices amid intensifying inflation. The March CPI report released Tuesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed inflation is at its highest point in the U.S. in more than 40 years as rising prices have an impact on consumers worldwide. Prices were up 1.2% compared to just a month ago, the report said, raising concerns that, if the Federal Reserve gets more aggressive in raising interest rates to temper inflation, that might trigger a recession. ""Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world,"" Biden said. ""So everything is going up. We saw it in today's inflation data. Seventy percent of the increase in prices in March came from Putin's price hike in gasoline."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki tried to preemptively cushion the blow of the report numbers on Monday. She said the White House expected a large difference between core and headline inflation, pointing to the price of gas as the main reason for the discrepancy. ""Just as an example, since President Putin's military buildup in January, average gas prices up more than 80 cents. Most of the increase occurred in March and gas prices, at times, prices were up more than a dollar above pre-invasion level. That roughly 25% increase in prices will drive tomorrow's inflation rating,"" Psaki said. To address those prices, Biden announced Tuesday he issuing a temporary, emergency waiver for the summer to allow the sale of ""E-15"" -- a blend of gas with 15% ethanol, rather than the usual 10%, which the White House says will bring down gas prices by 10 cents a gallon. Usually, E-15 is not sold in the summer because it's believed to add to smog. ""The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to issue an emergency waiver to allow E15 gasoline that uses more ethanol from homegrown crops to be sold across the United States this summer in order to increase fuel supply,"" Biden said. ""It's not going to solve all our problems. But it's going to help some people and I'm committed to do whatever I can to help. Even if it's an extra buck or two in the pockets."" But the move will have a limited impact: Only 2% of gas stations around the country carry E-15, mostly in the Midwest. The White House countered a question from ABC News on whether the impact would be insignificant for Americans. ""Ultimately this is about giving Americans more options and more flexibility,"" a White House official said ahead of the president's remarks. ""President Biden knows that every cent matters and families will see savings even after taking into consideration the difference in energy efficiency."" Inflation and even gas prices have been on the rise even before the invasion of Ukraine. A new ABC News/Ipsos poll found Americans are more likely to place a ""great deal"" or a ""good amount"" of the blame for the price increases on Democratic Party policies (52%) and Biden (51%) than on Republican Party policies (33%) and former President Donald Trump (24%). A strong majority of Americans (68%) also disapproves of the way Biden is handling gas prices. Biden's trip to Iowa comes with the midterm elections seven months away. It's a state he spent a lot of time in amid the 2020 campaign, but ultimately lost to former President Donald Trump by nine points. While his remarks are set to focus on his administration's actions to lower gas prices and the bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year, Biden might feel obligated to address Tuesday's report, which showed increases in prices for gasoline, rent and food were the largest contributors to inflation for Americans. Gasoline prices rose 18.3% compared to a month ago and were a major contributor to inflation; other energy prices also increased. Food prices increased by 1% and the food at home prices by 1.5%. Aside from food and energy, rent was the biggest factor in the price increases. Airline fares, household furnishings and operations, medical care and motor vehicle insurance also contributed to inflation. Used cars and trucks fell 3.8% compared to a month ago. The report, though in line with expectations, does nothing to temper concerns that the Federal Reserve has a tough job ahead of it in cooling this inflation without sparking a recession.

2022-04-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/humanitarian-corridors-work-offer-lifeline-besieged-ukrainians/story?id=84011869,How humanitarian corridors work to offer lifeline to besieged Ukrainians,"For tens of thousands of civilians trapped in active combat zones in Ukraine, the establishment of humanitarian corridors could mean the difference between living and dying, experts said. At least nine humanitarian corridors are expected to open in war-torn areas of eastern Ukraine this week to allow civilians to escape heavy fighting, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. More than 4,354 people used the opened humanitarian corridors on Monday to evacuate via buses and private cars, according to Vereshchuk. She said the same safe passages will be open on Tuesday. But the designated routes out of besieged towns such as Mariupol in southeast Ukraine and areas of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine can be dangerous if not done with precision and complete transparency, Crystal Wells, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told ABC News. “We see humanitarian corridors, that we refer to as safe passages, as really a desperate measure in dire times,"" Wells said. Humanitarian corridors are routes for civilians to escape from the most dangerous war zones. The safe passages require Russian and Ukrainian leaders to agree on specific routes and a ceasefire span of time along those thoroughfares to allow civilians a window of opportunity to get out of the crossfire. Safe passageways during wars date back to World War II, when routes were established to transport 10,000 children from Nazi-controlled countries in humanitarian rescues dubbed ""kindertransports."" The Geneva Conventions in 1949 also established rules to ensure civilians had access to humanitarian supplies, including food and medicine, during war. ""It’s important, first of all, to remember that civilians are actually protected under international humanitarian law. Those are the laws that govern armed conflict,"" Wells said. ""And civilians should be protected from hostilities whether they’re in their homes, in a hospital, in a school or in a so-called humanitarian corridor."" But Wells said that some humanitarian routes opened in Ukraine had to quickly be closed or not used at all because hostilities resumed. ""It’s not like all of a sudden a humanitarian corridors comes in and it's a magic wand to ending civilian suffering,"" Wells said. “It's so important that these are agreed on not just in principle but in concrete terms so that it’s not only the people sitting in capital cities who agree. It needs to come down to actionable, concrete, logistical details, and it has to be communicated down the chain of command to the militaries on the ground for these to work safely."" She said if details of a humanitarian corridor, including the precise routes and ceasefire times, are not conveyed to frontline troops, it could create a dangerous -- and deadly -- situation. “It's not just about the safety of our teams, but it's to not also lead people or accompany people into something where they could be in harm's way,"" Wells said. In the absence of humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian civilians have risked their lives trying to flee battle zones on their own. Many have been killed. “What's been happening in cities like Mariupol is that in the absence of these concrete agreements, you have civilians leaving, but they’re doing so in a very ad hoc way. They’re making a life-and-death decision to go, and there’s not a ceasefire agreement in place and there’s not specifics about routes and the times and all of that. So, it’s very risky for people."" Much of the focus for humanitarian agencies in recent days has been on Mariupol, a port city of nearly 400,000 people that has been under siege since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko told the Associated Press by telephone Monday that the death toll in his city has surpassed 10,000 and could reach double that as attacks continue. Boychenko also alleged Russian forces have brought mobile crematoriums to Mariupol to collect and incinerate civilian bodies in an attempt to cover up evidence of war crimes. Russia has denied committing atrocities in Ukraine and claims it is not targeting civilians. Vereshchuk said in a statement posted on social media Monday that humanitarian evacuation routes were agreed upon for those traveling by private cars from Mariupol. Wells estimated that more than 100,000 civilians remain in Mariupol. ""For us, Mariupol really remains very much a focus and a priority,"" Wells said. ""That’s a city that’s been for weeks now without any humanitarian aid. They’ve been for weeks now without really any proper safe passage for civilians out of the city."" She said ICRC teams have been trying for weeks to deliver humanitarian aid to Mariupol without success. ""We tried again a couple of Fridays ago to access Mariupol, and our teams spent five days and five nights on the road trying to get into the city, and security conditions didn’t allow it,"" Wells said. Wells said the ICRC has successfully used designated safe passages to get civilians out of the hard-hit town of Sumy in northeast Ukraine and between the Russian-controlled city Berdyansk to safety in Zaporizhzhia, a roughly 120-mile journey. She said an unarmed ICRC convoy from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia last week included buses and Red Cross land cruisers clearly marked with the agency's emblem at the front and rear of the caravan. Wells said many of the civilians who joined the convoy were fleeing Mariupol. ""We had seven buses with seven volunteer bus drivers, and that would allow about 350 people to board,"" Wells said. ""But then we had private cars starting to join the convoy from Berdyansk all the way to Zaporizhzhia. By the end of that convoy to Zaporizhzhia, they estimated there were about 100 civilian cars, which got us up to about 1,000 people."" Wells said the evacuation from Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia took two days. She said a similar mission in Mariupol would likely take longer. ""To think of doing it for 100,000 people, we would really need agreements to hold for not just hours, but days,"" Wells said. No matter how much time is granted to the humanitarian corridors, Wells said some civilians are bound to get left behind. ""What about the elderly? What about people with disabilities? Not everyone is able-bodied to get into their own car or board a bus and leave,"" Wells said. ""So, that’s where it’s also important that aid needs to be brought into these places as well and that civilians still have to be protected and respected from hostilities.""",,,,15
2022-04-13,https://abcnews.go.com/International/tens-thousands-feared-dead-mariupol-russia-renews-assault/story?id=84032405,Tens of thousands feared dead in Mariupol as Russia renews assault in eastern Ukraine,"LONDON -- Tens of thousands of civilians could be dead in Mariupol, the city's mayor said, as analysts warn that Russia is regrouping for a renewed assault on eastern Ukraine. The streets in Mariupol are “carpeted” with bodies, Vadym Boychenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said Monday. While there is no confirmed number of casualties, the mayor suggested the number of dead could be well over 10,000 in the coastal town, the site of some of the worst bombardment since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. ""If it is possible to mention such a terrifying number, then it is above 10,000. According to our estimates, it is 20,000 plus, unfortunately,” Boychenko said in an interview with the Associated Press. Russian airstrikes have battered the southeastern city over the past few weeks targeting all kinds of buildings, including a theatre housing those seeking refuge, a maternity hospital and an art school. Officials say that over 80 percent of the city is destroyed. With the city almost completely cut off from the outside world, it has been difficult for the authorities to verify atrocities alleged to have been committed on the ground, including claims made Monday by the Azov battalion, a far-right group now part of the Ukrainian National Guard, that Russia may have used chemical weapons against the Ukrainian forces in the city. The claims could not be independently verified by ABC News. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office and the country's ministry of defense said they are investigating the claims. “We are currently confirming this information, trying to understand what it was. According to preliminary information, we can say that it is possible– that it was, rather, a phosphorous munition. Official information will be finalized later,"" Hanna Maliar, Deputy Minister of Defence, said during a national news broadcast. A spokesman for Russian-backed separatists, Eduard Basurin, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Tuesday that they ""haven't used any chemical weapons in Mariupol."" But on the eve of the alleged attack, Basurin made the case on Russian TV that his forces should use chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops to ""smoke them out."" Late on Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby issued a statement saying that the use of a substance cannot be confirmed, but expressed concerns about Russia’s potential use of “riot control agents including tear gas mixed with chemical agents.” “We are aware of social media reports which claim Russian forces deployed a potential chemical munition in Mariupol, Ukraine. We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely. These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,” the statement reads. Britain's armed forces minister said on Tuesday that should Russia resort to the use of chemical weapons in the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, ""all possible options are on the table in terms of how the West might respond” in response to the speculation, saying the reports had not been verified. Whether or not phosphorous is considered a chemical weapon is a topic of debate among militaries and governments. Although phosphorus is not classified as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Geneva Convention forbids its use as an incendiary weapon in civilian areas. Amidst the reports of Russia regrouping behind its own borders, the British Ministry of Defense warned today that the fighting is set to intensify over the next two-three weeks with a renewed assault. “Fighting in eastern Ukraine will intensify over the next two to three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there,” the U.K.'s ministry of defense stated in a tweet. “Russian attacks remain focused on Ukrainian positions near Donetsk and Luhansk with further fighting around Kherson and Mykolaiv and a renewed push towards Kramatorsk. Russian forces continue to withdraw from Belarus in order to redeploy in support of operations in eastern Ukraine,"" the post added.",,,,28

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby walked reporters through the aid package in an afternoon press briefing, saying it includes ""new capabilities that we have not provided to Ukraine."" ""We committed from the very beginning even before the invasion, to helping Ukraine be able to defend itself. This is a piece of that. And this is representative of the kinds of capabilities that the Ukrainians themselves have asked for and said they need as this fighting now gets focused on the eastern part of the country,"" he said. ""How that gets interpreted by the Russians. you can ask Mr. Putin and the Kremlin,"" Kirby added. Biden announced the $800 million package in an earlier written statement. He also noted that Russia is preparing to focus its invasion in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine but affirmed the U.S. would continue to ""provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself."" ""This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine. These new capabilities include artillery systems, artillery rounds, and armored personnel carriers,"" Biden said. ""I have also approved the transfer of additional helicopters. In addition, we continue to facilitate the transfer of significant capabilities from our Allies and partners around the world,"" Biden added. According to the Pentagon, the list of new military hardware includes 155mm howitzer artillery -- a specific request from Ukraine -- 200 M-113 armored personnel carriers, 100 armored humvees, 300 Switchblade drones, and 11 MI-17 helicopters. The U.S. had given Ukraine five helicopters as part of an earlier shipment. ""And again, the Ukrainians have made it clear that in this fight that's coming, artillery is a critical need -- not just the artillery piece itself, but the rounds that go with it,"" Kirby said following Biden's announcement. ""You can see, there's 40,000 rounds that are going on with this -- and we will be in an iterative conversation with them going forward and if they need additional artillery rounds, clearly the United States will do what we can to fill those needs."" Reiterating the U.S. position not to send U.S. forces to fight in Ukraine, Kirby told reporters, ""There will be no U.S. pilots flying the helicopters into Ukraine."" ""Unmanned coastal defense vessels"" were also included on the lengthy list of equipment, some of which will require specific training. The additional aid comes after Biden called Russia's action's in Ukraine ""genocide"" for the first time and as Zelenskyy warns Putin could use chemical weapons in Ukraine. The U.S. has now given Ukraine nearly $3 billion in security assistance. ABC News' Matt Seyler contributed to this story.",,,,9
2022-04-14,https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/gm-ceo-mary-barra-talks-newest-electric-vehicle/story?id=84087631,"GM CEO Mary Barra talks newest electric vehicle, inflation and competition with Tesla","General Motors CEO Mary Barra sat down exclusively with ABC News’ Rebecca Jarvis to introduce the company's newest electric vehicle, the Cadillac LYRIQ, and take the first ride. In 2021, the company announced that it is committed to selling only all-electric vehicles by 2035. “I think it gets into the power of General Motors brands,” said Barra. “First of all, we're a full line manufacturer. We have four brands and we have vehicles at every price.” Due in part to the severe sanctions on Russia, combined with record-high inflation caused by residual economic effects from the pandemic, gas prices reached a record high in the U.S. On March 13 the average U.S. price of regular-grade gas was $4.43 -- which exceeds the prior all-time high by 32 cents set in July 2008, according to AAA. Although prices have since declined, Barra said that the high price tag for gas could have piqued newfound interest in electric vehicles. “I definitely think there's going to be more interest as people see gas prices… We all are wondering what the situation is there,” said Barra. In 2022, General Motors expects to unveil two additional electric vehicles -- both under $40,000. Barra said the next challenge is to expand the accessibility of charging stations. “It's going to be many solutions. Right now, there's a lot of startups working in this space, and we're partnering with them,” said Barra. “We have committed to invest three quarters of a billion dollars in chargers working with other companies, as well as our dealers, to find the right locations in different cities to make sure that we have coverage.” Barra said that despite the current inflation consumers face and uncertainty around how the overall economy will look in the future, the demand for electric vehicles remains high and she’s confident General Motors’ pricing will remain competitive. “What we see at General Motors is we do see a strong pricing environment and we see strong demand for our vehicles overall,” said Barra. “Right now, we're in a unique situation because of the pandemic and then because of the semiconductor shortage, we haven't been able to make as many vehicles. So we have a lot of pent up demand.” Elon Musk’s Tesla currently dominates the U.S. electric vehicle market, owning 60% of shares in the space, Experian Automotive reported. Barra said the new version of the American classic is set to take Tesla head-on. “If you think about it right now, [electric vehicle] sales are very low. They're in single digits. By 2025, and then beyond, we want to start dramatically growing shares,” said Barra. “We sell more vehicles than anyone else does with the brands, and we have loyal consumers, so I'm really excited about our future.”",,,,7
2022-04-14,https://abcnews.go.com/International/educational-enormous-ukrainian-refugees-fled-moldova/story?id=84070104,Educational needs 'enormous' for Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Moldova,"Amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis that has unfolded in the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, education advocates are working to ensure Ukraine's displaced children are not forgotten. More than 4.6 million people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries since the invasion began, according to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They have primarily fled to Poland, as well as Romania, Hungary, Russia and Moldova, which, like Ukraine, declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Though one of the poorest countries in Europe, Moldova has welcomed the equivalent of 15% of its population in a matter of weeks, with over 415,000 fleeing there from Ukraine, according to the U.N. Many refugees have moved on to other European countries, though about 100,000 remain in the country currently, according to Education Cannot Wait, the United Nation’s global fund for education in emergencies. Of those, 50,000 are school-aged children. Only 1,800 of those children are currently enrolled in school in Moldova, the organization said. As Moldova welcomes refugees, the educational needs are ""enormous"" and its educational capacity is ""overstretched"" and ""strained,"" Yasmine Sherif, director of Education Cannot Wait, told ABC News. The needs, she said, include teachers who can not only meet the demand, but also address language barriers -- the official language of Moldova is Romanian, while most people in Ukraine speak Ukrainian. Teachers who are trained to address the mental health needs of the refugees, who may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, are another. Sherif, who visited Moldova this week to visit schools and talk with local officials and refugees, recalled meeting a mother who fled from Odessa with her two daughters. ""The mother broke down crying, and her daughters seemed also very traumatized from the experience,"" she said. ""On top of her mind is not her own suffering but how she can ensure that her daughters feel safe and that they can continue their schooling."" Ukraine's Ministry of Education and Science has coordinated online lessons, though comprehensive remote learning for refugees is also challenging due to damaged infrastructure across Ukraine and impacts on teachers, Sherif said. More than 900 education facilities in Ukraine have been destroyed or damaged during the fighting, according to Education Cannot Wait. The demands on Moldova may only continue to grow, with a second wave of refugees possible as the conflict continues, Sherif said. Education Cannot Wait announced on Wednesday a $1.5 million grant to support the educational response to the refugee crisis in Moldova that will be delivered in partnership with the government of Moldova, which has developed a framework for the schooling of refugees, including those who have applied for asylum. Sherif said the funding could go toward rehabilitating educational facilities and training teachers who speak Ukrainian, including refugees. Amid the refugee crisis, Theirworld, a global children’s education charity, said it plans to announce additional funding to ""support refugee education projects in the coming weeks, harnessing its experiences from other emergencies, and campaigning to ensure donors invest 10% of the humanitarian response funding into education,"" the organization's president, Justin van Fleet, said in a statement. UNICEF is also working to help refugees ""reclaim their learning experience, in a safe and supportive environment, nurturing their resilience against the traumas of war,"" UNICEF Representative to Moldova Maha Damaj said in a statement. The organization has set up support centers for families along refugee transit routes that provide services, including psychological counseling and support and child-friendly spaces. Disruption to education can have lasting impacts, with girls especially vulnerable to human trafficking, Sherif said. ""Education gives you a chance as a girl to be empowered, and for both girls and boys, it offers a very protective environment,"" she said. It also provides the mental health and social services crucial for children, especially those who are refugees. ""Without that, it's very difficult to start anew,"" Sherif said.",,,,2
2022-04-14,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainians-claim-russian-warship-damaged-missile-strike/story?id=84079250,Russian warship sinks after Ukraine claims it struck ship with missiles,"The Russian Defense Ministry announced on Thursday that its Black Sea Fleet flagship vessel, Moskva, sunk after losing its stability when it was towed to a port. Russia said the ship sustained damages during a fire started by the detonation of ammunition. Ukrainian government officials, on Wednesday, claimed its armed forces fired missiles that struck the vessel, causing damage. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych and Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs, said there was an explosion and that the cruiser is on fire. The governor of Odessa Maksym Marchenko claimed on Telegram that two anti-ship cruise missiles struck the cruiser in the Black Sea, causing ""very serious damage."" Russia earlier said the ship was seriously damaged, but did not confirm that was due to Ukrainian strikes. Russia claimed a fire abroad the ship forced all 510 members of the crew to evacuate. ""As a result of a fire, ammunition has detonated on the Moskva missile cruiser. The ship was seriously damaged. The crew was completely evacuated,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. ""The cause of the fire is under investigation,"" the statement said. Russia later said the fire aboard the ship was contained and that the Moskva will be towed to a port. Russia's Defense Ministry said the main missile weapons on board were not damaged, but made no mention of missile strikes in its statement. A senior U.S. defense official told reporters the U.S. assesses that the crew of the Moskva is still battling a fire aboard the ship. About a half-dozen other ships that had been close to the Moskva have now moved further away from the coast into the Black Sea, the official also said. The Pentagon said it can not confirm or deny whether the ship was hit by a missile. ""We cannot confirm the Ukrainian reports that it was hit by a missile but we are also not in a position to refute that it could have been a Ukrainian missile which struck the ship,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters at a briefing on Thursday. Noting that the U.S. does not have perfect visibility into the situation, Kirby said, ""we do believe that there was a significant explosion on this cruiser the Moskva of a Slava class of cruisers in the Russian Navy. We do believe that that that explosion caused a significant fire, which as of this morning was still raging aboard the ship."" Kirby said ""at least some"" of the Moskva's crew had evacuated to other Russian Navy ships but he couldn't say it was the entire crew. He added that the U.S. doesn't have ""a better, clearer sense of the damage done"" and whether the ship could be repaired. In an interview on MSNBC Thursday, Kirby said there wasn't enough information to determine if the explosion was in fact caused by a Ukrainian missile strike, though it can't be ruled out. Despite the Russian Defense Ministry claiming the ship was being towed, Kirby said it was under its own power and looked to be headed east toward Sevastopol in Crimea. ""She was operating about 60 miles or so south of Odessa and we know she suffered an explosion,"" Kirby said on MSNBC. ""It looks like from the images that we've been able to look at it looks like there's a pretty sizable explosion too."" Kirby later told reporters the U.S.'s assessment is now more uncertain that was now the case. “While we had assessed that the ship was underway under its own power, we are no longer able to make that certainty today, this afternoon,” he said. “We're not exactly sure that the ship is actually still able to make its own way. Kirby told reporters that so far Russia’s Navy has been limited to launching cruise missile strikes inside Ukraine and resupply efforts. “It remains to be seen exactly what the major impact is going to be,” said Kirby. On CNN, Kirby said the U.S. is unaware what caused at least one explosion abroad the ship, describing the explosion as ""a fairly major one at that, that has caused extensive damage to the ship."" -ABC News' Fidel Pavlenko, Luis Martinez, Oleksiy Pshemyskyi and Yulia Drozd contributed to this report",,,,18
2022-04-17,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mariupol-besieged-fallen-ukrainian-pm/story?id=84122574,Mariupol besieged but not fallen: Ukrainian PM,"Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Sunday in an exclusive interview with ABC ""This Week"" that the besieged city of Mariupol has not yet fallen despite Russian demands that Ukrainians surrender. ""There [are] still our military forces, our soldiers, so they will fight until the end,"" Shmyhal told ""This Week"" Anchor George Stephanopoulos. Mariupol is a strategic city for Russia because it would allow Russian forces in the south to connect with troops in the Donbas region. It would also give Russia a key port. Shmyhal said even though the city remains in Ukrainian control, its residents are suffering. ""They have no water, no food, no heat, no electricity,"" Shmyhal said. ""They ask all of our partners to support and help stop this humanitarian catastrophe."" During a virtual address overnight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia's actions in Mariupol were ""just inhuman."" ""Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,"" Zelenskyy said. The Russian Defense Ministry warned that the military would kill any remaining Ukrainian fighters who did not surrender before the overnight deadline. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that Russia is regrouping and repositioning forces to the east, warning that ""a big Russian offensive"" is expected in the Donbas region in southeastern Ukraine. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week. Nehammer was the first European leader to do so since Russia invaded Ukraine. Stephanopoulos asked Shmyhal about the Austrian chancellor's assessment that Putin believes he is winning the war. ""Has the tide turned?"" he asked. Shmyhal replied that only one big city ""is under control of Russian military forces. But all of the rest of the cities are under Ukrainian control."" On Saturday, Russia continued attacks across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv. The Ukrainian president's office reported missile strikes and shelling in eight regions across the country. Stephanopoulos asked Shmyhal if peace talks between Ukraine and Russia have reached a dead end. Shmyhal said Ukraine was open to diplomacy, but if Russia does not want to negotiate, Ukraine will continue to fight. ""We will not surrender; we will not leave our country, our families, our land,"" Shmyhal said. ""So we will fight absolutely to the end, to win in this war."" President Joe Biden authorized $800 million more in military aid last week, after referring to Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide."" Stephanopoulos asked the Ukrainian Prime Minister what more the country needs. ""We are so grateful to American people, especially to President Biden for [the] support of Ukraine,"" Shmyhal said. ""Only half of our economy is working, so we ask for financial support."" Reuters has reported that Shmyhal will travel to Washington, D.C., this week along with other top Ukrainian finance officials for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings. Shmyhal told Stephanopoulos that while members of his financial team are in Washington, they will continue to push for additional financial support. Stephanopoulos asked Shmyhal what his message is for the West. ""We need more sanctions from West partners. We need more ammunition to protect our country and European borders,"" Shmyhal added.

2022-04-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/infuriating-climate-activists-biden-expands-oil-drilling-public/story?id=84148098,"Infuriating climate activists, Biden expands oil drilling on public land","In a move that could help temper high gasoline prices, President Joe Biden is bringing back leases for oil and gas drilling on federal land -- but the reversal of a 2020 campaign promise has angered climate activists ahead of midterms that will determine Biden's ability to get his agenda through Congress. The administration was set to start selling leases for drilling on public lands -- putting 144,000 acres of lands up for lease in nine states as soon as Monday -- as Biden faces massive pressure to boost oil production in the U.S. amid soaring prices partly from the war in Ukraine, what Biden calls ""Putin's price hike."" The Interior Department announced the move on Friday afternoon heading into the holiday weekend. ""For too long, the federal oil and gas leasing programs have prioritized the wants of extractive industries above local communities, the natural environment, the impact on our air and water, the needs of Tribal Nations, and, moreover, other uses of our shared public lands,"" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a release. ""Today, we begin to reset how and what we consider to be the highest and best use of Americans' resources for the benefit of all current and future generations."" The Interior Department said new changes to the sale process reflect ""the balanced approach to energy development and management of our nation's public lands"" and noted the land offered for auction is 80% less than the 733,000 acres nominated. It also said that lease sales will be subject to Tribal consultation and community input. But the action goes against a key promise the president made on the campaign trail not to drill on federal lands, part of a larger campaign pledge to try and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, infuriating climate activists at the start of Earth Week and National Park Week. To help deflect criticism, the Biden administration is increasing the royalties that companies must pay for this drilling from 12.5% to 18.75% -- in a first of its kind increase in more than a century. While some environmental groups have acknowledged that the administration changes -- increasing royalties and limiting leases to areas with existing infrastructure -- are positive steps, other more critical climate groups argue that any decision that continues U.S. reliance on fossil fuels is a step in the wrong direction. ""The Biden administration's claim that it must hold these lease sales is pure fiction and a reckless failure of climate leadership,"" said Randi Spivak, public lands director at the Center for Biological Diversity in Arizona, in a statement. ""It's as if they're ignoring the horror of firestorms, floods and megadroughts, and accepting climate catastrophes as business as usual...These lease sales should be shelved and the climate-destroying federal fossil fuel programs brought to an end."" Another activist, Kyle Tisdel, a climate and energy program director with the Western Environmental Law Center, which litigates to safeguard public lands, sent the administration a stark warning with the midterms nearly 200 days away. ""We have heard a lot of rhetoric from President Biden and his administration about the need to take action on climate,"" he said in a statement. ""But not only is the administration not doing everything it could -- it is not really doing anything. Climate action was a pillar of President Biden's campaign, and his promises on this existential issue were a major reason the public elected him."" The White House has argued it had no choice but to continue drilling on public lands after a federal judge in Louisiana struck down Biden's executive order in June 2021 temporarily suspending such drilling. A senior administration official told ABC News on Friday the move was ""a necessary action as a result of ongoing litigation."" ""We continue to believe that as a country and as an administration we must speed up -- not slow down -- our transition to clean energy,"" the senior administration official said, ticking through actions the administration has taken to develop clean-energy alternatives. ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce pressed White House press secretary Jen Psaki on whether Biden's ambitious goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 now risks being undercut as the administration argues it's being forced to expand fossil fuel production. ""Obviously we're going to continue to fight this legal action, but I would say that you know the president remains committed to addressing the climate crisis is one of the four pillars that he came in, he ran on as president, and he will continue to fight for,"" Psaki said. ""One of the reasons that this was so troubling to him is because he is so committed to that -- that objective as president and we have continued to propose historic investment in addressing the climate crisis, something that we will continue to discuss with Congress."" Asked point-blank if the White House is still confident that goal is achievable, Psaki said, ""We are continuing to pursue it, and we're going to continue to do everything we can to reach it."" The chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., applauded the administration for raising royalties on the drilling, saying in a statement, ""If we're going to let the fossil fuel industry pocket more of our public lands for drilling, we should at least make sure they're paying a decent price to do it."" As Republicans have blasted Biden over gas prices he's tied to Putin, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and frequent critic of the administration's energy policies, tempered expectations that Monday's move may bring down oil prices, noting it will still limit domestic production by increasing costs on companies. Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, a nonprofit which to litigates environmental issues, called the action ""incompatible with meeting our climate obligations."" ""We are encouraged by a significant reduction in lease sale acreage, implementation of science-based analysis of greenhouse gas emissions, and an increase in the royalty rate for new competitive leases to 18.75%, but proceeding with proposed lease sales puts any hope of slashing pollution by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 further out of reach,"" she said in a statement. ""If the Biden administration is serious about addressing climate change, its actions need to start matching its words,"" Dillen added. The action is the latest in a wave to address soaring oil prices as the president is forced to walk a fine line between committing to fighting climate change but, also, to bringing down gas prices for Americans amid 40-year-high inflation -- issues plaguing him ahead of the midterm elections. Back on the campaign trail in 2020, Biden said at a town hall in New Hampshire that he opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, before adding, ""And by the way, no more drilling on federal lands, period. Period, period, period."" Some progressive groups are sure to remind voters of the administration's actions on fossil fuels since and heading into November. ""Candidate Biden promised to end new oil and gas leasing on public lands, but President Biden is prioritizing oil executive profits over future generations,"" said Nicole Ghio, senior fossil fuels program manager at Friends of the Earth, in a statement. It's widely believed the Biden Justice Department or White House could have done more to delay the auctions continuing in order to keep his campaign promise, even potentially delaying the sales indefinitely by fighting the judge's order in court. Instead, the administration found a way to release a smaller number of acres and increase royalties. ""This is the Biden White House under enormous pressure to do something about the spiraling cost of gasoline,"" said ABC News Political Director Rick Klein on ""Good Morning America"" Sunday. ""It might mean more exploration and might even mean more production, but it's going to take a while -- and it's another reason that it's so hard to deal with a political crisis when that crisis involves gas prices."" Last week, Biden lifted requirements to allow the summer sale of ""E-15"" -- a blend of gas with 15% ethanol, rather than the usual 10% -- which the White House said will bring down gas prices by 10 cents a gallon. And late last month, he announced his unprecedented plans to release roughly 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve over the next six months to reduce energy and gas prices. According to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, U.S. gas prices have declined for the fourth straight week, with the national average falling 3.8 cents per gallon to $4.06/gal. Prices are down 21.1 cents from a month ago, he said in a tweet Monday. A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll found Americans are more likely to place a ""great deal"" or a ""good amount"" of the blame for the price increases on Democratic Party policies (52%) and Biden (51%) than on Republican Party policies (33%) and former President Donald Trump (24%). A strong majority of Americans (68%) also disapproves of the way Biden is handling gas prices. The states with federal land up for oil and gas leases as soon as Monday include Alabama, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming.

2022-04-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-takes-mariupol-forces-freed-fight-east-pentagon/story?id=84152667,"If Russia takes Mariupol, forces could be freed to fight in east: Pentagon update Day 54","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 54. Russia 'shaping' the battlefield for renewed offensive There are now 76 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) inside Ukraine, all of them in the south and east. Each BTG is made up of roughly 800-1,000 soldiers. That's up from 65 BTGs last week, so as many 11,000 troops have crossed the border since then, the senior defense official said. Last week, the U.S. mostly saw support forces convoying into the Donbas region, but BTGs are Russia's primary fighting units. Artillery, helicopter support and command and control elements have continued to flow in. In a separate briefing, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Monday that while there is currently fighting in Donbas, as there has been for years, defense officials do not believe Russia's new offensive push has begun. ""We believe that the Russians are shaping and setting the conditions for future offensive operations,"" Kirby said. That shaping effort appears to be an attempt by Russia to avoid blunders it made during combat operations in northern Ukraine. ""We believe that they are trying to learn from from past mistakes, and you can see that in just the way they are conducting these shaping operations,"" Kirby said. ""They're conducting themselves in ways that we didn't see around Kyiv, for instance."" While Russian forces are ""trying to set the conditions for more aggressive, more overt, and larger ground maneuvers in the Donbas,"" Kirby said Ukrainian troops are not sitting idle. ""We have seen indications in just the last few days that the Ukrainians not only have have defended bravely, but they have been able to secure certain villages and towns in the Donbas,"" Kirby said. There are another 22 or so BTGs still in Russia north of Ukraine, most likely refitting and resupplying after being depleted form earlier combat in northern Ukraine, according to a defense official. The official noted that if Russia takes Mariupol, it would free up close to another 12 BTGs (roughly 8,800-12,000 troops) that could be used for fighting elsewhere in the south or east. Mariupol Ukrainian forces continue fighting to push back Russian troops in Mariupol, according to the official. The city is still under threat of missile and artillery bombardment. Kyiv and lviv under long-range fire Russian long-range bombers have hit both Kyiv and Lviv with air-launched cruise missiles over the last couple of days, according to the official. ""Our initial assessment is that they were going after primarily military targets, or what they believed to be military targets,"" the official said. During his press briefing, Kirby said the U.S. is still assessing what the Russian's hit in the two cities, but added that most Russian airstrikes are being directed on the east and south of Ukraine, especially Mariupol. The Moskva The U.S. can't verify authenticity of videos purportedly showing Russia's Moskva cruiser sinking, ""but the images themselves comport with what we had assessed to be the damage done to the ship,"" the official said. The official said the U.S. was able to see Russian sailors board lifeboats before the ship sank, but could not confirm how many casualties there might have been. ""It's hard to look at the damage that was done without generally assuming that there were also casualties, that she lost sailors. How many, we just don't know,"" the official said. First shipments of new $800 million US aid package arrive ""Based on the last $800 million that the President authorized that we just announced last week, already there have been four flights from the United States arriving into the theater just yesterday,"" the official said. US to train Ukrainians on artillery In coming days, the U.S. plans to facilitate training for Ukrainians on the howitzers it's sending them, according to the official. The 18 howitzers heading to Ukraine will come from a mix of U.S. Army and Marine Corps stocks. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",,,,6
2022-04-18,https://abcnews.go.com/International/takes-prosecute-war-crimes/story?id=83915800,What it takes to prosecute war crimes,"As Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine, atrocities were revealed and the U.S. and European countries accused Russia of committing war crimes. Last month, the U.S. made a formal legal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials Friday said they found more than 900 bodies of civilians in the Kyiv region after Russian forces retreated, 350 of which were found in the town of Bucha. Geoffrey Nice, a barrister who prosecuted former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, told ABC News it is obvious that war crimes are being committed in Ukraine. ""Without doubt. It's clear as conveyed from everything we're watching every day on television,"" Nice said. In March, days after the war began, the International Criminal Court announced it is launching an investigation into possible war crimes committed in Ukraine. This story explains what it takes to prosecute war crimes. What is a war crime? War crimes are a part of the law of armed conflict, which governs fighting during war, and apply to all sides of an armed conflict, including armed forces and organized armed groups. These rules are laid out in the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols. Individuals could also be held responsible or prosecuted for serious violations of the law of armed conflict or a grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, Tom Dannenbaum, an assistant professor of International Law at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told ABC News in an interview. ""These rules go all the way down the command chain, and indeed all the way up the command chain. ... Any individual from the lowest level physical perpetrator to the highest level commander is potentially implicated, or is at least governed by this law,"" Dannenbaum said. These violations include attacking civilians and their structures, killings, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, torture or sexual and gender-based crimes, such as rape, according to Dannenbaum. Jurisdiction and forums for prosecution There are several forums where war crimes can be prosecuted. In Ukraine, this includes the ICC, domestic courts and courts in countries that have universal jurisdiction. Ukraine has consented to the jurisdiction of the ICC, which can prosecute four main crimes: genocide; crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, imprisonment, deportation and torture; war crimes that breach the Geneva conventions; and the crime of aggression. In order for individuals to stand trial in the ICC, they must voluntarily consent to it or be handed over to the court. Russia does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC and is not required to hand over suspects who are indicted. Domestic courts in Ukraine can prosecute war crimes since the crimes occurred within their territorial jurisdiction, and Russian courts can prosecute crimes involving their citizens, based on nationality jurisdiction. Universal jurisdiction exists in some countries, including Australia, France and Germany, allowing them to prosecute individuals for crimes committed out of their territory. The individuals do not need to be citizens of the prosecuting country nor does the crime have to have been committed against its citizens. ""It asserts universal jurisdiction on the grounds that this particular crime is a crime that is of universal interest,"" Dannenbaum said. The U.S. does not allow its courts to exercise universal jurisdiction. Evidence gathering and investigating Investigators divide evidence into two categories: crime based and linkage evidence, according to William Wiley, founder and executive director of the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, who has over 20 years experience in International Criminal and Humanitarian Law on the investigative and legal sides. To collect crime based evidence, investigators gather basic facts like such as cause of death, or probable cause of death, time of death, and location of death, Wiley said. ""Crime based, for example, in the well known situation of Bucha, in Ukraine, would be the dead bodies, eye witnesses to the killing of those individuals,"" Wiley said. Crime based evidence makes up a small portion of cases; ""90% of the work in an international criminal investigation, the prosecution is focused on gathering and analysis of linkage evidence,"" Wiley said. Investigators will be looking for ""linkage evidence between those who performed the wrongful act on the ground and any other actors that are potentially going to be subject to investigation and prosecution, particularly those up the chain of command,"" Dannenbaum said. Linkage evidence can include documents, documentary materials generated, communications, satellite imagery or insider witnesses. Investigators are looking for evidence that could establish intent. Finding sufficient linkage evidence is the main challenge prosecutors and investigators face, Wiley said. ""What it takes to prosecute a war crime is a great deal of evidence because ultimately, war crimes cases are are brought against higher level perpetrators who need a great deal of linkage material and connect somebody in Moscow to offenses perpetrated in, for instance, Bucha,"" Wiley said. But Ukraine appears to be gathering communications evidence ""in considerable volumes ... because the Russian operational security appears to be extremely poor. They're not using frequently encrypted communications devices, certainly on the tactical and operational level,"" Wiley said. Nice disagreed, and said there doesn't need to be a huge amount of evidence. The war ""was associated with war crimes right from the very beginning. Never been any doubt about that,"" said Nice. He added, ""There doesn't necessarily need to be a huge amount of evidence because it is so overwhelmingly clear."" Suspects are identified late in the investigative process. Investigators start by gathering evidence surrounding the perpetrating structures, then they link those crimes to a crime base, and finally they work toward identifying suspects, Wiley said. ""Ultimately, it's not Russia that is going to be put on trial ... it's individual suspects,"" Wiley said. The legal principle of command responsibility states that commanders are responsible for the conduct their subordinates, Wiley said. This runs all the way up the command chain, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. This rules out the possibility of higher ranking officials claiming they were unaware of the actions committed by their forces. ""For instance, in Bucha, this is not going to be an effective defense because the law of command responsibility imposes a requirement on commanders to be aware, at all times, of what their men are up to,"" Wiley said. Could Russian forces and leadership face prosecution? Experts agree that it is unlikely the highest-ranking officials will be prosecuted, but Russian forces could be. There is a ""fairly strong prospect"" for Russian forces to be sent to trial because a number of them have been captured by Ukraine and because there is ""an unprecedented level of international cooperation around gathering evidence, making sure it's preserved,"" Dannenbaum said. Dannenbaum said countries are providing the ICC with additional resources, including financial support and investigative teams. Wiley also thinks forces will be prosecuted. ""I don't think there's going to be a problem getting some Russian perpetrators into court. The fundamental question is, what ranks will they hold, or will they have held,"" Wiley said. ""However, there's a great many Russian soldiers, and paramilitary personnel connected to the Russian security intelligence services, who've been captured by the Ukrainians,"" Wiley said. But the likelihood of Putin or other high-ranking Russian officials being prosecuted is not high. ""It's much less likely that those individuals will come into the custody of the jurisdictions that would seek to prosecute them. And Putin himself has an additional wrinkle, which is a concept called head of state immunity, which makes it difficult to prosecute Putin in domestic courts,"" Dannenbaum. But he could be prosecuted in the ICC. If there is regime change in Russia, he could be tried, Nice said. ""If there's a regime change in Russia, as there was in Serbia, which led to the former Serbian President being handed over, then he may be tried,"" Nice said.",,,,13
2022-04-19,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-begins-long-feared-offensive-ukraines-east/story?id=84161008,Russia begins long-feared offensive in Ukraine's east,"LONDON -- Russia launched an all-out ground offensive to take control of eastern Ukraine late Monday, marking the long-feared start of a new phase of the nearly two-month-long war. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces were attacking along a nearly 300-mile front in the disputed Donbas region, the predominately Russian-speaking industrial heartland of Ukraine's east, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian soldiers since 2014 and have declared two independent republics recognized by Moscow. ""Russian troops have begun the battle for Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced late Tuesday in his nightly broadcast. ""A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive."" Since invading neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24 from Belarus, to the north, and Russia, to the east, Russian forces have struggled to take full control of major cities amid strong resistance from Ukrainian troops. After failing to seize the capital, Kyiv, Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine and have been regrouping in the east in recent weeks in preparation for a full-scale assault, as Russian officials declared ""liberating"" the Donbas as the main goal of the ""special military operation."" On Tuesday morning, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that ""another stage of this operation is beginning."" ""I am sure this will be a very important moment of this entire special operation,"" Lavrov said in an interview with India Today, an English-language Indian television network. Lavrov noted that the objective, ""as it was declared from the very start,"" was to ""fully liberate"" the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics in the Donbas. The Russian military called on the outnumbered Ukrainian fighters in the besieged port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast to surrender by midday. The Russian Ministry of Defense said it was ready to declare a temporary ceasefire in Mariupol on Tuesday from 1:30 p.m. local time. Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, head of Russia's National Defense Control Center, told Russian state media on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops holed up on the grounds of the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works plant in Mariupol had until 12 p.m. local time to stop all fighting and lay down their arms. Moscow has proposed this plan ""given the catastrophic situation in the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, as well as for purely humanitarian considerations,"" according to Mizintsev. ""All those who will lay down arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared,"" he added. ""The actual start of the temporary ceasefire shall be marked by both sides by raising flags -- red flags by the Russian side and white flags by the Ukrainian side along the entire perimeter of Azovstal. Furthermore, their readiness to put the temporary ceasefire into effect shall be confirmed by the sides via all communication channels."" According to Mizintsev, ""absolutely all"" Ukrainian troops and foreign mercenaries would have been allowed to leave the plant without any weapons or ammunition from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. local time. Moscow guaranteed to each Ukrainian soldier who surrenders that their life will be spared and their rights as prisoners of war will be respected, Mizintsev said. The territory of the giant Azovstal plant is the last holdout for the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. The Mariupol City Council has previously said there are at least 1,000 people, including Ukrainian troops, on the grounds of the plant. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Monday that civilians, including women and children, were also sheltering there. She called for an ""urgent humanitarian corridor"" to allow them to evacuate. Eduard Basurin, a spokesperson for the militia of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state media on Tuesday that separatist special forces were chosen to assist the Russian military in storming the Azovstal plant. Basurin said they have already started the operation in Mariupol, with Russian forces providing air and artillery support. The Ukrainian government did not immediately confirm the claim. However, Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun said Tuesday that Russian forces were intensifying their attacks in the east, with a focus on breaching Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as establishing full control of Mariupol. Weeks of relentless Russian bombardment have largely reduced Mariupol to rubble and killed thousands of residents, according to local officials. Capturing the city -- a strategically important port on the Sea of Azov, part of the Black Sea -- is the remaining obstacle to Russia's push to secure a coastal corridor to Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which Russian forces invaded and subsequently annexed in 2014. Earlier this month, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that a full-scale ground offensive by Russia in Ukraine's east would be ""a crucial phase of the war.""",,,,28
2022-04-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russian-offensive-limited-fall-mariupol-inevitable-pentagon-update/story?id=84171542,"Russian offensive 'limited' so far, fall of Mariupol 'not inevitable': Pentagon update Day 55","The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday on Day 55. 'Limited' Russian offensive operations so far in eastern Ukraine The U.S. has seen ""limited"" Russian offensive operations southwest of Donetsk and south of Izium, but these are believed to be ""preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct,"" a senior U.S. defense official said. ""These are actual ground offensives, and they are being supported, of course, by some long-range fires, mostly artillery, which is right out of the Russian doctrine,"" the official said. But while there is ongoing fighting in the region, a more devastating offensive is still in the works. ""You've seen comments by [Ukraine's] President Zelenskyy yesterday, and even for [Russian Foreign Minister] Lavrov, about this new offensive beginning ... We think that these ... are preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct. So, we're not pushing back on the notion that offensive operations have begun, but again, we think that this is a prelude of larger offensive operations that are potentially still in the offing here,"" the official said. The Pentagon believes Russia's military is working to learn from its mistakes fighting in the north, where it was plagued with logistical and supply problems, conducting what officials call ""shaping operations"" to set favorable conditions on the battlefield before beginning its new offensive in earnest. ""In other words, continue to reinforce, continue to make sure they have logistics and sustainment in place, continue to make sure that they have proper aviation and other enabling capability,"" the official said. Over the last 24 hours, two Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs), or up to 2,000 more combat troops, have been sent into Ukraine, according to the official. This brings the total to an estimated 78 BTGs inside the country, all in the south and east. About 75% of Putin's total combat power originally arrayed against Ukraine remains, according to the official. This takes into account all military capabilities, including troop casualties, destroyed vehicles and aircraft, and expended missiles. This is the lowest assessment we've heard out of the Pentagon. Fall of Mariupol and Donbas 'not inevitable' ""People speak about this as if it's inevitable, that Mariupol is going to fall, that it's inevitable that Donbas will be taken by the Russians. We don't see it that way. And we're doing everything we can to make sure that it's not inevitable,"" the official said. With fighting concentrated around Donbas, Ukraine has to move aid coming in from the U.S. and others all the way across the country. ""Right now we know from our discussions with the Ukrainians that they are getting this materiel, it's getting into the hands of their fighters,"" the official said. But Russia aims to isolate Ukrainian forces in the east. ""Clearly what the Russians want to do is cut them off and to defeat them in the Donbas,"" the official said, reiterating that defeat is not inevitable. Ukraine has more operable planes than 2 weeks ago At a separate briefing later Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine currently has more operable military planes right now than it did two weeks ago because Ukraine has received additional aircraft as well as parts to get damaged planes flying again. Kirby was reticent to provide any details on where the parts and planes came from but stressed that they did not come from the U.S. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Kirby said at the on-camera briefing at the Pentagon. “And that's not by accident, that's because other nations who had experience with those kinds of aircraft have been able to help them get more aircraft up and running,” said Kirby. ""We certainly have helped with the trans-shipment of some additional spare parts that have helped with their aircraft needs, but we have not transported whole aircraft,"" he said. Russian missile strikes The U.S. assesses Russia has fired at least 1,670 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. The official noted that bad weather lowers visibility, making it harder for the U.S. to observe launches and other battlefield actions, so the actual number could be higher. Despite the recent airstrikes in Kyiv and Lviv, Russia's firepower is focused on Mariupol and Donbas.",,,,6
2022-04-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vice-president-kamala-harris-announce-us-ban-anti/story?id=84152287,Vice President Kamala Harris announces US ban on anti-satellite missile tests,"Vice President Kamala Harris announced Monday night that the Biden administration is setting a self-imposed ban on anti-satellite missile testing with the goal of making it an ""international norm for responsible behavior in space."" The U.S., China, India and Russia have all carried out such tests, which generate dangerous space debris. The U.S. is the first to impose such a ban. ""Simply put, these tests are dangerous, and we will not conduct them,"" Harris said during remarks at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The vice president said the U.S. hopes other nations will follow suit. The U.S. has identified and tracks over 1,600 pieces of debris that Russia created when it used a missile to destroy a satellite in November and more than 2,800 that China generated when it carried out its own test in 2007, Harris said. Russia's direct-ascent anti-satellite missile test created a field of debris that threatened the International Space Station. ""This debris presents a risk to the safety of our astronauts, our satellites and our growing commercial presence,"" she said. ""A piece of space debris the size of a basketball, which travels at thousands of miles per hour, would destroy a satellite. Even a piece of debris as small as a grain of sand could cause serious damage."" ""These weapons are intended to deny the United States our ability to use our space capabilities by destructing, destroying our satellites, satellites which are critical to our national security,"" Harris said. ""These tests, to be sure, are reckless, and they are irresponsible. These tests also put in danger so much of what we do in space."" Ahead of her remarks, the vice president met with members of the United States Space Force and United States Space Command, receiving briefings on their work advancing U.S. national security.",,,,1
2022-04-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russians-calling-ukrainians-lay-arms-civilians-sheltering/story?id=84188159,"Situation in Azovstal steel plant 'desperate,' Ukraine says","Ukraine claimed on Thursday that hundreds of people remain trapped in the Azovstal steel plant where the situation has become ""desparate."" Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed the Ukrainian army continues to fight in the besieged Mariupol, saying that the situation in Azovstal is ""desparate"" with hundreds of civilians, children and injured fighters trapped in the plant with nearly no food, water or essential medicine. ""Azovstal is being constantly bombarded by Russia despite large numbers of civilians sheltering there. Ukrainians don't trust [Russian] troops, are afraid of being deported, killed. An urgent humanitarian corridor is needed from the Azovstal plant with guarantees people will be safe,"" the Ukrainian MFA said in a tweet. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops not to attack the Azovstal plant, in a televised meeting with defense minister Sergei Shoigu. Shoigu said it would take Russian forces three to four days to take control of the industrial zone of the plant. Putin also claimed the Mariupol operation a success, congratulating his defense minister and thanking Russian troops. ""The completion of the combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success,"" Putin told Shoigu on Thursday. ""I congratulate you. Convey words of gratitude to the troops."" Ukraine's presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich addressed Putin's comments in a press conference Thursday and said that Ukrainian troops continue to hold the plant and Russia would not storm Azovstal because they have suffered huge losses and redeployed some of their troops. A Ukrainian commander of the regiment at that factory said Ukrainian troops there are ready to surrender if they can be guaranteed protection by a third party and are allowed to take the bodies of their dead with them. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy's office called for negotiations inside Mariupol to get anyone left in the factory out of the area alive. President Joe Biden pushed back against Putin's claim that Russian forces have taken control of Mariupol. ""It's questionable whether he does control Mariupol. One thing for sure we know about Mariupol, he should allow humanitarian corridors to let people on that steel mill and other places are buried under rubble to get out. That's what any head of state would do in such a circumstance,"" Biden said. ""There is no evidence yet that Mariupol has completely fallen,"" he added. On Wednesday, Russia's military issued another warning to Ukrainian forces at the plant, telling them to lay down their arms and leave, according to Russian state media. Russia claimed a ceasefire would begin at the Azovstal steel plant at 2 p.m. Moscow time on Wednesday to allow Ukrainian fighters to safely leave. Ukrainian forces rejected a similar offer on Tuesday. The Mariupol city council claimed Tuesday that there are at least 1,000 civilians seeking shelter in the plant, mostly women with children and the elderly. Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the number of Ukrainian marines and fighters at the site. A Russian official, Dmitry Polyansky, accused Ukrainian troops of using civilians at the plant as human shields. ""One month into the siege of Azovstal plant, those same radicals and neo-Nazis suddenly declared that allegedly there had been civilians inside the plant all that time, even though until yesterday, they had never uttered a word about it,"" Polyansky told the U.N. Security Council during a session on Ukraine on Tuesday. In a video posted online, Serhiy Voyna, the commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade and commander for Ukraine's marines in Mariupol, made an appeal to world leaders, asking for an extraction from the plant to the territory of a third-party state. ""This could be the last appeal of our lives. We are probably facing our last days, if not hours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to 1. They have advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment and in tanks,"" Voyna said. Voyna spoke to the Washington Post via satellite phone on Tuesday, and said his forces would not make the same mistake made by others and trust Russian guarantees of safe passage, only to see them open fire. Voyna said more than 500 Mariupol military battalion soldiers are wounded. ""We are only defending one object, the Azovstal plant where, in addition to military personnel, there are also civilians who have fallen victim to this war. We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us. We ask them to use the procedure of 'extraction' and take us to the territory of a third-party state,"" Voyna said.",,,,28
2022-04-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announce-800m-aid-package-ukraine-russia-presses/story?id=84194608,Biden announces new $800M aid package to Ukraine as Russia presses offensive,"President Joe Biden on Thursday announced an additional $800 million package in military assistance to Ukraine -- as well as a ban on all Russian-affiliated ships from U.S. ports -- as Russian forces launch a long-expected, large-scale campaign to seize the country's east. ""We're in a critical window now of time where -- they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,"" Biden said from the White House Roosevelt Room, adding the U.S. and allies will continue to provide Ukraine with ""equipment they need -- their forces need -- to defend their nation."" Biden said the new aid package will include ""heavy artillery weapons, dozens of howitzers, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition to go with those howitzers,"" as well as tactical drones. It follows another of similar size, which Biden announced last week, but focuses more on artillery and ammunition, U.S. officials told ABC News earlier this week. Biden said the U.S. has sent ""equipment that is responsive to Ukraine's needs and tailored to support the intensified fighting in the Donbas region, which is a different war than in other places because both topographically, it's different -- it's flat, it's not in the mountains -- and it requires different kinds of weapons to be more effective."" ""Every American taxpayer, every member of our armed forces can be proud of the fact that our country's generosity -- and the skill and service of our military -- helped arm and repel Russia's aggression in Ukraine to beat back Putin's savagery that tried to seize Ukraine's capital and wipe out Ukraine's government,"" Biden added. Detailing capabilities in the package, the Pentagon said 72 more howitzers and the vehicles to tow them onto the battlefield are being sent to Ukraine, reflecting the importance of howitzer artillery in fighting in the Donbas, where the terrain is wide and open. When combined with the 18 howitzers announced last week, the 90 howitzers in total headed to Ukraine “provides enough artillery systems to equip five battalions,"" according to the Pentagon. As the fighting progresses, there are concerns about getting American-made artillery into the region, also reflected in that this is the bulk of the new aid package. With this latest package, the U.S. has announced more than $3 billion in military aid since the start started in late February. In particular, this is the eighth tranche of U.S. assistance from the Pentagon's existing stockpile, using what's known as presidential drawdown authority to expedite delivery. As more than 5 million have fled Ukraine since the war began, Biden also announced a new program dubbed ""Unite for Ukraine"" to fast-track Ukrainian refugees coming to the U.S. ""This new humanitarian parole program will complement the existing legal pathways available to Ukrainians, including immigrant visas and refugees processing"" and ""provide an expedient channel for secure legal migration from Europe to the United States for Ukrainians, who have a U.S. sponsor such as a family or an NGO,"" Biden said. Beginning April 25, the administration says U.S.-based individuals and entities can apply to the Department of Homeland Security to sponsor Ukrainian citizens. Those who apply to sponsor Ukrainians will be required to declare their financial support and pass a background check, according to administration officials, and there is no limit on how many Ukrainians a person or entity can sponsor. ""This program will be fast, it will be streamlined, and will ensure the United States honors its commitment to go to the people of Ukraine and need not go through our southern border,"" Biden added. As he continues to ramp up pressure on Putin, Biden said the U.S. will also ban all Russian-affiliated ships from its ports. ""That means no ship, no ship that sails on the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by Russian interest would be allowed to dock on the united States port or access our shores. None,"" he said. After meeting with Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal ahead of his remarks, Biden again called on Congress to provide more funding for weapons and ammunition because existing money is ""almost exhausted,"" he said, even with an additional $500 million in economic aid to Ukraine's government the Treasury Department also announced Thursday, separate from the latest $800 million military package. Russia offered another ultimatum Wednesday to allow Ukrainian fighters to leave a steel plant in Mariupol -- but those fighters, for days, have refused to surrender. Finally seizing the strategic port city after weeks of besiegement and bombardment would help give Russian forces a land bridge between Crimea, which Russia has occupied since 2014, and the eastern provinces known as the Donbas, where Russian-led separatists have battled the Ukrainian government since 2014, too. The Donbas is expected to be Russia's focus now, but the U.S. remains concerned that Russian forces will target the paths in western Ukraine being used to ship Western military aid into the country, a defense official told ABC News. While they have not done so yet, cutting off those supply routes will help the Kremlin isolate Ukrainian forces in the east, the official added. The U.S. believes Russians will target the paths in western Ukraine being used to ship in Western military aid in order to isolate Ukrainian forces in the east, a defense official told ABC News. ""Right now, we know from our discussions with the Ukrainians that they are getting this material,"" a defense official said Tuesday. ""It's getting into the hands of their fighters."" The U.S. and other Western countries have now provided Ukraine with close to 70,000 anti-tank weapons, including several varieties of shoulder-fired missiles. The number of shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles that the U.S. and other countries have sent to Ukraine is nearing 30,000. Those missiles have been used by Ukrainian forces to great effect, but as the battle shifts from Ukraine's major cities and suburbs to the more flat eastern provinces, Kyiv's troops will need more artillery and ammunition instead. Four flights carrying military aid from the $800 million drawdown package Biden announced last week arrived in Ukraine over the last 24 hours, some of them carrying U.S. howitzers and 155mm ammunition for them, a senior defense official said Wednesday, adding more equipment will arrive over the next 24 hours. ABC News asked the official why the U.S. decided to send U.S. artillery to the Ukrainians. ""We're mindful of the importance of artillery in the fight that they're in right now and in the fighting in the days to come because of the terrain, and because of what we think they're going to be up against with Russian forces,"" the official responded. Another reason was ""the fact that it wouldn't require an onerous amount of training for the Ukrainians to know how to use them"" and the ability to ship them quickly, according to the official. After Biden called Russia's actions in Ukraine ""genocide"" for the first time last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Wednesday that the same horrors witnessed in Bucha -- ""death, destruction, atrocities"" -- may take place in the eastern city of Mariupol ""at some point,"" even as Russian forces seem already poised to fully capture the strategic city. ""We can only anticipate that when this tide also at some point recedes from Mariupol, we're going to see far worse -- if that's possible to imagine,"" Blinken said. ""So the conditions there, the situation there as a result of this Russian aggression are truly horrific.""",,,,7
2022-04-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-administration-fast-tracking-ukrainian-refugees-us/story?id=84213983,Biden administration fast-tracking Ukrainian refugees into US,"The Biden administration on Thursday announced it is moving to fast-track Ukrainian refugees coming to the United States. President Joe Biden heralded the plan as ""fast"" and ""streamlined"" to protect Ukrainians fleeing Russia's war, but it will do so on a temporary basis and require financial support from a U.S. sponsor -- drawing criticism from some refugee resettlement groups who called for Ukrainians to receive more permanent refugee status. The U.S. would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, Biden announced in Brussels last month, amid the fast-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the end of World War II. Nearly 8 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, the United Nations announced Thursday. Beginning April 25, the administration says U.S.-based individuals and entities can apply to the Department of Homeland Security to sponsor Ukrainian citizens -- in an operation dubbed ""Uniting for Ukraine."" Any U.S. citizen or entity can apply sponsor Ukrainians and will be required to declare their financial support and pass a background check. Administration officials said there is no limit on how many Ukrainians a person or entity can sponsor. ""We are proud to deliver on President Biden's commitment to welcome 100,000 Ukrainians and others fleeing Russian aggression to the United States. The Ukrainian people continue to suffer immense tragedy and loss as a result of Putin's unprovoked and unjustified attack on their country,"" Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. ""DHS will continue to provide relief to the Ukrainian people, while supporting our European allies who have shouldered so much as the result of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine."" The administration anticipates a ""large majority"" of Ukrainians using the program will apply through family in the U.S. already, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday. But a group of nearly 70 Ukrainian-American community groups, religious organizations, refugee resettlement agencies, and other nonprofits, backed by a $3.6 million donation from the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs, also announced Thursday they would help U.S. citizens sponsor Ukrainian refugees. Ukrainians with a sponsor must meet certain conditions -- being a resident of the war-torn country since Feb. 11 and up to date on vaccinations. They will also be subject to a background check and biometric screening and other security checks, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Once in the U.S, Ukrainians will have up to two years to be considered for parole, but officials said they anticipate the length of time in the U.S. to be short-term. The program will not provide a pathway to permanent residency in the U.S. ""What many of us have heard out in the region in Eastern Europe is a lot of Ukrainians don't even want to go further east, from the border countries in Eastern Europe, because it's a situation where women and children are separated from their husbands, fathers, brothers, and so they're quite keen staying near Ukraine to return as soon as possible,"" a senior administration official said. Administration officials told reporters on Thursday they hope it will be a ""streamlined process"" through an online portal where sponsors and Ukrainian nationals can both upload documents after being approved. They said they anticipate the process to be ""fairly quick,"" but didn't offer an exact timeframe. Ukrainians who don't have a visa to enter the U.S. will be encouraged to apply for this program as they say it's the safest way to enter the U.S., officials said. In recent months, some Ukrainians seeking asylum in the U.S. have been traveling to Mexico and arriving at the U.S.-Mexican border -- 3,274 in March alone, according to data from DHS. But the administration announced that after April 25, when the new parole program goes live, Ukrainians who present themselves at a border port of entry will be denied entry into the U.S. like other nationalities. Ukrainians ""may be refused entry under our existing laws. As I think everybody knows, we are continuing to enforce the public health authority under Title 42 at the land border to the 23rd [of May]. That will be the case for all nationalities,"" one senior administration official said. Title 42, the public health authority deployed by the Trump administration, expelled migrants on the basis of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Ukrainians had been largely exempted by DHS because of Russia's war. But now, with the policy set to be phased out by the administration on May 23, there are heightened concerns of a sharp increase in migration to the southern border. For Ukrainians fleeing the violence, but who don't have sponsors in the U.S., the administration said it is working with NGOs and nonprofits to connect people. Welcome.US, a nonprofit created during the evacuation of Kabul to assist Afghans fleeing the Taliban, announced Thursday it is working alongside Ukrainian-American community organizations, refugee resettlement agencies, and religious leaders to support the program. With $3.6 million in funding from Goldman Sachs, the group will help U.S. citizens that want to sponsor Ukrainians and allow folks to donate to support local nonprofits assisting Ukrainians or provide Airbnb or airline miles for those traveling to the U.S. But some of those refugee resettlement groups are expressing concern about the administration's plans, especially the short-term legal status these Ukrainian refugees are getting and the requirement that sponsors assume financial responsibility. Doing so is the administration ""outsourc[ing] its moral obligation to support newly arrived Ukrainians. Without access to traditional refugee resettlement benefits, we urge policy makers to consider implementing some semblance of a safety net for those rebuilding their lives from scratch,"" said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. LIRS is one of the largest U.S. resettlement agencies, but is not involved in the Welcome.US program. Other refugee groups expressed concern that the administration is not doing enough to address the systemic issues with the country's refugee resettlement program. As part of Thursday's announcement, the State Department will expand resettlement operations in Europe for Ukrainian refugees -- helping up to 18,000 resettle in Eastern European countries, including those considered most vulnerable like the LGBTQ community. But the resettlement program in the U.S. was decimated by Trump-era budget cuts and restrictions that refugee advocates said were onerous. While Biden has announced big targets for refugee resettlement before -- including an admissions ceiling of 125,00 for this fiscal year -- his administration has fallen far short of those targets. Halfway through this fiscal year, they have resettled 8,758 refugees -- a fraction of that 125,000 goal -- according to State Department data. ""Relying on temporary parole amounts to putting bandages on open wounds. The administration cannot continue to lurch from one crisis to another without increasing overall capacity for permanent protection in the United States,"" said Sunil Varghese, Policy Director at the International Refugee Assistance Project, a legal advocacy group.",,,,2
2022-04-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/battle-donbas-weapons-us-rushing-ukraine-critical/story?id=84173580,The battle for Donbas: Why the weapons the US is rushing to Ukraine are so critical,"As Russia's military gears up for what it hopes will be a decisive victory over Ukraine in the eastern part of the country, the U.S. is rushing to send weapons and equipment needed to hold off the larger invading force in the rural and open Donbas terrain -- a far different battlefield from the urban fighting where Ukrainian forces held an advantage. What could make all the difference now is the new $800 million military aid package for Ukraine President Joe Biden announced Thursday. It's a race against time -- maybe a matter of weeks, a U.S. defense official said. ""Now they've launched and refocused their campaign to seize new territory in eastern Ukraine, and we're in a critical window now of time where they're going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,"" Biden said of the Russian offensive, which U.S. military officials believe is just getting started. ""We know that time is not our friend,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Tuesday. Russia gains by being closer to its border With Ukrainian forces focused in the east, Russia intends to push down from the north, near the city of Izium, and up from the south, surrounding the Ukrainian defenders to ""finish them or force them to surrender,"" a senior U.S. official said Thursday. If Russia takes the beleaguered city of Mariupol in the south, it could free up thousands of troops to join the push north to trap Ukraine forces, according to the official. Although Russia and Ukraine have been battling over Donbas for eight years, Russia's concentrated flow of troops and weapons into the region could bring ""a whole different level of fighting,"" Kirby said Tuesday. There are now 85 battalion tactical groups (BTGs), Russia's main fighting units, inside Ukraine, according to the official. Each BTG is made up of roughly 800-1,000 troops. About 10 of them crossed into the country this week, most heading to the Donbas region. Kirby said the U.S. is focused on sending Ukraine weapons and systems that are not only useful for the rural eastern terrain, but that the Ukrainians can use in the fight without much training. Russia, meanwhile, is trying not to repeat blunders it committed in northern Ukraine, and will enjoy certain geographic advantages in Donbas. Early on, Russian invaders in the north were beset by supply problems, running out of food for troops and fuel for vehicles, failing to achieve any major victories. Pentagon officials believe they did not expect such strong resistance from Ukrainians so didn't adequately prepare for a prolonged fight. But since withdrawing its troops in the north to focus on Donbas, Russia has been putting equipment and support forces in place ahead of its combat troops to favorably condition the battlefield. ""We believe that they are trying to learn from past mistakes, and you can see that in just the way they are conducting these shaping operations,"" Kirby told reporters Monday. ""They're conducting themselves in ways that we didn't see around Kyiv, for instance."" Another advantage for Russia is that its logistics will be simplified by fighting closer to its own border, while Ukraine will now face the challenge of transporting heavy weapons and ammunition coming over its western border all the way across the country, meaning more miles for something to go wrong, and more chances for Russia to strike these vital shipments. How US-provided artillery and radars could make a difference To stand a chance fighting in the open Donbas landscape, Ukraine will need more long-range weapons and the ability to quickly move troops on the ground and in the air, according to Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and ABC News contributor. The U.S. has sent Ukraine $3.4 billion of aid since the beginning of the invasion, including many thousands of shoulder-fired missiles, small arms and ammunition, body armor, and medical supplies. The two most recent packages, dedicating $800 million of aid each, announced April 13 and 21, were tailored to reflect the new battle space. ""It's different,"" Biden said Thursday. ""It’s flat, it's not in the mountains, and it requires different kinds of weapons to be more effective."" To that end, the U.S. is sending 90 of its 155mm howitzers, which officials say will begin arriving over the weekend. ""This is going to be the king of battle out there,"" Mulroy said. While Ukraine already has Russian-made artillery pieces, the U.S. and most Western nations do not have the corresponding 152mm ammunition to offer as it runs through its limited stockpiles. The incoming U.S.-made 155mm guns will bring Ukrainian forces extra firepower, but also the ability to be better resupplied by the West. To start, the U.S. is sending 184,000 artillery rounds along with the 90 weapons. Russia has been flowing its own artillery into Donbas in preparation for its renewed offensive. To help Ukraine counter the threat, the U.S. is sending 14 radar systems that can detect incoming artillery and other indirect-fire attacks and find where they're coming from. ""Right now the Russians are kind of just lobbing artillery without any consequence,"" Mulroy said. ""They want to give them a whole lot of consequence."" The radar systems can help the Ukrainians accurately fire back. ""The counter radar is moving to theater this week,"" a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday, adding that the howitzers and radar systems complement each other, but can also be used independently. Training will be critical About 50 Ukrainians are being trained on the U.S. howitzers outside of the country. This first group of trainees is expected to finish around the same time as the first artillery pieces arrive in their country, likely Sunday or Monday, according to a U.S. official. The U.S. is using a ""train-the-trainer"" approach so as not to pull too many high-demand troops away from the front -- the small group of Ukrainians learning to use the new systems will return to their country to train fellow Ukrainian troops there. The U.S. took a similar approach with the small, explosive Switchblade drones, hundreds of which are headed to Ukraine. A small number of Ukrainians were in the U.S. for pre-scheduled military education when Russia invaded their country. The U.S. capitalized on their presence to add a couple days of training on the Switchblades, which are designed to fly directly into targets and explode. ""Although it's not a very difficult system to operate, we took advantage of having them in the country to give them some rudimentary training on that,"" a U.S. defense official said on April 6. U.S. officials have said other systems being sent to Ukraine will also require a small period of training, likely to also take place outside of the country. Officials have declined to specify where such training could take place, citing operational security concerns. With Russia intent on surrounding and trapping Ukrainian forces, the ability to move troops quickly by ground and air will be essential, according to Mulroy. ""They're going to try to envelope the Ukrainians and cut them off and starve them,"" he said. ""So, the Ukrainians need to have the ability not to let that happen."" Since the beginning of the invasion, the U.S. has given Ukraine 16 Mi-17 transport helicopters, each able to carry a three-person crew and up to 30 passengers. Mulroy said an advantage of the Soviet-designed Mi-17 is that Ukrainian pilots already know how to fly them. The U.S. has also offered Ukraine hundreds of armored personnel carriers that have tracks similar to those of tanks, as well as armored Humvees. Weather will likely play a factor, and muddy conditions during Spring could limit vehicle mobility for both sides. ""Even just this week, the ground as it is makes it harder for them to operate off of paved roads and highways,"" Kirby said. Time is of the essence Mulroy said the U.S. is doing a great job shipping military aid to the region, but believes more can be done to speed things up. ""We just have to take every opportunity to increase production and improve the flow, because it is going to make a difference,"" he said. The U.S. has not sent Ukraine any of its M1 Abrams tanks, officials saying they are too different from Ukraine's T-72s to be useable in the short term. But other nations with the Soviet-era tanks have given theirs. In total, Ukrainian forces have more tanks in their country than Russia's military, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. A less tangible but very real factor in the fighting so far has been troop morale. The Pentagon sees evidence Russian forces are still suffering from low motivation and poor unit cohesion, according to officials. ""Almost half of their enlisted troops are conscripts who don't receive a lot of training and who we have evidence, even recent evidence, that they've been disillusioned by this war,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. Meanwhile Russian officers are frustrated with the performance of other officers and of their own troops, according to the official. Ukrainian troops have not seemed to suffer any significant morale problems, and throughout the war have been described by U.S. officials as brave and wily in defense of their homeland. Biden praised the resolve of Ukrainians in a meeting with top military leaders at the White House Wednesday. ""I knew they were tough and proud, but I tell you what, they're tougher and more proud than I thought,"" Biden said.",,,,9
2022-04-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/billion-pledge-make-transportation-sustainable-experts-weigh/story?id=84295856,Will the $6 billion pledge to make transportation more sustainable be enough? Experts weigh in.,"The funds to help states make transportation more sustainable have been promised, but will they be enough to propel the U.S. toward its emissions goals? While it's a step in the right direction, the $6.4 billion pledged by the Federal Highway Administration to help states fund projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will barely make a dent in the funds needed to help the U.S. meet its goal to be carbon neutral by 2050, experts said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced last week that states would receive the money -- part of a $1 trillion infrastructure package passed by Congress in November -- over five years to create projects that support widespread use of electric vehicles and trail facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists. ""It's a good start,"" Tom Moerenhout, a research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told ABC News. ""But, it's not a lot of money."" It will likely require more than $100 billion ""to really make a dent into road-based or transportation-based carbon emissions,"" which are the largest source of carbon emissions in the U.S., Moerenhout said. While roads, bridges and train lines have ""really long lifespans,"" the decisions states make on where to allocate the funding will need to be strategic, as they will ""stick with us through 2050,"" Elizabeth Irvin, a senior transportation analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told ABC News. ""That's funding for states to work on transportation projects, where they're explicitly taking into account both emission reductions and sustainability and also environmental justice,"" Irvin said. ""Those are all really important things."" In the coming years, there will be a significant shift in the number of electric vehicles on the road, despite the war in Russia threatening to further disrupt the supply chain, Randy Bell, director of the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank, told ABC News. The changing market has been evident in the release of more electric crossover and SUVs, which is ""what Americans want to drive,"" Rawn said. On Tuesday, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, announced the first shipment of the F-150 Lightning, the first electric version of the top-selling truck in the U.S. for 45 years. Ford had to stop taking orders due to the ""tremendous interest"" in the Lightning, Ford said, adding that it sold out soon after the plans were announced last year. The need for charging infrastructure to power these EVs will be ""huge,"" Bell said, echoing the need to spend money wisely. ""EV adoption is not uniform around the country,"" Bell said. The infrastructure for charging stations will also take the burden off families from having to install charging capabilities at home, Carol Lee Rawn, senior director of transportation at Ceres, a sustainability nonprofit, told ABC News. ""So you don't have to worry about having a plug at your house,"" she said. ""You can plug when you go shopping, or when you go to work, and it's also extremely helpful for businesses that are interested in transitioning to electrification."" In addition, policymakers will need to consider infrastructure that allows people to walk and ride bikes and scooters safely, Rawn said, adding that E-bikes are becoming a viable alternative for many people. Countries are now sprinting to meet the ambitious pledges made at COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, in October 2021. The Biden administration has continued to roll out a steady stream of initiatives to ease emissions from the transportation sector. In December 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its strictest vehicle emissions standards ever for cars and light trucks from model years 2023-2026. In February, the Transportation Department gave states the go-ahead to build electric car charging stations. And earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued new standards for vehicles sold in the U.S., requiring the average fuel efficiency to be at least 40 miles per gallon starting in 2026 -- up from the 28 mpg standard enacted under former President Donald Trump. Currently, the U.S. is not on track to meet its 2030 or even 2050 goals, Moerenhout said, adding that it will be especially important for governments to incentivize the reduction of emissions. ""I think Europe has shown that with tightening fuel emission standards, you can move people into more sustainable practices and incentivize electrification,"" Moerenhout said. ""But in the U.S., it has just been far too sporadic."" With the Russian-backed conflict in Ukraine now detracting from the sense of urgency toward climate change, it will be imperative that governments find a way to address energy security and climate action together, Bell said. ""So you may end up with a more pragmatic pathway towards climate action, which ultimately becomes more economic, becomes more politically palatable and becomes much more realizable in the short to medium term,"" he said.",,,,22
2022-04-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/photo-exhibit-capitol-shows-humanitarian-crisis-ukraine/story?id=84371681,Photo exhibit at Capitol shows humanitarian crisis in Ukraine,"The Speaker's Dining Room in the Capitol is usually filled with photographs of Nancy Pelosi's home state of California. But for the next six weeks, on display instead will be shocking images of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine caused by the Russian invasion. Pelosi unveiled the photo exhibit Thursday, joined by other lawmakers and the Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. ""It is a manifestation -- an emotional time to the people of Ukraine, with a praise for their heroism that is just almost unimaginable, but so is the brutality they are suffering,"" Pelosi said, describing the scenes. The photographs showed streams of desperate civilians fleeing Ukraine amid charred and collapsed buildings, paramedics trying to save the wounded, and mass graves. ""I wish I could tell you about our talented children well on the way to their amazing successes,"" the Ukrainian ambassador said. ""Instead, this photographs that you see here today tell the stories of children who will never grow up. The children who were subjected to torture."" Pelosi thanked Markatova for allowing the photos to be displayed, saying they will allow House members and their guests to witness close-up the brutality of the Russian invasion. ""It is very emotional for us to see, but that motivates us to do so much more,"" Pelosi said. The exhibit opening came as the House approved a measure 417-10 Thursday making it easier for the United States to ""lend"" military aid and equipment to Ukraine. All 10 votes against were cast by Republicans. It now heads to the president's desk. ""It's outside the circle of civilized human behavior what the Russians are doing,"" Pelosi said, getting emotional as she made her way around the room taking in the photos. ""You would think unimaginable, but then here it is."" ABC News' Mariam Khan contributed to this report.",,,,24
2022-04-30,https://abcnews.go.com/International/comedian-wartime-leader-zelenskyy-helping-ukraine-win-information/story?id=84340282,From comedian to wartime leader: How President Zelenskyy is helping Ukraine win the information war,"LONDON -- Just after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was offered the chance by the U.S. government to leave the city of Kyiv for his own safety. What he is said to have responded has come to embody the defiance of the former comedic actor turned wartime leader: ""The fight is here,"" he reportedly said, ""I need ammunition, not a ride."" Early U.S. intelligence assessments suggested that Russia would take Kyiv within days of attacking Ukraine, but a succession of setbacks for the Russian military, and fierce resistance on the Ukrainian side, means the war is now dragging into its third month. Through it all, Zelenskyy has been the face of Ukrainian resistance – addressing his people on social media daily, as well as parliaments and leaders around the world. The Ukrainian government's communications strategy has proved important in both rallying morale and helping the country secure key military aid as the war has progressed, experts and analysts say. In the early phase of the war, the defiant message of Zelenskyy's early addresses, often filmed by himself in front of his office in the heart of the capital and posted on his social media accounts, was ""critical,"" according to Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Programme at the think tank Chatham House. ""The very first weeks of war were very dark times where there was a lot of anxiety and uncertainty about Kyiv, whether it will be able to stand Russian assault,"" she said. ""And that voice of Zelenskyy, almost like it was breaking that darkness, gave a communication channel to the world."" Zelenskyy has appeared in a constant stream of addresses since the war started, often decked out in combat fatigues, directly addressing the Ukrainian people but also the international media, who relied on these broadcasts as a daily source of information that would be reached by millions in the west. By remaining in Kyiv at the time, Zelenskyy also faced personal danger, broadcasting from the capital despite Russian missiles hitting targets in the city every night and Russian saboteur units allegedly sent to kill him. ""We are all here. Our military are here, as are our people and whole society,"" Zelenskyy said in one of his characteristic selfie-style videos posted at the time. ""We're all here defending our independence and our country. And we'll go on doing that. Glory to our defenders! Glory to Ukraine."" It's a style which now seems familiar, but at the time was a clear indication that the current Ukrainian government had appreciated the importance of wartime messaging, according to David Patrikarakos, a contributing editor at the online magazine UnHerd and author of the book ""War in 140 Characters: How Social Media Is Reshaping Conflict in the Twenty-First Century."" ""You see in those videos that Zelenskyy is both the President of Ukraine and a literal man in the street,"" Patrikarakos told ABC News. ""And the Ukrainian messaging at the beginning of the war was really focused on one message, which is, we will fight, but we are civilians who do not want to fight. The war has imposed this upon us."" While Zelenskyy has a background as a performer -- famously playing a teacher who accidentally become president in the sitcom 'Servant of the People' -- as a leader on the international stage he was perhaps best known as a figure in the impeachment of U.S. President Donald Trump, during which he was notably quiet. Now, he has drawn praise for rising to the challenges of a wartime communicator. ""I think what is interesting is that he is metamorphosing, right, how he changed and completely and blended with the new reality fast,"" Lutsevych said. ""That transformation happened quickly, partially because he is an actor, he understands the new setting, the new scene and he plays it."" Yet for all his success as a communicator, at the core of Zelenskyy's success as been the moral authority he carries in the face of the Russian invasion, according to John Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. ""His prominence is a result of his what I would call his sound and statesmanlike response to, again, this absolutely dreadful circumstance in which he found himself,"" Herbst told ABC News. ""He's demonstrated courage, boldness and, of course, the ability to frame his dilemma and his needs for all who want to listen, which includes the entire Western world."" That framing, as seen during his addresses to parliaments and legislatures around the world, has made his calls for international aid particularly effective. For the American people Zelenskyy invoked Pearl Harbor and quoted Martin Luther King. For the British, he quoted Shakespeare and Winston Churchill. Zelenskyy's tour was met with widespread acclaim, with tearful legislators resonating with his country's struggle as Zelenskyy appealed for more armaments and aid. He has not held back his criticism too, particularly for the U.N. Security Council, who he accused of failing to stand up to the Russian veto. ""What he's done is humanize the conflict,"" Patrikarakos. ""He made people care about Ukraine. And that's what affects policy."" The U.N. General Assembly has since adopted a procedure requiring a meeting of the body within 10 days if a veto is used in the Security Council by one of the five permanent members, including Russia. ""In an ideal world, if you have extraordinary needs, which Zelenskyy most definitely has, and you have nations that are sympathetic to you, they will meet your extraordinary needs when their interests require it,"" Herbst said. ""And then you do everything behind closed doors. The problem is that with this administration in Washington and with other governments in the West, you had the sympathy, but you had a certain nearsightedness that prevented them from doing what Ukraine needed. So he appealed publicly others in the United States and elsewhere to find satisfaction of his needs."" Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, found a more mixed reception in the Israeli Knesset, where his evocation of the actions of Nazi Germany drew criticism from some lawmakers and the media. ""The war is terrible but the comparison to the horrors of the Holocaust and the final solution is outrageous,"" one Israeli minister tweeted. And his performances when being questioned by journalists have not been as strong as his pre-written speeches, according to Lutsevych, but Zelenskyy and his small team of advisers essential to shaping the communications strategy have largely been successful. The regular communications of the government via social media, as well as the provision of translation and logistical services to news outlets, has proved important in disseminating their messages wider, according to Diane Nemec Ignashev, professor of Russian and the liberal arts at Carleton College. ""In terms of outreach, my estimation would be that Ukrainian official sources, insofar as they feed the Ukrainian news agencies, which in turn feed social media and the foreign media, are doing an excellent job getting information out to diverse audiences,"" Ignashev told ABC News. For the most part, Zelenskyy has found a receptive audience in the west. Ukraine has also found a friendly reception in other key areas of diplomacy, with Politico reporting last month on Ukraine's network of lobbyists -- some of whom are working pro bono -- who have pushed for military aid and sanctions on Russia in Washington, D.C., and London. Now, the war looks set to drag on much longer than anticipated, with some analysts now suggesting the fighting could continue through to the end of the year, and with that the focus of messaging has already changed. Early on, Ukraine's messaging highlighted its defiance, hammering home that there was a war that they believed they can win. Now the focus is on evidence of war crimes to keep the international community focused on meeting their obligations to Ukraine, Lutsevych said. Russia has defended itself vigorously against accusations of war crimes, even alleging that photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in cities like Bucha were a ""provocation."" ""That is important because that could also lead to defections and splits within the elite inside Russia,"" Lutsevych said on Ukrainian efforts to demonstrate evidence of war crimes. ""So I think we'll see more and more information on war crimes and also what is happening on the occupied territories, temporarily occupied territories Russia controls."" And the problem the Ukrainian authorities face is how to keep the international community fixed on their interests, continuing to send the arms and financial aid the country needs to fight and stay afloat. ""The challenge for the Ukrainians is how do you keep all this fresh. News cycles are fickle things, especially in this day and age,"" according to Patrikarakos. ""In the final analysis, the war on the ground is the most important thing, that's how people are getting killed,"" he said. ""But let's not forget this: communications, information warfare, whatever you want to call it, affects policy. Policy affects war. If policy brings you Stingers and Javelins and N-LAWs, all those things that have faced the Russian army for the last two months, that's what they've done very well.""",,,,25
2022-05-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukrainian-ambassador-calls-pelosis-visit-kyiv-special-delight/story?id=84418364,Ukrainian ambassador calls Pelosi's visit to Kyiv 'a special delight',"Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Oksana Markarova says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's surprise visit to Kyiv is ""yet another sign of a very very strong support that Ukraine has in the United States,"" calling it ""symbolic"" and ""a special delight"" to see her meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Overnight, Pelosi led a surprise congressional delegation to Kyiv and met Zelenskyy after Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Department of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with the Ukrainian leader last week. ""We believe that we are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom,"" Pelosi said in a video posted by Zelenskyy on Twitter early Sunday morning. The trip comes just days after President Joe Biden announced his request for Congress to approve a $33 billion in supplemental aid to Ukraine. ""There appears to be support for that $33 billion aid package. What more do you need?"" ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos asked the ambassador. ""We need all the assistance we can get in defensive weapons, in military support, in financial support, but also in humanitarian support. And I think this request covers all of these areas,"" she said. ""We feel and we know that Americans are our brothers and sisters in this fight for freedom for democracy and as we are about to review here in the United States the next package of support to Ukraine, which President Biden submitted recently to Congress, I believe it's very symbolic that Speaker Pelosi visited Ukraine,"" she added. The president's aid request has received some bipartisan support. Speaking to Stephanopoulos on Sunday morning, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said he expects Congress to approve it quickly but expressed disappointment that the legislature is not in session and can't move more quickly. ""If I were speaker for a day, I'd call Congress back into session, back into work as we're not -- we won't be in session next week. But every day we don't send them more weapons is a day where more people will be killed and a day where they could lose this war,"" he said. Russian leaders have been ramping up the rhetoric and nuclear threats in recent days as Russian President Vladimir Putin has intensified his military's attacks in the southern and eastern regions. When pressed by Stephanopoulos on whether Putin has turned the tide in the war, Markarova said Russia has yet to fulfill ""any of the objectives that they have declared."" ""They are trying to scare Ukrainians, they are trying to scare the world, but the fact and the truth is that Ukrainians are not afraid and our president and all Ukrainians are bravely defending our country -- and the world is not afraid,"" she said. Stephanopoulos continued: ""We’re now on the third month of this war. When this begun, did you believe it’d go on this long?"" ""Well, you know, this attack from Russia, our country experienced for the past 400 years,"" Markarova said. ""Sometimes, it was full fledge wars like now. Sometimes it was occupations and oppressions. So, this is not something unfamiliar to us. But I think it has been an eye-opening two months for the world."" ""So, of course, we are trying and we are doing everything possible on the battlefield but also on the diplomatic front to stop this war as soon as possible,"" she added, ""But as this war was started by Russians, it has to be ended by Russians. And we really hope that they will make their decision faster.""",,,,7
2022-05-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/officials-push-back-report-us-intel-helping-ukraine/story?id=84518393,Officials push back on report US intel helping Ukraine target Russian generals,"U.S. officials on Thursday pushed back on a New York Times report that said the U.S. provided Ukraine intelligence that helped it target and kill Russian generals and other senior officers. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson took exception to the story's headline: ""U.S. Intelligence Is Helping Ukraine Kill Russian Generals, Officials Say."" ""The headline of this story is misleading and the way it is framed is irresponsible. The United States provides battlefield intelligence to help the Ukrainians defend their country. We do not provide intelligence with the intent to kill Russian generals,"" Watson said, drawing a semantic distinction, appearing to want to distance the U.S. from any direct involvement in an attack on Russian commanders. A second U.S. official with knowledge of U.S. intelligence-sharing with Ukraine confirmed that the U.S. provides intelligence on movements of Russian units and command posts, but not on individual Russian military leaders. ""The U.S. is not providing intelligence on Russian generals,"" the official told ABC News Wednesday evening. A third official told ABC News the same: ""That is not how we operate."" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby offered clarifying remarks during a press briefing Thursday. ""The United States provides battlefield intelligence to help Ukrainians defend their country,"" Kirby said. ""We do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in the targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military."" The New York Times story originally cited American officials claiming U.S. intelligence ""has helped Ukrainians target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in action in the Ukraine war."" Officials say it is correct, as reported by the Times, that the Ukrainians are able to combine what they learn from the U.S. with their own intelligence to then target Russian leaders. But they emphasized that the U.S. does not play a direct role in targeting individuals on the battlefield. Other nations are also sharing intelligence with Ukraine, which has its own ""robust"" capabilities, according to Kirby. ""Ukraine combines information that we and other partners provide with the intelligence that they themselves are gathering on the battlefield, and then they make their own decisions, and they take their own actions,"" Kirby said. The Kremlin also responded to the article, saying its troops are aware of intelligence-assistance for Ukraine coming from the West. ""Our servicemen are well aware that the United States, the United Kingdom and NATO in general are providing intelligence and information about other parameters to the Ukrainian Armed Forces on a permanent basis. This is well known and, of course, together with the arms supply to Ukraine by the same countries and the alliance, all of those actions are not helping rapidly finalize the operation, although they cannot hinder the achievement of objectives set for the special military operation,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a press briefing Thursday. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has claimed 12 Russian generals have been killed since the invasion, though U.S. officials have not confirmed this when asked. One reason senior officers might be particularly vulnerable is due to the structure of Russia's military. ""They do not delegate authority,"" said Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East and ABC News contributor. ""So, they are out giving orders directly to their forces."" Unlike the U.S. military, Russia does not empower its non-commissioned and junior officers with the authority to make decisions on their own, according to Mulroy. ""It's the only way to effectively fight in modern combined arms maneuver warfare,"" he said. ""The lack of delegation is another reason the Russian military is performing so poorly."" Top American military leaders have publicly stated the U.S. is sharing intelligence to help Ukrainians in their fight against Russia's invading forces. ""We have opened up the pipes,"" Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told senators Tuesday. ""There is a significant amount of intelligence flowing to the Ukraine from the United States."" The officials ABC News spoke to could not say whether the U.S. has any hard rules in place against giving Ukraine intelligence on high-level leaders, including top Russian general Valery Gerasimov, who spent multiple days in the contested Donbas region last week. But according to Mulroy, there is nothing wrong in principle with helping Ukraine kill Russian generals. ""Targeting generals is fully lawful, targeting non-combatant civilians is not,"" Mulroy said. ""If Russian generals don't want to be targeted, they should withdraw their forces and return to Russia."" ABC News' Molly Nagle contributed to this report.",,,,9
2022-05-07,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russias-victory-day-mark-key-milestone-war-ukraine/story?id=84491309,Russia's Victory Day to mark key milestone in war with Ukraine,"LONDON -- On May 9, Russia will celebrate Victory Day, its huge national holiday commemorating the anniversary of the defeat of the Nazis during World War II with a military parade through the streets of Moscow. Reports suggest that, in terms of firepower, it will be a less extravagant display, with fewer tanks and other military hardware set to take part, but this year's event carries extra significance. ""The original significance of V Day was the same for the USSR as for the other allies,"" Catriona Kelly, a professor of Russian and Soviet Culture at Trinity College, Cambridge, told ABC News. ""In the 1990s, on the other hand, commemoration became much less important, and was revived again, on an unprecedented scale, in the Putin era."" Under Putin, Victory Day has become Russia's central national holiday and veneration of the Soviet victory a cornerstone of his regime. Putin revived the military parades marking the holiday, and they have grown in size almost each year since 2014, becoming a showcase of Russian military might. War commemoration serves as a ""basis of an aggressive patriotism based on the perception of an external threat to the country's survival,"" Kelly said. An estimated 27 million people from the Soviet Union died during the Second World War, an enormous death toll that dwarfs that of other countries, and memory of the war still holds deep personal significance for many Russians. Putin's avowed goal to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine is directly linked to the Kremlin's efforts to cultivate that history for its political ends, according to Mark Galeotti, a security expert on Russian affairs. ""Largely the whole point was exactly to try and wrap this war in the mantle of what they call the Great Patriotic War,"" Galeotti said. ""Remember, Putin expected this to be a quick and easy victory in two weeks. I think this was going to be his kind of claim to historical fame. You know, this is going to be his moment, he wanted it to be comparable to victory over Nazis."" Ukraine and Western countries, as well as independent experts, believe the Kremlin had hoped to set Victory Day as a deadline to achieve a military victory in the war with Ukraine or at least to declare the conquest of the Donbas region. But the disastrous course of the war so far for Russia -- that has seen it retreat from Kyiv and its current offensive on east Ukraine now stalled -- has forced the Kremlin to approach the day differently. The British armed forces minister recently said that Russia will ""probably"" use Victory Day as an opportunity to formally declare war on Ukraine, but the Kremlin has denied this. ""That would be a great irony if Moscow used the occasion of Victory Day to declare war, which in itself would allow them to surge conscripts in a way they're not able to do now,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters recently. ""In a way, that would be tantamount to revealing to the world that their war effort is failing, that they are floundering in their military campaign and military objectives."" During the past ten weeks of war, many analysts have pointed to May 9 as a key marker, a date where Putin will have to show the Russian people a ""prize"" from the war, which is only referred to in the country as a ""special military operation."" That ""prize"" could be Mariupol, the beleaguered port city that has been the site of some of the worst fighting and bombing since the war began, though there is no hiding that the war has not gone to plan. ""Any Russian victory that can be proclaimed at this stage will look like an approximation at best, though the onslaught on Azovstal in Mariupol in recent days suggests that complete capture of the city will be represented as a prize"" on May 9, Kelly said. Ukraine's military has claimed that the streets of the city, where tens of thousands are feared to have been killed under the Russian assault, are being cleared of debris in preparation for a parade there on Victory Day. Russian intelligence assessments initially said that the capital of Kyiv would fall within a matter of days of the invasion, but stiff Ukrainian resistance and a united front in the West have now changed the kind of Victory Day the Kremlin will be commemorating. Even so, Putin retains a tight control of the narrative around the war, and so far, the impact that could reverberate at home when news of the thousands of Russians killed emerges, has not been felt. ""I'm sure Putin would have loved to have had the victory to announce for Victory Day,"" Galeotti told ABC News. ""But ... when you have all the state media under your control and you've squeezed out every element of independent media, in some ways you get to write the narrative, and then the narrative will be that Mariupol is won, that this was never about taking all of Ukraine."" From the information available, public opinion seems to be narrowly in favor of the war in Russia, though Galeotti said the image projected of the ""special operation"" in the Russian media has ""nothing at all to do with the reality of what's happened."" Whatever Putin says in his speech on Victory Day, there has been no suggestion that Russia will be winding down its war anytime soon, even if their war aims have now changed to create a land corridor to Crimea. ""Putin has to 'win', or to put it differently, he has no reverse gear,"" Kelly said. ""That means his only means of reacting to a miscalculation is to fight back. All the evidence suggests that he expected a rapid collapse of the Ukrainian armed forces of the kind that happened in Crimea in 2014. And he didn't expect pushback from Western countries on the level there has been. Ukraine has been a shock from both points of view and is the biggest challenge of his political career.""",,,,26

Sitting at his desk in the Oval Office on Monday, President Joe Biden signed the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 into law. The legislation gives Biden the authority to lend or lease defense equipment to Ukraine and other Eastern European nations as Russia's aggression in the region continues. ""It matters, it really matters,"" Biden said as he signed the bill. A similar lend-lease program was enacted in 1941 to provide pivotal aid to Allied nations in the battle against Nazi Germany. President Franklin Roosevelt said at the time that the U.S. should serve as a ""great arsenal of democracy"" to defeat Adolf Hitler. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was ""grateful"" to Biden and the American people for their support. ""Today's signing of the law on Lend-Lease is a historic step,"" Zelenskyy tweeted. ""I am convinced that we will win together again. And we will defend democracy in Ukraine. And in Europe."" The Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 was a bipartisan undertaking, passing the Senate by unanimous consent and the House of Representatives with 417 votes. Rep. John Katko, a cosponsor of the bill, said the law will ""expand our nation's ability to expeditiously deliver additional defense articles to the Government of Ukraine as they fight back against Vladimir Putin's barbaric and unlawful invasion."" ""This is a necessary step to protect the future of Ukraine and the safety of its people,"" Katko, R-N.Y., added. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, also cosponsor of the lend-lease legislation, said Congress ""cannot let up"" on providing assistance to Ukraine. ""As Ukraine fights for its future -- and the future of liberal democracies around the globe -- delivering military equipment to the frontlines is paramount,"" Shaheen, D-N.H., told ABC News in a statement. Biden signed the bill just hours after Russia's commemoration of Victory Day, a holiday celebrating the 77th anniversary of the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany. Russian President Vladimir Putin used the occasion to defend his invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24. ""You are fighting for the motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of the Second World War,"" Putin said in a speech on Monday. Putin notably did not make any declaration of war or victory during his remarks. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, remained defiant, stating there will soon be ""two Victory Days in Ukraine."" ""On the Day of Victory over Nazism, we are fighting for a new victory,"" Zelenskyy said in a video message. ""The road to it is difficult, but we have no doubt that we will win.""",,,,9
2022-05-09,https://abcnews.go.com/International/putin-defends-ukraine-invasion-marking-wwii-victory/story?id=84586995,Putin defends Ukraine invasion while marking WWII victory,"LONDON -- During a military parade in Moscow on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed his troops fighting in neighboring Ukraine, but offered little insight into his next steps. ""You are fighting for the motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of the Second World War,"" Putin said in a patriotic speech for Victory Day, a national holiday in Russia commemorating the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Columns of Russian soldiers marched through Moscow's Red Square, alongside tanks and other military vehicles boasting huge intercontinental ballistic missiles. ""Now here, on the Red Square, soldiers and officers from many regions of our vast homeland stand shoulder to shoulder, including those who came directly from Donbas, directly from the combat zone,"" Putin said. Putin launched a ""special military operation"" into Ukraine on Feb. 24, with Russian forces invading from Belarus, to the north, and Russia, to the east. They quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv, but ultimately failed to seize the Ukrainian capital and other major cities in the north. Russian forces were met with strong resistance from Ukrainian troops, despite weeks of relentless bombardment that decimated entire neighborhoods and claimed civilian lives. The Russian military announced on March 29 it would scale down activities in the north around Kyiv and Chernihiv and instead focus its efforts on the ""liberation"" of the disputed Donbas region in the east, which is home to a mostly Russian-speaking population. Russia-backed separatist forces have controlled two breakaway republics of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Donbas since 2014, following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. On April 18, the Russian military began a full-scale ground offensive in Donbas in an attempt to capture the strategic port city of Mariupol and to secure a coastal corridor to Crimea. Although he showed no signs of backing down, Putin on Monday did not make any declarations of war, peace or victory during his remarks at the Victory Day parade. He drew parallels between Soviet soldiers battling Nazi troops and the Russian forces fighting now in Ukraine, as he has vowed to ""de-Nazify"" the former Soviet republic. He also spoke of Donbas as if it was already part of Russia. ""These days, you are fighting for our people in the Donbas. For the security of our homeland, Russia,"" he said. ""You are defending what fathers and grandfathers, great-grandfathers fought for."" Putin accused Ukraine of seeking to attain nuclear weapons and planning a ""punitive operation in the Donbas, for an invasion of our historical lands, including Crimea."" He also laid blame on the West for refusing to have ""an honest dialogue"" about Russia's demands for formal guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will pull back its forces from countries in eastern Europe that joined after the Cold War. ""Thus, an absolutely unacceptable threat was systematically created for us and directly at our borders,"" Putin added. ""The danger was growing everyday."" The Russian leader claimed that attacking Ukraine ""was a forced, timely and only right decision -- the decision of a sovereign, strong, independent country."" ""Russia has given a preemptive rebuff to aggression,"" he said. Just hours before Putin's remarks, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy released a video message marking the 1945 victory over the Nazis, telling his country that ""very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine."" ""Today, we celebrate the Day of Victory over Nazism. And we will not give anyone a single piece of our history,"" Zelenskyy said. ""We are proud of our ancestors who, together with other nations in the anti-Hitler coalition, defeated Nazism. And we will not allow anyone to annex this victory, we will not allow it to be appropriated."" ""On the Day of Victory over Nazism, we are fighting for a new victory,"" he added. ""The road to it is difficult, but we have no doubt that we will win.""",,,,28

So far, about 6,000 Ukrainians of the 19,000 who applied have received authorization to travel to the U.S. after passing background checks and biometric screenings, DHS said in a statement. The program requires Ukrainians to have a private sponsor in the U.S. who must also complete a background check and prove they have the financial means to support those granted refuge. The program is part of President Joe Biden's promise to allow 100,000 Ukrainians to seek refuge in the U.S. Other legal pathways are also still available through the State Department that will count toward the 100,000 objective. ""We are proud to deliver on President Biden's commitment to welcome 100,000 Ukrainians and others fleeing Russian aggression to the United States. The Ukrainian people continue to suffer immense tragedy and loss as a result of Putin's unprovoked and unjustified attack on their country,"" Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement last month. ""DHS will continue to provide relief to the Ukrainian people, while supporting our European allies who have shouldered so much as the result of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine."" Before ""United for Ukraine"" was established, about 20,000 Ukrainians without prior authorization entered the U.S. along the southern border, according to a DHS court filing. With the pre-authorization program up and running, authorities have taken a harder line on admitting Ukrainians who show up at the border without proper documentation. That shift left dozens stranded on the Mexican side of a border crossing near San Diego and potentially many more elsewhere along the border, the San Diego Union Tribune reported last month. More than 5.8 million refugees have fled Ukraine, according to the UNHCR, with the majority traveling to eastern European nations including Poland and Romania.",,,,2
2022-05-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/putin-prepping-prolonged-conflict-donbas-escalate-nuclear-threats/story?id=84626300,"Putin prepping 'prolonged conflict' beyond Donbas, could escalate nuclear threats: Top US intel official","Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a ""prolonged conflict"" in Ukraine, and could resort to drastic measures if the fighting doesn't go his way, according to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday, Haines said Putin's invasion of Ukraine has sent a shock through the geopolitical order, ""with implications for the future that we are only beginning to understand, but are sure to be consequential."" Though Putin has focused his forces on Donbas after failing in the north, the U.S. does not believe he will be content with the eastern part of the country, Haines said. ""The next month or two of fighting will be significant as the Russians attempt to reinvigorate their efforts. But even if they are successful, we are not confident that the fight in the Donbas will effectively end the war,"" she said. ""We assess President Putin is preparing for prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas."" But for now Putin's goal is to take control of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in Donbas and encircle Ukrainian forces from the north and south ""in order to crush the most capable and well-equipped Ukrainian forces who are fighting to hold the line in the East,"" Haines said. Putin would also like to ""consolidate control of the land bridge Russia has established from Crimea to the Donbas, occupy Kherson, and control the water source for Crimea,"" she said. The U.S. also sees signs his military wants to extend that land bridge to Transnistria, in Moldova, according to Haines. Haines said Russia might be capable of achieving ""most"" of those goals in the coming months, but would need to mobilize more troops to achieve the last: ""We believe that they will not be able to extend control over a land bridge that stretches to Transnistria and includes Odessa without launching some form of mobilization. And it is increasingly unlikely that they will be able to establish control over both oblasts and the buffer zone they desire in the coming weeks,"" Haines said. But Putin is ""probably counting on U.S. and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation, energy prices get worse,"" she added. Economic forces are at work in Russia as well, with sanctions from the West having a ""pretty significant"" impact on Russia, according to Haines. ""Among the indicators that one might look at are, for example, the fact that ... we predict approximately 20% inflation in Russia, that we expect that their GDP will fall about 10%, possibly even more, over the course of the year,"" she said. The fighting itself has also worn on Russia's capabilities. ""Our view is that the ground combat forces have been degraded considerably. It's going to take them years ... to rebuild that,"" she said. But degraded conventual forces could drive Putin to other means of exerting force. ""That may end up meaning that they have greater reliance in effect on asymmetric tools during this period,"" Haines said. ""So they may rely more on things like cyber, nuclear, precision, etc. And that's obviously a shift in the way in which they are exercising their efforts for influence."" The discrepancy between Putin's high aspirations and his degraded conventional capability could lead to ""a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory,"" and ""a period of more ad-hoc decision making in Russia"" in the next few months, Haines said. This could also manifest itself domestically. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on, or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine,"" she said. What could happen next? ""The most likely flashpoints for escalation in the coming weeks are around increasing Russian attempts to interdict Western security assistance, retaliation for Western economic sanctions or threats to the regime at home. We believe that Moscow continues to use nuclear rhetoric to deter the United States and the West from increasing lethal aid to Ukraine and to respond to public comments of the U.S. and NATO allies that suggest expanded Western goals in the conflict,"" she said. The next step for Putin could be to launch major nuclear drills to command respect from the U.S. ""If Putin perceives that the United States is ignoring his threats, he may try to signal to Washington the heightened danger of its support to Ukraine by authorizing another large nuclear exercise involving a major dispersal of mobile intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers, strategic submarines,"" Haines said. But so far U.S. officials have said they do not believe Russia is preparing to actually use nuclear weapons in Ukraine or elsewhere. ""We otherwise continue to believe that President Putin would probably only authorize the use of nuclear weapons if he perceived an existential threat to the Russian state or regime,"" Haines said.",,,,14

The civilian was a resident of Chupakhivka who was riding a bike on the roadside when he was shot, Venediktova alleged. Shishmarin is charged with murder and two counts of robbery. He surrendered to Ukrainian law enforcement on the same day and has been a prisoner of war since, Ukrainian prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said. Shishmarin's lawyer and a public defender, Viktor Ovsiannikov, refused to disclose his strategy, but said the fact the soldier was following orders does not legally constitute a defense. It’s up to the judges whether to take that under consideration. The length of the trial will depend on how the defendant will plead, but the prosecution has sufficient proof regardless, Syniuk told ABC News. Syniuk also said Shishmarin has cooperated throughout the investigation. Shishimarin is the first member of the Russian military to be facing a criminal trial, Venediktova said in a post on Facebook. Prosecutor Andriy Syniuk told ABC News that trying this case should set the standard and prove that Ukraine is a country with a rule of law and respect for human rights.

2022-05-16,https://abcnews.go.com/International/finland-sweden-set-announce-stance-nato-membership/story?id=84595411,"Sweden to apply to join NATO, joining Finland in ending nonaligned status","LONDON and HELSINKI -- Sweden will apply to formally join NATO, following in the footsteps of neighboring Finland, the country's prime minister said, ending long-held positions of neutrality in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""The best for our country's security is that Sweden applies for membership in NATO and that we do it now together with Finland,"" Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Monday. ""And following today's debate in Parliament, the government is ready to make a decision about an application. That will be the starting point for a process that includes ratification in all the NATO member's parliaments and after that, the government will return to Parliament with a proposal for ratification for Swedish membership of NATO."" ""As nonaligned countries, Sweden and Finland have been contributing to stability in our region, but that changed when Russia invaded Ukraine,"" she added. President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland announced their intention to apply for NATO membership on Sunday, with the country's Parliament expected to endorse the proposal as a formality. Leaders in both Sweden and Finland had long been expected to apply to join the military alliance, as the war in Ukraine continues to have unintended consequences for Russia by potentially pushing two more of its neighbors into NATO. Last week, Dmitry Peskov, Russia's presidential press secretary, said that ""another enlargement of NATO does not make our continent more stable and secure."" Peskov reiterated that stance on Monday, saying that although Russia had ""no territorial disputes"" with Sweden and Finland, unlike in Ukraine, Russia believed it to be a ""serious issue"" that they are following ""very closely."" Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Ann Linde said last week that Finland's leaders had delivered an ""important message,"" adding that her country ""will decide after the report from the security policy consultations has been presented."" The Scandinavian countries have long held neutral status when it comes to European conflict. Finland became a neutral country after the Second World War, while Sweden has resisted military alliances long before that. Yet fears that Russia could do to other non-NATO countries what it has done to Ukraine has sparked a rapid shift in public opinion in both countries, one of which, Finland, shares an 830-mile land border with Russia. Both could be on the cusp of joining NATO. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has publicly said the Nordic countries would be welcomed into the alliance, however the process could take months once their formal applications have been sent in. Ahead of any official announcement from both countries for NATO membership, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously signed mutual security assurances in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. NATO's expansion would be yet another unintended consequence for Russia, as they continue to be met with fierce resistance in Ukraine and a more united West than their intelligence assessments anticipated. Part of Russia's security demands ahead of the invasion in Ukraine included reverting NATO forces to 1997 positions. Since NATO was founded in 1949, the alliance has expanded to include 30 member countries, including three former Soviet republics, and the inclusion of Sweden and Finland would further expand the alliance's influence in the Arctic and in the areas around Russia. Stoltenberg said just days ahead of the invasion ""if Kremlin's aim is to have less NATO on Russia's borders, it will only get more NATO. And if it wants to divide NATO, it will only get an even more united Alliance."" This prediction now appears to be coming true -- although Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov last month said that NATO is a ""tool sharpened for confrontation"" and it is ""not an alliance that ensures peace and stability"" when asked about Sweden and Finland. Experts say the expansion will be evidence of yet another strategic blunder on Russia's part. Even as public opinion has shifted, there are still those that opposes NATO membership for the Nordic countries, fearing it would lead to increased tensions with Russia. ""I'm afraid that NATO membership will increase actually the tensions in the Baltic Sea region and also will increase the tensions in Finland, especially regarding the eastern border,"" Veronika Honkasalo, one of the few members of Finland's parliament who doesn't believe the country should join, told ABC News. Furthermore, there are concerns that Sweden and Finland could be vulnerable to Russian attacks during the application process, though State Department spokesperson Ned Price moved to reassure both countries last week, saying: ""I am certain that we will find ways to address concerns they may have regarding the period between the potential application and the final ratification."" However, polling reported in both countries appears to show a significant majority are in favor of NATO membership. ""[Putin] has for years said Finland and Sweden joining is a red line,"" Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, told ABC News. ""He's managed to drive both Finland and Sweden towards NATO. So I think a massive miscalculation for him, but I think a positive thing for the rest of Europe."" ""It's very clearly the population that changed its opinion in, say, six months, radically so,"" he said, adding that the shift in public opinion had a snowball effect into Sweden, as fears grew about what could happen without the umbrella protection of NATO membership as the war in Ukraine continued. ""Now Russia has gone so far that joining NATO seems to be the only genuine solution here,"" he said.",,,,27

Mariupol's mayor confirmed that a cease-fire remains in place in the port city. The Ukrainian military ordered remaining troops who had been sheltering beneath the Azovstal steel factory to focus on efforts to save the lives of their personnel. More than 260 Ukrainian soldiers were evacuated through a humanitarian corridor, some of whom were injured, according to Ukraine's defense minister. Malyar said that 53 wounded soldiers are being transported from Azovstal to Novoazovsk where they will receive immediate medical attention. ""About Azovstal, we hope that we'll manage to save their lives. There are seriously injured among them. I want to stress that we need our defenders alive.

Another 211 Ukrainian fighters were accompanied by Russian forces from Azovstal to Olenivka in rebel-held Donetsk, where they will be part of the exchange for Russian prisoners of war. ""As a part of an exchange deal, 50 wounded were evacuated from Azovstal to Novoazovsk. Negotiations are underway for them to be transferred to Zaporozhzhya,"" another source told ABC News, confirming the exchange. Russia's state-run TASS reported that Russia's defense ministry confirmed an agreement was reached on Monday to evacuate wounded Ukrainian troops from the plant and transport them to a medical facility in Novoazovsk to ""provide them with all the necessary assistance.""

""Let me be clear: New members joining NATO is not a threat to any nation,"" Biden said. ""It never has been. NATO's purpose is to defend against aggression, that's its purpose, to defend."" Finland and Sweden's move to join the alliance is also welcomed by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who said Wednesday the nations are their ""closest partners."" ""All allies agree on the importance of NATO enlargement,"" Stoltenberg said at a news conference. ""We all agree that we must stand together. And we all agree that this is an historic moment, which we must seize."" The request must be approved by all of NATO's 30 member countries, making Erdogan's objection a potential headache. ""We have told our relevant friends we would say 'no' to Finland and Sweden's entry into NATO, and we will continue on our path like this,"" Erdogan said in a video statement on Thursday. Erdogan has been critical of both countries, stating he perceives them as being supportive of groups Turkey views as extremist -- including the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Both Sweden's prime minister and Finland's president addressed Turkey's disapproval during their visit to the White House. ""Finland has always had proud and good bilateral relations to Turkey,"" Niinistö said. ""As NATO allies, we will commit to Turkey's security, just as Turkey will commit to our security. We take terrorism seriously, we condemn terrorism in all its forms and we are actively engaged in combating it. We are open to discussing all the concerns Turkey may have concerning our membership in an open and constructive manner."" Andersson said Sweden is having dialogues with all NATO members, Turkey included, to sort out any issues at hand. Despite Turkey's opposition, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told ABC White House Correspondent MaryAlice Parks on Wednesday the administration is ""confident at the end of the day"" that Finland and Sweden ""will have an effective and efficient accession process"" and that ""Turkey's concerns can be addressed."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu met in New York on Wednesday to ""reaffirm their strong cooperation as partners and NATO allies,"" according to a joint statement. ""They discussed ways and assessed concrete steps to enhance their cooperation on defense issues, counterterrorism, energy and food security, combatting climate change and boosting trade ties, while agreeing to intensify consultations on a range of regional issues,"" the statement read.",,,,8
2022-05-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/inside-submarine-capable-launching-nuclear-missiles/story?id=84832056,Inside the submarine capable of launching nuclear missiles,"America's main nuclear deterrent glides undetected under the oceans as it carries a cargo of ballistic missiles that will hopefully never be used. Off the coast of Hawaii, ABC News visited the USS Maine, one of 14 Ohio Class U.S. Navy submarines capable of launching nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. Measuring two football fields in length and weighing 18,000 tons, the massive submarine carries 20 Trident 2 D5 missiles capable of striking targets up to 4,000 miles away. Each missile is capable of holding up to 12 nuclear warheads -- one reason why these submarines are able to carry about 70% of the nation's active nuclear arsenal allowed by the New START Treaty. ""I'd say it's the most powerful force in the world right now,"" Vice Adm. Bill Houston, the commander of the U.S. Navy's Submarine Forces, told ABC News. But in keeping with U.S. policy, Houston could neither confirm nor deny whether there were missiles with nuclear warheads aboard the submarine. The Navy screened ABC News’ footage of the visit to the submarine for operational and security reasons. You can see more of Martha's rare access inside the sub and exclusive reporting on America's nuclear defense this Sunday on ""This Week."" Developed at the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the submarines have continued with their classified missions, serving as a key part of America's nuclear triad that includes strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) housed in the western plains states. Recent comments by Russian leaders about their strategic nuclear capabilities following the invasion of Ukraine have shined a spotlight on America's nuclear deterrence mission. Houston characterized comments by Russian leaders about Russia's nuclear weapons capability as ""very dangerous,"" ""irresponsible"" and ""unprofessional."" ""It gives more meaning to this mission,"" said Houston. ""But we view our mission as a peace mission, purely defensive is what we do."" He added, ""And so when they saber rattle, this deterrent here is meant to prevent that from occurring."" A main part of why Ohio Class submarines are a powerful nuclear deterrent is because they are undetectable in vast stretches of ocean, making an adversary susceptible to a retaliatory strike should it carry out a strategic attack against the United States. To stay hidden, the submarine will surface very rarely -- if at all -- during what could be a months-long patrol underwater. ""This submarine, once it's underwater, it will not be detected,"" said Houston. ""It is the one portion of our deterrent that will always be available if needed."" And maintaining that deterrent means that not even senior military leaders will know where the submarine is at any given time. That's a privilege available only to the submarine's senior leaders. The crew will regularly train for the unthinkable, like the launch of nuclear-armed missiles in a retaliatory strike against a country that has carried out a strategic attack against the United States. ABC News was allowed to witness a simulated launch exercise where redundancies are an integral security measure intended to ensure the validity of a presidential order to launch missiles. ""United States policy is not to aim our missiles at any adversary or any country,"" said Cmdr. Darren Gerhardt. ""If we said they're targeted, they would be pointing to the spot in the ocean. They don't go anywhere."" Living with the Trident missiles is also a regular part of life for the 150 sailors on the submarine. The sailors have to maneuver their way through hallways lined by 24 missile tubes that house ICBMs. The missiles are also located near the sleeping berths. Crew members carry out their assignments in shifts with some gathering for breakfast at 3 a.m. With the submarine operating hundreds of feet below the surface, the crew has little awareness about what is going on in the world. At times the submarine will come up to periscope depth to receive satellite signals for updates on what's going on in the world. But that maneuver carries risk. ""But when I do come up to periscope depth that makes me vulnerable,"" said Gerhardt. ""So I have to minimize the amount of times I do that."" And when the crew returns to their families, ""we're catching up on several months' worth of information that we missed,"" Gerhardt said. Both Houston and Gerhardt said they're used to this life under the sea. ""I would say this is where we're more comfortable,"" said Houston. ""A pilot likes to be in the air. We like to be under the sea."" Added Gerhardt, ""This is our home.""",,,,1
2022-05-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-supplied-howitzers-ukraine-lack-accuracy-aiding-computers/story?id=84840798,US-supplied howitzers to Ukraine lack accuracy-aiding computers,"KYIV -- Dozens of artillery systems supplied by the United States to Ukraine were not fitted with advanced computer systems, which improve the efficiency and accuracy of the weapons, ABC News has learned. The M777 155mm howitzers are now being used by the Ukrainian military in its war with Russia. The Pentagon did not deny that the artillery pieces were supplied without the computers but said it had received ""positive feedback"" from the Ukrainians about the ""precise and highly effective"" weapons. That positive sentiment was echoed by a Ukrainian politician, who spoke to ABC News on condition of anonymity. However, the politician also expressed frustration that the artillery pieces had not been the fitted with the digital computer systems. Artillery is currently playing a crucial role in the fighting raging in eastern Ukraine as Russia continues its offensive in that part of the country. U.S. officials recently confirmed that all but one of the 90 howitzers promised to Ukraine had now been delivered, along with tactical vehicles used to tow them. If fitted to a howitzer, the digital computer system enables the crew operating the weapon to quickly and accurately pinpoint a target. Howitzers without a computer system can still be fired accurately, using traditional methods to calculate the angle needed to hit a target. Modern computer systems, however, rule-out the possibility of human error. Why the artillery pieces supplied to Ukraine did not have the digital targeting technology installed is unclear. The Pentagon said it would not discuss individual components ""for operational security reasons."" ABC News contributor Steve Ganyard, a retired colonel in the United State Marine Corps, said the reason for not providing the computers would be ""compromise."" ""It’s a risk assessment the U.S. does with any export,"" he said. ""If this piece of kit ends up in Moscow, what is the damage to U.S. security? In this case they couldn’t share the best the U.S. has,"" he said. The revelation about the lack of computer systems on the howitzers comes amid broader frustration in Ukrainian political circles that the U.S. has not yet supplied certain types of advanced weaponry. To date, the U.S. and its allies have provided Ukraine with an impressive quantity and array of weapons including thousands of anti-tank missiles, thousands of anti-aircraft missiles, hundreds of armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers and hundreds of attack drones. However, the Ukrainian government is currently lobbying the United States for multiple rocket launcher systems and western-made fighter jets, such as F16s Ukrainian politicians interviewed by ABC News said it was urgent that Ukraine received these types of weapons now, because they believe that Russia is vulnerable following a string of failures on the battlefield. ""Russia is very weak now. Their army is very demoralized,"" said a Ukrainian politician. ""What we are saying is that we need all the multi-rocket-launcher systems now. This is the best time for us to get the Russians out of our country."" ""To do that, we need really good U.S. weapons,"" the politician said. ABC News' Luis Martinez contributed to this report.",,,,9
2022-06-01,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kremlin-warns-biden-sending-rockets-ukraine-adding-fuel/story?id=85106529,Kremlin warns Biden sending rockets to Ukraine 'adding fuel to the fire',"The Kremlin said Wednesday that President Joe Biden's plans to send advanced rocket systems to Ukraine was ""adding fuel to the fire."" ""We know that the United States has been purposefully and meticulously adding fuel to the fire,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. ""The United States pursues the course towards fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian."" Biden said Tuesday the U.S. would provide advanced rocket systems to help Ukraine defend itself, as Russia's invasion nears the 100-day mark. ""We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table,"" Biden wrote in an opinion piece in The New York Times. ""That's why I've decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine. Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Wednesday that if Ukraine receives multiple-launch rocket systems from the West there were ""risks"" of a third country becoming involved in the conflict, according to Interfax. ""Such risks, of course, exist,"" he told reporters, responding to a question, according to Interfax. The White House principal deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, said Wednesday morning that ""Russia has brought this on itself."" ""We don't negotiate our security assistance packages to Ukraine with the Kremlin,"" Finer said during an interview with CNN, adding that Biden had warned Russian President Vladimir Putin ""directly"" that if he ""launched a new, renewed invasion of Ukraine, the United States would increase the amount of security assistance we were providing, including new and advanced systems."" ""They have not been pleased by the amount of security assistance we've been providing to the Ukrainians, frankly, since far before this most recent phase of the conflict began,"" Finer said. The United States will send high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), which will enable the Ukrainians to ""more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield from a greater distance inside Ukraine, and to help them repel Russians,"" a senior Biden administration official told reporters Tuesday. The missiles will be provided as part of a new $700 million security assistance package for Ukraine -- the 11th of its kind from the U.S. -- which will also include additional Javelin anti-tank missiles, helicopters, tactical vehicles and artillery rounds. The HIMARS is a longer-range rocket system that can fire munitions up to 190 miles. But the munitions the U.S. plans to provide Ukraine have a maximum range of around 43 miles, according to Pentagon officials. Officials say they wanted to limit the range so that the weapons would be used on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine but not fired farther into Russia itself. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the weapons systems were ""precisely what they need to defend themselves against the ongoing Russian aggression."" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, standing alongside Blinken in Washington, said the United States' support was ""making a difference on the battlefield every day,"" and called the latest round of assistance ""a demonstration of real U.S. leadership."" As Russia has shifted its invasion to the east of the country, Ukrainian fighters have found themselves outgunned by a Russian military with more powerful artillery. Ukraine has struggled to push back Russian advances, and its leaders have long asked the U.S. to send more powerful guns. ""We need more heavy weapons delivered as soon as possible, especially MLRS, to repel Russian attacks,"" Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted last week, referring to multiple-launch rocket systems. An official stressed Tuesday that the Ukrainians had given the United States ""assurances they will not use"" the new systems the U.S. is providing ""against targets in Russian territory."" ""The Ukrainians have given us assurances that they will not use these systems against targets on Russian territory,"" Blinken said Wednesday. The administration has taken pains to underscore this distinction, given Russia's warning that advanced systems would be seen as an escalation. ""We are mindful of the escalation risks in everything we're doing with this,"" Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters Wednesday. ""We've been mindful of that, but at the same time, Russia doesn't get a veto over what we send to the Ukrainians."" Biden's announcement came a day after he sparked confusion during a quick exchange with a reporter outside the White House. Asked if he planned ""to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine,"" Biden only responded, ""We're not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia."" White House officials clarified they were still considering sending longer-range systems to Russia. Ultimately, the U.S. stopped short of sharing the longest-range ammunition that could be fired by the HIMARS. As part of the $700 million package, the U.S. will be sending four HIMARS to Ukraine along with precision ammunition. The systems had been pre-placed inside Europe in anticipation of Biden granting Ukraine's request for the systems so as to speed up the transfer, according to Kahl. The Defense Department also created an accelerated three-week training program to teach Ukrainians how to employ and maintain the systems outside of Ukraine. By comparison, U.S. service members normally go through closer to six months of training on HIMARS. ""I will say the Ukrainians have proven time and time again to be extraordinarily ingenious and quick learners. And so I think we've been able to speed things up in the training cycle based on how quickly the Ukrainians have learned systems and been able to integrate them into their activities,"" he said. In his Tuesday New York Times essay, the president stressed the action was not intended to start a broader conflict, and said the U.S. was ""not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders"" – nor did it ""want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia."" ""We do not seek a war between NATO and Russia,"" Biden wrote. ""As much as I disagree with Mr. Putin, and find his actions an outrage, the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow. ""So long as the United States or our allies are not attacked,"" he continued, ""we will not be directly engaged in this conflict, either by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine or by attacking Russian forces.",,,,11
2022-06-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/kyiv-authorities-turn-places-hit-russian-missiles-tourist/story?id=85070881,"In Kyiv, authorities turn places hit by Russian missiles into tourist attractions: Reporter's notebook","It starts as a typical historical sightseeing tour. The guide shows us around the Babi Yar memorial. Once a high-end neighborhood of Kyiv, it became a place of one of its biggest tragedies - a mass murder of Jews and gypsies by the Nazis in September 1941. According to various estimates, up to 30,000 people, including children, were shot dead or hung in this place. As the guide continues, we see how the tragic past suddenly evolves into tragic present. The group stops by a TV tower, the tallest building in the city and one of the tallest in the world. Russian missiles hit it on March 1, leaving five people dead and five wounded. The strike disrupted the work of a few Ukrainian TV channels, but the broadcast was resumed two hours after the emergency service repaired the operational center of the tower. ""Russia wanted to make us deaf and blind,"" Liudmyla, a 46-year-old resident of Kyiv, said. ""But the tower withstood. So will Kyiv and Ukraine. We need to be aware of what is going on in the city. That's why I'm happy that the excursion route includes such places."" Kyiv was hit by a barrage of missiles throughout the city from the first days of war. Since then, 150 residents have died, more than 300 have been wounded, according to the local authorities. Western intelligence predicted the fall of the city into Russian hands within 48 hours after the invasion. Instead, the Ukrainian army fought back against the Russian troops, which had to move to other areas in Ukraine in mid-March. ""When we saw that the security situation was improving, we started thinking ahead; how to turn our wounds into advantages,"" Daniil Barashkin, head of the Kyiv tourist information center told ABC News. ""The destruction always terrifies people, that's why it can be very attractive. But at the same time, when we see it, we start appreciating life more."" Now there's a route organized by the Kyiv tourist center that includes the places damaged during the Russian invasion. But the authorities plan to do more, in particular bus tours around the city to show the destroyed residential buildings and a tour around a governmental quarter, which is now heavily guarded. ""I walk in the streets and often see people, including foreigners, looking at some places and discussing how they looked before the war. People are interested in knowing more,"" Barashkin said. The first route organized by the city tourist center attracted almost 50 people. Around 30 attended the second one. ""People come themselves, just after seeing the announcement, and we can't ban them from coming. It's just so cool to see that they are so eager,"" Barashkin said. As we go, the air raid siren goes off. ""We don't hide anymore; let's continue the tour,"" one of the participants said. ""If something happens, we usually pause the tour and proceed to the nearest shelter,"" Barashkin said. ""Before adopting the route at the mayor's office, we made sure it is safe for the people."" The capital's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, urges people not to neglect the sirens and reiterates that although now quiet and peaceful, Kyiv is still under threat of missile strikes. ""Unfortunately, we cannot provide 100% security guarantee to those who come to Kyiv,"" he told ABC News. But people should see and remember, how the city suffered and at what price withstood the Russian attack. ""The places we show in this excursion are part of the tragic history of Ukraine, a history of our courageous fight for our cities, our country and our future. They demonstrate that Russia brings war and deaths to our land. People need to see this and never have any illusions about any 'brotherhood with Russia,"" Klitschko said. The last highlight of the excursion is the building of the Artem military concern, which was hit twice by missiles. The building is still partially damaged and uninhabited. ""It's sad and frightening,"" Iryna, a 61-year-old resident of Kyiv, said. ""However, I wouldn't even repair these buildings and leave them as a reminder of what we've come through,"" she said. ""I feel sympathy for the people who suffered due to this war. I want to go around such places and see how I could help my city,"" Ruslan, a 24-year old Kyiv resident, said. ""All these events have been a horror, but the tragedy united all the Ukrainians."" Ironically, the Artem concern, founded in the last years of the Soviet Union, was named after a famous communist Artem, who founded a puppet republic in the east of Ukraine and fought against the Ukrainian nationalists in the early 20th century. ""So it appears that my excursion route tells a bit about the Ukrainian nationalist movement that existed 100 years ago. But this is something that Russia does not recognize and is trying to destroy now, killing thousands of people in Ukraine. And show that, too,"" Vlad Balan, a tourist guide told ABC News. ""But I hope that in the future, I will take the guests around the places that demonstrate development and achievement, not death and destruction. I'm sure it will happen soon.""",,,,5

In her first televised solo interview since the invasion began, Zelenska, 44, told ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts that conceding territory to Russia won't stop the war. ""You just can’t concede…parts of your territory. It’s like conceding a freedom,"" Zelenska said. ""Even if we would consider territories, the aggressor would not stop at that. He would continue pressing, he would continue launching more and more steps forward, more and more attacks against our territory."" The interview comes nearly 100 days since Russia invaded Ukraine, devastating towns and forcing the displacement of millions of Ukrainian residents. After failing to capture the capital of Kyiv, the Russian military has since launched a full-scale ground offensive in eastern Ukraine's disputed Donbas region. This week, President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will be sending Ukraine more sophisticated military equipment as part of a $700 million package of security assistance. The move follows calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month for long-range rocket systems to ""allow the defeat of tyranny.""

2022-06-02,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-lady-sits-exclusive-interview-abc-news-dont/story?id=85113164,Ukrainian first lady sits down for exclusive interview with ABC News: 'Don't get used to our pain',"Since the start of Russia's invasion, the Ukrainian first lady has been in hiding with her two children. A difficult question her 9-year-old son keeps asking is when the war will end, Olena Zelenska said in an exclusive interview with ABC News. ""Unfortunately, I don't think any Ukrainian would be able to answer that question,"" Zelenska told ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts in her first televised solo interview since the invasion began. In discussing the state of the conflict nearly 100 days after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, Zelenska said that conceding territory to Russia won't stop the war. ""You just can't concede ... parts of your territory. It's like conceding a freedom,"" Zelenska, 44, said in the interview, airing on ""Good Morning America"" Thursday. ""Even if we would consider territories, the aggressor would not stop at that. He would continue pressing, he would continue launching more and more steps forward, more and more attacks against our territory."" Zelenska's son has also continued to ask about his father, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom they have been separated from since the start of the war. ""We said goodbye to one another on the very first day. And over the next two months, we only had a chance to speak via the phone,"" Zelenska said. As he's handled the stress of war, she said she is ""proud"" that the whole world has gotten to see Zelenskyy's ""true identity."" The two met at university and have been married for nearly 20 years. She said Zelenskyy's decision to run for president of Ukraine amid a successful comedy career was ""unexpected."" ""There's one trait about Volodymyr that's very important -- he likes to change things around himself,"" she said. ""And that's why I clearly realized that there wouldn't be anything even closely related to the word boring when you were staying with him."" But as his family, she said she will support him in any way she could. ""If one day he would say that, 'OK, I'm going to go to space as an astronaut,' then, well, I would have to fly with him,"" she said, laughing. Zelenska said she doesn't feel as courageous as her husband, but as first lady, she feels motivated to ""keep on working to do my own part in order to ... get closer to our victory."" ""I realized that I have to be strong, that I have to be courageous, that I have to support him,"" she said. Zelenska has drawn attention to the women involved in the war, saying in an Instagram post in March that the Ukrainian resistance ""has a particularly female face."" ""I always thought that Ukrainian women are the best. And I was really proud of how the Ukrainian women behaved themselves during the war,"" she said. ""Now, I'm proud of the fact that the whole world has seen the true face of the Ukrainian women."" Zelenska said there are countless stories that have inspired her, though one, in particular, involved a maternity nurse in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol. ""She continued working, despite all those shelling,"" she said. ""There was no water supplies. There was no electricity supply. And she kept on working until that maternity hospital was completely destroyed."" The nurse, Tatiana, helped deliver 27 newborns during that time, Zelenska said. Another story of heroism involved a 15-year-old girl named Leeza who helped evacuate four people from a village in eastern Ukraine even after both her legs were wounded during shelling. ""When I saw her on the news report ... that was the face of a child,"" Zelenska said. ""And still, she found the courage to keep on driving."" For all the stories of unity and heroism, Zelenska noted that the war has been deadly for Ukraine's children. As of Wednesday, 243 children have been killed as a result of the conflict, she said. June 4 marks the International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression, as commemorated by the United Nations. ""Unfortunately, this year we will be marking this event,"" the first lady said. Children have also been traumatized by the war; Zelenska recounted hearing about two boys who saw their mother killed in front of them, and then had to bury her themselves. ""We need to help people to live that through. We need to help people psychologically, mentally, in whatever ways possible,"" she said. To that end, she is introducing a national program to provide mental health support for those impacted by the war's ""atrocities,"" she said. ""The medical institutions and medical system as we have it right now, it might simply be not enough to cover all the needs,"" she said. ""That's why we need to be prepared."" Another challenge will be getting Ukrainians who might not be used to seeking mental health support to avail themselves of this help, she said. ""Even the parents, they might not recognize that their child is having a problem, is having some sort of PTSD,"" she said. Zelenska discussed the ""enormous support"" Ukraine has felt from across the globe amid the war -- before the interview was interrupted by an air raid siren. ""It's really important, because you feel you're not alone,"" she said once the interview was able to safely resume. First lady Jill Biden's surprise visit to western Ukraine last month was another ""tremendous"" sign of support, Zelenska said. ""I finally managed to see her face-to-face, and it was a tremendously courageous action that she has made,"" Zelenska said. ""She came to the country which is at war, and the people of Ukraine, they highly appreciated that."" This week, President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will be sending Ukraine more sophisticated military equipment as part of a $700 million package of security assistance. The move comes following calls from Zelenskyy last month for long-range rocket systems to ""allow the defeat of tyranny."" Zelenska said they are grateful for the humanitarian and security assistance Ukraine has received so far, and that they ""hope and wait for more assistance to come."" As the war continues, another difficult question Zelenska finds herself unable to answer is what message she would give to the Russian people. ""Whenever we are trying to ask them a question or relay any message, they tend to answer that we have other information. ... Or they might be saying that we have other viewpoints on the situation,"" she said. ""But how can you have any other view on those killings? On those atrocities committed?"" In a message to the American people, she implored them to ""not get used to this war."" ""Otherwise, we are risking a never-ending war and this is not something we would like to have,"" she said. ""Don't get used to our pain."" The interview with Zelenska will air Thursday on ""Good Morning America"" and across ABC News. ""Good Morning America"" airs at 7 a.m. on ABC.",,,,25
2022-06-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/100-days-fate-bidens-face-off-putin-ukraine/story?id=85162525,"100 days in, fate of Biden's face-off with Putin over Ukraine still uncertain","One hundred days after Russia invaded Ukraine, the unexpectedly prolonged conflict has created a political headache for President Joe Biden with no end in sight. Historic inflation and sky-high prices at the gas pump in the U.S. have driven Biden's popularity down ahead of midterm elections this fall. He has to a large degree risked his political fortunes on the outcome of a war that he has pledged he will not send U.S. troops to fight – and which shows no signs of abating. Russia has made recent gains on the battlefield. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that Russian forces now control 20% of Ukrainian territory. Biden said Friday that ""it appears"" there will have to be ""a negotiated settlement"" to end the war. ""What that entails, I don't know,"" the president said, speaking to reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. ""I don't think anybody knows at this time.” But Biden would not say if he thought Ukraine had to cede territory to Russia to achieve peace. ""Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,"" he said. ""It’s their territory. I'm not going to tell them what they should and shouldn't do."" The president has succeeded in largely keeping Western allies united, strengthening the NATO alliance in the face of Russia attempts to split it. But as Russia continues to block Ukrainian food exports and sanctions drive up energy prices worldwide, Biden has found himself in the increasingly difficult position of balancing his desire to stop what he has called Russia's threat to democracy, with Americans' rising economic uncertainty. Russia has also sought to present the conflict as a fight in which the United States is directly involved. But while Biden insists he will not send American troops to Ukraine, as long as the war continues -- and while the U.S. sends Ukraine increasingly sophisticated weaponry -- the risk remains that the president could find himself more deeply involved than he wants. The United States has sent billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to Ukraine. Last month, Biden signed legislation providing $40 billion more over the coming months. And it has provided intelligence that the Ukrainians have used to target Russian forces. The U.S. military assistance -- combined with aid from other Western nations -- have contributed to Ukraine's successes in fending off the Russian invasion. The level of weapons systems the U.S. has provided has become more and more advanced over time. This week, Biden committed to sending even more powerful, longer-range missile systems useful for the battle in eastern Ukraine. After Russia's failures early in the war -- not taking any major cities and finding itself forced to narrow its aims -- it has now made steady progress in the east. What Vladimir Putin thought might just take a matter of days -- conquering all of Ukraine -- didn't happen due to Ukrainian resolve and increasing American help. But his aggression continues, despite unprecedented heavy sanctions that Biden said would change his behavior -- sanctions now in effect for months. One hundred days in, how Biden's face-off with Putin ends -- and when -- is still an open question.",,,,7

The Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) are conducing a joint investigation into the incident. (The probe was first reported by CNN.) Four U.S. service members were evaluated for minor wounds and possible traumatic brain injuries after what the military originally reported to be two indirect-fire rounds hitting the Green Village base in Syria. An Army CID official confirmed in a statement that the service member was being investigated, adding that the person was currently back in the U.S. The official emphasized that ""at this point these are just allegations"" and that any suspects were presumed innocent. ""The investigation is ongoing, which may or may not, develop sufficient evidence to identify a perpetrator(s) and have enough evidence to ensure a conviction in a court of law,"" the official said.",,,,13
2022-06-09,https://abcnews.go.com/US/rising-gas-prices-impacting-responders/story?id=85260667,How rising gas prices are impacting first responders,"As gas prices continue to rise, first responders are among those feeling the pain at the pump. MedStar Mobile Healthcare, an emergency medical services system in Fort Worth, Texas, has seen its gas expenses increase dramatically. During the month of May last year, MedStar spent $96,547.94 on fuel; this past May, it spent $223,582.55, according to Matt Zavadsky, chief transformation officer for MedStar. The response volume only marginally increased while the fuel costs rose, he said. ""It's a significant impact, on top of the other financial impacts adversely affecting EMS agencies,"" Zavadsky told ABC News. ""For rural EMS agencies that travel great distances, and have more challenging finances, the impact could be even greater."" A travel boom that's increasing the demand for gas also comes amid a shortage of crude oil supply due to sanctions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, driving up prices at the pump in recent months, experts told ABC News. The average price of a gallon of gas nationwide reached $5 on Thursday, according to GasBuddy. As of Thursday, AAA had the average price of a gallon of gas just under $5 -- at $4.97, up from about $4.33 a month ago and $3.07 a year ago. The increase has caused agencies like sheriff's offices and fire departments to closely monitor their fuel budget and issue new policy directives to limit gas mileage -- without impacting emergency response. ""Most sheriffs that I know will budget what their need is and maybe 10% more, but not 100% more,"" Matthew Saxton, CEO and executive director of the Michigan Sheriffs' Association, told ABC News. This week, the Isabella County Sheriff's Office in central Michigan announced that it has ""exhausted"" its fuel funds, with several months to go before a budget reset. As a result, it said it will be managing what non-emergency calls it can over the phone. ""Deputies will continue to provide patrols to all areas of the county, they will respond to those calls that need to be managed in person. Any call that is in progress with active suspects will involve a response by the deputies,"" Sheriff Michael Main said in a Facebook post. ""I want to assure the community that safety is our primary goal, and we will continue to respond to those types of calls."" County officials told Flint, Michigan, ABC affiliate WJRT they plan to address the budget concerns in the coming weeks. ""I know that once we meet, we're going to resolve this,"" Isabella County Commissioner Jerry Jaloszynski told the station. As director of the Franklin County Emergency Management Agency, Ryan Buckingham said he issued a policy directive regarding non-emergency activities a couple of months ago when gas prices in the southern Illinois county were approaching $4 per gallon. ""I have a small budget to work with. I have to look out for that pretty quick,"" Buckingham told ABC News. ""When it hits $5 a gallon, it gets even worse."" Buckingham said the agency has used up 76% of its fuel budget so far this fiscal year, which started Dec. 1, 2021. ""We're about 25% over the mark right now as far as where we should be budget-wise,"" he said, noting that the agency typically doesn't go over its allotted budget unless it's had to respond to something like a major disaster. To help curtail fuel costs, Buckingham said the agency is looking to limit travel for meetings and training. For instance, instead of driving an hour away for specialty dive training, personnel may train in a local pool. Emergency response will not be affected ""no matter what,"" he said. In rural Colorado, near Durango, Upper Pine River Fire Protection District Fire Chief Bruce Evans started noticing a ""significant"" increase in gas prices in January. In the last three months, fuel expenses have increased 36%, said Evans, cutting into the fuel budget. ""We've used 65% of that budget,"" said Evans. ""We should have only used 45%."" The department has started exploring ways to reduce the number of vehicles that it has on the road outside an emergency response, including ""no drive Friday,"" where personnel work from home if they can, Evans said. They may need to look to reallocate more funds to their fuel budget. ""We know we're going to have to put more money in, but we're also trying to be conservative,"" he said. For EMS systems, the higher prices come as agencies have also increased wages to retain workers during the pandemic, Zavadsky said. Agencies will likely need to dip into their reserves or reallocate funds to cover the rising costs, he said. Volunteer EMS personnel who use their personal vehicles to go to calls ""may be less able to respond due to the high fuel prices,"" he said. ""Those double-whammy cost increases, without any real mechanism to generate more revenue, is crippling most EMS agencies,"" Zavadsky said.",,,,22
2022-06-10,https://abcnews.go.com/International/bucha-residents-reclaim-homes-amid-war/story?id=85292329,Bucha residents try to reclaim their homes amid war,"Bucha, Ukraine is getting back to normal, but residents are still living with trauma from the war. ABC News correspondents returned to Bucha to witness its rebirth. In April, it took over two hours for the ABC News team to travel from Kyiv to Bucha, with bombed out bridges and checkpoints slowing their momentum. Now, the trip has returned to its swift 45 minute length. Where charred tanks and burned out trucks littered Bucha’s streets a few weeks ago, flowers now color the city, and thick grass replaces mine-planted meadows. The ABC News team headed to an apartment block that they remembered as bleak and frozen in April. There, they reunited with Mykola Pavlyuk, who had shared his story with ABC News in April. He had shown where he had buried his three friends in his backyard. After being forced out of his home by Russian troops, Pavlyuk had lived underground with the other residents in his building. One of his friends was killed by a grenade, and Pavlyuk had been in charge of picking up the pieces of his ruined body so that they could be buried. Pavlyuk told ABC News that he left Bucha for a while after the April visit to live with his sister. Since then, doctors in the family have prescribed him medication and he has found help through his church. “Eventually I had to get up and move on,” he said. “Thankfully I got a new job. I’m glad I have a job. I only just started. So life goes on. I try to think about the bad times as little as possible. Unfortunately it doesn’t always work out. Everything reminds me of the past.” Despite hearing about the power Pavlyuk's April interview had over people all over the world, Pavlyuk is still struggling with what he has endured. “I don’t feel great,” Pavlyuk said. “I start remembering. And it’s hard. I try to calm myself down. I saw my friends, my family but I feel bad.” Outside, standing by the homemade grave of his friends, Pavlyuk acknowledges the regrowth around him. “It helps that it’s summer,” he said. “All the destruction is hidden by the greenery. It’s hiding the terrors of Bucha.” Like many of Bucha’s residents, Pavlyuk can’t forget the mass graves, torture, execution and alleged human rights abuses that have now defined the city. A mass grave site has reclaimed a churchyard in the city. Small memorials are the only markings seen, and dried flowers wrapped in Ukrainian colors sit sadly at its base. Pavlyuk doubts there will be an investigation into the atrocities. Bucha is not the only place which has had to endure alleged war crimes inflicted by Russian troops. Last month, a 21-year-old Russian soldier pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed civilian in another town. It was the first war crimes trial since the war started. As the war continues in Ukraine, citizens have no time to grieve. With Russian forces persevering in Donbas, the flowers of Bucha look frail.",,,,19
2022-06-11,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announces-joint-declaration-immigration-attempt-show-unity/story?id=85311463,Biden announces joint declaration on immigration in attempt to show unity across the Americas,"Flanked by the leaders of several countries, President Joe Biden announced the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection on the final day of the Summit of the Americas on Friday. 20 different countries signed on to the declaration, each committing to tackling different components of migration. Biden credited the pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and climate change as contributing factors to migration throughout the Western Hemisphere. “Right now, migrants make up as much as 10% of the population of Costa Rica. And no nation should bear this responsibility alone, in my view, our view,” he said. Many of the commitments under the declaration deal specifically with boosting temporary worker programs. Canada has agreed to welcome more than 50,000 agricultural workers from Mexico, Guatemala, and the Caribbean this year. Mexico and Guatemala are also agreeing to expand migrant labor programs to address labor shortages. Ecuador has issued a decree to create a pathway to regular migration status for Venezuelans who legally entered through port of entry but are currently unlawfully in the country. At home, the Biden Administration has offered its own commitments including $300 million in funding for humanitarian assistance for countries “so when migrants arrive on their doorstep, they can provide a place to stay, make sure migrants can see a doctor, find opportunities to work, so they don't have to undertake the dangerous journey north.” The Biden Administration has been rattled by the continuation of hardline immigration policies installed by the Trump administration. Unprecedented rates of migration and piecemeal approaches to stemming the flow have manifested in large groups gathering at ports of entry like Del Rio, Texas. However today, the president made clear that controlling migration is a responsibility shared among all nations in the western hemisphere. Perhaps pushing back on Republican attacks that he’s “soft on immigration,” the president also assured that the declaration includes a commitment to strengthen border security as well as the administration’s intention to expand a multilateral “sting operation” that aims to disrupt human trafficking in Latin America. “If you prey on desperate and vulnerable migrants for profit, we are coming for you. We are coming after you,"" Biden said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will be launching a $65 million pilot program to issue grants for farmers hiring seasonal agricultural workers. The administration failed in its attempts to lift Title 42, a Trump-era policy that allows the government to quickly expel migrants without giving them a chance to apply for asylum because of the ongoing pandemic. Last month, a federal judge prevented the administration from ending the rule on May 23. Immigration advocates and lawyers have said that Black asylum seekers are bearing the brunt of these kinds of hardline policies as they face discrimination at our border and on their journey here. In September, photos depicting Border Patrol agents on horse back aggressively apprehending Haitian migrants in Del Rio, Texasy, sparked outrage and a lawsuit on behalf of some of the people detained that day. The president has carved out several initiatives that deal specifically with Haitian migrants in the Declaration including resuming its participation in the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program, which allows U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to apply for parole for relatives in Haiti. The U.S. will also be providing 11,500 H-2B visas for nonagricultural seasonal workers from Central America and Haiti. Nana Gyamfi, the Executive Director of Black Alliance for Just Immigration (BAJI), said the initiatives laid out in the declaration deprive Haitian migrants the right to seek asylum where they feel safe. “When you claim asylum, you are taking agency over your life. You are saying that I'm making this journey, if I survive here is where I want to be safe,” she said. “All of the pieces that you see in this declaration are all take away agency from the people who need the support, and puts all of the decision making into government entities.” Gyamfi also believes it fails to address institutional racism that excludes Black asylum seekers from finding refuge across the hemisphere. “There's no policies that are saying look, we understand that you know, anti Blackness exists and that it's being expressed not just in the United States policy, but the policies of Mexico and the policies in Central America,” she said. The announcement of the Declaration comes as some of the controversy over notable absences at the Summit have threatened to overshadow the collaborative work the administration intended to do on issues like climate change, recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic, and migration. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei boycotted the summit over the administration’s decision to not invite leaders of the authoritarian governments of Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba. During a plenary session, Prime Minister of Belize Johnny Briceño slammed the president, as he was seated from a few feet away, over his “incomprehensible” and “un-American” exclusion of Cuba and Venezuela. The administration is touting the declaration as proof that countries in the region can work together to achieve common goals. Belize has committed to launching a program in August to legalize some Central American and CARICOM migrants who have been living illegally in the country. “Our security is linked in ways that I don't think most people in my country fully understand, and maybe not in your countries as well. Our common humanity demands that we care for our neighbors by working together,” the president said.",,,,2
2022-06-15,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-sends-letter-oil-refiners-blasting-high-profits/story?id=85410420,Biden sends letter to oil refiners blasting high profits amid record gas prices,"President Joe Biden on Wednesday sent a letter to seven major oil refiners blasting them for record profits amid the war in Ukraine as Americans pay record prices at the gas pump. In the letter, he informs them he has ordered Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm to convene an emergency meeting with company executives to provide an explanation of any reduction in refining capacity since 2020. While acknowledging that ""Putin's war of aggression"" has dwindled the world supply of oil, Biden also pointed out that oil company profit margins are at the highest levels ever recorded. ""The last time the price of crude oil was about $120 per barrel, in March, the price of gas at the pump was $4.25 per gallon. Today, gas prices are 75 cents higher, and diesel prices are 90 cents higher. That difference -- of more than 15% at the pump -- is the result of the historically high profit margins for refining oil into gasoline, diesel and other refined products. Since the beginning of the year, refiners' margins for refining gasoline and diesel have tripled, and are currently at their highest levels ever recorded,"" Biden wrote. Biden blames on the companies for ""worsening"" the pain the war has imposed on Americans. ""I understand that many factors contributed to the business decisions to reduce refinery capacity, which occurred before I took office. But at a time of war, refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto American families are not acceptable. There is no question that Vladimir Putin is principally responsible for the intense financial pain the American people and their families are bearing. But amid a war that has raised gasoline prices more than $1.70 per gallon, historically high refinery profit margins are worsening that pain,"" he wrote. He hinted his administration is prepared to take action if the companies don't boost production, although the consequences of not complying are not clear. ""I am prepared to use all tools at my disposal, as appropriate, to address barriers to providing Americans affordable, secure energy supply,"" he wrote. ""The crunch that families are facing deserves immediate action. Your companies need to work with my Administration to bring forward concrete, near-term solutions that address the crisis and respect the critical equities of energy workers and fence-line communities."" Asked on CNN Wednesday morning what ""tools"" are at Biden's disposal, Granholm did not answer directly, but said his use of the Defense Production Act in other contexts has been on the table and that Congress can also take a variety of actions to address the issue. She said he first wants to hear from the companies why ""we are seeing these massive profit-taking on the part of refiners."" When pressed repeatedly if a proposal from Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to impose a 21% surtax on excess profits form the oil companies is something Biden would consider supporting, Granholm nervously said ""no tool has been taken off the table"" but did not directly say whether he'd back the idea. ""I'm saying no tool has been taken off the table and he wants to hear from the refineries, the companies who are doing refining to see what is the bottleneck and how we can increase supply. And he's also asking, of course, for the oil and gas industry to increase supply as well, by drilling more."" Biden's letter was sent to the Marathon Petroleum Corp; Valero Energy Corp; ExxonMobil; Phillips 66; Chevron; BP and Shell. An industry group, The American Petroleum Institute, responded by trying to shift blame back to the White House, saying the administration's ""misguided policy"" in reducing domestic oil and gas production has added to energy costs. ""While we appreciate the opportunity to open increased dialogue with the White House, the administration's misguided policy agenda shifting away from domestic oil and natural gas has compounded inflationary pressures and added headwinds to companies' daily efforts to meet growing energy needs while reducing emissions,"" API President Mike Sommers said in a statement. It urged the president to ""prioritize unlocking U.S. energy resources"" to reduce costs instead of increasing reliance on countries like Saudi Arabia.

2022-06-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/recession-inevitable-inflation-remains-unacceptably-high-janet-yellen/story?id=85482728,Recession isn't 'inevitable' but inflation remains 'unacceptably high': Janet Yellen,"A recession is not ""at all inevitable"" as the Federal Reserve takes increasingly aggressive action to address sharply rising inflation, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. ""I expect the economy to slow,"" Yellen told ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""It's been growing at a very rapid rate, as the economy, as the labor market, has recovered and we have reached full employment. It's natural now that we expect a transition to steady and stable growth, but I don't think a recession is at all inevitable."" ""Clearly, inflation is unacceptably high,"" Yellen continued. ""It's President [Joe] Biden's top priority to bring it down. And [Fed] Chair [Jerome] Powell has said that his goal is to bring inflation down while maintaining a strong labor market. That's going to take skill and luck, but I believe it's possible."" The current inflation rate, year-over-year, is at a 40-year high of 8.6%, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On Wednesday, in an effort to cool those rising costs, the Fed increased interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point -- marking the largest rate increase since 1994. A higher interest rate increases borrowing costs for consumers and companies, potentially slowing inflation by decreasing demand. ""You say it's not inevitable, but I guess the question is: Is it likely?"" Stephanopoulos pressed Yellen, citing data on consumer pull-back and slowing movement in the job market and noting that she, Biden and Powell were all wrong about inflation's lasting impact last year. ""Consumer spending remains very strong. There's month-to-month volatility, but overall spending is strong, although patterns of spending are changing and higher food and energy prices are certainly affecting consumers,"" Yellen said. ""But bank balances are high,"" she continued. ""It's clear that most consumers, even lower-income households, continue to have buffer stocks of savings that will enable them to maintain spending. So I don't see a drop-off in consumer spending as a likely cause of the recession in the months ahead. And the labor market is very strong, arguably the strongest of the post-war period."" Yellen attributed inflation partly to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying the conflict had increased global prices on energy and food. ""It's important to recognize that the United States is certainly not the only advanced economy suffering from high inflation,"" Yellen said. ""We see it in the U.K., we see it in France, Germany, Italy; and the causes of it are global, not local."" She said ""energy prices spillover is really half of inflation,"" but that Biden has been working to keep oil prices from going even higher. Gas prices remain at record highs after months of increases. The current national average is about $4.98 per gallon. Yellen cited Biden's ""historic"" release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve over six months in an effort to reduce prices -- though costs continue to climb. ""[Biden] stands ready to work and is encouraging producers of oil and refined products, gas, to work with him to increase supplies, to bring gas prices and energy prices down,"" Yellen said. On Wednesday, Biden sent a letter to seven major oil refiners in the U.S., blasting them for posting record profits while consumers face record-high gas prices and calling on them to increase production. The American Petroleum Institute fired back, with its CEO and president arguing it's ""the administration’s misguided policy agenda shifting away from domestic oil and natural gas [that] has compounded inflationary pressures and added headwinds to companies’ daily efforts to meet growing energy needs while reducing emissions."" ""How do you respond to that?"" Stephanopoulos pressed. ""I don't think that the policies are responsible for what's happening in the oil market,"" Yellen said. ""I think that producers were partly caught unaware of the strength of the recovery in the economy and weren't ready to meet the needs of the economy. High prices should induce them to increase supplies over time."" While long-term efforts to bring down the cost of gas are being debated, Stephanopoulos asked about the short term. ""Several in Congress are calling for gas tax holidays. Prices average around $5 a gallon. Is that on the table?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""President Biden wants to do anything he possibly can to help consumers,"" Yellen said. ""Gas prices have risen a great deal and it's clearly burdening households. So he stands ready to work with Congress, and that's an idea that's certainly worth considering."" Yellen also said the administration is considering lifting some Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods. ""We all recognize that China engages in a range of unfair trade practices that it's important to address,"" Yellen said. ""But the tariffs we inherited, some serve no strategic purpose and raise costs to consumers. And so, reconfiguring some of those tariffs so they make more sense and reduce some unnecessary burdens is something that's under consideration.""",,,,23
2022-06-20,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-back-gas-tax-holiday-rebate-cards-address/story?id=85508373,Biden may soon back a gas tax holiday -- plus rebate cards -- to address pain at the pump,"As top White House officials reiterate that tackling high inflation remains President Joe Biden's chief priority, his administration is debating strategies to bring prices down -- and sending mixed signals about how, and how quickly, Biden may act on an issue that is top of mind for voters and weighing on his approval ratings. The president said Monday he could make a decision as soon as this week on whether to support Congress instituting a pause on the federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, which experts have estimated could lower prices by approximately 14.72 cents per gallon. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Sunday that the administration was open to considering such a move, citing the cost on consumers. As of Monday, the national average gas price was $4.98 per gallon. ""Gas prices have risen a great deal, and it's clearly burdening households,"" Yellen said during an appearance on ""This Week"" with George Stephanopoulos. ""So [the president] stands ready to work with Congress and [gas tax holidays are] an idea that's certainly worth considering."" But Yellen's counterpart at the Department of Energy seemingly disagreed with that notion in her own appearance Sunday. ""Part of the challenge with the gas tax, of course, is that it funds the roads,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on CNN. ""[W]e just did a big infrastructure bill to help fund the roads. So if we do -- if we remove the gas tax -- that takes away the funding that was just passed by Congress to be able to do that."" ""That's one of the challenges. But I'm not saying that that's off the table,"" Granholm said. A gas tax holiday would require approval from Congress, where Democrats hold a fragile majority. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has previously spoken skeptically of the idea, saying it was possibly better ""PR"" than policy. Biden told reporters on Monday that, as another relief measure, gas rebate cards were also under deliberation. ""That's part of what we're considering,"" he said when asked. ""That's part of the whole operation."" It's unclear, however, how such rebate cards would work -- whether they would be pre-loaded or provide rebates post-purchase. A recession isn't guaranteed: White House Administration officials are united on one point: A recession is ""not inevitable,"" they have all said. ""There's nothing inevitable about a recession,"" Biden said Monday. Yellen, Granholm and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese likewise all used variations of that language during their Sunday show appearances. ""There's a lot of things about the economy right now that are unique,"" Deese said. ""Americans are spending less money on goods, they're spending more money on services from companies … The housing market is recalibrating."" Yellen acknowledged Sunday that inflation was ""unacceptably high,"" again blaming Russia's invasion of Ukraine and long-term supply chain issues as contributors. ""These factors are unlikely to diminish immediately, but over time, I certainly expect inflation to come down,"" she said. Still, she noted, ""Consumer spending remains very strong. There's month-to-month volatility, but overall spending is strong."" And, she added, ""Bank balances are high. It's clear that most consumers, even lower-income households, continue to have buffer stocks of savings."" With the Federal Reserve taking increasingly aggressive action to curb inflation -- raising interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, the largest hike in nearly 30 years -- Yellen said the goal was a delicate balancing act. ""[Fed] Chair [Jerome] Powell has said that his goal is to bring inflation down while maintaining a strong labor market. That's going to take skill and luck, but I believe it's possible,"" she said Sunday. As the administration insist there's a way to avoid recession while reigning in inflation, Republican lawmakers are taking the opportunity to hammer Biden on higher prices -- a key talking point for the GOP ahead of the November midterm elections. ""Bidenflation is costing average Americans an extra $460 a month,"" Pennsylvania Rep. Lloyd Smucker tweeted on Monday. Officials weigh more economic measures Biden made clear Monday he has no plans to meet oil executives in person but is instead tasking top aides, like Granholm, with making his administration's position clear. In a letter last Wednesday, Biden called out seven oil refiners for earning record profits while oil supplies decrease. He asked the companies to increase production or risk facing White House intervention. While the president did not specifically identify the tools he could use, Granholm hinted during a Wednesday CNN appearance that the Defense Production Act may be on the table. In his letter, Biden also instructed his energy secretary to convene an emergency meeting with oil company executives. Granholm will probe the companies to explain reductions in oil refining capacity, according to an ABC News report. Trade groups representing the producers contend that ""U.S. refineries are running at 94 percent of capacity."" The American Petroleum Institute also fired back at Biden's letter, with its CEO and president arguing it was ""the administration's misguided policy agenda shifting away from domestic oil and natural gas [that] has compounded inflationary pressures and added headwinds to companies' daily efforts to meet growing energy needs while reducing emissions."" Separately, Yellen told federal lawmakers earlier this month that her department was reviewing Trump-era tariffs targeting China. Economists in a March policy brief said that ""eliminating the tariff would save US firms and households about $81 billion annually on direct purchases from China."" When asked Saturday about his position on eliminating those tariffs, the president said, ""We are still in the process of making up my mind.""

2022-06-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/south-korea-launches-successful-homegrown-rocket-starting-era/story?id=85522998,"South Korea launches first successful homegrown rocket, starting 'new era' for space program","SEOUL -- South Korea successfully launched and put its homegrown space rocket into orbit Tuesday, becoming the seventh nation capable of launching practical satellites using a self-developed propulsion system. “The Nuri rocket launch was a success,” Lee Sang-ryul, director of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute told the press after the launch. “After the launch, Nuri’s flight process proceeded according to the planned flight sequence.” KARI set off its 200-ton homegrown space rocket from the Naro Space Center in the Southern coastal village of Goheung. The launch was delayed from the original test date last Thursday due to weather conditions and a technical glitch. Loaded with a 162.5-kilogram (358-pound) performance-verification satellite -- as well as four cube satellites for academic research and a 1.3-ton dummy satellite -- Nuri reached its target orbit of 700 kilometers (435 miles) above the Earth. All three stages of its engine were combusted according to plan, separating the mounted satellites at the arranged moment. With Tuesday's launch, South Korea joined the U.S., Russia, France, China, Japan and India in its self-developed propulsion capabilities, according to officials. “The launch opens up a new era for South Korea’s space program and science technology,” Aerospace Engineering professor Cho Donghyun of Pusan National University told ABC News. The Nuri Development Project, also known as the Korean Launch Vehicle project, commenced in 2010. The completion of its three-stage launch vehicle system technology enabled the team to test-fire South Korea’s first homemade rocket last October. Back then, the rocket made it to the target altitude of 700 kilometers but failed to put a dummy satellite into orbit, making the launch a half-success. The rocket launched on Tuesday stably settled the performance-verification satellite into orbit. “The Nuri spacecraft is fired up by not just one engine but a clustering of four 75-ton grade liquid engines. This gives potential to build larger projectiles with more engines in the future,” Cho said. A latecomer in the aerospace industry, South Korea’s rocket-launch journey began in 2013 when it blasted its first carrier rocket, Naro-1, to achieve orbit. The aircraft was a collaborative project with Russia’s Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center and KARI. In the 12 years since that collaboration, South Korea developed its very own space rocket. South Korea invested $616 million on space research in 2021, according to South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT, a figure considerably less than the $48 billion the U.S. spent in the same period. “We have set the stage for us to travel to space whenever we’d like, without having to rent a launchpad or a projectile from another country,” Minister of Science and ICT Lee Jong Ho said. “The South Korean government plans to enhance the technical reliability of the Nuri rocket through four additional launches until 2027.” ABC News' Eunseo Nam contributed to this report.",,,,1
2022-06-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989,Ben Stiller meets Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine on World Refugee Day,"Hollywood actor and director Ben Stiller heaped praise on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Monday to mark World Refugee Day as Russia's ongoing invasion there forces millions to flee. Stiller, who was visiting Ukraine and Poland as a goodwill ambassador of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) gave a rushed walk and extended his hands to meet Zelenskyy, an actor and stand-up comedian before he was elected president in 2019. Both men said they were honored to meet each other. ""You're my hero,"" Stiller told Zelenskyy inside the presidential palace. ""You're amazing. You quit a great acting career for this."" ""Not so great as yours,"" Zelenskyy said back with a smile. ""No, but pretty great,"" Stiller joked, putting his hand over his heart at times. ""But what you've done and the way that you've rallied the country and for the world, it's really inspiring."" Zelenskyy gushed at the compliment, saying, ""It's too much for me."" Stiller traveled to Ukraine ""to see the scale of destruction and hear firsthand from people who have directly experienced the impact of the war,"" the UNHCR said in a release, adding, ""These personal stories will enable Mr. Stiller to communicate the need for continued and increased support to the humanitarian response in Ukraine."" Ahead of his meeting with Zelenskyy and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Stiller visited occupied settlements around Kyiv and stopped earlier Monday in Irpin -- a town next to the capital that witnessed intense fighting early during the invasion. He and Karolina Lindholm Billing, the UNHCR representative in Ukraine, met with survivors of that occupation, according to a press release from Zelenskyy's office. ""It's one thing to see this destruction on TV or on social networks. Another thing is to see it all with your own eyes. That's a lot more shocking,"" Stiller told Zelenskyy. ""What you saw in Irpin is definitely dreadful,"" the Ukrainian president replied. ""But it is even worse to just imagine what is happening in the settlements that are still under temporary occupation in the east."" In Irpin, the bodies of 290 victims, with a disproportionate number of women, were recovered after Russian forces inflicted a month of terror, the BBC reported. And in the east, Russian forces have used long-range artillery to assail cities in the Donbas region, which Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to control. Since Putin launched his invasion in late February, between 8 and 12 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine, according to data from the UNHCR. Roughly half have fled to neighboring Poland, which Stiller visited Sunday, seeking to spread awareness of the needs of the refugee crisis.

2022-06-22,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-call-congress-states-suspend-gas-taxes/story?id=85545498,"Biden calls on Congress, states to suspend gas taxes","President Biden on Wednesday called on Congress to suspend the federal gas tax for three months and asked states to suspend their own gas taxes or provide commensurate relief to consumers. The federal government charges an 18.4-cent tax per gallon of gasoline and a 24.4-cent tax per gallon of diesel. Suspending the tax for three months -- through the end of September, will cost about $10 billion, the White House said. ""I fully understand that the gas tax holiday alone is not going to fix the problem,"" Biden said in remarks delivered from the South Court Auditorium. ""But it will provide families some immediate relief, just a little bit of breathing room, as we continue working to bring down prices for the long haul."" But the idea may not get the reception Biden is looking for from lawmakers on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was noncommittal on the issue in a statement she released after Biden's announcement. ""We will see where the consensus lies on a path forward for the President’s proposal in the House and the Senate,"" the statement read. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told ABC News on Wednesday that he's not on a ""yes"" vote as of now. ""Now, to do that and put another hole into the budget is something that is very concerning to me, and people need to understand that 18 cents is not going to be straight across the board -- it never has been that you'll see in 18 cents exactly penny-for-penny come off of that price,"" Manchin said. Biden specifically called on companies to make sure that ""every penny"" of those savings are passed through to consumers. ""This is no time for profiteering,"" he said. Biden on Wednesday also called on the industry to use profits to refine more oil and gasoline and lower prices at the pump. ""My message is simple to the companies running gas stations and setting those prices at the pump: this is a time of war, global peril, Ukraine,"" Biden said. ""These are not normal times. Bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you are paying for the product to it now. Do it now, do it today. Your customers, the American people, they need relief now."" The administration has been putting public pressure on oil companies to help Americans at a time of financial need. ""Companies, of course, are beholden to their shareholders, but they really need to be beholden and conscious of customers, and their fellow neighbors, and their fellow citizens, just like this administration's doing,"" another senior administration official told reporters. ""And we hope that that's the spirit that CEOs of these companies will take."" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is scheduled to meet with oil company executives Thursday, during which they will press executives to ensure they'll pass on the savings if the gas tax holiday is enacted. ""We are encouraging these oil and gas companies to invest, to help their fellow citizens, to help their own workers,"" Granholm told reporters at the daily White House press briefing. ""We need them to come to the table."" When asked about the apparent lack of support for the gas tax holiday from lawmakers, Granholm said there will be ongoing discussions. ""I would hope that both sides of the aisle are listening to their constituents about getting relief,"" she said. ""I think the citizens will be the loudest voice in the room."" On Wednesday, Biden also called on state and local governments to provide ""relief"" to Americans by suspending their state gas taxes or provide other remedies, like delaying planned tax and fee increases, or even consumer rebates or relief payments. State gas taxes average about 31 cents per gallon of gasoline, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School recently found that the suspension of gas taxes in Maryland, Georgia and Connecticut were, in fact, ""mostly passed onto consumers at some point during the tax holiday in the form of lower gas prices,"" but that the lower prices ""were often not sustained during the entire holiday."" In Maryland, 72% of the tax savings were passed on to consumers; in Georgia, 58-65% were, and in Connecticut, 71-87% were, according to their analysis. When asked why Biden wants the federal tax suspended for three months specifically, the official said the president wanted to balance the need of ""the unique moment that we're in"" -- particularly during the summer driving season -- with the fact that the tax provides important revenue for the government to pay for highways and other transportation projects. ""The purpose of this suspension,"" the official said, ""is really to address the unique moment that we're in, and with a particular focus on the summer driving season and the pain that families are feeling at the pump right now, while recognizing that on a longer-term basis, the gas tax is an important source of revenue for federal infrastructure."" The gas tax revenue goes to the federal government's Highway Trust Fund, which provides for much of the government's spending on highways and mass transit. Biden said his proposal wouldn't affect the Highway Trust Fund, and an administration official previously told reporters that Congress can fill in the $10 billion gap with ""other revenues."" ""I promise you I'm doing everything possible to bring the price of energy down, gas prices down,"" the president said.",,,,22
2022-06-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-purchase-advanced-missile-system-ukraines-defense/story?id=85791000,US to purchase advanced missile system for Ukraine's defense,"The United States is working to finalize the purchase of an advanced air defense system bound for Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at the G-7 summit in Germany Monday. Developed in Norway, the NASAMS is an anti-aircraft medium-to-long-range surface-to-air missile that can reportedly strike targets 100 miles away. Sullivan confirmed to reporters that the U.S. is finalizing the purchase but has yet to sign a contract making the purchase official. It is unclear how much the anti-aircraft system costs. Biden told his global counterparts at the G-7 and Ukraine's President Zelensky about U.S. intentions, Sullivan said. The impending purchase of the NASAMS system is part of a package that will also include artillery ammunition and counter-battery radars, according to Sullivan. The Ukrainian military made specific requests for the ammunition and radars, he said. The NASAMS system is reported to protect restricted airspace around the White House. Monday's announcement from the G-7 summit comes four days after the White House announced it is sending $450 million in aid to Ukraine. HIMARS missile systems are part of that package. Hours after the announcement, initial counts are that 10 died and more than 40 were wounded following a Monday missile strike in Kremenchuk in Ukraine's Poltava region. Residents say the strike hit a shopping mall, setting it ablaze. The administration and President Zelensky hope the NASAMS system and other recent aid from the U.S. will better equip Ukraine to continue its pushback against Russia in the war, which recently entered its fifth month. Some G-7 members also announced Sunday they will further tighten their grip on Russia by banning the imports of Russian gold. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan joined together to ban Russia's second-largest import but fellow G-7 members Germany, France, and Italy held out. The move codifies a ban that many refiners, shippers, and banks already voluntarily implemented themselves, and it highlights how even some of the world's global powers -- those geographically closest to the Russia-Ukrainian conflict -- disagree with how to approach the matter. The U.S. Treasury will release an official notice of the ban as it concerns U.S.-based businesses Tuesday. President Zelenskyy met virtually with G-7 leaders Monday as the group moves closer to reaching an agreement that will cap the price of Russian oil, further starving Russia of funds to fuel its war.

The London-based international human rights group published a new report documenting how the deadly blitz on the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater unfolded, citing interviews with numerous survivors and witnesses as well as ""extensive digital evidence,"" which included photographs, videos, radio intercepts, satellite imagery and radar data. The report concluded that the evidence indicates the attack ""was almost certainly an airstrike carried out by the Russian military,"" with the theater as ""the intended target."" ""After months of rigorous investigation, analysis of satellite imagery and interviews with dozens of witnesses, we concluded that the strike was a clear war crime committed by Russian forces,"" Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in a statement Thursday. As many as 1,500 civilians had been taking refuge in the grand, columned Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater in central Mariupol when it was struck on March 16, according to the Ukrainian government. Russian forces had been relentlessly bombarding the strategic port city in southeastern Ukraine since launching an invasion on Feb. 24. Satellite images taken prior to the attack showed huge, white Cyrillic letters written on the pavement in front of and behind the building, spelling out the Russian word for ""children"" -- ""deti"" -- to alert warplanes to those inside. According to Amnesty International's report, Russian fighter aircraft most likely attacked the theater-turned-shelter using two 500-kilogram bombs that struck close to each other and detonated simultaneously. The strike took place on a clear morning and landed inside the main structure of the theater, which the report noted was a cultural landmark and the only big building in the middle of a large park in Mariupol. The theater's civilian character and the presence of numerous civilians ""were evident,"" according to the report. About a week after the attack, the Mariupol City Council said the death toll was around 300, citing eyewitnesses. A subsequent investigation by The Associated Press found evidence that the strike was far deadlier than initially estimated, killing closer to 600 people inside and outside the building. The AP called it ""the single deadliest known attack against civilians to date"" in Russia's war on Ukraine. It remains unclear exactly how many people were killed, but Amnesty International said the death toll is likely much smaller than previously reported. Based on a review of witness accounts and other sources, the organization believes ""at least a dozen people died in the attack, but also that it is likely that many additional fatalities remain unreported,"" according to the report. ""Many people were injured and killed in this merciless attack. Their deaths were likely caused by Russian forces deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians,"" Callamard said. ""The International Criminal Court, and all others with jurisdiction over crimes committed during this conflict, must investigate this attack as a war crime. All those responsible must be held accountable for causing such death and destruction."" The Russian military claimed to have fully captured Mariupol in late May, after a nearly three month siege that reduced the city of 430,000 people to smoldering ruin. The victory secured a coastal corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow forcibly annexed from Ukraine in 2014. ""Through the air and on the ground, Russian forces have been on a well-documented and deliberate killing spree of civilians in Ukraine,"" Callamard added. ""Thorough investigations are urgently needed in order to hold perpetrators accountable for the serious injury and loss of civilian life they caused, as well as for the extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.""",,,,15
2022-06-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-aims-punish-russia-world-stage-sanctions-hurt/story?id=85461254,"As Biden aims to punish Russia on world stage, sanctions hurt at home","As the leaders of NATO's 30 member countries convene in Madrid this week, preserving the alliance's remarkable unity against Russian aggression is at the top of President Joe Biden's agenda. But as the war's economic fallout ripples far beyond Eastern Europe, maintaining Americans' support for Ukraine amid mounting fallout at home may be the greater challenge. Before Russia launched its attack, the average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S was near $3.50. Now, it hovers near $5. Inflation concerns were already ballooning before the war, and since its onset in February, year-over-year rates continue to surge. Biden has pledged to do whatever he can to bolster the U.S. economy while promising to take down Russia's -- pledging to make President Vladimir Putin pay a staggering price for inciting the conflict. So far, though, higher global prices have made it possible for Russia to reap higher revenues from its fuel exports, even while it exports less. ABC News asked experts about whether the financial penalties levied against Russia are having unintended consequences and what other tools the Biden administration could use to counter Putin's aggression that don't hurt American consumers. Sanctions' side effects? When it comes to evaluating the efficacy of the allies' sanctions and embargo strategy, economists stress it will take time for the measures to show their true bite -- on Russia. In fact, in the near-term, Ginger Faulk, an international lawyer at Eversheds-Sutherland who represents multinational companies in matters involving the U.S. government's regulation of foreign trade and investment, said there's evidence the policies have been ""counterproductive."" ""The sanctions have not stopped Russia from continuing its war and they're not even threatening Putin's hold on power in Russia,"" Faulk said. ""To date, Russia has been able to increase its spending on the war in spite of these sanctions."" While Biden might blame ""Putin's price hike"" for Americans' pain at the pump, Faulk said there's more to the story. ""The rise in gas prices that people are seeing is caused by a lot of factors, but make no mistake -- one of the big factors is the shunning of Russian oil in global markets,"" she said. ""I think if we had approached the embargoes more strategically at the outset, it wouldn't have caused this."" Douglas Rediker, a senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, argues that beyond the Biden administration's policies, the war's roiling of supply chains and a diminished wiliness to trade with Russia have had a much greater role in rising costs. ""To some degree, Putin's invasion of Ukraine is what caused the price hikes, rather than the U.S. and E.U.'s reaction to it,"" Rediker said. ""Gasoline prices have gone up. But they have not gone up primarily because of the sanctions that we've imposed on Russia. They've gone up because of the overall impact on supply chains, on trade, and diminish willingness to transact with Russia,"" he added, noting that penalties on Moscow's national banking system have also played a part. Capping the cash flow Fewer customers willing to do business with the Kremlin has resulted in other countries like China scooping up Russian oil at discounted rates. But instead of trying to hinder countries going against the U.S. and its allies from benefiting, experts say imposing a price cap on how much an importer can pay for Russian oil might be a better strategy. ""Sanctions lawmakers have to get smarter,"" Faulk said. ""That's why you see the Treasury Department and the White House talking about reducing the price that Russia receives for the oil itself without actually taking those barrels off of the world market."" Indeed, it's a proposal that was on the table at this week's meeting of G-7 nations, where a U.S. official said the leaders of the world's most advanced economies were able to come ""very close"" to an agreement on a mechanism that would set a global price cap on Russian oil by imposing shipping restrictions on any product purchased above a certain threshold. In theory, the restrictions would be enforceable because a London-based company insures the vast majority of the world's oil tankers, so only countries in compliance would be allowed to use the company's services. ""The goal here is to starve Russia, starve Putin of his main source of cash, and force down the price of Russian oil to help blunt the impact of Putin's war at the pump,"" a senior administration official said. In addition to being able to charge less for its product, Faulk says Moscow will have to be content with the added expense of sending oil to faraway customers. ""It's much more complex and expensive to send oil to China or to India rather than to Europe,"" she said. ""Those increased logistics costs and the sanctions discount will eat into Russian revenues."" But whether importers would follow suit with price limits or establish workarounds is still unclear. And there's also the possibility that the Kremlin could respond to the measure by abruptly cutting off oil exports to the E.U. before its gradual embargo comes into full effect, or halting its supply of natural gas—which Europe relies on to heat nearly half of its homes. ""Russia is responding in a kind of economic tit-for-tat by cutting gas flows into Europe. And that doesn't bode well for this winter,"" Faulk said. No easy fixes The key to bringing down prices at home lies in a simple economic model: supply and demand. But experts say those variables are exceedingly difficult to manipulate. To ramp up supply, Rediker says, the Biden administration has shown a willingness to work towards expanding the amount of fuel available to the global market, even if it means courting unsavory trade partners. ""There are steps to do deals with -- if not the devil -- certainly do deals with countries we have demonized for human rights and political behavior,"" Rediker said, referencing authoritarian governments like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Trying to limit demand may be even less politically palatable. ""The Biden administration is very reluctant to see comparisons to the Carter administration,"" Rediker said, recalling a speech the former president gave advising Americans to turn down their thermostats amid rampant inflation and the energy crisis of the 1970s. ""I think they have that deeply penetrated in their political thinking and they want to avoid being seen as asking Americans to reduce the demand for fossil fuels."" As for the White House proposal to temporarily lift the federal gas tax, Rediker says most economists would describe it a ""political theater,"" and that if it were to be enacted, it could actually result in increased inflation by prompting more federal borrowing. With no straightforward solution, he says support for the war could wane. ""As the war has continued on, the American public may still be supportive of Ukraine. But the question is, are they willing to make an overt sacrifice that's being reflected in higher prices at the pump?"" Rediker said. ""I think that's an open question.""",,,,23
2022-07-05,https://abcnews.go.com/US/protect-home-energy-costs-heat-waves/story?id=85922701,How to protect your home and keep energy costs down during heat waves,"Summer has just started but millions around the country have already experienced record-breaking heat waves, forcing people to blast air conditioning and think of ways to protect their homes during an onslaught of high temperatures, all while trying to keep energy costs low. The U.S. has already seen heat indexes reach dangerous levels this summer. Last month, Shreveport, Louisiana, reached 105 degrees, while temperatures in Houston, Texas, hit 103 degrees. Drought conditions in parts of the country also make it ripe for pasture losses, water shortages and wildfires, which puts people's homes at risk. Protecting your homes Extreme weather is costing Americans billions of dollars. In 2020, extreme weather cost U.S. taxpayers $99 billion, with heat waves and droughts costing taxpayers an average of $6.4 billion a year since 1980, according to the Center for American Progress. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, some tips homeowners could use to protect their home include adding insulation to keep the heat out, incorporating window reflectors and weather stripping windows and doors. ""Windows and doors are critical,"" Jim Reinhart, CEO and president of Ygrene, told ABC News. ""Today's windows and doors are way more efficient than those that many homes were constructed in 30 to 40 years ago."" Reinhart said having a proper roof is also important in protecting your home from extreme heat and can help reduce your energy costs by at least 20%. Rising temperatures can also increase a house's humidity if not properly maintained, which can cause mold to grow. If roofs, windows and doors are not regularly supported, issues, such as water damage, can cause bigger and more expensive problems, Reinhart added. ""A lot of what we ask people to do is not to just fix it, but fix it appropriately,"" he said. Keeping energy costs down Customers are expected to be hit hard financially because of rising energy costs, especially during the summer. Utility companies have warned customers that the high costs of natural gas are leading to an increase in electricity prices. The war in Ukraine has forced the U.S. to export a record amount of gas, driving up the price. Some tips the Department of Energy suggests for keeping costs down include setting your thermostat to a temperature you're comfortable with and an indoor temperature that isn't that much different from the outside temperature. Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) suggests setting your thermostat to 78 degrees or higher and using ceiling fans to help circulate the air throughout a room. Logan Atkinson, executive director at Alliance for Affordable Energy, told ABC News people should look to see what energy efficiency programs their states offer to help reduce costs. ""Most utilities are required around the country are to provide [these programs],"" Atkinson said. ""If you're a low-income homeowner, most of those programs are free of charge entirely."" Rising temperatures will undoubtedly lead to an increased usage of people's air conditioning systems. Homeowners with heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, commonly referred to as HVAC, should have them serviced by a technician to ensure they're running efficiently. The cost to replace an HVAC system costs an average of $7,000, with some systems going up to $10,000, according to Home Advisor. It is more economical to maintain it than replace a broken system. Atkinson said the efficiency programs could cover some costs if you're keeping the system serviced.",,,,10
2022-07-08,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-falling-gas-prices-show-program-working/story?id=86318473,Biden says falling gas prices show his 'program is working',"President Joe Biden on Friday touted falling gas prices, robust new jobs numbers and a low unemployment rate to make the case that his economic program and fight to bring inflation down is ""working."" ""The unemployment rate is near a historic low of 3.6%. The private sector jobs are at a record high,"" he said at a White House event about abortion. ""Gas prices are still way too high, and have fallen 25 days in a row. And this week we saw the second largest single day decrease in gas prices in a decade. We still have a lot of work to do ... But I am suggesting we are making significant progress. The program is working."" The national average for a gallon of gas stood at $4.72 Friday, down three cents from Thursday and about 12 cents since this time last week, according to AAA. The average cost for gas peaked at $5.01 per gallon on June 14, according to AAA, and the price of crude oil fell below $100 per barrel this week for the first time since May 11. Relief at the pump comes as global demand for commodities slows, resulting in lower prices for crude oil copper, cotton, and lumber. ""I think the reason why oil prices are going down now is because the prospect that we do see an economic slowdown,"" GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis Patrick De Haan told ABC News Thursday. If that trend continues, a potential recession could prove politically problematic for Biden and fellow Democrats ahead of the midterm elections in November. Building a strong economy was a priority in the Democratic party's 2020 platform. ""But, if all of a sudden, the worries over the recession fade, we can see oil prices go right back up,"" De Haan said. A hurricane making landfall near a refinery, such as one in Louisiana, could also cause prices to rise. In the coming weeks, what Americans pay at the pump in some states could fall another 25 to 50 cents per gallon on average, De Haan said. Some stations around the country have already lowered prices to the mid-three-dollar range. The president's remarks Friday are the latest in a largely unsuccessful White House effort to counter damaging daily headlines about skyrocketing prices at the pump. What began with attributing the rise in prices to Russia's invasion of Ukraine became a proposal to suspend the federal gas tax for three months. But that plan found little support among Republicans and Democrats in Congress. Some Republican senators called the proposal to halt the 18-cent tax a gimmick, while some Democrats said it might not work. The president also floated offering rebate cards to Americans in June, but the Washington Post reported a chip shortage would make it challenging to produce the cards. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm then met with top oil executives late last month to discuss how their companies might help ease pain at the pump, but some analysts say it is unlikely the current price drop is related to the administration's lobbying efforts. The falling price of crude oil and weakened demand have driven the cost of gas down and the industry is also working through higher-cost inventory, according to investment research firm Third Bridge's global lead for energy Peter McNally. ""That is bringing prices at the pump down, not the president telling the corner gas station to do it,"" McNally said Thursday. The White House doubled down this week, again calling for Congress to suspend the federal gas tax Thursday and blaming Russia's invasion of Ukraine Friday. ""Wholesale gas prices are down by $1 per gallon,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday. ""Retail gas prices have only come down by about 20 cents over the same period. More work needs to be done."" But gas stations are slowly lowering their prices as they try to recapture some of their margins from when prices rose, De Haan said. Stations are behind the curve when their costs rise for up to five days, as raising prices is difficult if other stations do not adjust theirs, he said. The White House and the Federal Reserve deserve some credit for recognizing inflation as a serious challenge, University of Houston petroleum engineering professor Ramanan Krishnamoorti said Thursday. The FED raising interest rates last month ""certainly slowed down some of the price exuberance we've seen with inflation,"" he said. The government's release of 100 million oil barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve year-to-date has also helped. Releasing oil has added supply to the market, likely preventing prices from going higher, McNally said.",,,,23
2022-07-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/western-lviv-concern-attacks-hangs-everyday-life/story?id=86584250,"In western Ukraine, concerns about Russian attacks hang over everyday life, mayor says","LVIV, Ukraine -- After a series of meetings with local military and civilian authorities this month, Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, the western Ukrainian city that’s remained largely untouched by the Russian invasion, warned of a possible escalation. “The danger of invasion from Belarus is actual -- there are no guarantees that there will be no chemical attack or local nuclear strike,” Sadovyi told ABC News a few days ago, following one of his short talks with a local representative of the State Emergency Service. Ukrainian military intelligence officials said there's no immediate danger, despite constant military activity and intensifying reconnaissance by Belarus near the border. There have been rumors of an impending attack, perhaps spread deliberately by pro-Russian forces to divert attention from other frontlines, Sadovyi said. Rumors or not, his city is still preparing for the worst, he said. “We have to prepare all our shelters -- fill it with water and medical supplies,” he said. “We are definitely in a better situation than we were at the end of February 2022,” says Andriy Hodyk, first deputy head of the Lviv Regional Military Administration. It's not just longtime residents of Lviv region who have to be protected from the possible assault from the north. There are between 250,000 to 300,000 internally displaced people living in the Lviv region, according to Hodyk. Some of them have already joined the army. “As for April, in different districts of the region up to 20% of mobilized conscripts were internally displaced people,” he said. In a series of interviews, residents and refugees in Lviv described living with a sense of unease, of feeling as though an attack could come at any day, even if there's been no indication one will come anytime soon. Valeriy, a 41-year-old sculptor from Kharkiv, who arrived in Lviv over a month ago with his disabled brother, said he is ready to defend Lviv, although his original plan was to take his brother to the European Union for treatment. “War is war. Of course -- we need to help,"" he said while standing in his temporary shelter in the middle of a local park. ""There would be a lot of people ready to defend Lviv from the possible offensive from Belarus."" Two other men at the same location have big families and different concerns. Serhiy, 42, a driver and hydrotechnical specialist from the Kherson region, managed to get to the west by driving through a mined road with his wife and four children. He and his family are now planning to head to Germany, as he was told the German government would provide decent social support for families with children. Another man, who was also named Serhiy, 37, a constructor from Cherkasy region and a father of six, said he too planned to go West: “If I were not concerned by the possibility of the offensive from Belarus, I would definitely stay here.” Meanwhile, Stanislav, 38, a father of four boys who arrived in Lviv from Slovyansk three months ago, said he was hoping his family won’t have to flee from Lviv as well “Perhaps our army will stop them or it will be the same as in my home city,” he said. Nevertheless, he said he would consider returning home but on only one condition: it being under Ukrainian control. There are still constant reminders of the closeness of the war. Around 5 million people have gone through Lviv since Feb. 24, when the invasion began, and about 150,000 have taken refuge inside the city limits, Sadovyi, the mayor, said. “We expect 50,000 to stay,” he said. He expressed deep sadness about the funerals that are being held in Lviv. Fallen soldiers -- including some men who brought their families from the east and then left to join the Ukrainian army -- have been brought back to the city for farewell ceremonies, he said. “We are burying them here as they cannot be buried in their home cities -- for instance currently occupied Mariupol or Melitopol,” he said.",,,,7
2022-07-15,https://abcnews.go.com/International/demand-artificial-limbs-surges-ukraine/story?id=86798197,Demand for artificial limbs surges in Ukraine,"KYIV -- One of Ukraine’s leading medical experts on developing prosthetic limbs for amputees says there has been a dramatic surge in demand for artificial arms and legs since Russia invaded Ukraine. Dr. Oleksandr Stetsenko told ABC News that financial support or donations of prosthetic parts are needed from abroad to meet the increased demand. External support, he said, is vital so that people have the chance to continue with their lives. “With good prosthetics people can come back to life again.” There is currently no official figure for how many people in Ukraine have undergone surgery to remove limbs because of injuries sustained from the war but Dr. Stetsenko estimates that around 500 people have had limbs amputated since the end of February with the majority of those cases being soldiers and around a fifth being civilians. While the number of patients in Ukraine needing artificial limbs has increased, the domestic supply of components to make prosthetic arms and legs has reduced. That is because a third of the companies which were previously producing components in Ukraine are now located in territory which has recently been occupied by Russian forces or in areas near to the frontline, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Health. A Director at the Ministry, Oleksandra Mashkevych, confirmed that Ukraine is no longer able “to cover all of the demand relating to artificial limbs.” She told ABC News that children who need artificial limbs are sent abroad to Europe or to the United States and that around 20 children in Ukraine are thought to have had limbs amputated since the start of the war in February. Mashkevych explained that in cases where patients need prosthetic limbs, the total treatment can last up to six months and financial support from the European Union has been critical to ensure the needs of patients and their families who get transferred to countries such as Germany and Poland can be met. One of Dr. Stetsenko’s patients, 19-year-old Daniil Melnyk, who is currently undergoing intensive rehabilitation with two new artificial legs at a hospital in Kyiv, epitomizes the impact of the war on individual Ukrainians as well as his country’s broader fighting spirit. Daniil was still a cadet at Ukraine’s military academy when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in late February and, just days later, he joined the Ukrainian army’s 14th Brigade and was soon serving on the frontline defending the Ukrainian capital in the initial phase of the war. But on March 7, his unit was traveling in a Ukrainian military convoy near Kyiv when they came under Russian fire and Melnyk sustained horrific shrapnel wounds to his hands and legs. Despite being badly wounded he survived for two days before being captured by Russian troops. He was treated at a Russian field hospital and later transferred to military hospitals in Russia before returning to Ukraine after being exchanged in a prisoner swap. Melnyk's left hand was amputated when he was held and treated in Russia and both of his legs were later amputated when he returned to Ukraine. Melnyk, however, with two prosthetic legs, is impressively mobile and upbeat about his future. “Life is very precious” he told ABC News. “Being alive is enough for me. I can move. I feel great.” The 19-year-old dreams about using his steely sprit to help others and wants to become a military psychologist. To underline the importance of good quality prosthetics for patients such as Melnyk, Dr Oleksandr Stetsenko joked that it is like “the difference between a good car, and a bad car.” “People with good prosthetics can have a family and they can do any job.”",,,,4
2022-07-18,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-hoping-inflation-cools-gas-prices-fall-daily/story?id=87017827,Biden 'hoping' inflation cools as gas prices fall daily for more than a month,"The White House on Monday tried to counter bad news on soaring inflation by highlighting that a key driver of rising prices -- the cost of gasoline -- has been going down steadily for more than a month. The average American driver is now saving $25 per month at the pump as thousands of gas stations lower their prices to below $4 per gallon, Biden economic adviser Jared Bernstein told reporters at the daily White House briefing. Although gas prices are dropping below $4 a gallon in 30 states across the country, the national average stood at $4.52 Monday morning, according to AAA. Down more than 15 cents from the week before, Monday marks 34 consecutive days prices have fallen from the June 14 peak of $5.01 per gallon. Americans are spending $190 million less per day at current gas prices economy-wide, Bernstein said. That could translate into lower costs for other goods and services for which gas is an input, like transportation, he said. The White House expects prices will continue falling through the end of July, hoping prices hit $4 nationwide, Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese said during an appearance on CNN Monday morning. The White House pointed to the tech website Gas Buddy that monitors prices nationwide as tweeting that the most common gas price in the U.S. was $3.99 a gallon. When asked in Saudi Arabia last week about his message to Americans looking for relief at the pump, President Joe Biden said, ""there's been a real change."" ""They've been coming down every single day, to the best of my knowledge,"" Biden said. The president's remark came after he met with top members of Saudi Arabia's government. He reportedly sought a commitment from the country to boost its oil production so domestic prices in the U.S. could fall further. But Biden left the Middle East without Saudi Arabia or OPEC+3 countries as a group announcing any new commitments to boost oil production further. Last month, OPEC+3 announced it would increase July and August production to 50 percent above what it first planned. The White House signaled Monday it anticipates further steps to stabilize the market in the coming weeks. Saudi Arabia is a member of OPEC+3 with Russia, which the White House has frequently faulted for high energy prices due to the country's war in Ukraine. Even without securing a commitment from Saudi Arabia, the White House took credit for the price drop on Monday. ""​​This is important to note that the work that we have done, the work that we will continue to do is going to give relief [of] $25 a month to American families,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. ""On average, that matters to teachers that matters, the firefighters. That matters to nurses and everyday people. The president is going to continue to do the work to make sure the prices go down,"" she said. Relief at the pump comes as oil prices increase slightly compared to where they closed Friday. Oil traded for about $105 per barrel Monday morning, up approximately four dollars from Friday and down from a week ago. American refineries are operating in the mid-90 percent range, even as gasoline demand has fallen. That mismatch in supply and demand will soon result in a four-million-barrel surplus per day, according to energy analytics firm ESAI Energy. The U.S. releases one million barrels of crude oil daily from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. ""I'm hoping,"" the president said upon his return to the U.S. Saturday night when asked if inflation would fall. The remark followed Wednesday's news that inflation broke projections, rising 9.1 percent in June. The White House maintains the June report does not account for falling gas prices, which started decreasing halfway through the month. The Biden administration rejected the idea a recession is imminent Monday, citing a 3.6 percent unemployment rate near pre-pandemic levels and consumer spending. ""Those kinds of statistics are anything but recessionary,"" Bernstein said. ""The president's actions taken thus far are helping provide real relief, real breathing room for the American consumers at the pump,"" he added later.",,,,23

President Joe Biden was also there on the South Lawn to welcome Zelenska, presenting Ukraine's first lady with a bouquet of yellow sunflowers, blue hydrangeas and white orchids. The meeting between the two first ladies is one of several appearances Zelenska will make this week in Washington as Russia's invasion of Ukraine stretches into its sixth month. Russian troops have stepped up attacks across Ukraine's eastern and southern regions with missile strikes. Last week, a 4-year-old girl was killed in a strike targeting the city of Vinnytsia. On Monday, Zelenska met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters that Blinken underscored the U.S. commitment to the people of Ukraine and commended Zelenska on her work supporting civilians during the conflict. On Wednesday, Ukraine's first lady will make remarks before members of the House and Senate on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Zelenska will address the conflict's toll on women and children. ""The brutality of Russian aggression and the treatment of women and children have horrified the American people, and these crimes have been of particular concern to the women Members of Congress,"" Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues previewing the event. ""We look forward to hearing First Lady Zelenska report on this situation, as well as offer insight on security, economic and humanitarian conditions on the ground,"" Pelosi added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy received a standing ovation after virtually addressing members of Congress in the early days of the conflict. Zelenska spoke to ABC ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts last month on the state of the war. She described being separated from her husband since the conflict broke out in February and the global support the nation has received. In the interview, she also implored the American people ""not get used to this war."" ""Otherwise, we are risking a never-ending war and this is not something we would like to have,"" she said. ""Don't get used to our pain."" As the two first ladies took their seats in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, Jill Biden said they would talk about mental health issues for mothers and children who have ""suffered such tragedy and the atrocities."" This isn't the first time Biden and Zelenska have met. Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine in May during Mother's Day, meeting with Zelenska at a school in a small town in western Ukraine. ""I wanted to come on Mother's Day,"" Biden told the Ukrainian first lady. ""I thought it was important to show the Ukrainian people that this war has to stop and this war has been brutal and that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine.""

""You help us and your help is very strong,"" Zelenska said in a rare address by a first lady to U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday, via a translator. ""While Russia kills, America saves, and you should know about it. But unfortunately, the war is not over."" Zelenska arrived at the Capitol Visitors Center Congressional Auditorium with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shortly after 11 a.m. on Wednesday. Pelosi introduced her, stating the Congress is ""honored"" to welcome her from the war zone. Zelenska's remarks came as Vladimir Putin's forces ramp up attacks and missile strikes on Ukraine's eastern and southern regions. ""Usually the wives of the president are exclusively engaged in peaceful affairs -- education, human rights, equality, accessibility -- and maybe you expected from me to speak on those topics,"" she said. ""But how can I talk about them when an unprovoked, invasive terrorist war is being waged against my country?"" ""Russia is destroying our people,"" she said. The first lady spoke about the conflict's toll on women and children. She has been separated from her husband, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for much of the time since the war broke out in February. She told lawmakers she wanted to address them not just as politicians but as mothers, fathers, sons and daughters as she displayed images of some of the children killed in the conflict -- including a 4-year-old named Liza who was killed in a Russian missile strike in the city of Vinnytsia last week. While the slideshow of war casualties played behind her, Zelenska told lawmakers: ""Those are Russia's 'hunger games' — hunting for peaceful people in peaceful cities of Ukraine."" A photograph of Liza's stroller on the ground after the attack was shown to lawmakers on the screen behind Zelenska. ""I'm asking for air defense systems in order for rockets not to kill children in their strollers, in order for rockets not to destroy children's rooms and kill entire families,"" she said. Lawmakers in May passed a $40 billion aid package to Ukraine for military and economic assistance. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., told pool reporters that Zelenska's presentation was ""incredibly powerful"" and paused to gather his thoughts before saying how difficult it was to see photos of ""dead, maimed children."" Zelenska made many stops in Washington this week, holding meetings with high-profile officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power. On Tuesday, she met with U.S. first lady Jill Biden at the White House for a bilateral meeting. President Zelesnkyy said on Tuesday he expects from his wife's visit ""significant results for Ukraine in cooperation with America. ​​It is important right now."" ""I really believe that it will be heard by those on whom decision-making in the U.S. depends,"" Zelenskyy said of his wife's address to Congress. Zelenskyy addressed U.S. lawmakers himself virtually in March, receiving a standing ovation after invoking Pearl Harbor in his plea for additional military aid.",,,,25
2022-07-22,https://abcnews.go.com/US/economic-cost-extreme-heat-climbing/story?id=87148601,"Extreme heat taking its toll on US, European economies","It's been a pressure cooker of a summer for economies in both the U.S. and Europe, and experts say the extreme heat is making it increasingly difficult for workers to do their jobs -- especially those who work outdoors. A historic and deadly heat wave has been scorching western Europe, killing more than 1,000 people in Spain and Portugal and displacing thousands in France, Greece and Italy. In Britain and Germany, the excessive heat is unprecedented. At the same time, much of the U.S. is baking under oppressive heat, as temperatures in Texas and Oklahoma topped 113 degrees. A video this week of a UPS delivery driver collapsing in the triple-digit heat of Scottsdale, Arizona, went viral. A UPS spokesperson confirmed the incident in a statement to Phoenix ABC affiliate KNXV, saying in part: ""We appreciate the concern for our employee and can report that he is fine... Our employee used his training to be aware of his situation and contact his manager for assistance, who immediately provided assistance."" Worker productivity losses due to heat cost the U.S. an estimated $100 billion a year, according to a report by the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center. As days of extreme heat become more frequent, the report claims that figure is projected to double to $200 billion by 2030, or about 0.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the average temperatures of several major U.S. cities have increased over the last 120 years, with Los Angeles County getting 3.4 degrees hotter and New York County experiencing a rise of 3.2 degrees in the average temperature. In Dallas County, Texas, the average temperature rose 1.2 degrees in the past 60 years, according to NOAA, and experts say the Southeast and Midwest are projected to face the highest economic toll from extreme heat. Texas loses an average of $30 billion a year due to its climate and the large number of people working outdoors, according to the think-tank's report. That number is projected to jump to $110 billion a year by 2050, amounting to 2.5% of Texas' total economic output. That same report found that industries most affected by extreme heat are construction and agriculture, where workers are most exposed to the elements. By 2050, construction is projected to lose 3.5% of its total annual economic activity to heat, or $1.2 billion per year, while agriculture is estimated to lose 3.7%, or nearly $131 million a year. President Joe Biden this week announced new executive steps to combat climate change but fell short of declaring a climate emergency. The move comes after a major legislative package with more than $300 billion in clean-energy tax breaks stalled on Capitol Hill. ""Since Congress is not acting as it should... This is an emergency and I will look at it that way,"" Biden said. The initiatives include $2.3 billion in funding for a program that helps communities prepare for disasters by expanding flood control and retrofitting buildings, as well as funding to help low-income families cover heating and cooling costs. Americans' electric bills are expected to increase by 20% to an average of $540 for this summer, compared to the same period last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. It comes at a time when consumers are already battling the highest inflation in 40 years with soaring prices for food, gas and other essentials. But not all of that increase in energy bills is due to a rise in usage. The rise is partly fueled by a jump in the price of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity. Natural gas prices have surged this year following a production slump during the pandemic, as well as shortages due to the war in Ukraine. Europe's heat wave is adding pressure to the continent's energy crunch. Electricity prices are already on the rise as Russia chokes off Europe's natural gas supply. One of Germany's largest power producers, Uniper, is asking for a government bailout after higher energy prices and rising demand for power amid soaring temperatures depleted the company's cash. The mercury reached a record 104 F in the U.K. this week, a country not accustomed to such extreme temperatures. The average temperature in the U.K. in July is 75 F so far, and most homes and businesses don't have air conditioners. The Met Office, the country's national weather service, warned that the heat will have ""widespread impacts on people and infrastructure."" Luton Airport, north of London, suspended flights Monday after record heat caused a surface defect on the runway, while the country's main rail network urged people to travel only if ""absolutely necessary."" Analysts say the sweltering heat comes at the height of tourism season for Europe and threatens foot traffic at retailers as shoppers choose to stay indoors. Record high temperatures and wildfires in France, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, which is suffering through one of its worst droughts on record, are destroying crops, pushing already high food prices even higher. More than half of the 27 countries in the European Union now face the threat of drought, made worse by extreme heat, according to a report from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. According to a study last year by European economists and climate experts published in the journal Nature Communications, heat waves on average had lowered overall annual economic growth across Europe by as much as 0.5% in the past decade. Italian Authorities in the northern region of Lombardy said 70% of crops are gone in the Po River delta and warn that water supplies for agriculture could run out by the end of July. The Italian farmers' association, Coldiretti, said that each fire costs Italians about $25,000 an acre to rebuild, and the group estimates that wheat production in Italy will decline by 15% because of an increase in production costs and the drought. ""We're working carefully, alongside different associations,"" Lombardy President Attilio Fontana told a press conference in Milan on Tuesday. ""Unfortunately, the only thing we can hope for is that it starts to rain again.""",,,,10

Andrei Skoch has been a member of Russia's national parliament since 1999 and under U.S. sanctions since 2018 because of his ""longstanding ties to Russian organized criminal groups, including time spent leading one such enterprise,"" according to the Treasury Department. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the U.S. issued further sanctions against Skoch and his assets for ""support[ing] the Kremlin's efforts to violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" ""Once again US law enforcement has demonstrated that international shell games will not suffice to hide the fruits of corruption and money laundering,"" said Andrew Adams, director of the Justice Department's KleptoCapture task force that has been moving to seize assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Skoch came to own the Airbus through a series of shell companies and trusts tied to his romantic partner, according to a seizure warrant issued by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. U.S. dollar transactions were made to pay for the registration of the Airbus in Aruba and for aviation insurance premiums, each of which was a necessary expense to maintain and operate the Airbus, the document said. The private jet is currently located in Kazakhstan, according to federal prosecutors. Skoch is part owner of the steel company Lebedinsky Mining, which is now part of the conglomerate Metalloinvest. The Justice Department's KleptoCapture task force is targeting sanctioned Russian oligarchs and their assets over their support for Russia's unprovoked war against Ukraine. ""The sanctions levied by the U.S. government and the work of this task force demonstrate to these offensively wealthy oligarchs who support Russia's military aggression that they are not untouchable, and we are dramatically impacting their way of life,"" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Michael Driscoll. The 56-year-old father of 10 already moved his $156 million superyacht, Madame Gu, to Dubai in order to avoid its seizure, according to The Associated Press.

But they weren't looking for phones. Victoria, a 42-year-old Ukrainian woman, told ABC News she and another woman, a neighbor, were raped by two of the Russian soldiers occupying her village near Kyiv in March. ABC News spoke to the two women who agreed to talk about what they say happened to them, on condition that their location and last names not be revealed. Another soldier, a commanding officer who was not involved in the assault, threatened Victoria, she says. ""He looked at me and said, 'You see, our boys have had a drink and want to have fun,'"" Victoria recounts. ""I understood that something terrible would happen."" Two of the soldiers took the women to a house converted into headquarters for the Russian occupiers and raped them, they say. That neighbor, 44-year-old Natalya, recounted the events to ABC News. ""He says, 'do you want everything to be fine with your son? So get upstairs and do as I tell you,'"" Natalya recalled, describing her encounter with one of the Russian soldiers she says raped her. ""He was like an animal…And that rifle was hanging around and swinging."" Natalya says she later learned the soldiers killed her husband after she was taken away. Its unclear how many soldiers or which ones were involved in the killing. The family buried her husband the next day. The two Russian soldiers the women say raped them have not yet been identified but face international arrest warrants, according to Kateryna Duchenko, the Ukrainian prosecutor in charge of sexual violence cases committed by Russian soldiers. Both cases are being investigated with slim chances of the suspects being taken under custody or doing any prison time, she said. Stories of rape and other atrocities at the hands of Russian troops are not unheard of in small towns and suburbs of Kyiv. Residents of Bucha and Borodyanka have reported human rights violations including rape, murder and torture by Russian forces during the invasion. Russian authorities have not responded to ABC News' requests for comment on the cases. ""The last case [we identified] was in occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia region, where allegedly 10 Russian soldiers raped a woman,"" Duchenko said. Communication with residents inside Russian-occupied territories is extremely difficult, making the investigation and prosecution of these cases nearly impossible, Duchenko said. ""We know she is alive and that she had medical treatment and those details are all we've got,"" Duchenko said on the limited information in the case in Zaporizhzhia. The United Nations reported in June it had collected 124 reports of alleged acts of conflict-related sexual violence but qualified that number as ""the tip of the iceberg"" and added that it did ""not reflect the scale of sexual violence in the context of Russia's war against Ukraine."" Victoria and Natalya say they are now undergoing counseling with a psychologist about their trauma. ""I wanted to take off my skin and throw it away,"" Victoria says. ""The person I was before the war is no longer there. I became more aggressive. I began to fight more for my own."" Natalya says she is still coming to terms with the assault. ""Many people have asked me, why aren't you crying, why haven't you gone crazy?"" she said. In June, Ukrainian authorities said they opened the first trial on sexual violence committed by a Russian soldier, according to the Kyiv Post. The suspect will be tried in absentia. Duchenko's office says it is working on prosecuting two other cases of sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers in addition to the case opened in June. The suspects will also be tried in absentia, since they are not in Ukrainian custody.",,,,19

The ships, sunken on Danube River, were part of Nazi Germany's Black Sea fleet in 1944 as they retreated from advancing Soviet forces, officials said. The vessels still impact the river today, often hampering river traffic during low water levels, authorities said. Now, over 20 ships have come to the surface, many of which are still loaded with ammunition and explosives. Officials say the vessels pose a risk to shipping on the Danube. The vessels have limited the navigable section of the stretch near Prahova to 100 meters, significantly slimmer than the prior 180 meters ships had access to. Serbian officials have taken to dredging along the river to salvage the usable navigation lanes. We have deployed almost [our] entire [dredging] capacity... We are struggling to keep out waterways navigable along their full length,"" Veljko Kovacevic, Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Transportation, told Reuters. The increasing difficulties for shipping boats will impact the country’s vital transportation of coal, which accounts for two thirds of Serbia’s electrical output, officials said. Further implicating the energy crisis, water flow in Serbia’s hydropower system dropped by half in the past two months, officials told the Balkan Green Energy News. The country is also already enduring the impacts of the war in Ukraine upon their energy supply. Officials said the ships vary, with some now showing turrets, command bridges, broken masts and twisted hulls, while even more still remain buried under sand banks. In March, the Serbian government invited a contracted a private company for the salvage of some of the hulls and removal of ammunition and explosives. The operation cost officials an estimated $30 million, according to the country's infrastructure ministry. ""The German flotilla has left behind a big ecological disaster that threatens us, people of Prahovo,"" Velimir Trajilovic, 74, a pensioner from Prahovo who wrote a book about the German ships, told Reuters. The exposure of more of the sunken fleet comes after a summer of low water levels and sizzling drought. The Danube levels near Prahovo are less than half their average for this time of the summer, experts say.",,,,10
2022-08-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-ukraine-conflict-continues-impact-civilians/story?id=88210989,How the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to impact civilians,"Six months into Russia's invasion, a humanitarian crisis continues to unfold in Ukraine, as millions have been displaced and thousands killed during the conflict. With no immediate end in sight to the fighting, humanitarian aid responders are fearful that winter will only bring further suffering for Ukrainian citizens already afflicted by six months of war. Hundreds of civilians are killed or wounded each week, primarily due to explosive weapons, such as shelling from air strikes and missiles, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which has been verifying civilian casualties since the start of the invasion. “Civilians continue to pay too high a price in this war,"" the U.N.'s political and peacebuilding chief, Rosemary DiCarlo, said in remarks to the U.N. Security Council in June. By the U.N's most recent count, as of Aug. 21, there have been over 13,400 verified civilian casualties in Ukraine since Feb. 24, including nearly 1,000 children. So far over 5,500 civilians have been killed and over 7,800 injured, according to the U.N., though those numbers are likely considerably higher. ""There are some black holes,"" Matilda Bogner, head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, told ABC News. ""For example Mariupol, which went through very severe, very heavy hostilities and connections were cut off. For a period of time it was not possible to speak to people there. It was very difficult to get full information."" March has so far seen the highest number of civilian injuries and deaths -- on a ""much larger scale"" than the most intense fighting after Russian forces invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014, Bogner said. A U.N. report found that from 2014 to 2016, up to 2,000 civilians were killed in Ukraine due to the conflict with Russia. ""While we don't know the full extent, I think we have a fairly clear picture and it means that a lot of civilians are suffering,"" Bogner said of this latest conflict. The U.N. has raised concerns that the high number of civilian casualties indicates that Russia is not complying with international humanitarian law. In one of the deadliest assaults on civilians, hundreds of people who were taking refuge in a theater in the besieged port city of Mariupol were killed in an air strike in March. Amnesty International called the act a ""clear war crime"" by Russian forces. In Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, dozens were killed in a rocket strike on a train station that was being used for civilian evacuations. Amnesty International said it has also documented evidence that Russian forces executed civilians in Ukraine in apparent war crimes, which Russia has denied. According to the World Health Organization, there have been 445 attacks related to health care in Ukraine reported between Feb. 24 and Aug. 11 -- including against health facilities, as well as personnel and patients. Such attacks violate international humanitarian law, which has a higher level of protection for medical establishments, Bogner said. They may have helped contribute to the high number of civilian deaths reported in March, she said, if injured civilians were unable to seek care. The attacks also prevent people from accessing regular health care, including for chronic conditions, and child vaccinations, Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the humanitarian aid organization International Rescue Committee, told ABC News. ""That will have a lasting impact,"" Zapasnik said. ""Their health care system is really overstretched at the moment."" Schools have also been impacted during the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said more than 2,000 educational institutions in Ukraine, including kindergartens, schools and universities, have been destroyed in Russian air strikes. September means the beginning of the new school year, though many schools are not in a position to open because they do not have a bomb shelter or they've been damaged, Bogner said. ""One reason why see so many schools attacked is that we have documented armed forces from both sides using schools as bases,"" Bogner said. ""That then means it becomes a legitimate object for the other side to attack. So this is certainly something that we discourage."" For Ukrainians, the past six months have been filled with stress and anxiety. ""A lot of families' coping mechanisms are being stretched now to breaking points,"" Zapasnik said. ""There are air raid sirens here on a regular basis,"" said Zapasnik, who is based in Odesa. ""The level of psychosocial stress is quite high across the country, but specifically in the east and south."" Women and children, who are often the most vulnerable in conflict situations, may be in particular need of support, she said. ""Dealing with things such as family separation, death of a loved one, going through a lot of stress, fear, a sense of helplessness,"" she said. Families may also be stressed financially, especially if they've lost their livelihood during the war, she said. Millions of civilians are also without sufficient access to necessities, such as food, water and power sources. As of Aug. 3, UNICEF estimates that nearly 16 million people need humanitarian assistance due to the crisis. ""This continued war in Ukraine is causing extreme civilian harm,"" Zapasnik said. ""Apart from the civilian deaths and injuries ... the war is also leaving millions without sufficient access to food, water, power sources, health care and other essential items."" The International Rescue Committee expects the number of those in need of humanitarian assistance to ""increase dramatically"" in the winter months, as civilians continue to be displaced and there is no electricity when temperatures plunge, Zapasnik said. Humanitarian aid organizations are starting to plan for winter now due to challenging supply chain logistics, Zapasnik said, so that they're not caught flatfooted in their response. ""Currently what I'm most concerned about is the winter,"" Zapasnik said.",,,,15
2022-08-23,https://abcnews.go.com/International/months-invasion-endgame-ukraine/story?id=88210112,"6 months into invasion, what is the endgame in Ukraine?","Wednesday marks six months since Russia invaded Ukraine. In the months since Russia's blitzkrieg attack from the north and east, which was met with a stronger-than-expected resistance from the outmanned and outgunned Ukrainians, the evolving conflict has become more of a ""static war"" with no clear winners, according to ABC News contributor retired Col. Steve Ganyard. ""At this stage, both countries, both Ukraine and Russia, seem to be losing,"" Ganyard said. ""And now the fight is obviously who can lose first and who will have to lose last."" It's impossible to predict how much longer the war will last -- it could be months or even years, Ganyard said. ""This is a war that's unfolding at this point very, very slowly,"" he said. ""Neither side has the ability to conduct significant offensive operations."" How long the fighting continues until one side ""loses first"" will likely depend on a few factors. For Russia, getting troops on the ground to maintain the territory it's taken is one, as recruiting personnel has been a challenge, Ganyard said. The Russian military hasn't given an official update on casualties since late March, when it reported around 1,350. One U.S. Department of Defense official estimated earlier this month that at least 70,000 Russians have been killed or wounded since the start of the war. ""There's a lot of fog in war, but, you know, I think it's safe to suggest that the Russians have probably taken 70 or 80,000 casualties in less than six months,"" Colin Kahl, the undersecretary for defense for policy at the Department of Defense, told reporters. Russian President Vladimir Putin has a ""very difficult chore"" to recruit qualified military personnel to fight in Ukraine, Ganyard said. ""The Russians are basically recruiting out of prisons at this point,"" he said. ""They have not mobilized the whole nation."" The number of Ukrainian soldiers killed since Feb. 24 is classified, but deputy minister of defense Hanna Maliar has said there are ""thousands."" There have also been thousands of civilian casualties; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates that over 5,500 have been killed and over 7,600 injured in Ukraine since Feb. 24. For Ukraine, continued support from the West will be key, Ganyard said, including supplies of precision weapons such as the long-range High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARs, which Ukrainian forces have used to wear down Russians in rear areas. ""The ability for the Ukrainians to target very precise locations -- command posts, supply depots -- this allows the Ukrainians to begin to attrite and wear down the Russians in their rear areas, take away the supplies that they're using to conduct this war,"" Ganyard said. This development is ""unprecedented"" so far in the conflict, he said. ""Up to this point, the war had been basically a slugfest -- artillery against artillery,"" he said. ""But now that the Ukrainians have this long-range capability where they can hit very precise coordinates, it gives them an offensive advantage."" Though as the conflict continues, there is a risk for Ukraine that Western support could wane as the impacts of the war, such as from energy supplies in Europe, are felt in the months ahead, he said. How much more of a beating their contracted economies can withstand will be a factor for both countries, Ganyard said. ""As we see both economies get drawn down, as we see both militaries being punished and diminished, it's going to be a question of who can survive and who can lose last,"" he said. Morale also continues to be crucial, with Ukraine buoyed by its offensive advantage while Russia looks to hold ground in hostile territory, he said. For Kahl, ""Ukrainian morale and will to fight is unquestioned and much higher, I think, than the average morale and will to fight on the Russian side,"" he told reporters. ""I think that gives the Ukrainians a significant advantage."" With those factors in consideration, there are several ways the conflict could potentially play out: In a ""best-case scenario"" for Russia, its troops will continue to gain incrementally in the Donbas and hold their ground against Ukrainian forces, Ganyard said. If Ukraine doesn't have the arsenal to push back or can't hold out amid a downhill economy, that could put them in a position to sue for peace, he said. ""Where the Russians are pushing in from the east toward the west, that is the bread basket of Ukraine,"" Ganyard said. ""That is where not only most of the industry is, but it's where most of the agriculture, very rich agricultural area, all of that gets transported down the Dnipro River. ""If Russia would be able to hang on to that, it would almost cut Ukraine in half, and certainly cut the Ukrainian economy by more than half,"" he continued. If Ukraine manages to recapture some of the territory in the Donbas claimed by Russian forces since the invasion started, that could pressure Putin to end the invasion to stave off further embarrassment, Ganyard said. ""If he began to lose, if he began to take even heavier losses, if the Ukrainians were able to recapture parts of Ukraine that the Russians have taken, at some point Putin may decide to cut his losses and declare victory and take whatever's left on the table in terms of the territory that he's taken thus far,"" Ganyard said. Alternately, Putin may push back against the political embarrassment of losing territory it had gained since the start of the invasion, Ganyard said. ""The more gains that the Ukrainians make, it's actually going to make the whole situation more dangerous because Putin may react in a way that escalates to de-escalate,"" Ganyard said. ""We've heard that term in the past, and usually that refers to the use of tactical battlefield nuclear weapons. ""The danger here is if the Ukrainians continue to do better, what does Putin do to save himself to save his beloved, domestic political position?"" he continued. ""Does he do something that would shock the whole world and try to scare the Ukrainians into an early surrender?"" Kherson, a port city on the north of the Crimean Peninsula, was the first major city to fall after Russia launched its invasion. The city is key to Ukraine for its access to the Black Sea and ability to move goods. If Ukraine manages to make ground and pushes past Kherson and threatens Russia-annexed Crimea, that could give Ukraine a negotiating advantage, Ganyard said. ""[Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy will continue to try to threaten Crimea to be able to pressure Putin,"" he said. That could look like threatening to turn off the freshwater supplies into Crimea, he said. ""There's all sorts of unknowns here about what happens,"" Ganyard said. ""As they go into the fall and into the winter, there may be some movement in terms of the negotiations. But at this point, neither side can afford to give up the kinds of military actions that we see on the ground to this point.""",,,,7
2022-08-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-celebrates-independence-day-marks-months-war/story?id=88728029,Ukraine celebrates Independence Day as it marks 6 months of war,"KYIV and LONDON -- As Ukraine prepared on Wednesday to celebrate its Independence Day, residents of Kyiv, the capital, took to the streets to take photographs with rows of destroyed Russian tanks, which have become a symbol of Russia’s failed strategy to take the city. The Russian army may have failed in its early plans to replace the Ukrainian government, but a war of attrition has set into the country’s east, with analysts warning that the war may drag on for months or even years. Despite the presence of the tanks, the atmosphere in the capital this week has been mostly muted, residents said. But authorities have warned that Independence Day may bring renewed Russian strikes on the city, far away from the frontlines. The United States repeated those warnings, with Americans being advised to leave the country via private means. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said the State Department “has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days."" With the city on high alert and the country under assault, the overlap of the two anniversaries has proven to be a moment for Ukrainians to reflect on the meaning of their independence. Ukraine issued its Declaration of Independence from the Soviet Union on Aug. 24, 1991. The day has since been one of Ukraine’s state holidays, usually marked by a military parade. ""During these six months, we changed history, changed the world and changed ourselves,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a speech on Wednesday. ""And the whole world learned who Ukrainians are. What Ukraine is. No one will say about it anymore: it is somewhere over there, near Russia."" The Ukrainian public not only supports the struggle to liberate the Russian controlled-areas, but has said it believes that Ukraine will win the war, according to polling in the country, though reports suggest Ukrainians are more divided on how much territory taken back would constitute a victory. But it has also left a nation traumatized by war. Millions have been displaced and hundreds of civilians are killed each week, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Humanitarians fear that the winter will bring more misery. There have been almost 1,000 verified deaths of children, according to the U.N., though observers say this number is likely higher. For many, independence now carries a new significance. “When Ukraine became an independent country, I was a little kid, I was only ten and at that time, I really couldn’t understand what is going on around, but I have heard many times from my grandmother about evil of Russian empire,” Andriy, 41, a musician, traumatologist and radio anchor from Lviv who now serves as a medic on the southern front, told ABC News. “When [the] Russian war exploded with more power on February 24, now I understand independence of Ukraine as [an] absolutely new thing.” German, a 59-year-old Kyiv resident, said there is a new clarity about what it means to be an independent country on the eve of the anniversary. “Until February 24, 2022, there was no clearly formed understanding of independence,” he told ABC News. “After the start of the war, the vision was as follows: independence is free people hardened into a nation that moves its state forward.” For some of the displaced, being forced to flee from the east has uprooted their sense of local identity and connection to home, even if they believe in Ukraine’s ultimate victory. “Maybe now I will sound in a stupid way, but I don't want to adapt, to adjust,” Yana, a 32-year-old who left the city of Kharkiv in March to the comparatively safe western city of Lviv, told ABC News. “No, not because I'm somehow abnormal, just because I don't have a sense of home anywhere… Lviv is a wonderful city, and Vinnytsia, and Poltava, and Kremenchuk, and all other cities, but my home is not there.” “What has changed now, every minute of our existence, we need to prove and fight for our independence,” she said. “Which until February 24 was a common thing and understandable to everyone.” For many Ukrainians, the war has changed not just their understanding of independence, but their entire lives, forever. “Adaptation is very simple,” German said. “It will never be the same again, as it was before. So I do what I can for the victory.”",,,,7

Andrii, 15, helped by his father, put his life in danger and sent the Ukrainian military the coordinates of advancing Russian forces during the early days of the war. The war in Ukraine, which has raged on for six months, has had a particularly brutal effect on children. Nearly 1,000 children have been killed or injured during the war, UNICEF estimates, and more than 5 million Ukrainian children both in the country and living as refugees abroad are in need of humanitarian aid. ""My mother was very scared at first,"" Andrii told ABC News reporter Britt Clennett. ""But now she is proud that we did well, that we are healthy and that we were able to help. Andrii said that they posted in a local village group that they had a drone, and that Andrii knew how to operate it. A man named Yuri Kasyanov from the civil defense forces responded to their post, Andrii told ABC News, adding that ""he didn't know that I'm 15."" Andrii was asked to use his drone to spy on advancing Russian vehicles in Makariv, a village near his own village of Kolonschyna, in the outskirts of Kiev. ""There were fuel trucks, tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers,"" he said. ""I tracked them on a drone, they were in my picture. And then I opened the tab with the map on the drone and put a mark on it and the coordinates appeared there."" Andrii said he passed the coordinates to Kasyanov, who passed them on to the Ukrainian artillery. The artillery decimated the column of Russian tanks within minutes. They were near enough to an explosion related to the attack that they had to evacuate the area, he said. ""Yuri organized a green corridor for us - a convoy,"" he said. ""We went through this field to the Zhytomyr highway that had already been liberated by that time."" Andrii said his friends didn't believe him at first when he recounted his story of helping to defeat Russian forces, but then they saw him on TV. ""My friends are very happy that everything turned out and I am fine,"" he said. ""I had to help because I could.""",,,,9
2022-08-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-volunteer-army-responds-russian-hackers-minister/story?id=88651955,"Ukraine's volunteer 'IT army' responds to Russian hackers, minister says","LVIV, Ukraine -- The largest power producer in Ukraine, which operates four nuclear power plants, last week survived what officials described as the most powerful attack on Ukraine by Russia hackers since the end of February. According to the Ukrainian nuclear agency, Energoatom, the attack did not cause any harm. At the same time, Ukrainians are hitting back at Russian digital infrastructure. In Russia, more than 600 online resources including the federal postal service, pension fund, online banking and video conference platforms were affected by Ukrainian hackers in this month, according to a statement by the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. ""Cyberspace is a frontline of the 21st century, and victories there are as important as in actual battlefields,"" Mykhailo Fedorov, the Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, told ABC News. He's responsible for establishing the so-called ""IT army"" -- a gathering of more than 230,000 anonymous volunteers who are working together via Telegram, an online messaging platform. Russia's assault on Ukraine has extended into the virtual domain as well as on real-life battlegrounds. And here the enemy is choosing very sensitive targets that could impact security for Ukraine, Europe and even the world. But Fedorov said his country's cyber security system was more than efficient. ""None out of over 800 cyberattacks since February 24 caused real losses for the Ukrainian economy, stopped the banking system or damaged critical infrastructure,"" he said. Some IT companies in Lviv, one of the biggest hubs for the industry, said they weren't eager to disclose their involvement in the country's digital defense efforts. Some in the Lviv IT community told ABC News it is a matter of a personal choice for members of their staff to join the fight. Stepan, a 41-year-old member of the IT army, spoke to ABC News but asked not to use his real name because of fears of reprisal. ""On the second or third day of a new phase of Russian aggression I saw the tweet from the minister of digital transformation about the establishment of a Telegram channel, and that was very helpful to figure it out, what exactly to do to help my country,"" Stepan said. He said he had no military experience and he spent all his time in front of his computer screen. Now, almost every day, Stepan and the rest of the unofficial Ukrainian IT army are being given clear online instructions explaining top targets and offering software they should use for the coordinated strike. As a programmer he understands that his input makes sense only as a part of a team effort: ""I am not doing a huge amount of work, but in general, when we are acting all together, our input is very useful."" ""I just start some applications and I am free for coffee, tracking the process from time to time -- maybe some new targets emerged,"" he said, adding that the IT warriors were not staying in front of their computers every moment of the day. He added, ""I am always analyzing and searching for some additional information. Why this particular target is important, who are those people to be affected by our interference."" When asked if he worried about the impact of his efforts on everyday Russians, he said that ""it is not the time for that, as I do not see any changes in Russian society during these months -- sure, it is not a matter of some rapid shifts in their consciousness. That is why we just have to keep on doing what we are doing."" The volunteer-based IT army's mission now is to hold the digital frontline of Ukraine while the regular cyber forces are still in the process of assembling, Fedorov, the minister, said. The country is countering Russian cyber-attacks on a daily basis, he said. Russia is weaker after at least 40 cybersecurity companies announced their withdrawal from the Russian market and suspended service for Russian clients, Fedorov said. ""As many software or hardware solutions just cannot be replaced by Russian-owned technologies, it takes time to develop their own solutions,"" he said. The minister also said he was is counting on international support for Ukraine, asking the international tech sector to share the newest cyber solutions and offer service and equipment, which can help Ukraine. ""We are showing Russia that tech is a future, and tech will win over large manpower and outdated tanks,"" he said. As a member of the IT army, Stepan said he believed that he is weakening the Russian economy and its sponsorship of the terror on Ukrainian soil. And he is not the only member of his family who is involved into the struggle. ""Together with my wife, who is also a volunteer, but in a different way, we are actively waiting for this war to end,"" he said.",,,,7

""It's a very difficult war,"" Zelenskyy told Muir from the presidential office in Kyiv. ""We will regain our territory."" You can watch more of David Muir's full interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and ""World News Tonight."" Last week, the Ukrainian military launched a long-awaited counteroffensive near the southern port city of Kherson, which Russian forces seized in early March. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall to the Russians amid the early days of the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24. The counteroffensive there is one of the first for Ukrainian troops that have been largely on the defensive. In his nightly video address on Sunday, the Ukrainian president said he had received ""good reports"" from his military commanders and head of intelligence. He thanks his troops for liberating a settlement in the eastern Donetsk region as well as two settlements in the south, and for advancing and regaining ""certain heights"" in an eastern area in the Lysychansk-Siversk direction. Zelenskyy told Muir that Ukrainians ""need to, step-by-step, de-occupy our territory."" ""This task is difficult and it doesn't only depend on us, but I'm sure that is what will happen,"" he added. ""It's only matter of time."" When asked why the Ukrainian military decided to launch the counteroffensive in the Kherson region at this time, Zelenskyy told Muir: ""I won't say that it's only counteroffensive in Kherson ... There is a direction or directions -- plural -- and we have to move forward."" Asked to clarify that the Kherson counteroffensive is not the only one underway in Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he ""can't discuss details of any military actions."" ""I want that the enemy gets some surprises from us,"" he added. Muir pressed: ""So what you are telling me, more than six months into this war, is that you will cede no Ukrainian territory -- that is not on the table?"" ""No,"" Zelenskyy responded. ""We will not.

""It's a question of dialogue with terrorists. We cannot -- you cannot discuss anything with terrorists. The majority of the world -- majority of the countries -- understand that we are dealing with a terrorist state after what they've done to our people, to civilian people,"" Zelenskyy said. You can watch more of David Muir's full interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and ""World News Tonight."" Zelenskyy cited suspected instances of rape and torture by Russian troops in areas outside of Kyiv during a retreat earlier this year. Images of tortured and bound bodies littered across neighborhoods like Bucha spread across the world. ""After rapes, after tortures, after murders, after we discovered a lot of dead bodies ... it's not a war, it's pure and clear terrorism, which Russia is doing against our nation and occupation of our land,"" the Ukrainian president said. ""So, we cannot have any compromises with terrorists. We cannot have any dialogue with the terrorists."" When pressed by Muir over the alleged atrocities, Zelenskyy said Putin was a war criminal and should be prosecuted. ""As any civilized person, any civilized man, I think that those responsible should not just go to hell, no, they should have fair trials -- fair, independent trials,"" Zelenskyy said. The comments come as Ukraine wages a counteroffensive to regain territory in the southern and eastern parts of the country that were lost to Russia. The main counteroffensive is focused around the port city of Kherson, which was the first major city Russia conquered in its invasion. However, Zelenskyy hinted to Muir that more than one counteroffensive is taking place. ""I won't say that it's only counteroffensive in Kherson. ...

2022-09-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-buying-millions-rockets-artillery-north-korea-ukraine/story?id=89410990,Russia is buying 'millions of rockets and artillery' from North Korea for its Ukraine invasion: US,"With few trade partners and an empty armory, the Kremlin is being forced to turn to North Korea to stock up on vital supplies to fuel its ongoing war in Ukraine, according to a recently declassified U.S. intelligence report. A U.S. official told ABC News that Russia's Ministry of Defense was ""in the process"" of buying ""millions of rockets and artillery shells"" from the so-called Hermit Kingdom and that the purchases were an indication Moscow's military ""continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions."" The official added that the intelligence community assessed it would likely become part of a pattern, with Russia seeking ""to purchase additional North Korean military equipment going forward."" (Neither country has yet responded to the report.) The Biden administration touted the development, first reported by The New York Times, as evidence that international sanctions -- despite what experts have called some adverse ripple effects in the U.S. -- were proving successful even as the White House resisted Kyiv's calls to impose additional penalties against Russia by branding it a state sponsor of terrorism. ""Our sanctions, export controls and efforts to further isolate Russia from the global economy are having a significant impact,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday. ""We are choking off Russia's military supply chains."" While North Korea wouldn't be providing Moscow with the most cutting-edge military technology, its Soviet-era stockpiles could fill a pressing niche by restocking Russian forces with artillery shells compatible with its weapon systems developed during the same timeframe -- ammunition it is struggling to supply. ""The fact that they're reaching out to North Korea is a sign that that they're having some challenges on the sustainment front,"" Pentagon spokesman Brigadier Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday. Ryder added that the intelligence on the weapons sale was declassified so the international community and the American public could better ""understand the situation that Russia finds itself as they again continue to wage their campaign in Ukraine."" So far, American officials have released little information about what -- if any -- action they intend to take to hinder or penalize Russia's purchases from North Korea. The State Department's principal deputy spokesperson, Vedant Patel, said that the sale was a clear violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions that prohibit the procurement of arms from North Korea, but he declined to say whether the U.S. planned to raise the issue to the intergovernmental organization or take other steps. ""While all U.N. sanctions are a serious violation, I think particularly concerning here is that a permanent member of the Security Council is floating these measures,"" Patel said, referring to Russia's powerful status within the body. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby added the caveat that there was no indication that the purchase had been completed or that any arms from North Korea were currently being used on battlefields in Ukraine. Pyongyang isn't the only pariah Russia has sought to broker an arms deal with in recent weeks. Last month, Moscow acquired drones from Iran. A Department of Defense official told ABC News that while the Kremlin will likely seek to import several hundred more, the initial shipment performed poorly, experiencing ""numerous failures."" Weapons from North Korea and Iran might not significantly move the needle in Ukraine, but U.S. officials are watching carefully to see if a much more significant power comes to Russia's aid: China. Beijing and Moscow retain close trade and defense ties, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked concern that the two could forge a military alliance. (China officially remains neutral on the conflict.) The U.S. has warned of intense consequences for China should it sell Moscow military supplies, but so far, there's no evidence it has violated export controls. ""In terms of what Russia may be asking of China or not, I don't have any information to provide from the podium on that,"" Pentagon spokesman Ryder said, ""other than to say that, in an era of strategic competition, we'll continue to keep a very close eye on Russia and China.""

Ukrainian troops have advanced 70 kilometers in less than a week, resulting in part of Russia's front-line collapse in Ukraine's northeast, with large numbers of Russian troops forced to retreat. One Ukrainian military source described the multi-pronged offensive as ""a thoroughly planned operation"" and told ABC News that ""everything was running to schedule."" The source also claimed that Russian troops in the area ""were running away."" In a major development on Saturday, Ukrainian forces appeared to have retaken the strategically important city of Izyum. This claim was made by multiple unconfirmed reports on social media and confirmed by a military source to ABC News. Russian military bloggers, some of who are embedded with Russian troops in Ukraine, also said Russian forces had retreated from Izyum to avoid being encircled. Izyum was Russia's headquarters for its offensive into the neighboring Donetsk region. Russia's Defense Ministry on Saturday confirmed it has carried out what it called a ""regrouping"" of its forces around Izyum. Russian military bloggers wrote on social media in reality Russian forces had retreated, while Russian state media has described the situation as ""extremely difficult."" The dramatic advance by Ukrainian forces also reaffirms how much the war has shifted in Ukraine's favor and adds credence to claims by U.S. and British officials that Russian forces are overstretched. The retaking of the city also shows the impact that weaponry from the U.S. and its allies is having on the battlefield. ""U.S. assistance is arriving where it is needed,"" former U.S. ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker told ABC News. ""The Ukrainians know how to use it."" ""The Russians are militarily exhausted,"" Volker claimed, and called on U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to provide even longer-range rockets to Ukraine. Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the northeast began late last week and swiftly broke through Russia’s line there. Since then Ukrainian forces had recaptured the city of Balakliya and on Saturday seized Kupiansk, a key logistics hub, according to Ukrainian officials as well as Russian pro-government journalists. The rapid offensive in the northeast has seen Ukrainian forces recapture the cities of Balakliya and Kupiansk, according to Ukrainian officials. Photos and videos of troops raising the Ukrainian flag are circulating online. Kupiansk is well-connected by rail and road -- making it a vital link in Russian supply lines in the area. By seizing the two cities, Ukrainian forces threatened to encircle completely thousands of Russian troops in Izyum, making its defense untenable and forcing Russia to withdraw them. On Friday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his forces had liberated and gained control of 30 settlements in the northeast. The gains amounted to 2,500 square kilometers, according to the Institute for the Study of War. Ukrainian forces also claim to have retaken several villages in the southern region of the country in recent days. Unlike the offensive in the northeast, the southern offensive was widely publicized by Ukrainian officials, raising the possibility that the Russian military was distracted by events in the south, and caught off-guard when the Ukrainian military went on the offensive in the northeast.",,,,28
2022-09-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraines-advance-northeast-turning-point-war-military-analysts/story?id=89750922,Ukraine's advance in northeast likely turning point in war: Military analysts say,"Ukraine's stunning counteroffensive in its northeast likely marks a turning point in the war and has profound consequences for Russia's position going forward, according to military analysts. The counteroffensive has seen Russia's frontline in the Kharkiv region collapse in less than a week, forcing thousands of its troops to retreat as Ukrainian troops have recaptured hundreds of square miles of territory, officials said. The defeat not only removes Russia's ability to threaten Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, but also likely ends Russia's ability to mount any major offensives in Ukraine again, the analysts said. It also will have a major knock-on effect on Russia's capacity to hold its positions on the other fronts around the country. It means in the long-run, the war now favors Ukraine, they said. ""Ukraine has turned the tide of this war in its favor,"" the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington D.C.-based think tank that tracks the war closely, wrote in an analysis. ""Kyiv will likely increasingly dictate the location and nature of the major fighting, and Russia will find itself increasingly responding inadequately to growing Ukrainian physical and psychological pressure in successive military campaigns unless Moscow finds some way to regain the initiative."" That does not mean the war will end soon, the ISW wrote—Russia still occupies around a fifth of Ukraine's territory— and is likely to continue into 2023, experts said. The Ukrainian counteroffensive routed a Russian force that had been one pincer in an attempt to seize the whole of the Donbas region, Russian President Vladimir Putin's minimum declared objective for the war. Ukraine retook the strategic city of Izyum, which had been the headquarters for the Russian effort to advance in Donbas from the north. Izyum's seizure means an end to the Russia's hopes of taking Donbas, the ISW and other analysts said. A second Russian offensive group trying to advance from the south onto the city of Bakhmut has now ""lost any real operational significance,"" the ISW wrote. Russian forces were already overstretched as they tried to seize the Donbas region, which made them unable to significantly advance for months, and painfully defending against a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, the experts said. Russia has been unable to replenish its forces because Putin has balked at ordering a full mobilization or putting the country on a war footing, fearing that could lead to domestic unrest that could threaten his rule, officials said. As a result, Russian forces are increasingly numerically inferior to Ukrainian in some areas. The Russian-appointed head of the Kharkiv region claimed Monday that Russian troops had been outnumbered 8-to-1 during the Ukrainian offensive. The rout of Russia's troops in the northeast—that saw them abandon dozens of tanks and vehicles—means it now must redeploy reserves that it does not have to stabilize the front there, experts said. But moving some of Russia's troops already deployed on other areas of the front risks giving Ukraine a chance to repeat its Kharkiv offensive elsewhere, hitting places where Russia has thinned its lines, according to the ISW. One potentially vulnerable area is the city of Kherson and the area around it west of the Dniepr river where Ukraine has already made it extremely difficult for Russia to re-supply its forces. Russia is reeling from the rout in the northeast, its troops' moral will be badly shaken. The risk for Moscow now is that the failure in the northeast could snowball elsewhere, triggering a domino effect as its forces panic and loses the will to fight, Konrad Muzyka, director of Rochan Consulting, told ABC News. Without a mass mobilization, that is fraught with huge political risks at home, Russia has no hope of reversing the direction of the war, Muzyka said. ""It's a horrible position to be in and actually there are no good choices,"" he said. ""They have to decide. The alternative is losing the war."" ""As a consequence of the north eastern rout of their forces, the Russians now have very few (if any) good choices. Their positions in the east are compromised and require a substantial realignment of defensive lines and logistics,"" Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general and fellow at Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote on Twitter: The grim outlook for Russia is shared by Russian nationalist military bloggers, who have large followings on social media and are often embedded with their forces there. The bloggers are the most vehement supporters of the war, but recently have written highly critical posts about the Russian leadership, furious at how the invasion has been conducted. They have demanded the Kremlin call a full mobilization and put Russia on a war footing, warning it is the only way to reverse the direction of the war. ""Not to recognise that Russia is waging a war is the greatest stupidity,"" Yury Kotyenok, who posts under the account Voenkor Kotenok Z, wrote following the retreat in the northeast.

2022-09-13,https://abcnews.go.com/International/heavy-fighting-breaks-azerbaijan-armenia/story?id=89811999,Heavy fighting breaks out between Azerbaijan and Armenia,"Heavy fighting has broken out between Azerbaijan and Armenia after Azerbaijan appeared to launch a large-scale attack on Armenian territory, triggering a crisis that poses a potentially serious challenge for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Armenia accused Azerbaijan of using heavy artillery, mortars and drones to target its troops, as well as towns along its border with the disputed enclave Nagorno-Karabakh starting in the early hours on Tuesday, alleging that at least 49 Armenian troops were killed. Both sides have blamed each other for the fighting, with Azerbaijan accusing Armenia of launching a ""large-scale provocation."" Russia said it had brokered a cease-fire to halt the violence on Tuesday night, but Armenia said some fighting was still going on, though less intensely. Both sides accused the other's forces of firing artillery along the border on Tuesday night. The fighting is the worst since the two nations waged a bloody war in 2020, in which tens of thousands of civilians were displaced and thousands of troops killed, after Azerbaijan launched an offensive to retake the enclave that is the object of a decades-long conflict. That war ended with a Russian-brokered cease-fire, after Azerbaijan defeated Armenia and forced it to cede substantial parts of Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia is in a security alliance with Armenia and deployed hundreds of troops there as peace-keepers to police the deal and enforce the lines separating the sides in the enclave. But with Russia now struggling in Ukraine, Azerbaijan may be seeking to take advantage of Moscow's difficulties to force Armenia to make further concessions. Armenia has accused Azerbaijan of firing on several towns and villages in its border area since Monday, releasing video purporting to show dozens of Azerbaijani troops trying to advance. Azerbaijan claimed its forces began firing after its infrastructure came under fire first, alleging Armenian military movements in the past month suggest preparations for a ""large-scale military provocation."" Armenia said the claims may be intended as a pretext for military action. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian has appealed to Russia and a Moscow-led security bloc of former Soviet countries to come to its aid, triggered a mutual assistance pact. Pashinian on Tuesday spoke by phone with Russia's defense minister, Sergey Shoigu, during which they agreed to ""take the necessary steps in the direction of stabilizing the situation,"" according to Armenia's defense ministry. The crisis is a challenge for the Kremlin, coming as it is reels from Ukraine's spectacular counteroffensive that routed Russian forces in its northeast this week and when Russia does not have the troops to spare for a major intervention. The collapse of the deal would embarrass Russia and undermine its position as the preeminent powerbroker in the region. Russia's foreign ministry has expressed ""extreme concern"" over the fighting and urged both sides to refrain from further escalation. The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was carrying out ""intensive work"" to resolve the situation and that Putin was personally involved. The Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Moscow-led security bloc that Armenia appealed to, held an emergency session in response Tuesday. The bloc agreed its secretary general should visit the conflict zone and a working group should be set up to study the situation, Belarus' presidential press office told the Russian news service, Interfax. The United States and the European Union have also called for an urgent end to the fighting. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had spoken to both Pashinian and Azerbaijan's President Ilhar Aliyev by telephone Tuesday, calling on both to pull back from further conflict. Blinken told reporters that it would be positive if Russia is able to help stop the violence. ""If Russia can actually use its own influence, for good which is to again, calm the waters, end the violence, and urge people to engage in good faith on building peace, that would be a positive thing,"" Blinken said during a visit to Purdue University in Indiana.",,,,17
2022-09-13,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-military-aid-helped-ukraines-stunning-offensive/story?id=89762501,How much has US military aid helped Ukraine's stunning offensive?,"Ukraine's stunning blitzkrieg counteroffensive in the northeastern part of the country has routed Russian forces and continues to make rapid progress, in some cases pushing back Russian troops back into Russia, U.S. officials said Monday. While they acknowledge that the constant flow of U.S. military aid and equipment has helped ""change the battlefield dynamics,"" the officials also have been quick to praise Ukraine's military for how it has employed the equipment on the battlefield and for anticipating what weapons it would need to eventually launch the offensive. While there are few details of the long-anticipated Ukrainian offensive in the south targeting the city of Kherson, the surprise Ukrainian offensive launched near the city of Kharkiv has led to a dramatic turn of events In a matter of days, Western officials believe, Ukrainian military forces have retaken as much as 6,000 square kilometers of territory in northeastern Ukraine once held by Russia for months, pushing eastward from Kharkiv as far as 40 miles. The Ukrainian advance northward from Kharkiv has come as close as 10 miles to the border with Russia as Russian troops hastily retreated in what Russia's defense ministry called a ""regrouping"" of forces. ""On the ground in the vicinity of Kharkiv, we assess that Russian forces have largely ceded their gains to the Ukrainians and then withdrawn to the north and east,"" a senior U.S. military official told reporters Monday. ""Many of these forces have moved over the border into Russia."" ""We also assess that Ukrainian forces have very likely taken control of Kupiansk and Izyum in addition to smaller villages,"" said the official. Both cities were important to Russian military operations in eastern Ukraine, particularly Izyum, which had been used as the main logistical hub for its months-long assault on the Donbass region. ""We've seen the Ukrainians use to great effect, the capabilities that they have across the battlefield to change the battlefield dynamics,"" the official added, referring to military capabilities provided to Ukraine by the United States and other countries. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the United States has provided $14.5 billion in military equipment, including Javelin anti-tank weapons, Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles, howitzer artillery, and the long-range HIMARS rockets (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems) that can reach more than 40 miles behind enemy lines. While that assistance was described by the U.S. military official as being ""incredibly helpful,"" the official directed praise at Ukraine's military. ""Much of the credit, if not most of it goes to the Ukrainians and what they're doing to employ these capabilities,"" said the official. A senior U.S. defense official complimented Ukraine's communications with the United States to anticipate what gear it would need against Russia, such as requesting howitzer artillery to counter what they expected to be an ""artillery battle the Russians intended to wage"" to take over the Donbass region. That was soon followed by Ukraine's request for a counter to Russia's advantage in long range rocket systems and its establishment of major logistical hubs and military headquarters far behind enemy lines. ""That's when we started focusing on the ability of providing the HIMARS and GMLR systems (the rockets fired by HIMARS),"" said the official. ""So, it is absolutely a partnership and in listening to the understanding of what they're seeing, and then seeing what we can do to provide them with capabilities to address that."" Last week, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said that the United States had provided ""thousands"" of the long-range rockets fired by the HIMARS systems that Ukraine has used to strike at more than 400 Russian targets behind enemy lines, including ammunition depots, logistical hubs, and military headquarters. ""They've had devastating effect,"" Milley said in Germany last week. ""Russian lines of communication and supply channels are severely strained. It is having a direct impact on the Russian ability to project and sustain combat power."" ""Russian command and control in the headquarters have been disrupted and they're having great difficulty resupplying their forces and replacing their combat losses,"" he added.",,,,28
2022-09-13,https://abcnews.go.com/International/eiffel-tower-dark-earlier-night-response-energy-crisis/story?id=89832543,Eiffel Tower to go dark earlier at night in response to energy crisis,"The Eiffel Tower will go dark earlier than usual each night in response to the energy crisis in Europe, officials announced Tuesday. The illumination of the Eiffel Tour will end at 11:45 p.m., which is when the tower closes to visitors, starting Sept. 21, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said. The iconic landmark is usually lit until 1 a.m. Additionally, the lighting on the exterior facades of all municipal buildings and monuments, including borough town halls, will be turned off at 10 p.m. starting on the same date, she said. Public lighting will be maintained to ensure the safety of Parisians, the mayor said. The lighting changes are among ""sobriety"" measures the French capital is enacting in the colder months to address the energy crisis spurred by Russia's war in Ukraine and to prevent energy shortages. Other actions include postponing when the city turns on the heat in public buildings by a month and lowering the temperature in those buildings by 1 degree to 18 degrees Celsius (about 64 degrees Fahrenheit) during office hours and even lower after office hours and on weekends. The city aims to reduce its energy use by 10% this winter -- a target set in July by French President Emmanuel Macron to conserve energy nationwide. The actions come after Europe saw its hottest summer in recorded history, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, and energy prices at the end of August were 12 times higher than they were at that time last year, Hidalgo's office said. It is unclear how long the changes will be in effect. A Russian squeeze on natural gas supplies in response to Western sanctions imposed over its actions in Ukraine has sent gas and electricity prices soaring in Europe. The crisis is expected to only get worse during the winter. The European Commission last week put forth new measures to continue to address the crisis, including proposing a mandatory target for reducing electricity use at peak hours and a price cap on Russian gas.",,,,20
2022-09-19,https://abcnews.go.com/International/bodies-found-makeshift-burial-ukraine-show-signs-torture/story?id=90143457,Bodies found in makeshift burial in Ukraine show signs of torture: Reporter's notebook,"It is a primeval scene. Neat rows of wooden crosses. There is little dignity for the dead in this makeshift burial site in the forest. Names are noticeably absent from almost all of the wooden crosses. Instead, they are marked with three-digit numbers. The true extent of the atrocities allegedly carried out by Russian soldiers and officials in Izium, a city in the northeasterly Kharkiv region, is still emerging. Izium was occupied by the Russians for nearly six months. In total there are 440 wooden crosses, but no one knows yet how many bodies lie in the ground in these unmarked graves. On Sunday Ukrainian forensic teams exhumed 50 more bodies. An official involved in the investigations told ABC News that 16 of those 50 victims were killed violently. One of the victims had been stabbed multiple times and four victims were found in the same grave, according to officials. By a large pit is a cross with words written in Russian: ""Ukrainian Armed Forces, 17 men from the morgue."" Ukrainian investigators told ABC News that one of the bodies of the men found in that mass grave had signs of torture. A forensic team dug up the badly decomposed body. Officials invited journalists to witness the exhumation process on Friday. It was immediately clear that the man’s hands were bound with rope behind his back. Bending down, in his white plastic overalls and boots, the lead investigator called out his initial findings. There was flesh missing from the dead man’s right arm and signs that his clothes had been burnt and he had a cut around his genitals. A very small number of the graves do have names and the dates of birth and death. There were graves of two young girls, ages 6 and 9. Local officials said some of the victims buried at the site had been shot and many of them showed signs of injury from shrapnel. They said the Russians ruled through fear. Images of makeshift prisons and alleged torture chambers are emerging. In the spring, Ukrainians uncovered mass atrocities in Bucha, near Kyiv. Russian forces had occupied Bucha only briefly but left behind horrifying scenes of chaos and death, leading to international condemnation of alleged Russian war crimes. Concerns are now mounting that if Ukrainians reclaim more territory from Russian forces, something similar may be expected again. For now, authorities will continue the grim task of trying to identify the dead. Despite evidence including satellite imagery, CCTV video and testimony by victims, some of it obtained and verified by ABC News, Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of war crimes, even on occasion calling genuine photos and videos of dead victims ""fakes.""",,,,19
2022-09-19,https://abcnews.go.com/International/war-ukraine-reached-turning-point/story?id=90019956,Has the war in Ukraine reached a turning point?,"By the six-month mark of Russia's war in Ukraine, the conflict had become a largely static one, with neither side conducting significant offensive operations. Until last week. Following a surprising counteroffensive, Ukraine said this week that it managed to recapture over 2,300 square miles of territory from Russia in the Kharkiv region in the northeast, including the strategic city of Izyum. The move also forced Russian troops to hastily retreat in what Russia's defense ministry called a ""regrouping"" of forces. Some military analysts see the counteroffensive as a turning point in the war, marking a likely end to Russia's ability to mount any major offensives in Ukraine again, while others -- including President Joe Biden -- have said it's hard to tell if that is indeed the case. Retired Col. Steve Ganyard, an ABC News contributor, called the offensive an important victory for Ukraine, though he noted that the battle in the south, near Kherson, is still crucial. ""The frontline is thousands of miles long. The Russians still maintain most of the Donbas and they're still holding up Ukrainian advances in the south,"" Ganyard said. ""It's a terrific victory for the Ukrainians. It will bolster their morale. It will show that they can fight better than the Russians can and it shows how weak the Russian military really is. But it is just one battle. One tactical, one operational victory. The war is still far from over."" Ukraine's offensive in the north seems to have caught Russian forces off-guard. After publicizing plans for a counteroffensive in Kherson last month, Ukrainian forces also pushed forward in the northeast unexpectedly last week. ""They actually sucker-punched the Russians,"" Ganyard said. ""The Russians moved 25 battle groups from the eastern front and the northeastern front, down to the area around Kherson to defend, add troops. So this made the lines up north around Kharkiv very thin."" The Russians may not have thought Ukraine could conduct two major offenses, but Ukrainian troops attacked the weakened front and ""flew through the remaining Russian defenses,"" Ganyard said. ""It's very extraordinary,"" said. ""We went from a relatively static battlefield for weeks if not months, to this amazing breakthrough, stunning breakthrough that the Ukrainians were able to conduct and achieve up in the north around Kharkiv."" More than 6,000 square kilometers were recaptured, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukrainian officials said they have retaken control of several cities, including Izyum -- which had been used as the main logistical hub for Russia's assault on the Donbas region. While the offensive is seen as strategically important for Ukraine and a major morale booster -- with the opposite implications for Russia -- there's still a long way to go in war, Ganyard said. Zelenskyy has previously stated his goal is to take back all Ukrainian territory from Russia, which still occupies around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington D.C.-based think tank that has been closely tracking the war. Retaking Kherson, a city on the Dnieper River, would allow Ukraine to sustain its economy, Ganyard said. While a Russian counteroffensive seems unlikely given how ""decimated"" its military has become, Ukraine could run the risk of becoming stretched too thin, he said. ""The Ukrainians need to be careful that they don't overrun their supply chain, that they don't have such catastrophic success that they themselves become too thin and stretched out in the areas that they've retaken,"" Ganyard said. One key factor in the ongoing conflict will be the winter and the challenges that may bring. ""Clearly, the Ukrainians have the momentum and they will probably continue to hold that momentum going into the winter,"" he said. ""The winter season changes everything...Who knows what's going to happen when things begin to get cold.""",,,,28
2022-09-22,https://abcnews.go.com/US/heating-bills-reach-10-year-high-upcoming-winter/story?id=90289962,Heating bills to reach 10-year high this upcoming winter: NEADA report,"Heating costs for the upcoming winter season are expected to increase by 17%, mainly impacting lower-income families, according to a new report from National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Costs are expected to reach above $1,200 in 2022-2023, up from $1,025 in 2021-2022, a 10-year high, NEADA data reports. Lower-income families are at a higher risk of falling behind on their energy bills and choosing to pay for medicine, food and rent, NEADA Executive Director Mark Wolfe said in a press release. Last week, in a letter, the association asked Congress for a supplemental increase of $5 billion in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program to cover the rising costs of heating homes, as well as cooling them because of frequent heat waves during the summer. Parts of the U.S. saw heat indexes reach dangerous levels this summer, which saw temperatures hitting the triple digits in some cities and towns. Sweltering summers have led to increased electricity use, resulting in lower levels of natural gas headed into the fall, Wolf told ABC News. ""We expected at the beginning of this year for prices to be going up because of the increased demand,"" Wolf said, adding that the high demand, combined with the war in Ukraine, has amplified the issue. He noted that prices in Europe are higher than in the U.S. The electric power sector uses natural gas to produce electricity. Last year, the industry accounted for 37% of total natural gas consumption in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to NEADA, this would be the second year homeowners have seen a significant price increase. Home energy prices have gone up more than 35% between 2020-2021 and 2021-2023, according to the report. The study found that the cumulative costs of heating homes could go from $127.9 billion in 2021-2022 to nearly $150 billion between 2022-2023, with the added expenses impacting low-income families the most.",,,,23

Blinken, addressing a U.N. Security Council meeting, said Putin has ""doubled down"" on the conflict despite concerns from the international community about the months-long invasion of Ukraine. ""That President Putin picked this week, as most of the world gathers at the United Nations, to add fuel to the fire he started shows his utter contempt for the U.N. charter, for the general assembly and for this council,"" Blinken said. ""The very international order that we have gathered here to uphold is being shredded before our eyes,"" he continued. ""We cannot, we will not allow President Putin to get away with it."" Putin on Wednesday announced a partial mobilization expected to conscript 300,000 Russian reservists to the fight after Ukraine recaptured parts of the Kharkiv region earlier this month, making a potential turning point in the conflict. The Kremlin is also moving this week to hold ""sham referendums"" in Russian-backed regions of Ukraine for people to vote on whether to join Russia. Blinken urged all U.N. members to reject these referendums and declare that all Ukrainian territory will remain part of the Eastern European nation. Blinken said Putin's war was a distraction from other pressing global issues the security council should address, including climate change, famine and international health security. Blinken's Russian counterpart -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov -- was not in the room when the secretary of state spoke. Blinken also discussed the mass graves uncovered in the recently recaptured Izium, stating the actions of Russian forces in the northeastern city are not acts of rogue units but fit a ""clear pattern."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy implored world leaders to punish Russia in his virtual address to the U.N. General Assembly, in which he said Russia wants to prepare another offensive that would include ""new Iziums."" ""Russia wants war,"" Zelenskyy said. ""It's true. But Russia will not be able to stop the course of history. Mankind and the international law are stronger than one terrorist state. Russia will be forced to end this war. Blinken's remarks came one day after President Joe Biden, in his own address to the U.N. General Assembly, rebuked Putin for having ""shamelessly violated the core tenants"" of the group's charter. Biden called for the U.N. to continue supporting Ukraine as he announced a U.S. commitment of $2.9 billion in global food aid as the war has disrupted supply chains and increased prices.",,,,16
2022-09-23,https://abcnews.go.com/International/referendums-announced-ukraine-republics-join-russia/story?id=90201080,What to know about 'referendums' announced in Ukraine 'republics' to join Russia,"KYIV -- A so-called ""referendum"" to join Russia announced by pro-Russian authorities of the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine has raised alarm bells globally as experts and leaders see it as a manipulative farce by Russia to force control over parts of Ukraine as Ukrainian forces are pushing back on Russian forces. U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink referred to the referendums, as well as increased military mobilization, as ""signs of weakness, of Russian failure,"" echoing many opinions that Russia is acting out under pressure in response to Ukrainian advances. ""The United States will never recognize Russia's claim to purportedly annexed Ukrainian territory, and we will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Brink tweeted Tuesday. The voting is planned for Sept. 23 to 27. Self-appointed Kremlin-backed officials of the occupied parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions also announced they would hold referendums on the same dates. ""We believe it is more timely than ever to make a strong-willed decision on the immediate holding of a referendum on the unification of the Kherson region with the Russian Federation,"" the local so-called Public Council said at a meeting Tuesday. The Russian Central Elections Commission said it would set up polling stations in Russia. Voters would be presented with one question: ""Are you in favor of the secession of the Zaporizhia region from Ukraine, the formation of an independent state by the Zaporizhia region and its entry into the Russian Federation as a subject of the Russian Federation?"" This decision of the Kremlin's proxies to stage sham referendums marked a significant escalation of the conflict and has been widely condemned by world leaders. The office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Russian statements a ""sedative"" for the Russian audience. ""There is global consensus and international law,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, the adviser to the head of the office of the president posted on Twitter. ""It is unambiguous: Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea are Ukraine. Any attempts to repaint flags are a fiction that will not change anything for us nor for our partners."" The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that any referendum in Russian-occupied territories will not have any legal consequences. ""No matter how much the Russian Federation holds illegal votes in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, the result will be the same: all Ukrainian territories will be freed from Russian occupation, and the Russian leadership will be brought to the strictest responsibility for organized terror, war crimes and crimes against humanity on Ukrainian soil,"" the statement said. U.S. President Joe Biden also criticized what he called Russia's ""outrageous acts"" in a speech at the United Nations on Wednesday. ""Just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and reckless disregard of the responsibilities of a nonproliferation regime,"" he said. ""Now, Russia is calling up more soldiers to join the fight and the Kremlin is organizing a sham referendum to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the U.N. Charter."" The eastern part of Ukraine has been occupied by Russian proxies since 2014. In late February 2022, right before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the ""independence"" of the so-called DPR and LPR. Since then, the leaders of the unrecognized republics have called for integration with Russia, but Moscow has reiterated that such a decision is not timely. Parts of southern Ukraine were occupied by Russian forces during the 2022 invasion. The occupational authorities there have tried to hold unofficial referendums to proclaim ""independence"" following Russia's 2014 invasion of the Donbas region. The efforts have so far failed and the referendums have been postponed several times. Now, such a possibility looks much more realistic. In a speech Wednesday, Putin said Russia would support any decision the electorate makes and provide security for the referendums. Meanwhile, the Russian leader announced partial mobilization across the country that would draft up to 300,000 men to be sent to war in Ukraine, according to the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. The timing of the referendums and mobilization, is not a coincidence, experts say. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War believe Ukraine's ongoing northern counter-offensive is panicking proxy forces and some Kremlin decision-makers. In early September, the Ukrainian Armed Forces astonished the world with its lightning counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, moving the Russians more than 30 miles east in just a few days. Videos showed Russian soldiers running away, leaving behind vehicles and ammunition. In all, the Ukrainian Armed Forces says it has liberated more than 3,700 square miles of territory so far, according to the Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar. This also includes some areas in the southern Kherson region, where Ukrainians are moving forward slowly but steadily, liberating village by village. Russia's retreat from the Kharkiv region sparked not only praise of the Ukrainian Army in the West, but also criticism of Russian authorities even amid the Russian propagandist media. Some military bloggers expressed the idea of ""freezing"" the war in Ukraine, which they claim would be beneficial to Russia itself. U.K. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace believes Putin's decision to mobilize parts of his population and the illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine are ""an admission that his invasion is failing."" ""No amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning the war,"" he said in a statement Wednesday, according to Reuters.",,,,14
2022-09-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nuclear-threats-raise-risk-cornered-putin-experts/story?id=90339542,New nuclear threats raise risk from a 'cornered Putin': Experts,"Even before Russian troops invaded Ukraine, U.S. officials warned global peace would be endangered if Russian President Vladimir Putin were allowed to brazenly seize another sovereign country. At the same time, analysts have warned that if he faced no option but defeat in that bid, the outcome could prove to be even more dangerous -- a so-called ""cornered Putin."" Ukrainian successes on the battlefield have not only pushed Russian troops back but now have pushed Putin further into a corner -- forcing him to take a series of dramatic steps to reinvigorate his brutal campaign: a sweeping military draft, labeled as a ""partial mobilization,"" to surge thousands of soldiers to the fight, and orchestrating what the West has called ""sham"" referenda in occupied territories in Ukraine -- intended to pave the way for them to be ""annexed"" -- considered, in Putin's view, to be part of Russia. Most alarming, in a rare televised address, Putin also issued a new round of thinly-veiled nuclear threats -- warning that Russia will use ""all available means"" to protect what he now portrays as Russian people and territory. While some of his rhetoric isn't new, the changed circumstances in the conflict are. ABC News spoke to experts and former U.S. officials about why Putin's latest saber-rattling escalates risks -- for both Putin and the world. Putin's ""partial mobilization"" to send Russians who have gone through military training to serve in Ukraine is broadly seen as a tacit acknowledgement that his military is failing to accomplish Moscow's goals in Ukraine. But Max Bergmann, a former State Department official and the director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says it also puts Putin's control over his own country in question. ""What is clearly happening here is that the Russian military position in Ukraine is collapsing,"" he said. ""Forcing people to go and fight in Ukraine is an extremely risky political decision. This is one of the most incredibly disruptive things that can be done to a society."" Although economic penalties for the invasion continue to have a mounting impact, Bergmann says the move will bring the war home to many Russians for the first time. And what's worse, he adds, is that Putin hasn't even officially called his invasion of Ukraine a war -- still describing it as a ""special military operation."" ""There's a total disconnect between the Russian government messaging that this is just some sort of tactical military effort in Ukraine, versus the need to suddenly rip men that have maybe at one time in their life served in the military for a year away from their families -- many with children -- and from their jobs, off to a battlefield where tens of thousands of people are dying,"" he said. Despite the Kremlin's efforts to silence protest, Bergmann says if enough discontent builds, Putin risks losing public support, and with it, his grasp on power. ""He is gambling his entire regime over Ukraine,"" he said. A powerful tool in Putin's arsenal is the state propaganda machine, but Bergmann believes Putin still has a steep hill to climb in portraying the war as defending the motherland. ""Putin hopes he can harken back to Russia's past of repelling invaders, whether it's Napoleon's army or Hitler's. But then, Russia was being invaded. It was an existential war. This is a war of imperial ambition,"" he said. ""He's going to have to work incredibly hard to convince the Russian public that it's worth it to lose their husbands, fathers and sons in an oblast in Ukraine."" While the Russian president still appears to wield uncompromising control, Bergmann warns the tide can shift quickly. ""Autocratic regimes look incredibly stable until they're not,"" he said. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, in his speech this week to the United Nations General Assembly, warned Moscow was trying to wait his fighters out. ""Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine and prepare forces to attempt a new offensive,"" he said in a recorded address. Analysts also say buying time to move newly conscripted troops to the front might be the motivator behind other elements of Putin's strategy. ""Those troops will take a while to get to the battlefield,"" said John Hardie, deputy director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Russia Program. ""It's definitely a game on his part."" Putin's latest efforts towards annexation, coupled with promises to defend its land, are likely aimed at giving Ukraine second thoughts about pursuing its counteroffensive -- and giving the West second thoughts about supporting it, Hardie and Bergmann said. But they say it's unlikely to prove effective. ""Putin's hope is that this causes Ukraine and the West to freak out to give some pause about further advances,"" Bergmann said. ""But I think support for Ukraine will remain strong. And that Ukraine is going to advance militarily as it sees fit."" One senior administration official called the referenda a ""crass and desperate"" maneuver that would not alter the U.S. outlook on the conflict, and predicted that other powers around the world -- even those more closely aligned with Russia -- would not be significantly swayed. If Putin's attempts to delay Ukraine's military progress fail, the most pressing question becomes whether he will make good on his threats to go nuclear -- and what the U.S. and its allies might do in response. ""It's something that you have to take very seriously. Russia has the world's largest nuclear arsenal,"" said Bergmann. ""And when the Russian president starts making nuclear threats, it's something everyone has to pay attention to."" While both Hardie and Bergmann agree Putin doesn't appear ready to resort to the nuclear option, they say deterrence must be the priority. American officials have publicly and privately warned Moscow against using nuclear weapons, and Hardie said they should also press countries the Kremlin might be more receptive to listening to -- such as China and India -- to send the same messages. But the consequences Russia could expect to face are less clear. ""Are we actually ready to do something more than sanctions? I tend to think we are probably not. I think the administration rightly wants to avoid World War III,"" said Hardie. Because of this, the Biden administration's ""strategic ambiguity"" on repercussions is the best available avenue, he argues. ""If offers the benefit of leaving doubt in Putin's mind,"" Hardie said. While Putin could ultimately disregard any doubts, Hardie says it will likely require Putin to grow considerably more desperate. ""I think this would be very much a last resort,"" he said, noting the Kremlin might test the waters first with demonstrations before hitting critical infrastructure or troop concentrations. ""But I think we're a long way from that point."" But Hardie said a significant incursion into Crimea -- the peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 -- would likely move the needle much more, and that it's possible Putin will decide to protect any newly annexed territory with the same ferocity. ""We're in uncharted waters,"" he said.",,,,14

Jake Sullivan, in an interview with ABC ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos, pointed both to the protests against Russian President Vladimir Putin's mobilization of 300,000 reservists and to what Sullivan called ""sham"" annexation referendums in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine. ""These are definitely not signs of strength or confidence. Quite the opposite: They're signs that Russia and Putin are struggling badly,"" Sullivan said while noting Putin's autocratic hold on the country made it hard to make definitive assessments from the outside. ""It will be the Russian people, ultimately, who make the determination about how Russia proceeds and the extent to which that there is resistance and pushback to what Vladimir Putin has tried to do, calling up these hundreds of thousands of young men,"" Sullivan added. ""Do you want them to rise up and replace Putin?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""At the end of the day, the future of Russian politics is going to be dictated, not by Washington, not by anyone in Europe, but by the people inside Russia,"" Sullivan responded. ""And what you are seeing in the streets right now is a deep unhappiness with what Putin is doing."" His comments come amid escalating rhetoric from Putin as Russian forces have been forced to cede large swaths of northeast Ukraine while retreating from a Ukrainian counteroffensive this month. Last week, Putin called up reservists and suggested that tactical nuclear weapons could be used to change the course of the war, groundlessly accusing the West of threatening Russia's territorial integrity. Since before attacking Ukraine in February, Putin has cast the invasion as a matter of Russian national security. ""The territorial integrity of our homeland, our independence and freedom will be ensured, I will emphasize this again, with all the means at our disposal. And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the prevailing winds can turn in their direction,"" Putin said in a speech last week. ""I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and some components are more modern than those of the NATO countries,"" Putin added. On ""This Week,"" Sullivan declined to explain precisely what warnings have been communicated between Russia and the U.S. but he said that there would be dire repercussions if such a weapon were used. ""We have communicated directly, privately, to the Russians at very high levels that there will be catastrophic consequences for Russia if they use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. We have been clear with them and emphatic with them that the United States will respond decisively alongside our allies and partners,"" Sullivan said. ""So that means taking the fight directly to Russia?"" Stephanopoulos asked. Sullivan demurred: ""We've been careful in how we talk about this publicly because, from our perspective, we want to lay down the principle that there would be catastrophic consequences but not engage in a game of rhetorical tit-for-tat."" Stephanopoulos also asked Sullivan if protests in Iran over the death of a woman who was not adhering to the country's strict female dress code would be enough to topple the government in Tehran. ""The United States ... hasn't necessarily over many decades had a great track record of perfectly predicting when protests turn into political change, and I can't perfectly predict that sitting here today. What I can say is they do reflect a deep-seated and widespread belief among the population of Iran, the citizens abroad, the women of Iran, that they deserve their dignity and their rights,"" Sullivan said. Stephanopoulos pressed, given the Iranian government's actions, if the Biden administration should continue seeking to revive the Obama-era nuclear deal which President Donald Trump scrapped. Conservatives have repeatedly criticized those efforts. Sullivan said that the White House feels diplomacy and political pressure can go hand-in-hand. ""The fact that we are in nuclear talks is in no way slowing us down from speaking out and acting on behalf of the people of Iran,"" he said. ""We're not going to slow down one inch in our defense and advocacy for the rights of the women and citizens of Iran.""",,,,7
2022-09-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/china-russia-recently-sought-spread-political-misinformation-online/story?id=90546653,"How China, Russia recently sought to spread political misinformation online, according to Meta","Social media accounts with ties to users in China and Russia posed as Western media outlets in an attempt to manipulate users and spread ""inauthentic"" content related to high-profile, politically charged issues including the invasion of Ukraine, Meta employees told reporters on Monday. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and other services, said that the accounts tied to both countries were taken down manually, though for more in-depth investigations and bigger networks an automated feature for takedowns is also used. The accounts, as a whole, did not reach nearly the same scale as past documented efforts on social media to spread politically related messages to U.S. users and others. But the operations, as described by Meta, are some of the latest examples of what both the company's officials and top U.S. lawmakers have said is a concern: how countries use social media to secretly sway public opinion. (The American government has reportedly employed a similar digital strategy abroad -- to influence opinion of the U.S.) In response to this scrutiny about foreign actors on their platforms, Meta and other leading internet companies have taken steps, they say, to curb the spread of suspicious and misleading information. The coordinated Chinese operation that Meta revealed on Monday targeted users primarily in the U.S. and Czech Republic, Meta said, and it was running fake accounts and websites across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and two petition platforms in the Czech Republic. According to the company, the accounts impersonated Americans by sharing online messages in both Chinese and English about issues including Second Amendment rights and abortion. Accounts in this network spanned both sides of the political aisle, supporting both conservative and liberal causes. Messages were also directed to a more global French and Chinese-speaking audience, Meta said. The group operated between November 2021 and September 2022. This was the first Chinese-based effort that Meta disrupted that focused on U.S. political issues and major topics ahead of the midterms, a distinct shift in Chinese-based interference, according to Meta. However, the operation was relatively short-lived and did not receive much engagement from real users, Meta said, with 81 Facebook accounts with 20 collective followers, one Facebook group with 250 members and two Instagram accounts with less than 10 followers between them. On a number of occasions, Chinese-originated entities would post various Russian state-linked content, Meta said. While the two countries overlapped in their goals and mutually reinforced each other, there was no visible coordination between the two. Meta officials also noted a notable time lag between the two operations. The Russian operation in May was the largest and most complex since the war on Ukraine started, spanning over 60 websites, using multiple different languages, impersonating credible and legitimate Western websites and news organizations, according to Meta. Its presence spanned Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, Twitter, YouTube and other European sites. The network mainly targeted users in Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, Ukraine and the U.K, Meta said. The narratives focused on the war on Ukraine and its impact in Europe. The messages criticized Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees and pushed the narrative that U.S. sanctions would backfire. Meta said it disrupted misinformation campaigns that targeted Ukrainians and exploited Ukraine's tensions with Russia in February. The company's security team removed about 40 users they found ""inauthentic,"" officials said Monday. The Russian operation had 1,633 Facebook accounts with 1,500 collective followers, 29 Instagram accounts with 1,500 followers between them and generated around $105,000 in ad sales, Meta said. The company will not return the ad revenue and will use it to build their security teams. Meta previously removed a Russian network of users in 2020 for violating their policy of foreign interference. The users were connected to an online trolling group that attempted to interfere with the 2016 election, the company has said. Meta has also emphasized that fake sites will continue to pop up. The company stressed on Monday that its view is that its security work is on deception rather than the content itself and that it did not punish Russian government platforms that had content from either of the operations because they were not directly contributing. Meta officials said the company remains on alert for more threats, including monitoring potential actors as the election season progresses. They will not be implementing any new tactics ahead of the midterms, officials said Monday. Meta said it has also shared its findings and threat indicators with the media and other platforms, law enforcement and the government.",,,,10
2022-09-28,https://abcnews.go.com/International/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missiles-seoul-nuclear-test/story?id=90624801,North Korea launches 2 ballistic missiles as Seoul says nuclear test is imminent,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles toward the East Sea on Wednesday, just one day before U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris arrives in South Korea and amid speculation that North Korea is preparing to conduct its seventh nuclear test as early as October. South Korean military detected two short-range ballistic missiles fired from the Sunan area in Pyongyang into the East Sea between 6:10 p.m. to 6:20 p.m. local time, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. It’s the second ballistic missile launch in a week after North Korea test-fired one surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missile from the western inland town of Taechon on Sunday. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff immediately and strongly condemned the missile launch calling it a ""grave provocation"" that undermines peace and security on the Korean Peninsula as well as the international community. Pyongyang has launched ballistic missiles 18 times and cruise missiles two times so far in 2022. “North Korea’s act of provocation will intensify the deterrence and response capabilities of the South Korea-U.S. ally and aggravate North Korea’s isolation from the international community,” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. “It’s a clear violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution and we urge North Korea to stop immediately.” South Korean lawmakers told reporters that they believe North Korea has prepared an underground nuclear test site and that South Korean officials believe their neighbor to the north will undertake its seventh nuclear test sometime between Oct. 16 and Nov. 7, though these reports have not been confirmed. “It’s become more plausible that North Korea will conduct a nuclear test as it readied the underground nuclear test tunnel,” Lawmaker Youn Kun-young said after a closed-door briefing with Seoul’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service. “According to the NIS, there’s a high possibility that if North Korea does, it will happen between the 20th Party Congress of China on October 16 and before the U.S. midterm elections on November 7.” Youn confirmed that the dates are only a reasonable guess and not confirmation of any specific intelligence. “North Korea must give due consideration to its allies China and Russia,” Former NIS North Korea analyst Kwak Gil-sup told ABC News. “And dropping a nuclear security issue before the U.S. midterms may work favorably for China and Russia, both currently in political conflict with Washington.” Another analyst suggested that although North Korea may be fully prepared to conduct a nuclear test, it does not necessarily mean that it will do so any time soon. “When North Korea passed the new law enshrining its nuclear doctrine this month, it is to say that they have the nuclear weapons. North Korea has already proved its capabilities of successfully building a hydrogen bomb that could fit on the top of an intercontinental ballistic missile during its sixth nuclear test in September 2017,” Park Hwee Rhak, chair of the Nuclear Defense Committee at the Hansun Foundation, told ABC News. “If North Korea conducts yet another nuclear test it would only mean that they have improved the force or developed a smaller warhead, but I don’t see why they would go public with a strategic weapon.” Both analysts, however, agreed about the unpredictable nature of North Korea. “When it comes to North Korea, hours of analysis and speculation are always met with a surprise threat,” Park said.",,,,1
2022-09-29,https://abcnews.go.com/US/russian-billionaire-charged-violating-us-sanctions/story?id=90708708,Russian billionaire charged with violating US sanctions,"Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska was charged Thursday with violating U.S. sanctions, according to an indictment unsealed in the Southern District of New York as part of the United States' efforts to crack down on Russian oligarchs. Deripaska, an aluminum magnate, was among two dozen Russians sanctioned in 2018 by the U.S. Treasury Department as punishment for what Treasury officials called ""the Russian government's ongoing and increasingly malign activities in the world."" The FBI searched Deripaska's homes in New York and Washington, D.C., last year. Deripaska has also been investigated in the past for money laundering, though no charges were ever brought. He was mentioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, which said that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had offered Deripaska internal polling and campaign briefings, but made no direct assertion that Deripaska had interfered in the election.. The new indictment charges Deripaska with violating sanctions by allegedly paying two women, Olga Shriki and Natalia Mikhaylovna Bardakova, to provide him personal services in the United States. ""Despite his cozy ties with the Kremlin and his vast wealth acquired through ties to a corrupt regime, Deripaska did all he could to lead a life in a stable, free, democratic society -- even if that meant lying and evading U.S. sanctions,"" said Andrew Adams, director of the Justice Department's KleptoCapture task force. ""The hypocrisy in seeking comfort and citizenship in the United States, while enjoying the fruits of a ruthless, anti-democratic regime, is striking."" Shriki facilitated the $3 million sale of a California music studio for Deripaska, and both women helped Deripaska's girlfriend, Ekaterina Voronina, travel from Russia to the United States so she could give birth to Deripaska's child, according to the indictment. Voronina has also been criminally charged with making false statements to agents of the Department of Homeland Security at the time she was attempting to enter the country. ""Additionally, between, in, or about 2018 and in or about 2020, Deripaska routinely had Shriki and Bardakova purchase various products in the United States for Deripaska's personal use and as gifts for others on his behalf,"" the indictment said. The indictment also accuses Shriki of destroying evidence during the investigation and accuses Bardakova of making false statements to U.S. government officers. Shriki was arrested Thursday in New Jersey and was expected to appear in federal court in Manhattan. Deripaska, Bardakova and Voronina were all believed to be in Russia.",,,,29
2022-09-30,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-slaps-sanctions-russia-putin-annexes-parts-ukraine/story?id=90727977,US slaps new sanctions on Russia after Putin annexes parts of Ukraine,"For months, the U.S. has warned that the Kremlin would move to annex occupied areas of Ukraine. But now that Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday has signed decrees annexing four regions into the Russian Federation, eyes have turned to the Western response to the provocation. Within minutes of Putin's action, President Joe Biden shot back. ""The United States condemns Russia’s fraudulent attempt today to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory. Russia is violating international law, trampling on the United Nations Charter, and showing its contempt for peaceful nations everywhere,"" he said in a statement. ""Make no mistake: these actions have no legitimacy. The United States will always honor Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. We will continue to support Ukraine’s efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically, including through the $1.1 billion in additional security assistance the United States announced this week,"" he said. Biden promised that the U.S., along with its allies and partners, would not let any support for Putin's land grab go unpunished. ""These sanctions will impose costs on individuals and entities -- inside and outside of Russia -- that provide political or economic support to illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory. We will rally the international community to both denounce these moves and to hold Russia accountable,"" he said. In a statement of his own, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also detailed the specific penalties the U.S. would inflict in response to the annexations, including imposing visa restrictions on scores of Russian and Belarusian military officials, sanctioning Russian government and banking officials, and penalizing entities that supply its military. Additionally, the president said he looked forward to signing off on additional $12 billion in military and economic aid for Ukraine, which Congress voted to send to his desk on Friday. ""He can't seize his neighbor’s territory and get away with it. It's as simple as that,"" he added, when speaking later Friday. ""And we are fully prepared to defend, I'm gonna say this again, America is fully prepared with our NATO allies to defend every single inch of NATO territory. Every single inch. So, Mr. Putin, don't misunderstand what I'm saying. Every inch."" The European Union has already moved to implement a host of new trade restrictions. At the United Nations, a U.S. sponsored resolution condemning the land grab will soon be introduced before the organization's Security Council. But so far, financial restrictions and public shaming have done little to constrain Putin's imperialistic goals, prompting Ukrainian officials to call for a shift in strategy. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pushed the U.S. to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, which installs secondary sanctions -- penalizing any business or entity that does business with the country. So far, the Biden administration has been adamantly against it, saying it could inhibit efforts to move aid to Ukraine and other needy countries, as well hinder any future peace talks. Still, Kyiv has been undeterred. David Arakhamia, one of Zelenskyy's closest advisers, during a visit to Washington on Thursday, said that he felt ""more optimistic"" after meeting with lawmakers, saying he felt Congress was continuing to ""put political pressure"" on the White House to shift its policy. ""We want to see as much financial impact on Russia as possible,"" Arakhamia said during a press conference. ""If we make Russia poor, that means we increase our chances for Ukraine to win."" Oleksandra Ustinova, a member of Ukraine's parliament, argued at the same event that the administration also needs to specifically say how it will punish Putin. ""It is very important for us that the United States exactly what they're going to do before Putin makes the next steps,"" Ustinova said. ""Because he's a bully. He's testing how far he can go."" Ustinova said Ukrainian officials had directly pushed the U.S. government to ""state how hard you're going to hit him"" and to crack down harder on Russian financial institutions. ""That would make him think twice,"" she said. When it comes to Putin's nuclear threats, the administration has been especially stringent, sticking to its policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" -- declining to say just how the West might respond to the ultimate aggression -- as an attempt to walk the line between deterrence and escalation. Arakhamia said he was hopeful NATO would spell out specifically what it would do in that worst-case scenario and that Ukraine would receive collective defense guarantees, but either would mark a significant shift and one that could have weighty implications for the conflict. A more likely and immediate response is expected to be an infusion of military and economic aid from Congress, which is set to pass a stopgap funding bill with more than $12 billion more for Ukraine on Friday. But already, some of the recent rounds of aid announced have included weaponry that still needs to be produced, meaning it won't make it to the battlefield for months or years -- and signaling surpluses in allies' armories are running low. ""We think it's high time the United States and other allies actually warm up production up to the scale of wartime,"" urged Anastasia Radina, another member of Ukraine's parliament. ""Because it is now wartime for the whole civilized world."" ""No one has seen anything like this since World War II,"" said Ustinova.",,,,7
2022-10-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/putin-faces-irreversible-reality-ukraine-invasion-latest-moves/story?id=90824658,Putin faces 'irreversible' reality in Ukraine invasion despite latest moves: Petraeus,"Russian President Vladimir Putin now faces an ""irreversible"" quagmire amid the country's land grab in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, retired Army general and former CIA chief David Petraeus said Sunday. Putin ""is losing"" despite ""significant"" but ""desperate"" moves in the war that began in late February, Petraeus told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. ""President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and Ukraine have mobilized vastly better than has Russia,"" Petraeus said. ""Ukraine has recruited, trained, equipped, organized and employed force incomparably better than Russia has."" Regardless of Putin's bravado, Petraeus said, ""No amount of annexation, no amount of even veiled nuclear threats can get him out of this situation."" Asked by Karl if Russia could win in its conflict with Ukraine, Petraeus said he did not see how: ""They cannot. There is nothing he [Putin] can do at this point."" On Friday, Putin said he was ""forever"" annexing four regions of Ukraine -- a move denounced by Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries -- and, in late September, the Russian leader said he was calling up some 300,000 reservists to bolster the war effort, triggering protests across his country. In a rare acknowledgment Thursday, Putin admitted ""mistakes"" in how the mobilization was carried out. But he argued again in a speech Friday that the invasion was crucial to preserving Russia against what he described as ""the enemy"" in the West. Meanwhile Ukrainian forces, buttressed by billions in weapons and funding from the U.S. and European allies, have made steady territorial gains since a counteroffensive that started last month. ""He's going to continue to lose on the battlefield,"" Petraeus said of Putin, pointing to Russia's recent retreat from a supply hub city in one of the annexed regions. Mounting sanctions are another complication, Petraeus said. Putin's Friday speech, in which he announced the annexation of parts of Ukraine, was designed to undercut Europe's commitment to challenging Russia, which is a major energy supplier on the continent, Petraeus said. ""Europe's going to have a tough winter,"" Petraeus said. ""There's going to be very reduced flow of natural gas, but they'll get through it and I don't think they'll crack on the issue of support for Ukraine."" ""Negotiations, as President Zelenskyy has said, will be the ultimate end,"" Petraeus said -- though an imminent diplomatic outcome might be unlikely, as Zelenskyy signaled on Friday that Ukraine would only agree to talks ""with another president of Russia."" ""It can still get worse for Putin and for Russia. And even the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield won't change this at all,"" Petraeus said. Still, he said the nuclear threat must be taken ""seriously."" Karl asked him if the use of such weapons would require the U.S. to directly intervene in the conflict with NATO. Petraeus said a response might see the U.S. and its NATO allies ""take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield"" in Ukraine, the contested region of Crimea that Russia annexed in 2014 and ships in the Black Sea. ""It cannot go unanswered. But it doesn't expand -- it's not nuclear for nuclear. You don't want to get into a nuclear escalation here,"" Petraeus said. ""But you have to show that this cannot be accepted in any way.""",,,,7
2022-10-04,https://abcnews.go.com/International/north-korea-fires-apparent-ballistic-missile-japan-ministry/story?id=90941767,North Korea fires ballistic missile over Japan,"NEW YORK, TOKYO and SEOUL -- North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan early on Tuesday morning, the Japanese Ministry of Defense said. South Korea and the U.S. conducted a joint strike package flight and precision bombing drill in response to the ballistic missile test, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff told ABC news. The Japanese government issued a “J-alert” through its emergency warning system, advising residents to take cover in sturdy buildings or underground. A government spokesperson said Japan didn’t attempt to shoot the missile down because they didn’t think it posed a threat. A U.S. defense official confirmed the launch to ABC News. Residents in Aomori and Hokkaido prefectures, toward the northern end of Japan, were advised to be on alert and to notify police or fire officials if debris is seen. Tuesday's launch marked the seventh time a North Korean missile flew over Japan. The last time was in August 2017. North Korea has shot 21 ballistic missiles and two cruise missiles since January, a record-breaking number of launches in a single year. Tuesday's launch was the country's fifth missile test in just over a week. “We ask that people return to life as usual, calmly,"" the Japanese government’s chief spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters at a press conference. People were also warned by officials not to touch or pick up any debris. The office of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida began to gather members to analyze the situation. A government spokesperson said no damage has been reported so far and a search is underway for debris. Officials are gathering information and will work with South Korea and the U.S. ""North Korea's actions threaten Japan and the international community,"" the spokesperson said. ""Missile launches like this go against the U.N. resolutions. Japan will launch a strong protest against North Korea in light of this. All new information will be shared promptly."" The White House said in a statement late Monday local time in Washington, D.C., that ""the United States strongly condemns the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) dangerous and reckless decision to launch a long-range ballistic missile over Japan."" U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts on Monday night local time, according to White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson. ""In both calls, the National Security Advisors consulted on appropriate and robust joint and international responses,"" Watson said, ""and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan reinforced the United States' ironclad commitments to the defense of Japan and the ROK [South Korea]."" Regional players may have few cards left in their hands to play towards curbing North Korea, observers said. Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan, told ABC News that the missile launch was a very provocative act as it comes amidst numerous missile tests this year. “There are no good options for [South Korean President] Yoon, Kishida, Biden to rein in Kim Jong Un,” Kingston said. “Sanctions and condemnation have failed to deter him and there is no good military option.” North Korea recently passed a law declaring its readiness to launch preemptive nuclear strikes. Analysts warned that the country may seek to reaffirm its nuclear weapons state status and is prepping for a seventh nuclear test. Jaechun Kim, professor of international relations at South Korea's Sogang University, said the U.S., Korea and Japan should mobilize cooperation from like-minded countries in non-U.N. sanctions to thwart North Korea’s provocations. “A unified front must be established that imposes sanctions on North Korea, as they did on Russia,” Kim said. “This is the only way to penalize North Korea for its bad behavior.” Kim also told ABC News that China, North Korea’s strongest ally, may have no little or no say in North Korea’s actions. “North Korea just does what it needs to do these days. So, with or without China’s support, it is quite likely for the North to conduct 7th nuke test,” Kim said. “It will be interesting to see whether Xi Jinping will throw his weight behind Kim Jong Un.” ABC News' Joohee Cho, Guy Davies and Matt Seyler contributed to this report.",,,,1
2022-10-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-disappointed-opec-decision-cut-oil-production/story?id=91043856,"White House 'disappointed' with OPEC+ decision to cut oil production, will release more from US reserves","The White House on Wednesday expressed disappointment following the announcement from OPEC+ that it would cut two million barrels per day from its production quotas beginning in November. The decision by the OPEC+ alliance, which includes Russia, is likely a response to oil prices dropping amid less demand stemming from a global economic slowdown. Oil prices currently hover around approximately $80 per barrel, down from the $100-plus cost it hit during late spring and early summer. Reducing supply will likely boost the cost of oil, which could raise the price Americans pay at the gas pump around the November midterm election -- and it comes just a few months after Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in July to lobby Middle Eastern allies to increase production. ""The president is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin's invasion of Ukraine,"" the White House said in a statement from national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese. The White House also said President Biden has directed the Department of Energy to release another 10 million oil barrels from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve next month, signaling the administration's effort to keep gas prices low with a month until the crucial midterms. The release was previously planned, according to an Energy Department press release. Biden offered little response when asked about the OPEC+ alliance's decision as he left the White House to head to Florida Wednesday morning. ""I need to see what the detail is,"" Biden said in response to a reporter's shouted question about the decision. ""I am concerned, it is unnecessary."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the administration would continue to ensure energy prices are ""kept low"" in light of the OPEC+ announcement. The national average cost of a gallon of gas is currently $3.83, up about 62 cents from last year, according to AAA. After the president struggled to rein in record-high gas prices that peaked at over $5 per gallon this summer, he and his administration have touted falling prices repeatedly over the past few weeks. ""And thanks to this president's efforts, we -- and his historic actions that he has taken, energy prices have declined sharply from their highs and American consumers are paying far less at the pump than they were several months ago,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday. ""And again, it's because of the historic steps that this president has taken,"" she added. Jean-Pierre did not directly comment on the OPEC+ alliance's expected move from the podium. But the White House's move to take credit for relief at the pump is much different from the administration's messaging earlier in the year. The largely unsuccessful White House effort to counter damaging daily headlines about skyrocketing prices at the pump saw it blame Russia's invasion of Ukraine for high energy issues before floating federal action that never happened. And in July -- when gas prices eased some over their June high -- Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia, where he held a controversial meeting with met with Crown Prince Muhammed bin Salam. The Middle Eastern nation accounts for roughly 17% of the world's petroleum reserves, according to OPEC+. ""We had a good discussion on ensuring global energy security and adequate oil supplies to support global economic growth,"" Biden said during his visit to Saudi. ""I'm doing all I can to increase the supply for the United States of America, which I expect to happen,"" he added. ""The Saudis share that urgency, and based on our discussions today, I expect we will see further steps in the coming weeks,"" Biden said. Some saw the move as desperate, while others criticized Biden for his infamous fist-bump with a man accused of human rights abuses, including the 2018 death of Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi. Wednesday's announcement from OPEC+ comes about a month after the alliance a 100,000 barrel per-day reduction to take effect in October. A similar cut in oil production also took effect in September.",,,,23

Putin on Oct. 4 signed into law the annexation of four Ukrainian territories after illegal referendums, conducted last week in the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, which were formed in 2014, and parts of the southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, which have been occupied by Russia since Feb. 24. The referendum ""results"" announced by the Russian-installed authorities alleged that more than 90% of the voters in each region supported separation from Ukraine and joining Russia. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the referendums “yet another Russian crime” and “null and worthiness.” The U.S., as well as the EU, have condemned the orchestrated “voting.” President Joe Biden vowed to ""never, never, never"" recognize the results of the Russian-led referendums. By annexing Russian-occupied territory and threatening to use nuclear weapons, Putin is attempting to force Kyiv to the negotiating table, an Institute for the Study of War report said. Attacks against any part of the swathe of Ukraine that Russia annexed would be considered aggression against Russia itself, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin said previously that he was willing to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia's ""territorial integrity."" An official in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told ABC News that the probability of the Russian nuclear attack was considered low. He, as well as an official close to the minister of defense, also said the annexation of the four Ukrainian regions will not affect the counteroffensive of the Ukrainian army ""in any way for now."" In response to the annexation President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine signed a decree Tuesday ruling out any negotiations with Putin. “It was our state that always offered Russia to agree on coexistence on equal, honest, dignified and fair terms,"" Zelenskyy said. ""It is obvious that this is impossible with this Russian president. He does not know what dignity and honesty are. Therefore, we are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but already with another president of Russia."" Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to the head of the president’s office, told ABC: “In order for the dialogue to become possible, Russia must abandon the basic demand -- the claim to Ukrainian territory. And the ball is on the Russian side. One call is all it takes to give the order to cease fire and withdraw troops. Obviously, Putin will never go for it.” Russia doesn’t fully control the four regions of Ukraine where the illegal referendums were held, adding further complications to the process of declaring them part of Russia. “The territories of the DPR, the LPR, and the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions lie within the borders that existed on the day of their establishment and the day of their entry into Russia,"" the Russian law signed by Putin says. The ""day of entry"" is when the Russian parliament makes the respective amendments to the Constitution. But during a week between the referendums and the day when Putin signed the law, the Armed Forces of Ukraine pushed more than 30 km forward in the Kherson region and liberated, in particular, a town of Lyman in the Lugansk region. Neither will the military draft announced by Putin on Sept. 21 change the course of the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian General Staff and the ministry of defense representatives told ABC News. Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday 200,000 men have now been mobilized, but the actual number is still unclear. The U.K. Ministry of Defense said Russia is struggling to recruit troop leaders and train the newly called up. Mykola Belieskov, a research fellow at Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies, said the draft ""should be viewed primarily as an effort to keep the current front line intact."" “As you see, no Russian strikes so far, although the Ukrainian forces are advancing,"" he told ABC. The Institute of the Study of War also said in one of its daily reports that the Kremlin’s decision to mobilize more manpower will not improve the performance of the Russian army in Ukraine. Zelenskyy called upon the Russian conscripts to surrender to Ukraine. “We see that people, in particular, in Dagestan, began to fight for their lives. We see that they are beginning to understand that this is a matter of their lives,"" he said, switching in his speech between the Ukrainian and Russian languages. ""Why should their husbands, brothers, sons die in this war?”",,,,14
2022-10-07,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-warns-putin-joking-nuclear-weapons/story?id=91157281,Biden warns Putin is 'not joking' about nuclear weapons,"President Joe Biden issued a dire warning about the escalating nuclear dilemma in Russia Thursday night, saying the country's president, Vladimir Putin, is ""not joking"" when he talks about potentially using the weapons. At a fundraiser in New York City, Biden said for the “first time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have the direct threat of the use of a nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path that they are going. That’s a different deal.” “We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis,” he said. “I don't think there's any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.” Biden said Putin's military is ""underperforming"" in Ukraine and he may feel threatened. The president said he knows Putin “fairly well” and has spent “a fair amount of time with him” and warned that Putin is serious. “He is not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons, or biological, or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming.” “There’s a lot at stake,” Biden said. “We are trying to figure out what is Putin’s off-ramp? Where does he get off? Where does he find a way out? Where does he find himself in a position that he does not - not only lose face but lose significant power within Russia?” Putin recently implemented a partial mobilization of 300,000 conscripts and has undertaken what has been called ""sham"" referenda to annex Ukrainian territory -- moves seen as a dramatic escalation in the conflict. And with those moves, he warned he will use ""all available means"" to protect what he now sees as Russian people and territory. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently called for Putin to stop his ""reckless nuclear threats"" during an address to the U.N. Security Council.",,,,7

""These comments were not based on new or fresh intelligence or new indications that Mr. Putin has made a decision to use nuclear weapons and, quite frankly, we don't have any indication that he has made that kind of decision,"" John Kirby, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. ""Nor have we seen anything that would give us pause to reconsider our own strategic nuclear posture in our efforts to defend our own national security interests and those of our allies and partners,"" Kirby said, citing the president's promise that ""neither we nor our allies are going to be intimidated by this."" Kirby's comments come after Biden's unusually stark remarks at a fundraiser on Thursday. Biden said then that Putin, the Russian president, was ""not joking when he talks about the use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons"" and that ""we have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis"" in the 1960s. The White House was pressed repeatedly last week over whether Biden's warning marked some shift in the administration's assessment of Putin's behavior, which Kirby denied on ""This Week."" ""We are monitoring this as best we can, and we have been monitoring his nuclear capabilities, frankly, since he invaded Ukraine back in February,"" Kirby said. Raddatz asked what the U.S. saw as Putin's ""way out"" of this war, where his forces have been losing ground in recent weeks in Ukraine's eastern and southern regions. On Saturday, an explosion also partially collapsed a bridge serving as a crucial supply link from Russia to Crimea, the disputed peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. ""Mr. Putin started this war and Mr. Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country,"" Kirby said, adding, ""We all want to see this war end. ... And what needs to happen is for the two sides to be able to sit down and negotiate and find a way out of this peacefully and diplomatically."" But, so far, ""Mr. Putin has shown no indications -- zero, none -- that he's willing to do that,"" Kirby said. And so, he said, the administration remained committed to indirect involvement in the war by supporting Ukraine via weapons and other military aid. On the Ukrainian side, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ruled out negotiating with Putin specifically -- not Russia -- and signed a decree formalizing that position on Tuesday. Raddatz also pressed Kirby on the White House's approach to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who launched a barrage of ballistic missiles in recent days, including over Japan, raising alarms there and in South Korea. ""I’ve seen this for decades and decades, the same thing happens through many presidents: You respond, you do drills, he keeps firing,"" Raddatz said. ""What are you doing differently?"" she pressed. Kirby pointed to intelligence gathering and ""military readiness"" between the U.S., Japan and South Korea: ""We're going to make sure that we have the capabilities in place to defend our national security interests if it comes to that."" But direct talks with Kim's regime remained the goal, he said: ""We want to see the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, verifiable and complete ... We are willing to sit down with them without preconditions at the negotiating table to work toward that end.""",,,,14
2022-10-10,https://abcnews.go.com/International/inside-ukraines-counteroffensive-drone-warfare-small-group-hackers/story?id=91104098,Inside Ukraine's critical drone warfare campaign against Russia,"In a workshop in an undisclosed location in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, a group of IT experts and engineers are assembling plastic components and soldering electrical wires. Bartek Kowalski from Poland, the only overseas member of an otherwise all-Ukrainian team, modestly joked that the intricate task he is performing can be learned by ""watching YouTube tutorials."" But the work of these volunteers is no laughing matter. They take drones that can be purchased on the internet and adapt them into fighting machines for the Ukrainian military. A custom-made fitting, designed in their lab, which is fixed onto the underside of a drone can carry a grenade that can then be dropped onto Russian positions. At the end of August, the Ukrainian military announced it was launching a counteroffensive in the south of the country. And, this week, Ukrainian forces appeared to be gaining significant amounts of ground in the Kharkiv region in the northeast. Yevhen Tkach is a biologist by trade who now spends the bulk of his time managing volunteer efforts to procure, adapt and supply drones to Ukrainian military units. He said he regularly receives information from military colleagues confirming the positive impact drones are making in the Ukrainians' ongoing operations to recapture territory. As well as their work to attach grenades to drones, Tkach and his colleagues are also taking other types of drones, and attaching explosives to them so they can be flown directly into a target in a kamikaze-style attack. His team is also working to fit certain drones with thermal cameras because a lot of the work undertaken by reconnaissance and sabotage units along the frontlines in Ukraine is carried out at night. As Yevhen Tkach pointed out, a drone is nowhere near as valuable as the life of a soldier, so the machines can access dangerous areas, acting as the military's ""eyes in the sky."" And he acknowledges that the Russians are ""really good at electronic warfare."" With the war in Ukraine predominantly an artillery battle, drones gather vital intelligence, allowing a unit to pinpoint enemy positions and assets. The location of any target is then passed to artillery units. However, soldiers who pilot drones are sometimes targets themselves. Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, Oleksandr Trofymenko was an event manager in Denmark. He quickly returned to his native Ukraine and now serves alongside a former farmer, DJ and security guard in a Ukrainian drone reconnaissance unit based in Zaporizhzhia. Trofymenko and his colleagues are heavily armed and alive to the risks they face. ""As soon as we launch the drone the Russians are hunting for us,"" he said with a wry smile. Defending their own territory, he argues, gives units like his an obvious advantage. ""We know everything,"" about the terrain, he said. Trofymenko is grateful to the army of Ukrainian volunteers who support units like his with vital equipment and even weapons. Yevhen Tkach and his small group of engineers in Zaporizhzhia also hack the drones before they supply them to reconnaissance units for use on the battlefield. By hacking a drone, they rid it of any digital signature which could reveal a unit's location to the Russians. Holding his drone aloft, soldier Trofymenko confidently states that the Russians can't see it. ""This is the work of Ukrainian engineers,"" he said.",,,,18
2022-10-11,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-officials-tech-companies-send-drones-front-line/story?id=91287422,"Ukrainian officials, tech companies to send more drones to the front line","LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian and foreign tech companies are providing an array of tech and cyber support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, Ukrainian officials and tech experts said, with some the country’s top commanders saying they plan to buy about 1,000 more drones. “Ukraine needs all the categories of drones: huge ones, small ones, kamikaze drones,” Ivan Tolchynskyi, CEO of Atlas Aerospace, a compact drone manufacturer, said at a conference in Lviv this month. The Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation along with the General Staff said this month that they’d spend almost $500,000 to buy about 1,000 drones. Small drones have become popular in Ukraine “because every soldier probably wants to get their own drone on the battlefield,” Tolchynskyi added. His company has provided the Ukrainian army with about 150 drones and plans to increase the number of deliveries to “1000 by the end of this year.” Ukraine's cause is also boosted by non-combat drones and special equipment, such as the mine-detection technology and medical drones supplied to various NGOs by the Canadian company Draganfly. “We originally came to Ukraine with our medical response drone that carries about 30 pounds of temperature sensitive supplies - such as insulin or pharmaceuticals - for search and rescue battlefield missions,” Cameron Chell, president and CEO of Draganfly, said. While drones help defend Ukraine's skies and territory, the country also needs solid protection in cyberspace to repel attacks by Russian hackers. “On average, we register around 200 attacks every day. Sometimes it is 500 a day and sometimes it is 50, but it happens every day,” Oleksandr Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation, said. “We may not see it, we may not know what is really going on behind the scenes,” Kim Zetter, a cybersecurity journalist, added. Yet according to NATO Cyber Defense Center Ambassador Kenneth Gears, “[W]e have probably seen what Russia has.” As troops in the battlefield don’t do anything without hacker support these days, Gears said, the “very poor results that we see on the battlefield from the Russian army are in part the result of failed cyber-attacks and cyber defenses of the Russian army.” But in Ukraine, the IT sector -- and cyber warfare -- seems to be thriving, industry officials said. “The IT industry is one of the most resilient industries in Ukraine right now, maybe the most resilient. We are able to perform very efficiently during these times,” Vitaly Sadler, CEO and co-founder of Intellias, an IT development company, said. Ukraine boasts an informal “IT army” -- a gathering of over 200,000 anonymous volunteers who are coordinating via the Telegram messaging app. This motley crew of 'hackers' performed online attacks on very sensitive Russian targets, targeting banks, civil aviation databases and even the Federal Security Service website. Ukraine may even conscript a few IT specialists fleeing Russia on the back of the partial military mobilization announced by Moscow on Sept. 21, said Oleksandr Bornyakov, the deputy minister of Digital Transformation, adding that the recruitment is likely going to be limited. “I don’t think Ukrainian society is ready to accept even 'good Russians.' We might consider this on a very personal basis after conducting complete research on each person,” Bornyakov said. Russian hackers are in a more vulnerable position once they leave Russia. “Right now, they are protected by the Russian government -- the NSA and the U.S. cyber command know many of them. And Russia is going to be focused primarily on its own defense,"" he said.",,,,7
2022-10-12,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/quickly-ukraine-advanced-air-defenses/story?id=91342252,How quickly will Ukraine get the advanced air defenses it needs?,"The United States and other countries are pledging to beef up Ukraine's air defenses following this week's deadly cruise missile strikes that struck Ukraine's major cities, but how quickly will they get there to counter Russia's missile threat? The larger, more advanced, systems Ukraine wants will likely take some time to arrive given the limited stockpiles in existing American and allied arsenals, as well as the length of time it takes to manufacture the sophisticated systems. The White House said President Joe Biden promised advanced air defense systems in a call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday and providing Ukraine with more modern systems as quickly as possible has moved to the forefront of previously scheduled NATO and Ukraine contact group meetings being held in Brussels this week. ""Systems will be provided as fast as we can physically get them there,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters Tuesday following the meeting of the 50 countries providing Ukraine with weapons. ""We're going to do everything we can, as fast as we can, to help the Ukrainian forces get the capability they need to protect the Ukrainian people,"" he added. Ukrainian officials claim their existing air defense systems were able to bring down half of the more than 80 missiles that targeted Ukraine's cities on Monday but they want more advanced systems capable of targeting the low flying Russian cruise missiles used in this week's barrages. For the most part Ukraine's current air defense systems are composed of older Russian-made S-300 systems and thousands of portable shoulder-fired systems given to Ukraine by the United States and other countries that came from their existing military stockpiles. The portable systems have been effective against low-flying Russian military planes and helicopters, but Ukraine has repeatedly asked for larger air defense systems with more range and capable targeting ballistic or cruise missiles. The U.S. effort initially focused on replenishing Ukraine's S-300 missiles from the stocks of other countries that had the system, and then arranging for Slovakia to give Ukraine its own S-300 system. But with a finite number of S-300 resources available the U.S. and other countries shifted to providing western-made systems that could be easily resupplied to meet Ukraine's long term air defense needs. But those new systems will flow in slowly over the next year as they are manufactured. On Tuesday, Germany confirmed that it had shipped the first of four Iris T-SLM air defense systems to Ukraine that it had committed to provide back in June. In mid-July, Ukraine received at least one NASAM battery that it received directly from Norway. The NASAM or National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, is jointly produced by Norwegian company Kongsberg and American defense contractor Raytheon. With a range of 18 to 30 miles the missiles are capable of defending against planes, drones, helicopters, and cruise missiles. Next month, Ukraine will receive two of eight NASAM batteries that the U.S. has committed to providing Ukraine. But the additional six NASAM systems committed by the United States are being built from scratch and will likely not be available for at least a year. But the limiting factor will be the capacity of American and Western manufacturers to make air defense systems that will take time to make. Also speaking in Brussels, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, indicated that the short-term effort would be on providing Ukraine with older systems that are more readily available. He noted that Ukraine has asked for the Hawk missile, an older medium range missile no longer in use by the U.S. military, and ""other systems out there throughout the world that are available."" ""A lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,"" said Milley who said the challenge will be to link all of those systems into an integrated air defense system for Ukraine. Any further U.S. missile defense assistance will likely not include American-made Patriot surface-to-air missile systems that Ukraine has requested. There are only a limited number of Patriot missile batteries in the U.S. arsenal and there remain concerns about how Russia might react to their presence inside Ukraine.",,,,11
2022-10-12,https://abcnews.go.com/International/deadly-russian-strikes-ukraine-sign-weakness-strength-analysts/story?id=91296759,"Deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine sign of weakness, not strength: Analysts","Russia’s missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday were a direct retaliation for the attack damaging the key bridge connecting Crimea with Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week. The bombardment was the largest against Ukrainian cities in months and focused heavily on civilian targets, killing at least 19 and injuring dozens more, Ukrainian officials said. It was also the first time the very center of Kyiv had been directly hit. But while the barrage was intended to terrorize, independent analysts said it underlined not Russia’s strength but growing weakness, illustrating its inability to shift the military situation in its favor. They called it a desperate attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to respond to critics at home but said the strikes would have no effect in reversing Russia's battlefield defeats. ""This is not, therefore, a new war-winning strategy but a ... tantrum,"" Lawrence Freedman, a professor of War Studies at Kings College London, wrote in a post his Substack blog of Monday’s strikes. The Crimean bridge that was partially collapsed by a blast over the weekend was a target with major symbolic and military significance for Russia. The bridge was an expensive physical symbol of Putin’s annexation of Crimea and a key supply line for Russian forces already under intense pressure in southern Ukraine. The attack on the bridge was a personal humiliation for Putin that underscored how badly the war is going for Russia. Russian nationalists were demanding a commensurate response, experts said. Russia's strikes on Monday were unable to hit anything comparable, instead resorting to bombing civilian targets without any military significance, including a university and a children’s playground in Kyiv, local officials said. ""The occupiers are not capable of opposing us on the battlefield already, that is why they resort to this terror,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post on Monday. In the capital, for example, a Russian missile targeted a pedestrian bridge that crosses through a park and that’s only used for sightseeing. The missile missed the bridge, leaving it intact, but it did hit the surrounding park. It's unclear if that strike resulted in any injuries. Russia also targeted several power stations around the country that Ukrainian and Western officials have said are part of a strategy of destroying heating infrastructure as winter approaches. The strikes are designed to spread fear, but will have no impact on Ukraine’s ability to keep advancing in the northeast and south where Russia is on the defensive, several military analysts said. Russia is also running out of the long-range missiles it used in Monday’s strike, meaning it will be unable to maintain such intensity even short-term, analysts said. Pavel Luzhin, a military expert and political scientist, told the Russian independent news site The Insider that after Monday’s strikes, Russia already had insufficient advanced missiles to repeat such a large-scale attack. ""The 83 missiles that Russia used today, it had been hoarding for several months,” Luzhin, who writes for Riddle Russia, told The Insider. Russia produces no more than 200 advanced cruise missiles a year, he said, and upping production or buying them from other countries was impossible. Luzhin said Russia still had larger quantities of older, less advanced missiles and now Iranian drones, but these were not enough to have a significant military impact. ""Enough for terror, but not for anything more,"" he said. White House spokesman John Kirby said in an interview on ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday that Russia’s bombing campaign across Ukraine didn’t appear to be enough to turn the military tide in Russia’s favor. ""It doesn't appear like they're going to do that,"" Kirby said. ""I mean, we don't know what the next steps here are for Mr. Putin. But you can see just from the--just from the reaction of the Ukrainian people over the course of the weekend, they're not backing down. They're not slowing down. They're gonna continue to conduct their counteroffensives. They are still active on the battlefield."" Greg Yudin, a professor of political philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences, told ABC News the Russian hardliners were ""the target audience"" for Monday’s strikes. He said Putin was now fully aligned with the hardliners and that he would escalate further despite his military’s growing weakness. ""He doesn’t care about reality. He will push until the end. He will escalate further and further, hoping that perhaps the final escalation will make the opponent surrender,” Yudin said. He said, in Putin’s view, the real opponent he must force to surrender was the West. ""The hardliners have been demanding attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure for some time and they now have got what they wanted. But they will inevitably be disappointed with the results. The electricity will be turned back on, the rubble cleared, and Ukraine’s armies will continue to press forward,” Freedman wrote in a post on his Substack. Russia has been bombing Ukrainian infrastructure since the start of the war, hitting Ukrainian cities most days, but the number of its strikes has fallen dramatically since the summer, which is a sign it has to ration its limited missile stockpile, most military experts say. Short on missiles and pushed back from Ukrainian cities, Russia is often turning to anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles to strike ground targets in order to preserve its more valuable cruise missiles, experts said. Ukraine is also increasingly effective at shooting down Russian missiles. One of Britain’s top spy chiefs on Tuesday also said Russia was increasingly short on ammunition and supplies of all types. ""We know — and Russian commanders on the ground know — that their supplies and munitions are running out,"" Sir Jeremy Fleming, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence will say in a speech he is expected to give Tuesday, the BBC and other media outlets reported. “Russia’s forces are exhausted. The use of prisoners to reinforce, and now the mobilization of tens of thousands of inexperienced conscripts, speaks of a desperate situation.” As Ukraine has routed Russian forces in parts of the country in recent weeks, hardline nationalists in Russia have been calling for Putin to adopt a total war approach that would destroy civilian infrastructure and flatten Ukrainian cities. On Monday some of those critics hailed the strikes. ""We must hope that this is not a one-time act of revenge but a new system of waging war,"" Alexander Kots, a prominent military reporter for the pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote on the social media platform Telegram. ""Across the entire Ukrainian government. Until they lose the ability to function."" The Kremlin last week appointed a new overall commander for its Ukrainian operations, Gen. Sergey Surovikin, known for leading a brutal indiscriminate bombing campaign in Syria. Monday’s strikes may suggest the Kremlin may be shifting to a similar strategy of intensifying attacks on civilians in the hope of counterbalancing its military’s failures while also placating its most aggressive supporters, experts said. In a short speech on Monday, Putin said the strikes were in response to the Crimean bridge explosion and warned Ukraine more would come if it repeated similar attacks. “No one should have any doubts about that,” Putin said. But Ukrainian officials said the threats would not intimidate them, noting Russia has barraged the country since February and instead calling for western countries to provide more air defenses. Kyiv has pleaded for such defenses for months, and Zelenskyy did so again Tuesday at the G7 meeting. ""I thank you for all the help already provided. It is big, it is significant,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. ""But the Russian leader, who is now in the final stage of his reign, still has room for further escalation. This possibility of his is a threat to all of us."" Zelenskyy told the G7 that air defense systems are critical for peace to be achieved in his country. ""We have a formula for peace. And now, reacting to Russian terror, sham referenda and the attempt to annex our territory, we can apply the peace formula so that the terrorist state stands no chance,"" he said. ""The first point is defense support. Air shield for Ukraine. This is part of the security guarantees that are an element of our peace formula,"" Zelenskyy said Tuesday. ""When Ukraine receives a sufficient number of modern and effective air defense systems, the key element of Russian terror - missile strikes - will cease to work."" In a phone call on Monday with Zelenskyy, President Joe Biden pledged to continue support, including “advanced air defense systems.” The United States announced in July it would provide two NASAMS surface-to-air defense systems, although they have not yet arrived. Kirby wouldn't provide any more details on what more, in terms of air defense systems, the U.S. may provide Ukraine. ""Clearly, air defense is a need, and we're going to work with them on that going forward,” he told ""GMA"" on Tuesday, adding: “Clearly, after this weekend, air defense capabilities continue to be a significant need for Ukraine.""",,,,18
2022-10-13,https://abcnews.go.com/US/higher-heating-bills-expected-winter-amid-energy-market/story?id=91447412,Higher heating bills expected this winter amid energy market turmoil: Report,"Americans are expected to see higher energy bills when it comes to heating their homes this winter, according to a new analysis from the U.S. Energy Information Agency released this week. The independent agency within the Department of Energy found that homes heated with natural gas could see prices 28% higher than last winter, while homes heated by electricity will see a 10% increase and propane heat will see a 5% increase. At least 90% of homes in the U.S. use natural gas or electricity for heat. EIA said the supplies of fuels like natural gas, propane, or heating oil are low and could struggle to meet demand if temperatures are especially cold or supply chain issues make it difficult to deliver to where the fuels are needed. Rusty Braziel, CEO & Principal Energy Markets Consultant for RBN Energy, said energy prices are dealing with several factors that are putting pressure on the market. ""It's a whole different kind of market turmoil than we've ever seen before,"" he said in a briefing with reporters. ""We've got a hot war in Europe, we've got sky-high prices, we got Russia's use of energy as a weapon. We're still recovering from a global pandemic. Our markets are absorbing a massive new energy transition and this economy is shaky, recession could be just around the corner. National politics are wacky, and producer discipline has basically reset the shale supply curve. So if that ain't wild, I don't know what is."" The EIA report factors in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's forecast for a colder-than-average winter in some parts of the country. Officials said demand for energy could change if temperatures dip colder than predicted. Energy costs are another factor that could lead to difficulty for many families dealing with the cost of living amid rising inflation. In 2020, 34 million U.S. households, about 27% of the country, reported having difficulty paying their energy bills or keeping their home at an unsafe temperature to avoid higher bills, according to an EIA survey. The Department of Energy said there are multiple ways that households can reduce energy bills by switching to more energy-efficient appliances or lighting and making homes better at keeping heat in and cold air out by sealing air leaks around windows or other points where heat could escape. The Biden administration has launched programs that include more than $3 billion to help low-income homeowners ""weatherize"" or retrofit their homes to be more energy efficient. The Inflation Reduction Act offers some tax credits to help with the up-front cost of installing more energy-efficient appliances or heaters. The advocacy group Rewiring America has a calculator where homeowners or renters can calculate what benefits they may be eligible to receive.",,,,23

SpaceX's Starlink terminals have been an important resource for Ukraine's military on the battlefield and it remains unclear what will happen if the service is stopped. CNN was first to report that SpaceX had sent a letter to the Pentagon that it reported said ""We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time."" Late Friday, Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon's deputy press secretary, confirmed receipt of the letter that touched on the funding of Starlink. ""We can confirm the Department received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of Starlink, their satellite communications product in Ukraine,"" Singh said in a statement. ""We remain in communication with SpaceX about this and other topics."" Earlier, Singh had indicated to reporters that other commercial satellite options might be looked at. ""There's not just SpaceX, there are other entities that we can certainly partner with when it comes to providing Ukraine with what they need on the battlefield,"" said Singh. ""I'm not going to show our hand right now on exactly what those are or who we're talking to."" Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, Musk offered free terminals that link with Space X satellites to help the beleaguered country maintain internet communications with the rest of the world. It is estimated that there are now more than 12,000 Starlink internet terminals inside Ukraine providing a vital communications system for front line troops fighting Russian troops throughout Ukraine. In tweets posted Friday, Musk stated that the maintenance and continued growth of the Starlink system in Ukraine is costing his company as much as much as $20 million a month. ""SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households,"" Musk tweeted. In a separate tweet he explained that ""In addition to terminals, we have to create, launch, maintain & replenish satellites & ground stations & pay telcos for access to Internet via gateways."" ""We've also had to defend against cyberattacks & jamming, which are getting harder,"" he added. In another tweet, Musk suggested that the Starlink row with the Pentagon was due in part to an insulting tweet by Ukraine's ambassador to Germany who used an expletive to characterize Musk's proposal to end the war by allowing Russia to keep Crimea. ""We're just following his recommendation,"" Musk tweeted Friday.",,,,10

A part of why we do see a lot of pressure on prices is that while the demand has come back, Americans have more income because Americans have jobs in this almost historically low level of unemployment,"" Buttigieg told anchor George Stephanopoulos, adding that it's ""been hard for the supply side to keep up."" ""That's a big part of what we're working on -- on the infrastructure side -- dealing with some of the bottlenecks we have, dealing with some of the constraints that we have in transportation infrastructure that's needed to be upgraded for decades,"" Buttigieg said, referring to a supply-chain crunch exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. President Joe Biden said last week that he believed an economic downturn was unlikely but conceded there could be a ""very slight recession."" His comments came after Jamie Dimon, the CEO of the largest bank in the United States, JPMorgan Chase CEO, warned a recession is likely within six to nine months because of Russia's war in Ukraine and historically high inflation and the rising interest rates to combat those prices. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times so far this year and is expected to again next month. Stephanopoulos pressed Buttigieg on what more Biden could do about rising prices after the president said he would soon be announcing more steps to tackle inflation and, particularly, the cost of gas. Buttigieg emphasized that he didn't want to ""get ahead of the president,"" but he highlighted how Biden had ordered the release of fuel from the country's strategic petroleum reserve and waived a requirement on ethanol blending for gas stations. ""This is part of a bigger focus that the president has sustained throughout this year on fighting inflation and creating more of that breathing room for American families,"" Buttigieg said. While gas prices have fallen sharply from a summer high -- now averaging about $3.90, down from $5.02 in mid-June -- they are 20 cents higher than they were just a month ago, according to AAA. Buttigieg laid some of the blame with oil companies, who have defended themselves from criticism of excessive profits. The economic headwinds could cost Democrats their slim congressional majorities this November. Stephanopoulos asked Buttigieg how the party should address high inflation with just 23 days until the midterm elections. Polls show it is a major factor in Biden's low approval rating, with voters giving Republicans the advantage on handling the economy -- and Republicans have, in turn, made the state of the economy central to their campaign messaging. ""Good policy is good politics. And we have been doing the right thing for the American people with proposals and achievements, legislatively, that are popular because they make sense,"" Buttigieg said. He pointed to a bipartisan infrastructure funding bill that was signed in 2021, which has allowed for improvements to bridges, roads and airports across the country, as well as the recently enacted Infrastructure Reduction Act (IRA), which contains provisions aimed at lowering health care costs. Buttigieg suggested that the November elections were important for making sure those policies continue: ""It's why we can't turn back on the progress that's been made, especially because we know there's still a long way to go."" He cited some conservative objections to allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, which was a major part of the IRA. GOP lawmakers have said the negotiation power is a ""price control"" that will hamstring pharmaceutical development. ""It's the wrong time to do anything that would increase costs for health care or anything else for the American people,"" Buttigieg said. Stephanopoulos asked whether Biden should spend more time highlighting the White House's other 2021 successes, like the direct COVID relief payments and a temporary expansion of the child tax credit which expired at the end of last year. Buttigieg said ""we are proud of those accomplishments,"" and then noted what he believed were others, such as a funding bill for domestic manufacturing, a veterans' health care bill and Biden's initial COVID-19 relief bill when the economy ""was at risk of going into free-fall."" ""In some ways having achieved so much legislatively makes it hard to talk about all at once because there are just so many,"" he said.",,,,23
2022-10-17,https://abcnews.go.com/International/iranian-drones-russia-attack-ukraine/story?id=91620223,What to know about the Iranian drones Russia is using to attack Ukraine,"A wave of drones struck Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities on Monday morning, killing at least four and wounding several others, after one blew apart a residential building in the capital and other drones targeted thermal power stations across the country. The attacks appeared to be the largest drone assault unleashed by Russia on civilian targets since the start of the war. Russia launched 43 drones and Ukraine successfully shot down all but six, Ukraine’s Air Force said. The attack highlighted how Russia is increasingly turning to using attack drones built and supplied by Iran to bolster its failing war effort in Ukraine. Russia has ordered hundreds of military drones from Iran’s government, according to western and Ukrainian officials, as it seeks to fill gaps in its own drone arsenal and as it runs short of long-range missiles. Ukraine’s government said the drones used in the attacks were mostly Iran’s Shahed-136s, large so-called loitering munitions, which Russia is employing like slow, small cruise missiles. Iran’s government has denied it is supplying drones to Russia to use in Ukraine but their deployment has already been widely documented since September. Ukrainian troops regularly post images of their wreckage and the drones' distinctive wing shape makes them easily identifiable. The 11-foot-long, propeller-powered drones are relatively unsophisticated, according to defense analysts, but still pose a serious threat, particularly if Russia receives them in large numbers. The Shahed-136 relies on a small civilian motor and commercially available GPS systems, making it vulnerable to jamming and relatively easy to bring down, Samuel Bendett, an expert on Russian unmanned military systems at CNA, a Virginia-based security research group, told ABC News. Russian troops have taken to nicknaming the drones “mopeds"", he said. But while vastly slower than Russia’s advanced cruise missiles, they are still able to fly hundreds of miles, capable of reaching almost anywhere in Ukraine. Slow and low-flying, they can also be difficult for some air defenses to detect and intercept. Their 50 kilogram payload is also relatively limited, but as Monday’s attacks show, the missiles can still sometimes cause significant damage. The drones’ greatest advantage, experts said, is that they are cheap compared to conventional missiles. “The whole point of using these Shaheds is to send them in waves, to stress Ukrainian air defenses, to have them expend ammunition, to keep people on edge,” Bendett said. “It’s not about all of them making it through, it’s about just some of them making it through.” Russia appears to be using the Iranian drones to maintain a campaign of aerial terror aimed at sapping Ukrainians’ will to fight, some experts said. In particular, Russia is targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, hoping to damage it as winter closes in. Monday’s attack again struck critical energy facilities, cutting hundreds of settlements off from the electricity grid, Ukraine’s prime minister said. The supply of Iranian drones is significant because Russia increasingly has insufficient missiles to keep up a daily campaign against civilian targets, according to Ukrainian and western officials. Most independent experts agree that Russia is unable to manufacture large enough numbers to replenish its stocks. But Iran’s drones may allow Russia to fill that gap, letting it continue its terror campaign and to degrade Ukrainian infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said Russia is seeking to acquire 2,400 drones from Iran. The Washington Post reported over the weekend that Iran has agreed to increase its supply of attack drones to Russia, citing officials. Iran’s weapons supplies to Moscow are also fueling tensions with Israel. Following The Washington Post report, Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Minister Nachman Shai publicly said it should start sending military aid to Ukraine. Israel has so far resisted calls from Ukraine to provide its vaunted ""Iron Dome"" anti-missile defense system and Israel’s government on Monday did not confirm it would send weapons. But Russia reacted furiously to the possibility, with former President Dmitry Medvedev on Monday warning that it would “destroy all interstate relations” between Russia and Israel. A senior adviser to Zelenskyy, Mykhailo Podolyak, blamed Iran for Monday’s attacks, writing on Twitter it was “responsible for the murders of Ukrainians.” Most experts said they did not believe the Iranian drones would be capable of fundamentally altering the military direction of the war, but that they could inflict daily death and destruction on civilians. Perhaps the biggest threat the drones pose currently is to Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. ""Even if it’s a 50 kilogram warhead flying in at a very high speed and it hits an electric power station, it can cause very significant damage. So I wouldn’t downplay that at all,"" said Bendett. But even such strikes seemed unlikely to break Ukrainian's determination to fight, he added. ""The cost could be substantial but it’s probably not going to change Ukrainian resolve,” Bendett said.",,,,18
2022-10-19,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-announcing-steps-lower-gas-prices-including-oil/story?id=91709910,"Biden announces more steps to try to lower gas prices, including next oil release from reserve","President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced a series of steps aimed at easing the oil supply crunch and lower gas prices, which have become a major domestic concern ahead of the November midterms. Biden confirmed the release of 15 million barrels from the nation's stockpile -- known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve -- in December. ""With my announcement today we're going to continue to stabilize markets and decrease the prices at a time when the actions of other countries have caused so much volatility,"" Biden said from the Roosevelt Room. This isn't a new tranche, administration officials told reporters earlier, but rather the final 15 million barrels from the 180 million that Biden pledged this spring to release over six months. Biden on Wednesday also said the administration is taking the unusual step of planning to buy oil to rebuild the strategic reserve once crude falls below $70 per barrel. Officials said that step is meant to send a clear signal to the market and incentivize domestic oil production. To that end, Biden also went after oil companies on Wednesday -- accusing them, as he has in the past, of price gouging at a time of historic profits. ""You should not be using your profits to buy back stocks or for dividends,"" Biden said in remarks directed to energy companies. ""Not now, not while a war is waging. You should be using these record-breaking profits to increase production and refining. Invest in America for the American people. Bring down the price you charge at the pump to reflect what you pay for the product."" Oil executives previously testified before Congress to address concerns about their prices but have insisted it is the result of larger economic forces, including supply and demand. The oil companies and some energy analysts have also repeatedly pushed back on Biden's calls to ramp up production, saying that increasing production is not so simple or easy and that other factors are at play. Gas prices have started to drop in the last week, but the national average for a gallon of gas is 20 cents higher than one month ago, according to AAA -- with gas prices also 56 cents higher than one year ago, though down from their summer high of more than $5 per gallon. ""But they're not falling fast enough,"" Biden acknowledged Wednesday. ""Families are hurting."" The Biden administration claimed some success in lowering prices over the summer and continued to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and ""other actors in the market"" for the rising prices this fall. The cost of gas, paired with overall high inflation, have led to months of withering criticism by Republicans as polls show voters are sour on Biden's handling of economic issues. Though the midterm elections loom, and while the 15 million more barrels of oil won't be released until December, administration officials said Biden is making an announcement now because of standard Department of Energy policy that requires a notification of the release a month and a half in advance. Biden denied the action was politically motivated -- to help Democrats before the midterm elections -- when questioned by a reporter Wednesday. ""It's motivated to make sure that I continue to push on what I've been pushing on and that is making sure there's enough oil that's been pumped by the companies, so that we have the ability to be able to produce enough gas that we need here at home,"" Biden responded. Other actions to address oil supply, according to officials, potentially include some limits on oil companies' exports to other markets. The administration has also not ruled out additional releases from the U.S. reserve, the officials said, with a decision on a January release to be made in November. ""We're keeping all tools on the table, anything that could potentially help ensure stable domestic supply,"" one official told reporters.",,,,23

""Just in the last few weeks, he's tried to mobilize more forces. He's gone through with this sham annexation of Ukrainian territory,"" Blinken said in a preview from the sit-down, which will air Thursday on ""Good Morning America."" ""Now, in saying that he's declaring martial law in places that he claims to have people who somehow want to be part of Russia, that speaks to his desperation,"" the secretary said. Blinken's remarks come after Putin issued an order this week declaring martial law in four Ukrainian provinces that he seized in September, which was widely denounced by the international community. Putin also placed all of Russia into various levels of heightened ""readiness."" When Stephanopoulos noted that second declaration and questioned Blinken if Putin is preparing for ""all-out war,"" Blinken said Russia's invasion is already becoming more indiscriminate in its violence. ""Going increasingly after the civilian population in Ukraine, indiscriminately bombing, targeting even power plants, bombs falling on schools, on hospitals -- that's pretty close,"" Blinken said.

2022-10-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/reason-vladimir-putin-imposed-martial-law-ukraine-analysis/story?id=91863245,Here's likely reason why Vladimir Putin imposed martial law in Ukraine: Analysis,"President Vladimir Putin's declaration of martial law on Wednesday officially imposed it only in four occupied regions of Ukraine. But many experts said in reality Putin appeared to have laid the groundwork to apply a form of martial law across the whole of Russia, just under another name. In his public address, Putin portrayed the martial law declaration as a technicality, limited to the Ukrainian regions he illegally annexed last month. But a second decree, published at the same time, also placed all of Russia's other regions into various levels of increased ""readiness."" Under those readiness levels, powers were granted to local authorities that closely resemble some of those under martial law. It was still unclear how the powers will be applied in practice, but some experts said it meant Putin had imposed a form of martial law across all Russia. ""It creates legal basis to impose martial law across the country or parts of the country without actually declaring it,"" Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, told ABC News. The most severe form outside the Ukrainian regions is in eight Russian regions neighboring Ukraine, where local administrations are granted powers to impose curfews, restrict movement, take over factories and transport, potentially apply censorship as well as order the temporary resettlement of people. The regions are under a ""form of martial law lite,"" Mark Galeotti, a veteran Russia analyst, wrote in the Spectator Magazine. ""Vladimir Putin has just moved Russia one step closer to totalitarianism."" Russia's southern and central regions, including Moscow, have slightly fewer powers and the rest of the country marginally less. The decrees grant governors the power to take any measures directed toward supporting Russia's war effort, in theory giving them almost unlimited authority. ""What's been declared is the right of the government to take any decision that seems to them necessary. Wherever, for whatever reason,"" Gleb Pavlovsky, a former political advisor to Putin and now a political analyst, said in a recent interview. For now, many regions have sought to reassure citizens the measures will not affect daily life. And most experts said it remained to be seen how they would be applied in practice. But the move appeared to be an attempt by Putin to rescue his invasion in Ukraine after presenting it as a limited ""Special Military Operation."" The decrees' primary goal, experts said, was to allow Russian authorities to mobilize resources needed to support the mass troop mobilization. ""I was waiting for this announcement. Their system can't mobilize this many people without mobilizing state resources too. The state needs more resources directed to the military,"" Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at RAND Corporation, wrote on Twitter. The move also appeared to re-direct Russia's economy toward supporting the war effort. It suggested the Kremlin is trying to ready Russia for a long war while also bracing for possible shocks to the political system coming from the battlefield, such as the likely loss of Kherson, Gabuev said. ""It looks like the Kremlin sees serious sources of worry,"" he said. ""Here the government really wants to be prepared."" He added, ""It's significant and it shows the change in the estimate of how the war is going and what kind of mobilization internally first and foremost will be needed to kind of toughen it out and then ultimately win this war by the Kremlin's definition.""",,,,14

Late last month, Putin issued a thinly veiled threat that Russia would resort to using nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine following a series of setbacks for Moscow on the battlefield. ""We are and should be worried,"" Syrskiy told ABC News. You can watch more of Ian Pannell's full interview with General Oleksandr Syrskiy on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Monday. The Ukrainian general is confident that his country is winning the fight against Russia, despite the challenges of war. ""Of course, I think we are winning. Because first and foremost, we are winning the psychological battle,"" Syrskiy said. ""We have success on the battleground, but the war is difficult."" Syrskiy, the commander of the Army of the Armed Forced of Ukraine, won the battle of Kyiv in the spring and the battle of Kharkiv in September. The successful surprise counteroffensive rapidly liberated thousands of square miles of occupied territory, forcing the Russians back towards their border. Last month, Putin accused Ukraine of terrorism after an explosion destroyed parts of a bridge connecting occupied Crimea to Russia, a vital supply route for Russian forces. ""There hasn't been any wars at that scale in Europe, or elsewhere in the world, since the Second World War. And we understand that this war is about the survival of our people and our state and this is why we have no other option but to win,"" Syrskiy said.",,,,7
2022-10-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/top-ukrainian-general-discusses-war-russia-putins-nuclear/story?id=91989074,"Top Ukrainian general discusses war against Russia, Putin's nuclear threat: Exclusive","KHARKIV, Ukraine -- The commander of the Ukrainian Ground Forces warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine is real and that the West ""should be worried,"" but said his country is nonetheless winning the war. Gen. Col. Oleksander Syrskiy made the comments in an exclusive interview with ABC News' Chief Foreign Correspondent Ian Pannell in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Sunday. As the 57-year-old top commander of his country's land forces, Syrskiy has played a decisive role in turning the war in Ukraine's favor, first leading the successful defense of the capital, Kyiv, and then -- most recently -- masterminding the spectacular counteroffensive in the northeast that upended the monthslong conflict and threw Russian forces onto the defensive. The rare interview, airing Monday on ""Good Morning America,"" is one of the few times Syrskiy has spoken publicly at length and he described Ukraine's tactics, the importance of Western support, the threat of renewed attacks from Belarus and his determination that Ukraine will reclaim all of its territory, including the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine's successes, however, have been shadowed by the recent threats from Putin that Russia might resort to nuclear weapons to reverse the course of his war in Ukraine. Syrskiy told ABC News that he takes the threats seriously. ""We are and should be worried,"" Syrskiy said. ""I do believe that such a threat really exists and we have to take it into account."" The urgency of those worries was underlined on Sunday when Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu made telephone calls to his counterparts in France, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, alleging that Ukraine was preparing to use a ""dirty bomb"" on its own territory. Shoigu's claim sparked fears that Russia might be laying the groundwork to use a nuclear weapon and blame Ukraine for it. Following Shoigu’s call with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson dismissed the allegations as ""transparently false."" ""The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,"" Watson said. Russia's nuclear threats have grown louder as its position in Ukraine has become increasingly desperate, and Ukrainian troops now threaten to force the Russians to retreat from the key port city of Kherson -- yet another potential turning point in the war. Syrskiy is one of the minds behind the two crucial victories so far that have enabled Ukraine's stunning success in pushing back Russian forces. When Russian troops advanced on Kyiv in late February, shortly after launching the invasion of neighboring Ukraine, Syrskiy directed the defense that shattered Putin’s initial objectives. Then in September, Syrskiy led the counteroffensive in northeastern Ukraine that liberated thousands of miles of Russian-occupied territory -- a disaster for Moscow that forced Putin to order a military draft and, for the first time, raised the prospect that Russian forces might suffer a full defeat in Ukraine. ""Of course I think we are winning,"" Syrskiy told ABC News. ""Because, first and foremost, we are winning the psychological battle."" But the commander warned against complacency, noting the heavy sacrifices that success has required of Ukrainians. ""We have success on the battleground, but war is difficult,"" he added. ""There hasn't been any wars at that scale in Europe, or elsewhere in the world, since the Second World War. And we understand that this war is about survival of our people and our state, and this is why we have no other option but to win."" Syrskiy was given the Hero of Ukraine award in April for his efforts defending the capital city. But the victory in Kharkiv, his hometown, was especially personal. Cerebral and reflective, Syrskiy is also a military leader who prefers to see the frontlines himself, regularly visiting positions to personally meet some of the soldiers he is sending into battle. He told ABC News he feels that responsibility and has a ""spiritual connection"" with his troops. Although he was appointed to his current post in 2019, Syrskiy has helped lead Ukraine's defense against Russia since 2014, when Russian troops and separatist proxies seized parts of the disputed Donbas region, the predominately Russian-speaking industrial heartland of Ukraine's east. Syrskiy has a deep familiarity with the tactics of his enemy, having been trained in the same Soviet school of warfare. In the 1980s, he studied at the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School. Now, he's exploiting that knowledge on the battlefield. ""It's easier to understand your enemy's actions,"" he told ABC News. ""You can foresee what he might do in different situations."" But as a commander, like the rest of Ukraine's military leadership, Syrskiy has embraced a different mode of military thinking since even before 2014 -- adopting NATO doctrines that grant greater initiative to more junior officers on the ground and moving away from the top-down Soviet approach. ""Of course there was a change in mentality,"" he said. ""Understanding that victory is achieved not by increasing the number of troops, but by using them smartly."" Despite his familiarity with Russia, Syrskiy said he had not believed Moscow would go through with a full-scale invasion. Even as Russian forces massed near the border, he said he believed an attack would be limited to the east, though he still prepared for the worst. ""To be honest, I did not expect that scale and level of invasion from the enemy,"" he told ABC News. Now fighting in Donbas, Syrskiy said Ukraine's strategy was to avoid full-frontal clashes that favoured Russia's massed artillery and instead, steadily degrade Russia's firepower by hitting supply hubs while launching constant mobile attacks. The goal, he said, was to achieve objectives with minimal losses. ""We achieve this by reliably hitting the firepower of the enemy, their artillery, avoiding frontal assaults, emphasizing raids and manoeuvers, attacking from the flanks and from the back,"" he added. ""We create the conditions under which we can make the enemy nervous, start taking losses and abandon their positions."" The successful counteroffensive in the northeast led by Syrskiy has been hailed by military experts as a masterstroke that will go down in the history of warfare, alongside other victorious operations like the D-Day landings during World War II or the Battle of Saratoga in the American Revolutionary War. Ukraine's success relied on patience and misdirection, declaring a counteroffensive in its south over the summer which lured Russia into pulling some of its best troops from the northeastern frontline. Once Russia had thinned its defenses in the northeast, Ukraine struck, rapidly breaking through and causing Russia's lines to collapse. Initially, the northeastern counteroffensive had itself been planned as a feint to tie up Russian units, according to Syrskiy. But he said he realized while planning the operation that Russian forces there were weaker than expected, opening up an opportunity to deliver a blow that would have a much wider effect. ""When we were planning it, it became obvious to me that an advance in Kharkiv as an operation will benefit us most and will have the most negative impact on the enemy,"" Syrskiy told ABC News. ""I noticed it first in May during the first offensive operation around Kharkiv, when we managed to liberate 10 to 30 kilometers of areas surrounding the city,"" he added, before noting that it was only in the summer that the change in the balance in forces made the counteroffensive possible. A similar Ukrainian success now looks possible in Kherson. Russia has ordered all civilians to leave the southern city amid reports it has already pulled back some veteran troops. But there are also concerns Russia might blow up the nearby Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, which Ukrainian officials allege Russian troops have rigged with explosives, threatening to flood Kherson. Syrskiy declined to comment on the battle for Kherson, saying only that he believes ""in the success of our armed forces."" He said the threat Russia might also blow up the Kakhovka dam should also not be underestimated. There is also renewed concern around neighboring Belarus, from where Russia launched its failed assault on Kyiv and where it has recently again begun moving in more troops and equipment. Western and Ukrainian officials have said that, for now, the new build up in Belarus is small and more likely a feint aimed at drawing Ukrainian troops away from the south. But Syrksiy said he believes the Russian moves in Belarus do reflect preparations to try to move the fighting into new areas once again. ""Of course they are getting ready for escalation of the battle and switching the conflict to other combat zones,"" he told ABC News. ""They are getting ready for action aimed at weakening our groupings and, to my mind, the possible purpose of that would be to cut or degrade our lines of communication and supplies."" But he said by doing so, Russia again risks stretching itself too thin in the north. ""They risk stepping on the same rake twice and hitting themselves in the face,"" he added. Most experts believe Putin is preparing for a long war, hoping his military mobilization and the arrival of winter weather will allow Russia to stablize its frontlines and then outlast Western determination to support Ukraine. The possibility of Republicans taking control of the U.S. Congress in the midterm elections next month is also raising questions whether American aid will continue as strongly for Ukraine. Republicans are divided on the issue and some party leaders have suggested they might scale aid back. When asked if he was worried that U.S. support could dry up if Republicans win more seats in Congress, Syrskiy said he doesn't get involved in politics. ""I trust the government. I trust the people of the United States of America. I trust that our strategic partner will continue to help us overcome our enemy come what may,"" he said. Syrskiy said he was grateful to the American people for the aid, which he said played a key role in Ukraine's victories. Without U.S. weapons and ammunition, he said he couldn't even imagine how much harder the task would be. When asked whether he believes Putin would stop if Ukraine succeeded in liberating all its territory, Syrskiy said it doesn't matter and that the fastest way to end the war was for Ukraine to push Russia out as quickly as possible. ""We have no other option, we have to go forward, move straight to our state borders,"" he said, adding that victory would only be when Ukrainian flags were flying over all Ukraine's borders, ""including Ukrainian Crimea."" Syrskiy recalled seeing razed villages last week as he drove near the recently liberated city of Lyman in northeastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast. ""You can't look at these scenes without getting emotional,"" he told ABC News. ""You literally feel pain in my heart, in my soul, so certainly you want to deliver such a blow to the enemy that they can never get back to Ukraine.""",,,,28

In this weekend's phone calls to top officials at the Pentagon, Russian military leaders indicated that the alleged Ukrainian use of a dirty bomb would be a justification for an escalation in the conflict, a U.S. official told ABC News. Over the weekend, in an unprecedented series of phone calls to senior defense officials in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Turkey, senior Russian defense officials repeatedly claimed that Ukraine was possibly preparing to use a dirty bomb. A dirty bomb is an explosive device paired with radioactive material that is intended to widely disperse radiation over a wide area while a nuclear weapon is a device that uses nuclear fission to produce a massive atomic or thermonuclear explosion. ""Obviously, we're concerned about these allegations that the Russians raised, them, not us,"" John Kirby, the National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications told reporters on Monday. ""They're the ones that made a public issue of this."" ""We reject the false allegation that the Russians made in the phone call that they placed at their request to (Defense) Secretary Austin, that the Ukrainians were planning to use a dirty bomb,"" said Kirby. ""We just reject that allegation. It's just not true."" On Sunday and Monday, in a rare move, Russian defense minister Sergey Shoygu and Russia's top military commander Gen. Valery Gerasimov initiated phone calls to their American counterparts and, according to Russia's defense ministry, raised their concerns that Ukraine was preparing to use a dirty bomb. Those calls, and similar calls to other western leaders, resulted in a joint statement by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France rejecting the Russian claim as a pretext to escalate tensions in Ukraine. ""Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory,"" said the statement. ""The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation. We further reject any pretext for escalation by Russia."" A U.S. official said that, in this weekend's calls to top officials at the Pentagon, Russian military leaders described any alleged Ukrainian use of a dirty bomb as a justification for an escalation in the conflict, presumably a reference to the use of nuclear or chemical-biological weapons. However, U.S. officials pointed out repeatedly on Monday that they are not seeing any indications that Russia's military is making preparations for the use of nuclear weapons. ""We continue to see nothing in the way of preparations by the Russian side for the use of nuclear weapons and nothing with respect to the potential use for a dirty bomb at this point,"" said Kirby. ""We're watching this as closely as we can."" ""We have seen in the past that the Russians have, on occasion, blamed others for things that that they were planning to do,"" said Kirby. Meanwhile in Moscow, the Russian government continued to say that Ukraine was preparing to use a dirty bomb. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed that Russia was in possession of information alleging that Ukraine was preparing dirty bombs at locations in Kyiv and central Ukraine. Earlier, the Russian defense ministry had published a map indicating that Ukraine was preparing a dirty bomb at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that has seen constant shelling for weeks.",,,,0

In satellite images taken on Oct. 17, the fortifications for this defensive line begin just south of Russian-held Popasna in the Luhansk region. An ABC News analysis of the satellite images overlaid on Google Earth suggests the fortifications, as of that date, were 7.9 miles long. Another section of fortifications, near the town of Hirske, can be seen on satellite imagery from Oct. 6. The image shows two rows of pyramid-shaped concrete blocks followed by a large vehicle-trapping ditch, both meant to slow down tanks and heavy machinery. An analyst for Janes, the defense intelligence provider, told ABC News the trenches “are considerably larger and more sophisticated than most Russian trench lines seen throughout the war."" The trench is being dubbed ""The Wagner Line"" in Russian media after the Russian private military company of the same name. Wagner’s founder, billionaire Evgeniy Prigozhin, told Russian media outlet New Day that Wagner was behind the project. Plans for the trench published by a Prigozhin-linked media outlet, FAN, show it will extend to Lysychansk to the north before turning and going east toward the Russian border. Completed according to this plan, it would run about 120 miles. The Janes analyst says this is an ambitious plan. ""It will take the Russians considerable time to construct it if they try to, and it’s time they may well not have,” given Ukraine’s offensive in the east. Even so, the Russians are using what the military analysts said are rare and expensive trench-digging systems, seen in videos published by FAN, to build it. This could mean ""the towns near these trenches are considered to be important enough by Russian commanders to merit their use."" The plan for the completed line goes through towns that the Janes analyst describes as strategic hubs important to Russia’s long-term goals in the region: Popasna, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk and Luhansk. But by protecting these towns, the line would actually bisect the Luhansk oblast, all of which Russia currently holds, staying instead within the borders of the Luhansk People’s Republic, the Russian-backed separatist republic within the oblast, the experts said. Colonel Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesman for Ukraine's Eastern Command, sees this as proof that the war is not going Russia’s way. ""It is the evidence of their losses as they proclaimed both Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts in general as Russia and here, in the middle of this territory they are building this fortified line,"" Cherevatyi told ABC News. And while the Wagner Line may be a defensive tool, Cherevatyi suspects there is a political reason for it as well. ""it looks as if they want to demonstrate how important it is for them, that they will stand till the end defending these territories."" ABC News' Yuriy Zaliznyak contributed to this report.",,,,5
2022-10-26,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-vows-breathing-room-families-midterms/story?id=92127477,Biden vows 'breathing room' for families going into midterms,"President Joe Biden, highlighting his administration's war on rising costs less than two weeks ahead of the midterm elections, announced new initiatives Wednesday he said will provide ""a little breathing room"" for American families. Speaking at the White House, Biden said the initiatives on what he called ""junk fees"" aim to ""lower the cost of everyday living for American families, to put more money in the pockets of middle-income and working- class Americans and to hold big corporations accountable."" ""These steps will immediately start saving Americans collectively billions of dollars in unfair fees,"" he said. The administration's actions to provide financial relief come amid steep inflation. Republicans have seized on high prices ahead of the midterms, arguing Democrats' policies are to blame for surging costs. Polling shows the GOP has an edge on the issue. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey found 36% of Americans trust Republicans to handle inflation while 21% trust Democrats. On the state of the economy overall, 36% of Americans trust Republicans to do a better job while 24% trust Democrats on the issue. Biden announced Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued guidance effectively banning two popular ""junk fee"" practices: surprise overdraft fees or depositor fees. Those actions will save consumers more than $1 billion per year, according to the White House. ""This is real money back in the pockets of American families,"" said Rohit Chopra, the director of the CFPB. ""It's good for them, and it's good for businesses that follow the law."" The CFPB will also develop guidance on other bank and credit card fees that currently cost consumers more than $24 billion per year, the White House said. Biden said his administration's looking to take action on other charges, including processing fees for concert tickets or resort fees. The Federal Trade Commission announced last week it would be launching a rule-making process to reduce such fee practices across the economy. Such fees, Biden said, ""hit marginalized Americans the hardest, especially low-income folks and people of color."" Biden, speaking just 13 days before Election Day, also took the opportunity to tout other moves his administration made to lower costs, including making hearing aids available over-the-counter and a program to lower Americans' monthly broadband bills. He again blamed high prices, particularly energy prices, on Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing war in Ukraine. Biden also repeated his call on gas companies to pass savings down to consumers, and predicted gas prices will continue to fall. ""I'm optimistic,"" Biden said. ""It's gonna take some time, and I appreciate the frustration and American people.""",,,,24
2022-10-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-war-expected-accelerate-clean-energy-transition-report/story?id=92201504,"Ukraine war expected to accelerate clean energy transition, new report finds","The war in Ukraine is reshaping the global energy landscape and is expected to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels as countries scramble for alternatives to Russian energy, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency. Russia has been one of the world's largest exporters of fossil fuels like oil and natural gas, but Russia has cut off supplies of natural gas to Europe since they invaded Ukraine and sanctions on Russian exports have threatened energy supplies and increased prices all over the world. The IEA report found that government's responses to this energy crisis like the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. as well as clean energy packages in the European Union, Japan and Korea will bring down global demand from fossil fuels and accelerate the deployment of less emitting forms of energy like wind and solar. China and India have also set new goals to roll out more renewable energy. ""The government responses around the world given to this energy crisis promise to be that we are seeing a turning point in the history of energy and this crisis, indeed, accelerates clean energy transitions,"" IEA Director Fatih Birol said at a press conference. The report found that these policies will contribute to a peak in fossil fuel demand for the first time since the industrial revolution, with demand for natural gas expected to peak this century and increasing use of electric vehicles contributing to a peak in demand for oil in the 2030s. ""In this scenario, coal use falls back within the next few years, natural gas demand reaches a plateau by the end of the decade, and rising sales of electric vehicles (EVs) mean that oil demand levels off in the mid-2030s before ebbing slightly to mid-century,"" the report said. ""This means that total demand for fossil fuels declines steadily from the mid-2020s to 2050 by an annual average roughly equivalent to the lifetime output of a large oil field."" United Nations climate reports have found that global greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels need to peak this century to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the target set by the Paris Agreement to prevent more dangerous impacts of climate change. The report expects that the short-term increases in demand for oil and coal burning to offset the lack of Russian gas are likely temporary and will be replaced by lower emissions sources of energy in the long-term. ""Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in the press release. ""Even with today's policy settings, the energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system.""",,,,20
2022-11-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-announce-13-billion-assistance-cut-energy-costs/story?id=92526007,Harris to announce over $13 billion in assistance to help cut energy costs this winter,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday will announce new steps the Biden administration is taking to help lower energy costs for Americans this winter. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is providing $4.5 billion in assistance to help cut heating costs for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), according to the White House. ""In addition to covering home heating costs this winter and unpaid utility bills, the program will help families make cost-effective home energy repairs to lower their heating and cooling bills,"" the White House said in a statement. Over the last year, LIHEAP has helped 5.3 million households across the United States with heating, cooling and weatherization, according to the White House. The U.S. Department of Energy will also allocate $9 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to support up to 1.6 million households nationwide in upgrading their homes to decrease energy bills. This will be separated into two rebate programs: one for whole home energy efficiency retrofits and another for highly efficient and electric home appliances, according to the White House. ""In addition to lowering costs, energy-efficient and electric building and appliance upgrades can reduce indoor and local outdoor air pollution, improving health in our communities,"" the White House said. ""In addition, they will cut millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year to help tackle climate change."" Harris will discuss the initiatives while visiting a union hall and training facility in Boston on Wednesday, according to the White House. Nearly half of U.S. households rely on natural gas for heating and their bills could jump 28% this winter, compared with last winter, while bills for heating oil are projected to be 27% higher and electricity 10% higher, according to a recent analysis from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, an independent agency within the U.S. Department of Energy. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents the state directors of LIHEAP, said in a recent report that energy costs are expected to be the highest this winter in more than a decade. This comes amid soaring inflation rates, with U.S. consumer prices increasing to a 40-year high 6.6% in September. There are a number of contributing factors, including a rebound in global energy consumption from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has triggered price spikes, and Russia's war in Ukraine further increasing prices and reducing supplies.",,,,23
2022-11-08,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-asks-us-capabilities-fighting-iranian-drones/story?id=92826420,Ukraine asks US for new capabilities in fighting Iranian drones,"ABC News has obtained a letter sent by a top Ukrainian official to senior members of Congress, asking them to assist Ukraine's calls for additional air defense systems to counter the attack drones built and supplied by Iran to bolster Russia's war effort. Russia has launched waves of deadly attacks in recent weeks, using Iranian-made drones that explode on impact to strike power plants, killing civilians and causing rolling blackouts, plunging millions of Ukrainian homes into darkness. In the letter, the chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, calls on the U.S. to provide Ukraine with highly mobile air defense systems known as C-RAMs, saying they would help protect ""important objects, especially crucial power plants."" C-RAMs have a built-in radar to track incoming threats and a giant rapid-fire gun to shoot them down, with NATO saying the ""most effective"" systems are able to fire 4,500 rounds per minute. A senior Ukrainian politician told ABC News that the Ukrainian government has also made an official request to the Biden administration for the C-RAMs systems. ABC contacted the Ukranian Ministry of Defense for comment. The Pentagon does not comment on specific Ukrainian requests for weaponry. However, Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Garron Garn told ABC News this week that U.S. support ""focuses on equipment that is relevant for the current fight."" ""We are working around the clock to fulfill Ukraine's priority security assistance requests, delivering weapons from U.S. stocks when they are available,"" he added. As things stand, Ukrainian officials say they are using an array of methods to shoot down the drones. Ukrainian fighter jets are being used to track them and, in some instances, shoot them down, according to the Ukrainian politician who has been briefed on the matter. ""We are using all kinds of different stuff [to destroy the Iranian drones],"" the source told ABC News, adding that the Ukrainian military even sometimes resorts to shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons to counter the threat. The White House last month indicated that Russia is launching Iranian-supplied drones from Crimea, a peninsula to the south of mainland Ukraine that was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. The White House National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, also said at the time that a ""relatively small number"" of Iranian personnel had been on the ground in Crimea to assist the Russians in how to operate the drones. The drones fly slowly, giving the Ukrainian military a matter of hours from the moment they are launched from Crimea, through to when they reach their targets, Ukrainian officials said. However, Ukrainian officials said the drones are able to change trajectory mid-flight, making it harder for the military to position assets that could shoot them down. In his letter, Stefanchuk also asks senior U.S. lawmakers to assist him in asking the Biden administration to provide longer-range missiles so that the Ukrainian military could destroy targets such as ""stocks of Iranian drones, deep behind the enemy lines on the occupied territory of Ukraine."" On Monday, Ukraine's defense minister announced that advanced air defense systems for countering Russian missiles and rockets, called NASAMS, had arrived in Ukraine. A senior U.S. official confirmed that two systems were delivered to Ukraine. The U.S. announced in August that it promised another six NASAMS launchers to Ukraine, but it could be some time until they arrive in the country. A Ukrainian government source said the Ukrainian government was talking to all of its partners, including the U.S., about creating a ""comprehensive and wide"" air defense system ""all across Ukraine."" ""We're not talking about a few systems near the front lines,"" the official added. ""If we have this [comprehensive air defense] system, this war can end sooner and that's in all of our interests."" Last month, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley called the project a priority. At a NATO meeting, he stressed that air defense systems would have to be provided to Ukraine by a number of countries. ""The task is then to bring those together, get them deployed, get them [the Ukrainians] trained, because each of these systems is different,"" Milley said. Last weekend, after weeks of denials, Iran finally acknowledged that it has supplied Russia with drones. However, Iran's foreign minister claimed Tehran only sold a relatively small number of drones to Russia and did so before President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. He also claimed that Iran had no knowledge that the drones were being used to attack Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Iran of ""lying.""",,,,18
2022-11-09,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-pull-kherson-defensive-positions/story?id=93001346,Russia to pull out of Kherson to new defensive positions,"In a major setback for Russia's military operations in Ukraine, Russia's defense minister has ordered Russian troops to retreat from the key southern city of Kherson and set up defensive positions across the Dnieper River as Ukrainian troops continued with a counteroffensive targeting the city. The fighting around the city expected to continue as Russian troops move across the Dnieper River into defensive positions taking advantage of the natural border offered by the river. The retreat is a major setback for Russia's beleaguered military operations inside of Ukraine as Kherson was the largest Ukrainian city under Russian control and the only major provincial capital seized by Russian troops early in the war that is now in its eighth month. It is even more significant given that Kherson was one of the four Ukrainian provinces that had just been illegally annexed by Russia. ""I understand that this is a very difficult decision, but at the same time we will preserve the most important thing -- the lives of our servicemen and, in general, the combat effectiveness of the group of troops, which it is futile to keep on the right bank in a limited area,"" Sergeii Shoigu, Russia's defense minister said he had approved the withdrawal of Russia's troops across the Dnieper River because defending the city had become ""futile"" and very difficult to resupply. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior Ukrainian official, described Russian forces as having been ""knocked out of Kherson."" ""The Russian army does not leave Kherson,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""It was knocked out with heavy battles, with losses methodically gnawed through the enemy’s defenses, work on crossings, hard and bloody military labor."" ""Dear people of Kherson. Here we are returning. Here you are returning. Welcome home,"" he wrote. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy urged caution about the Russian announcement tweeting that ""actions speak louder than words. We see no signs that Russia is leaving Kherson without a fight."" A Russian troop withdrawal from Kherson had been telegraphed for weeks beginning with the evacuation of tens of thousands of Russian civilians from the city as Ukraine continued to target the bridges that were the main supply routes into the city across the Dnieper River. ""I found it interesting that they waited until after the election to make that judgment which we knew for some time that they were going to be doing,"" President Biden said at a White House news conference on Wednesday. ""And it's evidence of the fact that they've got some real problems, the Russian military."" ""At a minimum it will lead to time for everyone to recalibrate their positions over the winter period,"" said Biden. ""It remains to be seen whether there'll be a judgment made as to whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia."" Last week, a western official told reporters that it appeared that Russia was preparing for a military withdrawal from Kherson because most Russian commanders had left the city and crossed the Dnieper River, leaving behind troops that he characterized as demoralized and leaderless. On Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon's top spokesman told reporters that it appeared that the recent arrival of Russian troops in Kherson could mean that Russia was ""looking to defend that territory for the long term or it could be part of a rearguard action as they look to retrograde out of that area."" The western official indicated that the Russian troops that had recently arrived in the region were some of the 300,000 recently mobilized Russian reservists who were arriving in some cases only 10 to 15 days after their mobilization and were ""woefully equipped and prepared."" The official predicted that when Russia carried out a pullout from Kherson that ""we might imagine an uptick in domestic criticism of (Russian) President Putin."" Putin has previously received criticism from pro-war Russian military bloggers who have called for Russia to fully mobilize to boost the scale of its military operations inside of Ukraine. But given high Russian military casualty rates and supply line failures the western official said it would be difficult for Russia to carry out operations this winter especially when ""Russian morale is very low.""",,,,28
2022-11-15,https://abcnews.go.com/International/inside-natos-secretive-space-commands-critical-mission/story?id=93332144,"ABC News Exclusive: Inside NATO's Space Centre, where Allied forces keep a close eye on Russian, Chinese satellite threats","At the heart of Ramstein Air Base in Germany, a mysterious new division of military personnel is quietly working to keep America and its allies safe from hostile attacks—in space. NATO's Space Centre was created just two years ago in response to satellite threats from Russia and China; and as space becomes increasingly militarized, it is now an integral part of Allied Air Command. ABC News was given exclusive access to the facility, located at AirCom's headquarters. Below ground, inside the highly classified Situation Center, space experts from 12 NATO nations—including American Guardians from the U.S. Space Force-- are all working to keep an eye on the more than 8,000 satellites currently orbiting the Earth, and sharing their findings across the alliance. ""We look at what is the environment, what's changed since yesterday? Did something launch into orbit? Was there a fragmentation? Did a satellite hit something?"" NATO Space Center Director Lt. Col. John Patrick told ABC News Russia's war in Ukraine has made their task more important than ever as Ukraine now relies on satellites for its communications. High-resolution satellite images have also helped with surveillance-- showing everything from troop movements, to bodies lining the streets of Russian-held areas. Watch the full story on ""Prime"" on ABC News Live. Russia has responded by threatening to take out the satellites helping Ukraine. Russia's senior foreign ministry official Konstantin Vorontsov told the United Nations last month that ""quasi-civilian infrastructure may be a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike,"" and that Western civilian and commercial satellites that helped Ukraine's war efforts was ""an extremely dangerous trend,"" according to Reuters. ""Without space-based capabilities to assist, I think you would not see the successes and, really, the heroic actions and defense that you've seen from Ukraine,"" Deputy Commander of NATO's Allied Air Command, Air Marshal Johnny Stringer told ABC News. But it's not just modern warfare. Nearly every aspect of daily llifenow involves satellite technology: from financial systems, computer data, mobile phone networks, power grids and air defense. And as dependence on satellites increases, so too do the threats to Allied assets in space, NATO officials said. ""We do worry about what, you know, our competitors, true potential adversaries, may have. And we need to make sure that our capabilities at least match, if not exceed. So the importance of space is not lost on anybody,"" Stringer said. NATO officials said space conflict would likely look a lot different than what one would expect. Some of NATO's concerns have to do with space-based technology capable of targeting our satellites; such as anti-satellite weapons, signal jamming, and lasers. ""So, it'll be something that's interfering with systems. It may be nefarious, or may not be. So, we try to investigate, 'why is that receiver having an issue,' or 'what's going on with that?'"" Patrick said. In November 2021, Russia carried out an anti-satellite test, blowing up one of its own, according to U.S. officials. Some of that debris came dangerously close to the International Space Station, forcing astronauts to shelter in place and adjust their trajectory. ""So, in terms of being irresponsible, that is really high up the list. So anti-satellite launches like Russia did just compromised space for everybody,"" Stringer said. Officers however wouldn't confirm with ABC News whether NATO allies have their own offensive capabilities in space. ""What I can't do is talk specifics on that side. But what I can reiterate is the importance of making sure that our access to space is what we need it to be,"" said Stringer. China also continues to be a top concern, officials said. Beijing conducted its own ASAT test in 2007, and was recently responsible for an uncontrolled rocket re-entry, according to U.S. officials. ""We recently were monitoring a piece of a Chinese vehicle that was coming back, and it was not a controlled reentry. And so there was a lot of concern among the NATO nations to know where that reentry was going to happen, to ensure that there wasn't danger to the population or the environment,"" U.S. Space Force Lt. Col. Caitlin Diffley told ABC News. Satellites even play a key role in nuclear defense. The fear is that a threat—or perceived threat—to nuclear early-warning satellites could escalate conflicts. ""Space-based capabilities are really a vital part of how we understand nuclear capability, not just in Russia, but more globally,"" Stringer said. With space becoming increasingly important to both military and civilian operations, NATO declared in 2019 Space as a fifth operational domain—alongside Air, Land, Maritime, and Cyberspace. It also outlined its space policy; recognizing that attacks to, from, or within space could lead to the invocation of Article 5—which would compel the U.S. and its allies to a military response. ""Essentially, it would be depending on what had been done in the space environment,"" Stringer said. ""Making sure that our assets are safe and protected up in space is vital."" Asked whether he believes space conflict is inevitable, Stringer told ABC, ""I think actually, because space is such an important domain, we are going to have to aim for that potential, and that requires a raft of capability.""",,,,7
2022-11-16,https://abcnews.go.com/International/poland-missile-strike-ukrainian-air-defenses-zelenskyy-disputes/story?id=93409702,Ukrainian investigators allowed on site of missile strike in Poland as investigation continues,"Polish officials granted Ukrainian investigators access on Thursday to the site of the missile strike that hit a Polish village and killed two people earlier in the week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday disputed a claim by Poland that Tuesday's missile strike came from Ukrainian air defenses. Polish President Andrzej Duda earlier had called the incident a ""tragic accident."" ""I have no doubt that it was not our rocket,"" Zelenskyy told reporters. He said Ukraine should be a party to the investigation over the strike. But U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in an on-camera briefing Wednesday said there's ""nothing that contradicts President Duda's preliminary assessment that this explosion was most likely the result of a Ukrainian air defense missile that unfortunately landed in Poland."" After arriving at the White House early Thursday morning, President Joe Biden was asked for his reaction to Zelenskyy denying that the missile that landed in Poland was Ukrainian. ""That's not the evidence,"" Biden responded. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken evaded questions from reporters about the disconnect between Ukraine and Western powers on the origin of the missile, saying he couldn't get ahead of the investigation and that officials are still gathering information. Blinken also said allies are in regular contact with Ukraine and are sharing the information they have. ""President Zelenskyy has been in touch with the Polish president himself to clarify the facts. The chair of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council said that Ukraine is pursuing a comprehensive analysis of what happened. So we also have among all of us--Ukraine, Poland, the United States, our NATO allies, G7 Partners--a commitment to follow the facts,"" Blinken told reporters Thursday. According to a Polish official, Duda sees ""no obstacles"" for Ukrainian observers to take part in an investigation into the causes of the missile blast. The decision will ultimately depend on the agreement with other members of the NATO alliance, said Jacek Siewiera, the head of the Polish National Security Office, in an interview on radio RMF FM Thursday. The missile caused an explosion Tuesday about 10 miles from the Polish-Ukrainian border, in the farming village of Przewodow, killing the owner of a granary that was struck and a tractor driver who was transferring maize and corn to the facility, according to Poland's Law and Justice Ministry. In response to the incident, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on Tuesday called an urgent meeting with the Polish Committee of the Council of Ministers for National Security and Defense Affairs. Duda said the NATO ally also strengthened the readiness of the Polish armed forces, including air defenses. The Polish foreign minister also summoned the Russian envoy to explain the explosion near the Ukrainian border. The incident came on the same day Russian forces fired 90 missiles into Ukraine, affecting power systems, enterprises and residential buildings, according to Zelenskyy. Russia denied responsibility for the missiles that landed in Poland. After Polish authorities released images from the site, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the wreckage was elements of an S-300 anti-aircraft guided missile, which it claimed is used by the Ukrainian Air Force. Duda said that it was probably a Russian-made S-300 missile, but that there is no evidence that it was a missile launched by the Russians. Russia claimed that its precision strikes were carried out on targets within Ukrainian territory and at a distance no closer than 35 km from the Ukrainian-Polish border. The U.S. has experts on the ground assisting with the Polish-led investigation, Austin said Wednesday. There is a debris field in Poland and other forms of data are going to be available from various technical means. Officials are expected to have confirmed data as to the point of origin, point of impact and what the angle of the weapon system was the flight trajectory ""shortly,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told reporters Wednesday. After he was briefed on the incident, President Joe Biden spoke with Duda and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday. Biden expressed ""deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland"" and offered ""full U.S. support for and assistance with Poland's investigation,"" the White House said in a statement. Hours after the explosion, the White House held an emergency roundtable meeting with G-7 and NATO world leaders in Bali, Indonesia regarding the explosion in Poland. Biden met with leaders of Germany, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the EU. After the meeting, Biden told reporters it is ""unlikely"" that the missile that hit Poland was fired from Russia and said leaders would support the investigation into what happened. ""I'm going to make sure we find out exactly what happened,"" Biden said. Biden also said that recent Russian missile attacks on Ukraine have been ""totally unconscionable"" and were a point of discussion at the meeting. The White House also condemned the attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure, calling them ""barbaric."" Russia called Biden's response ""reserved and far more professional reaction"" compared to other countries. However, Austin and the White House blamed Russia on Wednesday for the ongoing conflict. ""Whatever the final conclusions may be, the world knows that Russia bears ultimate responsibility for this incident, which launched another barrage of missiles against Ukraine specifically intended to target Ukraine's civilian infrastructure,"" Austin said. -ABC News' Tom Soufi Burridge, Luis Martinez, Will Gretsky and Ben Gittleson contributed to this report.",,,,16

North Korea, which has launched at least 88 ballistic and other missiles this year, fired an ICBM that could travel 9,300 miles or longer, putting the U.S. mainland within its range, according to Japan's defense minister. Both the militaries of the United States and South Korea militaries are analyzing the data, but North Korea's latest launch -- and its second this month -- involved a missile that covered a distance of 620 miles, according to Japanese and South Korean officials. The missile had an altitude of 3,700 miles and flew for 69 minutes before it landed about 130 miles off Hokkaido in northern Japan, authorities confirmed. The commander of the 35th Fighter Wing at the Misawa Air Base located in northern Japan ordered everyone, including service personnel and staff, at the base to seek cover for 23 minutes following the missile launch. ""At this time, there are no additional indications or warnings of an immediate threat to Misawa Air Base,"" said Commander Michael Richard who issued a seek cover order at 10:33 a.m. as a precautionary measure. President Joe Biden was briefed on the situation and will continue close consultation with allies, according to a statement released from the White House overnight. ""This conduct by North Korea most recently is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Resolution. It destabilizes security in the region and unnecessarily raises tensions,"" said Vice President Kamala Harris, who is in Bangkok attending the Asia-Pacific Cooperative forum (APEC). ""We strongly condemn these actions, and we again call for North Korea to stop further unlawful, destabilizing acts. On behalf of the United States, I reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our Indo-Pacific Alliances. Together the countries represented here will continue to urge North Korea to commit to serious and sustained diplomacy.""",,,,1

The Kremlin, meanwhile, claims the brief video clips, which were circulated widely online, show the troops carrying out an execution and is calling for an international investigation. Ukraine's announcement comes after the U.S. State Department's top war crimes adviser said Monday that U.S. officials were aware of the footage, and underscored that both Moscow and Kyiv are bound to follow the same international law on the battlefield. ""We're obviously tracking that quite closely,"" Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack said of the incident, which took place earlier this month in the Luhansk region of Ukraine. ""It's really important to emphasize that the laws of war apply to all parties equally, both the aggressor state and the defender state,"" she continued. ""But when it comes to the war in Ukraine, that's really where the equivalency ends. When we're looking at the sheer scale of criminality exhibited by Russian forces, it's enormous compared to the allegations that we have seen against Ukrainian forces."" That assessment is supported by multiple international efforts to document war crimes and other atrocities committed in the course of the conflict.

DiCarlo reported in September that the body's independent commission was ""struck by the large number of executions and other violations carried out by Russian forces"" while investigators documented only two incidents of Ukrainian fighters mistreated Russian soldiers. Van Schaack said how each country's government handles allegations against its service members is also vastly different. ""Russia inevitably responds with propaganda, denial, myths and disinformation -- whereas Ukrainian authorities have generally acknowledged abuses and have denounced, and have pledged to investigate them,"" she said. ""And so we would urge Ukraine to continue to abide by international obligations in this conflict. And we continue to reiterate the importance that all parties to the conflict must abide by international law or face the consequences."" Though the videos, which have been verified by the New York Times, depict a slice of the war's brutal reality, the circumstances surrounding the incident are unclear. The Russian soldiers appear to have opened fire while surrendering, but the actual killings or the events leading up to them are not shown, leaving room for the possibility that the Ukrainian fighters could have acted in self-defense. While investigating potential crimes on the battlefield is a difficult task, Van Schaack spoke to the challenges that lie ahead for the international justice system once a conviction is reached, acknowledging that Russian bad actors could likely find refuge in their country for years to come -- but perhaps not indefinitely. ""If Russian perpetrators remain in Russia, and absent any kind of political transformation there, it will be difficult to move forward,"" she said. ""But what we have seen in prior conflicts is that perpetrators do inevitably travel, particularly as time passes--they want to visit family, they have other reasons to leave."" But Van Schaack also expressed optimism that the justice would one day reach the highest levels of power in the Kremlin, and that even Russia's President Vladimir Putin might be held accountable for atrocities committed during the invasion. ""Superiors can be held liable for the acts of their subordinates,"" she said, adding that while prosecutors will follow the evidence, investigators were documenting what appeared to be ""systemic acts"" that transcended rank and file members of Russia's military. ""It's very hard to imagine how many crimes could be committed without responsibility going all the way up the chain of command,"" Van Schaack said.",,,,13
2022-11-23,https://abcnews.go.com/International/newborn-killed-after-missile-strikes-ukraine-maternity-ward/story?id=93847505,Newborn killed in missile strike on Ukrainian maternity ward,"KYIV and LONDON -- A newborn baby was killed in an attack on a hospital in the town of Vilniansk in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine, overnight Tuesday, the local mayor told ABC News. The attack on the maternity hospital came before a wave of Russian strikes across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv, which struck residential areas and infrastructure. The strikes have led to significant power outages, including in neighboring Moldova, as Russia continues to strike Ukraine's power grid ahead of what experts warn will be a punishing winte The baby boy, named Kyrylo Kamyanskyi, was born two days ago. His mother, Maria, survived the attack. ""She is shocked and asked to take her home,"" Natalia Musienko, the mayor of the city told ABC. ""It's a horrible attack,"" she said, while taking shelter from Russian missiles. ""Our hearts are overwhelmed with grief,"" Oleksandr Starukh, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region posted on his Telegram channel. According to the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, Oleg Buriak, the Russian forces launched S-300 missiles around 2 a.m. local time. Two of those missiles hit the maternity ward at the Vilniansk hospital and a nearby clinic. Both facilities have been completely destroyed, officials said. At the time of the attack, five people were in the buildings. According to the mayor, one doctor, pulled from the rubble, suffered burns but is in a stable condition. Two other doctors trapped in the building were later rescued, and about 60 other hospital staffers were evacuated. In total, three people have been killed, and six people injured. ""We are now trying to save some of the expensive equipment from the maternity ward,"" Musienko said. ""But, of course, the biggest loss is the death of a baby. Human lives are the most precious. we can't return them."" The attack on the hospital came just a week after a deadly Russian strike on a residential building in Vilniansk that killed 11 people, including children. This week, Dr. Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization's regional director for Europe told an audience in Kyiv that his organization had so far verified 703 attacks on health centers since the war -- attacks that are in breach of international law. ""Continued attacks on health and energy infrastructure mean hundreds of hospitals and health care facilities are no longer fully operational - lacking fuel, water and electricity to meet basic needs,"" he said. And on Wednesday, the European Parliament voted to recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism in response to its ""brutal war of aggression in Ukraine."" The EU cannot officially designate states as sponsors of terrorism, but the resolution calls for the bloc to adopt a legal framework to formally designate Russia, which would restrict diplomatic relations.",,,,15
2022-11-28,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-sign-memo-combat-conflict-related-sexual-violence/story?id=94058806,Biden to sign memo to combat conflict-related sexual violence,"President Joe Biden is poised to sign a memorandum boosting the U.S. government's opposition to conflict-related sexual violence in an effort to further combat rape as a weapon of war. Biden is expected to sign the memo, which will clarify that an act of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) may constitute a serious human rights abuse, on Monday, according to the White House. The memo is intended to give CRSV an ""equal consideration alongside other serious human rights abuses in developing designations under existing sanctions authorities,"" the White House said. It also directs the State and Treasury departments, as well as other federal agencies, to use additional tools to hold CRSV offenders accountable. Biden is releasing the presidential memorandum in conjunction with the United Kingdom's international ministerial conference on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict, ""at a time when CRSV persists with impunity around the world, including in Russian-occupied Ukraine and Ethiopia,"" the White House said A report released by the United Nations in October said that Russian troops have committed war crimes, including rape and sexual violence, against Ukrainian civilians. ""You only need to see a snapshot from what is happening in Ukraine to know how important this presidential memorandum can be in focusing on accountability for conflict related sexual violence,"" a senior Biden administration official said on a call with reporters Sunday. ""It will provide guidance and direction to facilitate targeting the perpetrators of these horrendous acts and bringing them to justice."" The United Nations estimates that 10 to 20 CRSV cases go undocumented for each one reported in connection with a conflict. A 2021 report by the U.N. Secretary-General found 3,293 U.N.-verified CRSV cases across 18 countries -- 97% of which were targeted toward women and girls. That number was about 800 more than what was verified by the U.N. in 2020. The memorandum pledges an additional $400,000, on top of the $1.75 million annual contribution, toward the Office of the U.N. Special Representative to the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, as well as an additional $5.5 million over the next two years to help the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor investigate and document acts of CRSV. The memo also aims to deliver services and support for survivors of gender-based violence in emergency and conflict settings, as well as increase access to justice, protection, and services to survivors of gender-based violence, according to the White House. ""Together with today's Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Accountability for Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, these initiatives signal President Biden's ongoing commitment to confront gender-based violence -- in all of its forms -- around the world,"" the White House said.

The Wildcat Sanctuary in Sandstone, Minnesota, welcomed four lion cubs, Taras, Stefania, Lesya and Prada, on Wednesday just months after they were found in a Kyiv breeding center in the war-torn country, the International Fund for Animal Welfare said. The cubs, roughly five months old, survived drone attacks and bombings and were transported to Poland in October to escape the dangers, according to the IFAW. They were flown to the U.S. in wooden crates explicitly designed for them, driven eight hours to the sanctuary and immediately unloaded into a warm indoor enclosure with plenty of food, water and toys, according to the non-profit. ""These cubs have endured more in their short lives than any animal should,"" Meredith Whitney, the wildlife rescue program manager at the IFAW, said in a statement. At the time of their rescue, zoos and sanctuaries in Europe didn't have the capacity to take the cubs in, the IFAW said. Dr. Andrew Kushnir, a veterinarian working with IFAW, has been taking care of the cubs since they arrived in Poland and accompanied them on their flight to the United States. ""During several drone attacks and airstrikes, he prepared their specialized milk formula every three hours, cleaned up their enclosure and made sure they had a warm place to sleep. On nights when the power went out, he even used his arms and legs to warm their milk bottles,"" the IFAW said in a statement. Administrators at the Wildcat Sanctuary said their habitat is specially designed for the cubs and other big cats to live and thrive. ""They have a custom, open space to explore and soft grass or hay to rest their tired bodies on,"" Tammy Thies, the founder and executive director of the Wildcat Sanctuary, said in a statement.",,,,8
2022-12-05,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-drone-attack-hits-2-military-bases-inside/story?id=94515155,Ukraine drone attack hits 2 military bases deep inside Russia,"Explosions that struck two military airbases deep inside Russia on Monday were the result of drone attacks launched by Ukraine, according to Russian and Ukrainian officials, in what appeared to be an audacious attempt to hit the long-range bombers Russia has used to devastate Ukraine’s power grid. Russia’s defense ministry on Monday confirmed the attacks on the bases that are located hundreds of miles from the frontline, saying two of its aircraft were damaged and three military personnel killed. The unprecedented strikes were the first time Ukraine has hit so far into Russia, targeting bases that had generally been thought of as untouchable, according to military experts. A senior Ukrainian official from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s circle, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told ABC News that Ukrainian drones had struck the Russian military airfields Monday. Russian media reported an explosion early Monday morning at the Engels-2 airbase in the Saratov region in southern Russia, a key airfield that houses Tu-95 and Tu-60 nuclear-capable bombers. Another explosion was reported at the Dyagilevo military airbase in Ryazan, a city less than 150 miles from Moscow and also houses Tu-95 bombers. Russian state media initially reported that a fuel tanker exploded at the base, killing three people and wounding at least five others. Russian officials initially avoided commenting on the explosions but on Monday evening, Russia’s defense ministry said ""Soviet-made"" Ukrainian drones had caused it. But the ministry said Russian air defenses had shot down the drones and the damage was caused by their wreckage landing on the airfields. Hours after the attacks, Russia launched a new barrage of missile strikes against Ukraine, including from strategic bombers, again targeting its energy infrastructure. Ukraine’s air force claimed it shot down 60 of 70 Russian cruise missiles, but the strikes left several regions partially without power. Zelenskyy said the Russian attacks had also killed four people Monday. Russia’s defense ministry claimed the drone attacks on its airbases had failed to disrupt the planned strikes, claiming they had destroyed 17 targets. The airbase explosions, nonetheless, were a significant shift, marking the first time Ukraine has sought to hit the bombers that for months have regularly attacked its civilian infrastructure with impunity and recently sought to bring its energy grid to its knees. The Russian bombers usually launch cruise missiles from outside Ukraine’s borders, well beyond the reach of its air defenses, experts said. Satellite images from the company Maxar taken over the two days before Monday’s attacks showed roughly two dozen Russian bombers parked at the Engels-2 base. The Russian defense ministry said two of its aircraft had suffered ""superficial"" damage in the blasts. Video circulating on Russian social media appeared to show two Tu-22 bombers at the Dyagilevo base with damage to their tail ends, standing next to a burned out fuel truck. Russian pro-war commentators reacted with fury to the attacks, calling it a humiliation that the country’s nuclear airbases were vulnerable to conventional drones and blaming it on negligence among commanders. A top advisor to Zelenskyy posted a cryptic comment on Twitter mocking Russia over the explosions. ""The Earth is round – discovery made by Galileo. Astronomy was not studied in Kremlin, giving preference to court astrologers,"" wrote Mykhailo Podolyak, the presidential adviser. ""If it was, they would know: if something is launched into other countries’ airspace, sooner or later unknown flying objects will return to departure point.""",,,,18
2022-12-12,https://abcnews.go.com/US/air-force-successfully-tests-hypersonic-missile-5-times/story?id=95076398,US catching up to China and Russia with latest hypersonic missile test,"The Air Force last week successfully tested a hypersonic AGM-183A missile off the coast of southern California -- striking a target after reaching more than five times the speed of sound -- in a sign that U.S. weapons are catching up to similar Chinese and Russian capabilities. The missile was launched from a B-52H bomber on Friday. It's the first test of a missile prototype that the Air Force hopes will become its first hypersonic missile. Unlike two previous airborne tests of the missile's booster system that reached hypersonic speeds, Friday's test, which was announced by the Air Force on Monday, was of a full prototype with an attached warhead that struck a target after reaching hypersonic speeds. Hypersonic weapons are designed to fly at lower altitudes than ballistic missiles while still striking at long-range targets. The U.S. has been behind Russia and China in developing such weapons, as both countries' militaries have already fielded hypersonic systems. The missile the Air Force is developing is known as both the AGM-183A and the ARRW, which stands for air-launched rapid response weapon, and is intended to be fired from the air. The test of a full prototype operational missile, or what the Air Force calls an ""all-up-round"" test, was similar to the two previous booster tests in that the prototype was released from a B-52 bomber flying off the coast of southern California. ""The ARRW team successfully designed and tested an air-launched hypersonic missile in five years,"" Air Force Brig. Gen. Jason Bartolomei, the Armament Directorate Program's executive officer, said in a statement. ""I am immensely proud of the tenacity and dedication this team has shown to provide a vital capability to our warfighter."" The 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base in California executed the ARRW test flight. In addition to the air-launched hypersonic missile that the Air Force is working on, the military is also developing land-launched hypersonic weapons. While seen as a long-distance targeting option, Russia has used some of its air-launched hypersonic missiles to strike inside Ukraine, a relatively short distance compared to its capability. These attacks have been seen as Russia trying to demonstrate its advanced military technologies -- or potentially out of need as its stock of precision-guided missiles has decreased significantly since its invasion began in February. Though China and Russia have developed hypersonic missile systems like the ones the U.S. is working on, the term hypersonic has also been used to describe other weapons systems that operate differently. That was the case in 2021 when it was disclosed that China had tested a system known as a fractional orbital bombardment system that could potentially carry a conventional or nuclear warhead anywhere in the world at hypersonic speeds. In that test, China launched a rocket that carried a maneuverable glide vehicle that orbited the earth before reentering the atmosphere and traveling at a hypersonic speed toward a target.",,,,1
2022-12-14,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-patriot-missiles-game-changer-ukraine/story?id=95222548,Will US Patriot missiles really be a game changer in Ukraine?,"If the United States approves the transfer of Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine will they really be the game changer that Ukrainian officials expect them to be? And how quickly could they actually get to the battlefield? Those are some of the questions being raised after U.S. officials have confirmed that the Pentagon has prepared plans to transfer Patriot batteries to Ukraine if approved by President Joe Biden, a possibility that could happen as early as this week. The air defense system can target ballistic and cruise missiles as well as manned and unmanned aircraft with a maximum range of 100 miles, depending on the system possibly given to Ukraine. A typical Patriot battery includes a radar system, a power generation supply, and a command and control station connected to several launch stations. With its sophisticated radar system it will be able to engage eight targets at a time. The transfer of the advanced air defense system is something Ukrainian officials have been demanding since shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. But U.S. officials have not been open to that possibility until recently out of concern over how Russia might react to their presence in Ukraine as well as over what might be learned about the missile's technology if a missile or its components were to fall into Russian hands. The U.S. and its partners have resupplied Ukraine's Soviet-era S-300 air defense missiles and provided Western air defense systems such as shoulder-fired Stinger missiles and other larger air defense systems like the NASAM, jointly produced by the U.S. and Norway. But it is the Patriot missile that Ukrainians have remained focused on specifically after Russian began using missile and one-way drone barrages targeting Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, causing electricity blackouts throughout much of the country. Reacting to the news that the U.S. is likely to supply Patriot air defense missile systems to Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian Defense official told ABC News that they will be ""a game changer,"" describing them as ""one of the best systems in the world"". The official added that Ukraine's access to the missiles will ""drastically increase our capacity to defend our skies from Russian strikes."" ""The decision to provide Ukraine with Patriot surface-to-air missile systems was the right one,"" said Mick Mulroy, a former assistant and an ABC News contributor. U.S. officials believe that once the Patriot transfer is approved a training program for Ukrainian troops could begin in Germany in a matter of weeks. But any training program will have to be much shorter than the training given to American soldiers that requires a minimum of five months of training followed by more advanced training. ""The Ukrainian soldiers have proven they are more than capable of learning complex US systems and will also learn this one,"" said Mulroy. Even with an accelerated training program it could be sometime in early 2023 before a system is operational in Ukraine. Patriot missiles first became wide-known during the 1991 Gulf War when they successfully intercepted most Iraqi missile attacks on U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and parallel attacks on Israel. But there have been many technological upgrades to Patriots since then and it remains to be seen which version of the missile Ukraine would receive. ""Whether this becomes a game changing technology or not will depend on how many of these missile systems the U.S. provides and how many missiles,"" said Steve Ganyard, an ABC News contributor. ""But it will certainly go a long way to help plug those gaps in the air defense system that have allowed Russia to attack critical infrastructure like the electrical grids and the cities of Ukraine,"" he added.",,,,11

2022-12-20,https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy/story?id=83085078,What to know about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,"Seven years ago, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was most famous for bringing laughs on Ukrainian TV by portraying an overwhelmed but hard-working president trying to fight corruption. Today, the 44-year-old's actions as the real Ukrainian president standing up against Russian President Vladimir Putin in the face of a deadly and ongoing war have earned him the respect of global leaders. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" the president said in a televised speech on the first day of the war. Zelenskyy's life and path have been anything but typical compared to other international leaders, and he has faced a seemingly unending series of crises since taking office. Zelenskyy, who is married and has two children, graduated from the Kyiv National Economic University in 2000 with a law degree, but he decided to pursue a different career. He formed the comedy troupe Kvartal 95 with other actors in 1997 and in 2003 the group began producing television programs. In 2015, Zelenskyy began starring in the role that would set him on the path to the presidency. In the show ""Servant of the People,"" he played Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko, a school teacher who wakes up to find that a rant he made against corrupt politicians went viral and catapulted him to the presidency. Holoborodko was often portrayed as being in over his head but willing to fight corruption. The show was so popular that it led to Kvartal 95 creating a political party in its name. In 2018, Zelenskyy abruptly moved into real politics and announced his candidacy for president under the Servant of the People party. During his campaign, he continued touring with his troupe and mocked his opponents in stand-up routines. Zelenskyy also took to social media to promote his campaign and platform. His political persona was similar to his TV character as he vowed to crack down on corruption and take on Ukraine's oligarchs. He went on to win the election in a landslide, taking over 73% of the vote, after running on a platform to end the war with Russia and its separatist proxies in eastern Ukraine. He was inaugurated in May 2019. Two months later, Zelenskyy would become entangled in a major U.S. political scandal involving then-President Donald Trump. During a July 2019 phone call between the two leaders, Trump pressured Zelenskyy to work with Rudy Giuliani and then-Attorney General William Barr to investigate Joe Biden, who was running against Trump in the presidential election, and his son Hunter Biden, according to a White House memorandum about the phone call. Trump allegedly withheld $400 million in congressional aid to Ukraine when Ukrainian officials didn't comply. Trump denied any wrongdoing, repeatedly saying it was a ""perfect call,"" and a subsequent congressional investigation led to Trump's impeachment later that year. The Republican-controlled Senate acquitted him in February 2020. Zelenskyy has had a more amicable relationship with Biden even before the American president became his crucial backer in the conflict with Russia, visiting the White House in August 2021. When he came to office, Zelenskyy also promised to find a peaceful way to resolve the eight-year conflict in eastern Ukraine with the Russian-controlled separatists there. He initially tried to engage with Putin diplomatically but was treated coldly by the Russian leader, who refused to meet or speak with Zelenskyy for months. In the year before the war, under pressure politically during the COVID-19 crisis, Zelenskyy had taken a harder line against pro-Russian political factions in Ukraine, including Viktor Medvedchuk, known as Putin's man in Ukraine. Russia's military buildup against Ukraine began around the same time Zelenskyy moved to sanction Medvedchuk and TV stations linked to him. He has denied all allegations by Putin and Russian-controlled separatists that he provoked the war and made an impassioned plea in Russian on Feb. 23 for that country's people to reject the aggression. ""We don't need war. Not a cold one, nor a hot one, nor a hybrid one,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I know that Russian TV won't show my speech. But citizens of Russia need to see it. They need to see the truth. The truth is you need to stop before it's too late."" Since Russia's invasion, Zelenskyy has remained in the country, refusing to leave the capital and in the early days of the war rebuffing U.S. offers to help him evacuate. As Russian troops closed in on Kyiv, Zelenskyy began making video addresses, often from the street in front of the presidential office, becoming an icon of defiance for his people. He has given many video addresses since, providing updates on the fighting as well as rallying cries. Zelenskyy's profile grew over the course of the war as did his connections with other world leaders. Zelenskyy has spoken by video-link to the parliaments of almost every Western country, persuading them to provide more military and political support for Ukraine. His message has been consistent, telling European countries not to fear Russia, sometimes chastising those seen as too hesitant in providing aid. And even as the war has continued on and his country continues to see death and destruction from Russian forces, Zelenskyy's resolve and steadfast opposition to Putin remained visible in his video addresses. During the summer of 2022, he pledged to liberate all of Ukraine's territory seized by Russia, something that has come to look far more plausible amid successful Ukrainian counteroffensives that have reclaimed swaths of territory in Ukraine's northeast. In an interview with ABC's ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir in August, Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to step up and help reclaim their territory. ""This task is difficult and it doesn't only depend on us, but I'm sure that is what will happen,"" he told Muir from the presidential office in Kyiv. ""It's only a matter of time."" Zelenskyy has toured the reclaimed areas and witnessed the damage and violence left behind by Russian forces. Zelenskyy addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 28 via a virtual presentation from Ukraine and echoed this message to the world stage. During his speech, he continued to criticize Russia over the violence against his country and the hundreds of lives that were destroyed by the invasion. ""A crime has been committed against Ukraine, and we demand just punishment,"" he said. ABC News' Conor Finnegan contributed to this report.",,,,25
2022-12-21,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-send-ukraine-patriot-missile-systems-precision-guided/story?id=95624925,US to send Ukraine Patriot missile system and precision-guided bomb technology,"The U.S. is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will provide Ukraine with a Patriot missile defense system and precision bomb kits that will turn dumb bombs into smart bombs guided by GPS coordinates toward their targets, according to U.S. officials. The inclusion of both weapons systems in the new U.S. military aid package is significant because it will give Ukraine an advanced system to protect its cities from Russian air strikes and will give its air force a new offensive capability. Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, the United States has provided more than $19 billion in military aid to Ukraine. The transfer of the advanced air defense system is something Ukrainian officials have been demanding since shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. It can target ballistic and cruise missiles as well as manned and unmanned aircraft with a maximum range of 100 miles, depending on the system possibly given to Ukraine. But U.S. officials have not been open to that possibility until recently out of concern over how Russia might react to their presence in Ukraine as well as over what might be learned about the missile's technology if a missile or its components were to fall into Russian hands. The aid package will also include Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) kits that will convert ""dumb"" bombs into precision guided weapons that use GPS coordinates to strike a target. ""Dumb bombs"" is the name used to describe gravity bombs without guidance systems that are dropped directly over a target and are notoriously imprecise. JDAM kits contain equipment that are attached to the front and back of a bomb to guide a bomb to a precise target using GPS coordinates. Ukraine's air force has been carrying out limited flight operations throughout the 10-month war and presumably the bomb kits will give it a new offensive capability. It is unclear when both systems will arrive in Ukraine. U.S. officials believe that, once the Patriot transfer is approved, a training program for Ukrainian troops could begin in Germany in a matter of weeks. But any training program will have to be much shorter than the training given to American soldiers that requires a minimum of five months of training followed by more advanced training.

2022-12-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyys-emotional-call-american-resolve-analysis/story?id=95699194,Zelenskyy's emotional call for American resolve: ANALYSIS,"The symbolism was unmistakable -- the American vice president and House speaker holding up before both chambers of Congress the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag. Just one day before, it had been signed by Ukrainian soldiers on the frontlines and given to their president, for him to deliver in person to a rousing ovation. The gesture capped a hurried, historic visit to Washington by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- his first out of Ukraine since Russia's invasion 300 days prior -- itself a potent symbol that despite relentless Russian attacks, his country has held on, in no small part thanks to unprecedented U.S. and Western support. That support brought Zelenskyy to a Washington on the verge of change -- with Republicans set to take control of the House in a matter of weeks, and some vocal members of the incoming majority opposing more massive U.S. aid. During his two-plus hours of meetings with President Joe Biden at the White House and his visit to Capitol Hill, Zelenskyy's mission was three-fold -- to express his country's gratitude, to reassure aid was not only worth it, but well-spent, and to ask for more. ""Your money is not charity. It's an investment in the global security and democracy we handle in the most responsible way,"" he said to applause -- adding while Russia ""could stop its aggression"" whenever it wanted, Congress's aid ""can speed up our victory,"" too. There were even some laughs in the chamber when he said at another point, ""We have artillery, yes. Thank you. We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really."" The comedian and TV star-turned politician mixed that humor with strength, adding emotional pleas and historical references to America's own wars for freedom -- a path he exalted and then compared to Ukraine's, as he repeatedly tied the two countries' fates together. ""Next year will be a turning point, I know it -- the point when Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values,"" he said to applause. Fresh from the frontline city Bakhmut, Zelenskyy said the battle there would be Ukraine's Battle of Saratoga, the critical U.S. victory during the American Revolutionary War that turned the tide against the British. And he compared the bitter December fighting in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region to the effort just underway 78 years ago in the Battle of the Bulge, when U.S. and Allied forces beat back Nazi Germany's last offensive and pushed onward to V-E Day. ""We do not complain. We do not judge and compare whose life is easier. Your well-being is the product of your national security, the result of your struggle for independence and your many victories. We Ukrainians will also go through our war of independence and freedom with dignity and success,"" he added. Beyond American patriotism, Zelenskyy even appealed to partisan policy favorites -- highlighting Russia's alliance with Iran, a frequent Republican foe, and accusing Tehran of being Moscow's ""ally in this genocidal policy."" But overwhelmingly, the speech was a hand extended to both sides -- both parties, both chambers, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Zelenskyy thanked the American people ""who waved our national flags, who acted to help"" and cried out, ""May God forever bless the United States of America."" Those exhortations have an end goal. Ukrainians are suffering through a brutal winter made worse by Russia's assault on its energy grid -- leaving millions without electricity, heat, and running water. U.S. and Ukrainian officials believe it is a deliberate Russian strategy to crush the country into submission while battle lines are largely stagnant in the winter cold. ""Russia is using winter as a weapon, freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another. It's the latest example of the outrageous atrocities the Russian forces are committing against innocent Ukrainian civilians, children and their families,"" Biden said during a joint news conference -- adding the U.S. and its allies are providing equipment to help Ukraine make emergency repairs to and strengthen the stability of its electrical grid. Zelenskyy implored Congress to do more -- tighten U.S. sanctions on Russia, pursue justice for war crimes committed by Russian troops, and of course, provide more military aid. Congress's decisions here ""can save millions of people. So let these decisions be taken,"" he said, adding to one of 18 standing ovations, ""We stand, we fight, and we will win because we are united -- Ukraine, America, and the entire free world."" But in the immediate aftermath of his remarks, it was unclear if Zelenskyy got more than the U.S. flag flown over the Capitol that day that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi presented to him after his speech. Negotiations over a massive $1.7 trillion government spending bill, which includes a $45 billion package for Ukraine, stalled shortly afterwards. Senators hit a major roadblock when Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, authored an amendment to reinstate Title 42, the public health policy first implemented by former President Donald Trump that cites the COVID-19 pandemic to block most migrants from claiming asylum at the southern border. With just hours until a possible government shutdown Friday at midnight, federal funding -- including this tranche of aid, a critical lifeline meant to last several more months -- is now endangered. What Zelenskyy did get may also not be enough. Earlier in the day, the Biden administration announced a $1.85 billion military package that for the first time included a Patriot missile defense system and so-called smart bomb kits -- both, more advanced weaponry that Zelenskyy's forces had long asked for. But Pentagon officials said the U.S. would have to first train Ukrainian troops in a third country on the Patriot missile battery, one of the world's most advanced air defense systems, and that would take ""several months."" While it's newer and longer-range than what's in Ukraine's arsenal now, it's also just one battery. Zelenskyy himself said alongside Biden that Ukraine ""would like to get more Patriots"" -- prompting the U.S. president to laugh and add, ""We're working on it."" It's not just Patriots Ukraine wants either. During his remarks to Congress, Zelenskyy also threw one veiled shot at the White House, telling lawmakers, ""Ukraine never asked American soldiers to fight on our land instead of us. I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves."" Since Russia first invaded, U.S. officials have said they will not provide Ukraine either tanks or warplanes. Transferring Polish fighter jets to Ukraine, for example, could be ""mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,"" as John Kirby, then the Pentagon spokesperson, said in March. But some analysts argue that by limiting what weapons they are willing to send, the U.S. and its NATO allies are handicapping Ukraine and may ultimately be dooming it to fail against a Russian adversary that has done nothing but escalate. ""The situation on the ground is relatively static, but every day we see Russia attack the electrical grid with relative impunity and the pain inflicted on civilians by taking out Ukraine's electricity -- all because Ukraine's defense is limited by what the U.S. and NATO are providing,"" said retired Col. Steve Ganyard, a former senior Defense and State Department official. ""It's obviously a political decision, but by withholding longer-range weapons, the U.S. and NATO bear some degree of responsibility for the dark, cold reality in Ukraine this winter,"" added Ganyard, an ABC News contributor, arguing Patriots and smart bombs ""won't change that that much, or anytime soon."" Right after his speech, Zelenskyy left for home, traveling far from the ebullient environment on Capitol Hill to the stark reality on the ground in Ukraine. It seems clear Ukraine may not have survived this long without U.S. and allied aid, but the question Zelenskyy left lingering now is whether the U.S. is providing it enough to help Kyiv win.",,,,25
2022-12-23,https://abcnews.go.com/International/christmas-convoy-delivers-equipment-humanitarian-supplies-kyiv/story?id=95661451,"'Christmas Convoy' delivers equipment, humanitarian supplies to Kyiv","NATO and U.S. veterans drove over $2 million worth of much needed equipment and humanitarian supplies into the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv last Friday, calling it a “Christmas Convoy.” The convoy, led by veterans from the U.S., U.K., Poland and Australia, consisted of more than 50 cars and military-ready light trucks carrying 75 energy generators, 250 wood burning stoves and other critical winter equipment. At the moment, more than half of Kyiv is without power – a critical blow as temperatures in the city have creeped below freezing. “Hearing that some of them are experiencing hypothermia and even some deaths just from this cold weather, I decided to go as soon as I got the invitation,” said U.S. veteran Earl Granville. “I know firsthand the power of what a community can do – and with the help of some charity, people can move mountains.” Granville served nine years with the Pennsylvania Army National Guard and lost his leg during his third tour in Afghanistan. He was one of several amputees who joined the convoy. U.S. Army veteran Taylor Harter decided to bring prosthetics to donate to injured Ukrainians in addition to the supplies he helped escort into the city. “The last time I was in a war zone I was carried out on a stretcher, so being able to do this meant a lot,” said Harter, an amputee who lost his leg. “I’m very happy the prosthetics and supplies I donated can be put to use by the guys and help get them back on their feet,” said Harter. Several organizations helped orchestrate the Christmas Convoy, including Tactivate – a nonprofit disaster response organization that’s been providing a wide array of equipment to Ukraine since the start of the war. Another key figure behind the convoy was Joe De Sena, the CEO and founder of Spartan Race endurance events, one of the world’s premier obstacle course races. “This humanitarian mission is showing the rest of the world that when a bully picks on any of us, they’re picking on all of us,” said De Sena. “The Spartan Race community is 10 million strong and spans 50 countries – this is a show of our solidarity with the people of Ukraine.” When asked if he worried about the risks that come with driving a humanitarian convoy through a war zone, De Sena – who was there himself – responded: “Have you seen the name of our company?” “We have a massive community all around the world,” De Sena said regarding how the convoy came to fruition. “We asked some of our veterans and – as you can see – a bunch raised their hands.” U.S. Army veteran Kemar Ebanks drove one of the vehicles departing from Rzeszow in Poland during the two-day journey to Kyiv. “We want to show that veterans understand the hardships the people of Ukraine are enduring and we are doing whatever we can to help in the fight for freedom,” said Ebanks, who hails from Fayetteville, North Carolina. “At Christmas time, when we celebrate good will between people, we wanted to give real support on the ground to the Ukrainian people – this is what the spirit of Christmas means to us.”",,,,7
