2022-11-06,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-brutality-donetsk/,"Ukraine warns of Russian ""brutality"" in contested eastern region","Kyiv, Ukraine — Russian forces are stepping up their strikes in a fiercely contested region of eastern Ukraine, worsening the already tough conditions for residents and the defending army following Moscow's illegal annexation and declaration of martial law in Donetsk province, Ukrainian authorities said. The attacks have almost completely destroyed the power plants that serve the city of Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the region's Ukrainian governor, said. Shelling killed one civilians and wounded three, he reported late Saturday. ""The destruction is daily, if not hourly,"" Kyrylenko said in a state television interview. Moscow-backed separatists controlled part of Donetsk for nearly eight years before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Protecting the separatists' self-proclaimed republic there was one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's justifications for the invasion, and his troops have spent months trying to capture the entire province. While Russia's ""greatest brutality"" was focused in the Donetsk region, ""constant fighting"" continued elsewhere along the front line that stretches more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Between Saturday and Sunday, Russia's launched four missiles and 19 airstrikes impacting more than 35 villages in seven regions, from Chernihiv and Kharkiv in the northeast to Kherson and Mykolaiv in the south, according to the president's office. Russia has focused on striking energy infrastructure over the last month, causing power shortages and rolling outages across the country. The capital, Kyiv, was scheduled to have hourly blackouts rotating Sunday in various parts of the city of some 3 million and the surrounding region. Rolling blackouts also were planned in the Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava regions, Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said in a Telegram post. More positive news was the re-connection of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to Ukraine's power grid, local media reported Sunday. Europe's largest nuclear plant needs electricity to maintain vital cooling system, but it had been running on emergency diesel generators since Russian shelling severed its outside connections. In the Donetsk city of Bakhmut, some 15,000 remaining residents were living under daily shelling and without water or power, according to local media. The city has been under attack for months, but the bombardment picked up after Russian forces experienced setbacks during Ukrainian counteroffensives in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. In Kharkiv, officials are working to identify bodies found in mass graves after the Russians withdrew, Dmytro Chubenko, a spokesperson for the regional prosecutor's office, said in an interview with local media. DNA samples have been collected from 450 bodies discovered in a mass grave in the city of Izium, but the samples need to be matched with relatives and so far only 80 people have participated, he said.",0.0,0.0,0.0,5
2022-11-05,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/power-blackouts-announced-across-ukraine-amid-russian-shelling/,Power blackouts announced across Ukraine amid Russian shelling,"KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine's state electricity operator on Saturday announced regular scheduled blackouts in Kyiv and seven other regions of the country in the aftermath of Russia's devastating strikes on energy infrastructure. The move comes as Russian forces continue to pound Ukrainian cities and villages with missiles and drones, inflicting damage on power plants, water supplies and other civilian targets, in a grinding war that is nearing its nine-month mark. Russia has denied that the drones it has used in Ukraine came from Iran, but the Islamic Republic's foreign minister on Saturday for the first time acknowledged supplying Moscow with ""a limited number"" of drones before the invasion. Hossein Amirabdollahian claimed, however, that Tehran didn't know if its drones were used against Ukraine and stated Iran's commitment to stopping the conflict. Ukrenergo, the sole operator of Ukraine's high-voltage transmission lines, said in an online statement Saturday that scheduled blackouts will take place in the capital and the greater Kyiv region, as well as several regions around it — Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Poltava and Kharkiv. The outages for ""certain groups of consumers"" will occur daily ""in accordance with a specific schedule drawn up by operators of distribution networks for each region,"" the statement said. The outages are expected to last for six and more hours each day. Ukraine has been grappling with power outages and disruption of water supplies since Russia started unleashing massive barrages of missile and drone strikes on the country's energy infrastructure last month. Moscow has said those came in response to what it alleged were Ukrainian attacks on Crimea, the region that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Ukraine has denied those allegations. Meanwhile, Russian shelling of Ukrainian regions continued into the early hours of Saturday. About 40 shells were fired overnight at the city of Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said on Telegram. The Russian forces targeted the city and the areas around it from heavy artillery. Two fires broke out, and more than a dozen of residential and utility buildings, as well as a gas pipeline, were damaged, the official said. Elsewhere in the region, the Ukrainian forces shot down a drone and another projectile, according to Reznichenko. In the southern Mykolaiv region, the overnight shelling of rural areas damaged several houses, but didn't cause any casualties, Mykolaiv Gov. Vitali Kim said on Telegram. The Russian forces also fired missiles at the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, which has been illegally annexed by Moscow and large parts of which remain occupied. According to regional Gov. Oleksandr Starukh, the attack took place shortly after midnight and damaged buildings of three businesses, as well as a number of cars. In the eastern Donetsk region, also annexed and partially occupied by Russia, eight cities and villages have been shelled, including Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Porkovsk. According to Ukraine's presidential office, at least three civilians were killed and eight others were wounded over the past 24 hours by Russian shelling of nine Ukrainian regions, where drones, missiles and heavy artillery were used. In the Russian-occupied Kherson region, where a Ukrainian counteroffensive is underway, the Russian military continue to abduct local residents, the presidential office said, with the most recent cases taking place over the past 24 hours.",0.0,0.0,0.0,5

The governor of the Kostroma region, Sergei Sitnikov, said 13 people died in the fire and five more were slightly injured. Russian news agency Interfax cited local emergency officials as saying that the death toll stood at 15. The contradicting numbers couldn't be immediately reconciled. The blaze erupted in the early hours after someone apparently used a flare gun, according to the authorities. The Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that a brawl erupted in the cafe shortly before the fire, but it wasn't immediately clear if it had anything to do with the use of a flare gun. Rescuers were able to evacuate 250 people. The roof of the cafe collapsed during the fire, which engulfed an area of 3,500 square meters (more than 37,000 square feet). Firefighters spent five hours battling the blaze, and a dozen residents of a nearby residential buildings were evacuated as a precaution. A criminal investigation has been launched, and the police have arrested a suspect. Ikhtiyar Mirzoyev, a member of the regional legislature and owner of the cafe, promised assistance to those affected by the fire. Kostroma, a riverside city of 270,000, is located roughly 340 kilometers (210 miles) north of Moscow. It wasn't the first time that pyrotechnics caused a deadly fire at a recreational venue in Russia. In 2009, more than 150 people were killed in a blaze at the Lame Horse nightclub in the city of Perm that erupted after someone set off fireworks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,9

The group also has two professionally recorded albums of traditional Ukrainian music and takes pride in sharing Ukrainian culture across the Midwest. Now the band is using its upcoming 15th anniversary to put on a stellar show to support Ukrainian soldiers and families. ""When the war first started we just were shell-shocked. We had some shows we were supposed to play but we said no, we're not going to. It's just too tough,"" Lev Frayman said. After that silence came invites to play at fundraisers across the metro. As the war continues abroad, it still hits home with the band members. ""It's been a very difficult eight months for the community, for everyone who has family, friends,"" Frayman said. The band is now raising money for Ukrainian soldiers getting prosthetics here in Minnesota. They say it feels good to feel good, to provide a window into Ukrainian culture, and to help everyone find strength and joy through music. ""Some of our songs go for 30 minutes. As we're playing them people keep dancing, so we can't stop. We just keep going,"" Frayman said. The band will be playing at the Cedar Cultural Center in Minneapolis on Friday.

Microsoft's financial commitment of more than $400 million enables the Ukraine government and other organizations to continue using the Microsoft cloud and its public data centers across Europe, the company's president, Brad Smith, announced at the annual Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal. Cloud technology offers resilience and security for Ukraine operations, Smith said, after Russia targeted Ukrainian data centers with air strikes when it invaded more than eight months ago. The invasion triggered ""extraordinary innovation"" by the Ukrainian military, Smith said. Ukraine and Russia are fighting ""a new type of war,"" with cyberweapons and other types of digital technology playing a pivotal role, he said. Artificial intelligence deployed by Kyiv, for example, is detecting and thwarting Russian cyberattacks ""in the blink of an eye,"" according to Smith.

Jean-Pierre said the U.S. continues to press Russia to release Griner and U.S. Marine Corps veteran Paul Whelan, who was sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison on espionage charges that his family have called a setup. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in July that the U.S. had made a ""substantial proposal"" for the release of Griner and Whelan. ""I can also tell you that in the subsequent weeks, despite a lack of good faith negotiation by the Russians, the U.S. government has continued to follow up on that offer and propose alternative potential ways forward with Russians through all available channels,"" Jean-Pierre said.

2022-11-03,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/russia-us-ukraine-biological-weapons-lab-claims-un-security-council-vote/,U.N. Security Council rejects Russia's call to probe debunked U.S.-Ukraine biological weapons claims,"United Nations — The U.N.'s 15-nation Security Council voted down on Wednesday a proposal by Russia to create a commission to investigate Moscow's unsubstantiated claims of a joint U.S.-Ukrainian ""military biological"" program. Russia has leveled allegations since March that programs in Ukraine sponsored by the U.S. Defense Department were in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention, an international law regulating weaponized toxins. Moscow has offered no verifiable proof of such work, and the U.S. Defense Department, the White House and Ukraine have consistently refuted the allegations. The U.N.'s disarmament chief, Izumi Nakamitsu, said in March that while the global body did not have the capacity to investigate, the U.N. was not aware of any biological weapons program in Ukraine. As the Security Council voted Wednesday on the resolution brought by Russia, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Washington and Ukraine had been ""through Russia's allegations in Geneva, point by point, and debunked every single one."" She said Russia's claims were ""based on disinformation, dishonesty, bad faith, and a total lack of respect for this body."" ""The United States does not have a biological weapons program. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States,"" insisted Thomas-Greenfield. During a series of U.N. meetings prompted by the Russian allegations, the U.S. has described the non-military biological labs it has supported in Ukraine since the 1990's, including one called the ""Biological Threat Reduction Program"" that was created to disassemble the former Soviet Union's programs, to ""reduce legacy threats from nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons left in the Soviet Union's successor states."" In May, CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay visited the Ukrainian facility at the heart of Russia's disinformation campaign, the Virology Reference Laboratory in Kyiv, and spoke with the chief researcher and scientists whose work there had been dedicated for years to containing dangerous pathogens. The facility has always been regularly inspected by international agencies, including the World Health Organization. Their work changed abruptly, however, when Russian forces invaded Ukraine on February 24 and the shelling began. ""They bombed a building right nearby,"" Dr. Natalia Vidayko, the lab's top scientist, told Livesay. From that day, the Ukrainian government ordered the lab, and others in the country, to destroy all particularly dangerous biological strains they had in storage, Vidayko said. ""They're completely destroyed,"" she repeated to Livesay, who found minimal security — amounting to one tired old guard dog — when he visited the lab in Kyiv. Despite the clear flaws with Russia's claims, Moscow brought its draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council this week — embedded within a 310-page document of claims and complaints — calling for a ""commission consisting of all members of the Security Council to investigate"" the allegations. Only Russia and China voted in favor of the measure, with the other three veto-wielding permanent members of the Council, the U.S., U.K. and France, voting against it. The 10 elected members of the Council abstained, so the measure was defeated. Analysts, Western diplomats and the Pentagon have suggested that Russia's disinformation about the biological labs is really a ""false flag,"" aimed at creating a pretext to blame Ukraine and the U.S. for a possible biological or chemical attack that Russia's own forces could carry out in Ukraine. President Biden warned in March that Russia would pay a ""severe price"" if it did use biological or chemical weapons in Ukraine. Russia's deputy Ambassador to the U.N., Dmitry Polyansky, said his country would take the issue to a U.N. meeting on the biological weapons convention in Geneva, which takes place between November 28 and December 16, claiming the U.S. and Ukraine had ""placed themselves above the law."" After Wednesday's vote, U.K. Ambassador Barbara Woodward said Russia's claims that Ukraine's Western allies had failed to consider Moscow's evidence were ""completely false."" ""Russia's allegations have no credible basis in fact,"" she said. French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere told diplomats at the Council meeting that Russia ""must stop this irresponsible disinformation campaign,"" dismissing Moscow's ""so-called evidence"" and insisting that it ""deserves no further consideration.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,3
2022-11-02,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/ukraine-war-russia-nuclear-weapons-us-intelligence/,U.S. officials say Russian commanders discussed possible nuclear weapons use in Ukraine,"Two U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Wednesday that senior Russian military officials discussed in mid-October how and when they might use nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine. The intelligence concerned U.S. officials because the relevant discussions came not long after Russian President Vladimir Putin, seeing Ukrainian forces claw territory back from his troops, hinted that he could resort to nuclear weapons. Putin warned in late September that he would ""certainly use all the means at our disposal"" to defend Russian territory. Asked about the U.S. intelligence on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed it as ""purposeful pumping"" of nuclear weapons rhetoric. ""We have not the slightest intention to take part in this pumping, and consider it very, very irresponsible,"" Peskov told reporters in Moscow. The discussions among Russian officials, first reported by the New York Times, were not detailed by the U.S. officials who confirmed the intelligence to CBS News. In a statement shared with CBS News, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he couldn't provide ""any comment on the particulars of this reporting,"" but said the U.S. had been ""clear from the outset that Russia's comments about the potential use of nuclear weapons are deeply concerning, and we take them seriously."" The talk within the Russian military came as Moscow claimed, without offering any evidence, that Ukraine was preparing to use a radioactive ""dirty bomb."" Ukraine and its Western partners dismissed the claim as a bid by Russia to create a pretext to blame Ukraine for its own possible use of such a device. A dirty bomb is a device that uses conventional explosives to disperse radioactive material. They are not generally weapons stocked by national military forces, but more often associated with terrorism. Their use is, however, hypothetical: A dirty bomb has never been detonated in an attack, but they have been tested. Their size and lethality depends entirely on the potency and quantity of the radioactive and explosives materials used. Since the intelligence about the unidentified Russians' conversations first came to light, concern within the U.S. government has eased, principally, one American official told CBS News, because the Russians' own rhetoric has been dialed back. Putin was not said to have been part of the conversations, and Kirby and the U.S. officials who spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity said there were no indications that Russia was then or is now making preparations to use a nuclear weapon. Fears that Putin — who makes all final decisions about Russian military deployments and operations — could order the use of any kind of nuclear weapon in Ukraine increased last month as his invading forces were dealt a series of defeats, retreating from a number of villages and towns in regions of eastern Ukraine that Putin has declared Russian territory. His unilateral annexation of four eastern Ukrainian regions at the end of September has been dismissed by the United Nations and most of the global community as an illegal landgrab. In addition to his battlefield losses, there were also indications last month of discontent within Russia. As Ukraine's troops advanced and a hastily-called military mobilization sent hundreds of young Russian men running for Russia's borders to avoid serving in Ukraine, and hundreds more who were drafted sent to the front lines with inadequate training and equipment, senior Russian officials started voicing rare public concern over the trajectory of Putin's war.",2.247343124116942,2.961565611192654,-0.7142224870757121,2

Maj. Jamie Lee Henry, a doctor at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, and her wife Anna Gabrielian, an anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, are at least eight weeks away from their potential trial. Court documents show discovery evidence provided to the defense include ""multiple hours of video recordings."" Plea negotiations will continue. Maj. Jamie Lee Henry and her wife Anna Gabrielian told an undercover FBI agent in August they'd provide medical information to the Russian government, according to the indictment. The Justice Department indictment refers to Henry as male, but in 2015, BuzzFeed News reported that Henry became the nation's first known active duty transgender active- duty U.S. Army officer, after the Army granted her request to change her name and gender. Henry and Gabrielian met with an individual they believed was associated with the Russian government but who was really an undercover agent, the indictment said. The couple allegedly told the agent they could pass on medical records to Russia of U.S. military, military family members and other individuals. Later, in a meeting at a hotel, Gabrielian allegedly provided the agent with medical information of two people: the spouse of an employee at the Office of Naval Intelligence and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. Gabrielian pointed out a medical issue in the first record that Russia could exploit, the Justice Department said. Henry provided the information of at least five individuals who were patients at Fort Bragg and were either military veterans or related to military veterans, the indictment said. Henry and Gabrielian both allegedly told the agent they were committed to helping Russia. The indictment said Gabrielian had reached out to the Russian embassy offering help, and Henry had allegedly even tried to join the Russian military after the invasion started but was told Russia only wanted individuals who had combat experience, which Henry lacks. Henry was more hesitant about violating the law limiting healthcare providers from sharing confidential medical records, but Gabrielian said she violated the law ""all the time,"" the Justice Department said. According to the indictment, Gabrielian told the agent Henry was a more valuable source for Russia because Henry had information on how the U.S. military establishes army hospitals in war conditions and about previous training the U.S. military had provided to Ukrainian personnel. A U.S. military service record provided to CBS News verified that Henry is currently assigned to Fort Bragg, N.C., as a staff internist with a rank of Major and has no combat deployments. The indictment said Henry holds a Secret-level security clearance, which allows access to information whose release would cause serious damage to national security. During their first meeting in a hotel room, the Justice Department said Gabrielian told the agent that if anything were to happen to her and Henry, she wanted their children ""to have a nice flight to Turkey to go on vacation because I don't want to end in jail here with my kids being hostages over my head.""",5.890167753001657,8.660324307141726,-2.770156554140069,1
2022-10-29,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/russia-invasion-ukraine-signs-unraveling/,More signs indicate Russia's invasion of Ukraine could be unraveling,"There are more and more signs that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could be unraveling. One of the most glaring setbacks in its war is its recent big call-up of more troops — a plan that doesn't appear to be working. Russia's mobilization has caused anger at home, forcing the old and inexperienced into uniform, with claims they're short of even basic equipment. The call-up followed weeks of embarrassing setbacks for Russian forces, as Ukraine has retaken swaths of its territory. And in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, officials appointed by Moscow have evacuated civilians ahead of another expected Ukrainian counter-offensive. On Russian state TV, at times the tone seems close to despair. Russia miscalculated its strength and for eight straight months can't win in its war on Ukraine, said one commentator. Perhaps another sign of Russian desperation is its new tactic: targeting the Ukrainian power grid, which has led to blackouts in Ukraine — but no collapse in morale. As Russia's nuclear forces started annual drills this week, President Vladimir Putin repeated his government's allegation that Ukraine could detonate a radioactive device — a so-called ""dirty bomb."" Some fear Russia is planning a false-flag operation, staging an incident and blaming Ukraine, perhaps as a pretext for using a nuclear weapon. ""I'm not guaranteeing you that it's a false flag operation yet, don't know,"" said President Joe Biden. ""But it would be a serious, serious mistake."" Ukraine's defense minister told CBS News Russia is exhausted, and trying to force Ukraine and the West to negotiate. In a bizarre speech this week, Putin railed against the West, including gay pride parades and so-called cancel culture. But he also said that it would make no sense for Russia to use a nuclear weapon. Biden's response to that was: If he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it?",2.7093141200673037,2.3150408064886956,0.39427331357860806,3
2022-10-29,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-suspends-ukraine-grain-deal-alleged-ship-attack/,Russia suspends Ukraine grain deal over ship attack claim,"Russia announced Saturday that it will immediately suspend its implementation of a U.N.-brokered grain deal that has seen more than 9 million tons of grain exported from Ukraine during the war and has brought down soaring global food prices. The Russian Defense Ministry cited an alleged Ukrainian drone attack Saturday against Russia's Black Sea Fleet ships moored off the coast of occupied Crimea as the reason for the move. Ukraine has denied the attack, saying that the Russians mishandled their own weapons. The Russian declaration came one day after U.N. chief Antonio Guterres urged Russia and Ukraine to renew the grain export deal, which was scheduled to expire on Nov. 19. Guterres also urged other countries, mainly in the West, to expedite the removal of obstacles blocking Russian grain and fertilizer exports. The U.N. chief said the grain deal — brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July — helps ""to cushion the suffering that this global cost-of-living crisis is inflicting on billions of people,"" his spokesman said. U.N. officials were in touch with Russian authorities over the announced suspension. ""It is vital that all parties refrain from any action that would imperil the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is a critical humanitarian effort that is clearly having a positive impact on access to food for millions of people,"" said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. Russia's Foreign Ministry on Saturday accused British specialists of being involved in the alleged attack by drones on Russian ships in Crimea. Britain's Defense Ministry had no immediate comment on the claim. ""In connection with the actions of Ukrainian armed forces, led by British specialists, directed, among other things, against Russian ships that ensure the functioning of the humanitarian corridor in question (which cannot be qualified otherwise than as a terrorist attack), the Russian side cannot guarantee the safety of civilian dry cargo ships participating in the Black Sea initiative, and suspends its implementation from today for an indefinite period,"" the Russian statement said. Ukraine's Ministry of Infrastructure said that Ukraine has never threatened the Black Sea grain corridor which ""is exclusively humanitarian in nature,"" and would continue to try to keep shipments going. It said since the first ship left the port of Odesa on Aug. 1, more than 9 million tons of food have been exported, including more than 5 million tons to African and Asian countries. As part of the U.N. World Food Program, it said, 190 thousand tons of wheat have been sent to countries where there is hunger. Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused Russia of playing ""hunger games"" by imperiling global food shipments. ""We warned about Russia's plans to destroy the (grain agreement). Now, under false pretenses, Moscow is blocking the grain corridor that ensures food security for millions of people,"" he tweeted Saturday. The head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Andriy Yermak, denounced the suspension as part of Russia's ""primitive blackmail."" Turkish officials said they haven't received any official notice yet of the deal's suspension. Russia also requested a meeting of the U.N. Security Council for Monday because of the alleged attack on the Black Sea Fleet and the security of the grain corridor, said Dmitry Polyansky, Russia's first deputy representative to the U.N. It would be the fourth U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine-related issues that Russia has called since Tuesday. Russia's agriculture minister said Moscow stands ready to ""fully replace Ukrainian grain and deliver supplies at affordable prices to all interested countries."" In remarks carried by the state Rossiya 24 TV channel, Dmitry Patrushev said Moscow was prepared to ""supply up to 500,000 tons of grain to the poorest countries free of charge in the next four months,"" with the help of Turkey. Earlier Saturday, Ukraine and Russia offered differing versions on the Crimea drone attack in which at least one Russian ship suffered damage in Sevastopol, the port on the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014. The Russian Defense Ministry said a minesweeper had ""minor damage"" during an alleged pre-dawn Ukrainian attack on navy and civilian vessels docked in Sevastopol, which hosts the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. The ministry claimed Russian forces had ""repelled"" 16 attacking drones. The governor of the Sevastopol region, Mikhail Razvozhaev, claimed the port saw a ""massive attack"" by air and sea drones. He provided no evidence, saying all video from the area would be seized for security reasons. But an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Ministry claimed that ""careless handling of explosives"" had caused blasts on four warships in Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Anton Gerashchenko wrote on Telegram that the vessels included a frigate, a landing ship and a ship that carried cruise missiles used in a deadly July attack on a western Ukrainian city. In other developments on Saturday, Russian troops moved large numbers of sick and wounded comrades from hospitals in Ukraine's southern Kherson region and stripped the facilities of medical equipment, Ukrainian officials said as their forces fought to retake the province. Kremlin-installed authorities in the mostly Russian-occupied region have urged civilians to leave the city of Kherson, the region's capital — and reportedly joined the tens of thousands who fled to other Russia-held areas. ""The so-called evacuation of invaders from the temporarily occupied territory of the Kherson region, including from medical institutions, continues,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russians were ""dismantling the entire health care system"" in Kherson and other occupied areas. ""The occupiers have decided to close medical institutions in the cities, take away equipment, ambulances. just everything,"" Zelenskyy said. Kherson is one of four regions in Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month and where he subsequently declared martial law. The others are Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. As Kyiv's forces sought gains in the south, Russia kept up its shelling and missile attacks in the country's east. Three more civilians died and eight more were wounded in the Donetsk region, a front-line hotspot as Russian soldiers try to capture the city of Bakhmut, an important target in Russia's stalled eastern offensive. Russian shelling also hit an industrial building in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region. Around a quarter of the region — including its capital — remains under Ukrainian control. In the latest prisoner exchange, 50 Ukrainian soldiers, including two former defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, and two civilians were released Saturday as part of a swap with Russia, according to Yermak.

As CBS 2's Suzanne Le Mignot reports, it was an emotional moment for all. Musicians from the Lyric Opera of Chicago perform Beethoven's Septet. Their audience: Students from St. Nicholas Cathedral School in Ukrainian Village. At least 70 of the students are refugees from Ukraine. ""It's beautiful music. I like it,"" said seventh grader Nazar Babych. The musicians would explain the intricacies of their instruments to the students. The highlight of the visit? The musicians joining the students for a very emotional performance. As the musicians played, the students sang the Ukrainian National Anthem. ""When the children all sang together, it just brought a tear to my eye,"" said Susan Warner, acting principal clarinet, Lyric Opera Orchestra. In April, Preman Tilson was among the Lyric Opera of Chicago musicians taking part in a benefit concert. It raised money to cover tuition for the Ukrainian refugee students now attending St. Nicholas Cathedral School. ""To be able to actually come now to the school and meet the actual kids who were brought over from Ukraine with our help, play for them and then to sing their national anthem with us is just an unbelievable feeling,"" said Tilson. ""I'm really happy,"" said sixth-grader Yaryna Kilchytska. ""They support us. They support Ukraine and that's really good!"" Seventh grader Nazar Babych said his father is still in Ukraine. Babych said attending this school and leaving his war torn homeland has been lifechanging. ""Here, you have more options, like you can go to one university, you can go to school wherever you want,"" Babych said. Babych said being in Chicago has opened up so many possibilities for what lies ahead for him in the future.",6.227770468363429,4.337407984809438,1.8903624835539912,8
2022-10-28,https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/ukraine-10-year-old-girl-cat-reuited-california/,A 10-year-old girl was devastated to leave her cat behind when her family fled Ukraine. But they recently reunited in California.,"As the war in Ukraine continued to escalate, the Bezhenar family made the difficult decision to leave the country in July. They had to leave everything behind – their business, their home, and even their pets, which devastated their 10-year-old daughter. ""We could not take any animals that we have,"" Maria Bezhenar, a mom of three, told CBS News. ""We asked my brother-in-law to watch over the animals and the youngest one, Agnessa, she was crying every time. She says, 'I want to go back home. My animals are there, my cats are there.' And we couldn't help her."" Bezhenar and her husband, Aleksander, first moved to Romania with their three daughters, Eleanor, Agnessa, and Angelina, as well as Bezhenar's mother. They could only stay temporarily, so, they decided to move to the United States. They promised Agnessa they would adopt a cat once they got there. Bezhenar found a program, UkraineTakeShelter.com, which helps refugees find housing in the U.S., and she connected with Geoffry Peters in Cloverdale, California. Peters has dedicated his life to working for charities, and is now on the board of a fundraising agency for nonprofits. His newest mission was helping a family from Ukraine move to the U.S. ""Can you imagine your life being turned upside down and you have to leave a country you've never left before, ride on an airplane you've never done before? Arrive in a new country, learn a language,"" Peters told CBS News. ""I mean, it's like starting from scratch, only it's on steroids. It's like everything moving 100 miles an hour."" Peters had a second home for the Bezhenars and helped them expedite their move to the U.S. But they arrived a little too quickly – Peters and his wife were on vacation when they got there in July. ""The house was an empty house,"" he said. ""So, we contacted all of our friends in the community here in Cloverdale, California and literally they furnished the entire house from top to bottom. Beds for every person in the family, kitchenware, utensils, plates."" His grandchildren greeted the family with signs at the airport and drove them to Cloverdale, where they saw how generous the community had been, Bezhenar said, calling the moment ""unbelievable."" Eventually, Peters and his wife arrived home and met the Bezhenars, and they formed a connection. ""When we saw them, they became like our father and mother. I call him 'adoptive father,'"" Bezhenar said. Since coming to the U.S., the family has made many changes. They've gotten their California drivers licenses. The girls have enrolled in school — the two eldest in junior college. And Aleksander is working to restart his career selling and installing wallpaper. They even adopted a new cat, but Agnessa still felt one thing was still missing — their beloved cat, Arsenii. As fate would have it, Bezhenar befriended a flight attendant on the way to the U.S.. She kept in touch with her and asked if she knew anyone who could help. ""I asked her if she knows something about the cats, how cats can fly and what documents cats need. And she says, 'I don't really know about this, but my friend who is another flight attendant from Hawaii, she must know everything about that,'"" Bezhenar recalls. That second flight attendant knew people who worked for an animal rescue. They contacted someone from the rescue, who was already in Europe on vacation. She volunteered to tack on some extra travel — to pick up Arsenii, bringing him to all the way to California. ""She just decided to travel to Bucharest to do everything needed for the cat, and she brought the cat back to Greece and from Greece to Montreal and from Montreal to Seattle and from Seattle to San Francisco. That was a long journey,"" Bezhenar said. This time, the Bezhenar family were the ones waiting at the airport with signs: ""Welcome home Arsenii."" Agnessa cried tears of joy. They left many things behind in Ukraine, but in California, they gained family. ""We are surrounded by good people here,"" Bezhenar said.",3.4592095677250887,2.637630851781566,0.8215787159435228,0
2022-10-28,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/ukraine-himars-ammunition-us-aid/,U.S. to send $275 million more in aid to Ukraine,"The U.S. is sending another round of aid to Ukraine that includes additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) as part of a package worth $275 million, the State Department confirmed Friday. The latest aid means the U.S. has provided approximately $17.9 billion in support to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February, a State Department spokesperson said. The latest package is also expected to include 500 precision-guided 155mm rounds; 2,000 155mm rounds of Remote Anti-Armor Mine (RAAM) Systems; 125 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs); more than 1,300 anti-armor systems; small arms and more than 2.7 million rounds of small arms ammunition; and four satellite communications antennas. ""The United States will continue to stand with more than 50 allies and partners in support of the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence with extraordinary courage and boundless determination,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. Earlier this month, the U.S. committed another four HIMARS to Ukraine as part of a $625 million arms package. That package also included artillery systems, ammunition and armored vehicles. The U.S. has so far pulled 20 HIMARS from its own stocks for Ukraine. The advanced rocket systems and munitions allow Ukraine to target Russian command posts, ammunition hubs and support areas beyond the frontlines. The expected announcement comes as Ukraine and its allies, including the U.S., warned Russia against using a ""dirty bomb"" — a device that uses conventional explosives to spread radioactive material — in Ukraine. Russia's defense minister had claimed in a series of calls with defense officials from other countries that it was Ukraine that was preparing to detonate such a device in its own territory, an accusation that the U.S. and several allies called ""transparently false."" Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday also claimed, after months of rising tensions, that he had no intention of using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, according to The Associated Press. ""We see no need for that,"" Putin said, according to AP. ""There is no point in that, neither political, nor military."" Russia recently unleashed a wave of attacks using Iranian-made self-detonating drones around Kyiv and other regions. The Biden administration has promised 18 more HIMARS through a contracting process that will take ""a few years"" to deliver to Ukraine, a senior defense official said last month.

""Anybody in the West that asks Ukraine to just do peace talks, they need to go through these villages. They need to see what's been done to these people,"" said the man, who wants to be known only by his call sign, Elvis. ""This is nothing like any conflict in the past 70 to 80 years,"" he told CBS News. ""This war is not sustainable, for either side."" Originally from Tennessee, Elvis fought in Ukraine because he was horrified by Russia's invasion of the country. While there, he said he repeatedly witnessed Russian forces using white phosphorus munitions — something Russia previously denied. ""It comes down extremely slow, but there's nothing you can do, and everything it touches just incinerates,"" Elvis said, describing one incident where he witnessed between 20 and 30 Ukrainian fighters ""burning alive"" before some committed suicide to end their suffering. ""A lot of guys have suicide pistols, and you'd hear them scream, and then they would say goodbye and then blow their own heads off,"" he said. White phosphorus is a wax-like chemical substance that ignites instantly when it comes into contact with oxygen. Its primary function in weaponry is to burn brightly, and it is used in incendiary munitions by militaries around the world, including the United States, often to illuminate targets as part of tracer munitions at night. But it can be extremely dangerous when used as a weapon, causing deep burns, even through bone. ""There are certain weapons that I've seen used on the battlefield in Ukraine that — okay, it's war, I get it — but there's certain weapons that are used that, if the rest of world could see what they cause, what that looks like when someone dies because of that, there would be a lot bigger outcry,"" Elvis said. The fighter said he has been traumatized by his experience on the battlefield, and that he's worried one of his fellow fighters may commit suicide because of what they went through together. But he believes Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion is a righteous war. And he wants more to be done to stop the conflict. ""If China invaded the U.S., hypothetically, leveled Los Angeles, leveled Seattle, Portland, massacred thousands, do you think the U.S. would just sue for peace? No,"" he said.",2.704037872107707,2.4863173564023104,0.21772051570539652,0
2022-10-27,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/wildcat-sanctuary-ukraine-lion-cubs/,Minnesota sanctuary could be forever home for lions rescued from Ukraine,"SANDSTONE, Minn. -– The Minnesota Wildcat Sanctuary could soon be home to four lion cubs rescued from Ukraine. The 40-acre sanctuary based just more than 90 minutes north of the Twin Cities is home to more than 100 rescued lions, tigers and more. The campus isn't open to the public – rather, the organization operates as a non-profit strictly aimed to give the animals a home. The mission to rescue the four-month-old cubs started more than a month ago. After more than 36 hours of travel, they've been safely transported to a zoo in Poland where they await their next steps. ""Three (of the four) cubs were actually bred for the cub petting trade or the pet trade over there, so not a reputable facility,"" Tammy Thies, Founder and Executive Director of the Wildcat Sanctuary, said. ""They were surrendered in a duffle bag at just weeks old."" Thies says shortly after, the International Fund for Animal Welfare contacted her MN-based organization. In the past, Thies says the IFAW has worked to rehome animals from Tiger King Park in Oklahoma to her sanctuary. Getting the animals overseas during a war, however, has proven to be more challenging. ""When you take a step forward, you'll get three steps back,"" she said. ""Now that we're dealing with war-stricken Ukraine, we can make sure that the process is even harder."" Thies says to get the animals to the United States, they have to clear customs – while organizations work to secure the proper permits and applications. ""I can't believe that when [Ukrainian's] communities are crumbling, when they don't have power, they don't have phones or anything, that they're still dedicated to getting these animals to safety when they're going through so much,"" Thies said. ""Four lion cubs might seem really small in the scale of the war, but the amount of network that we've put together to help more animals and people that can support each other is amazing. For those four cubs, this is a whole new world and new life they're going to have. And that means the world."" Thies says if all works well, her hope is to have the cubs to the United States within the next few months.",2.796741846828264,3.355202585061259,-0.5584607382329949,0

""Citizens of (Israel) do not need a visa and are allowed to stay in the country for 90 days,"" Darius Jauniskis, head of Lithuania's State Security Department, told a local radio station. Jauniskis said Lithuania has no evidence of any threat that Sobchak could pose to national security. ""If we had anything, certain appropriate measures would be taken,"" he told the Ziniu Radijas station. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters that ""Ms. Sobchak currently is not included in any sanctions list of the EU, U.K. or the U.S. This does not mean that it cannot occur."" Landbergis said Sobschak might already have left Lithuania as she had entered Europe's passport-free travel zone -- a 26-country area made up of most of the EU members plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Israeli citizens with a valid passport can travel freely within Europe's visa-free zone, known as the Schengen area. ""Ms. Sobchak might have left Lithuania's territory already because she is not restricted in her movement to Poland, to other European countries, or to the north,"" he said, according to the Baltic News Service, the region's main news agency. A video from a surveillance camera shows Sobchak entering Lithuania on foot and talking to border officials. Lithuania and other Baltic states along with Poland stopped admitting Russian citizens who hold a valid Schengen visa back in September, a move to support Ukraine. Hundreds were turned away, but many still entered after presenting passports of other countries at the border. Sobchak, 40, has often been critical of Putin, but many Russian opposition figures have accused her of serving the Kremlin's agenda. In 2018, she became a liberal challenger in Russia's presidential election, finishing a distant fourth with about 1.7% of the vote in what her critics described as a Kremlin effort to add a democratic veneer to Putin's sweeping re-election. Russian media claimed she had bought tickets to Dubai and Turkey to mislead the authorities but eventually left for Belarus, from where she traveled to Lithuania. The reports claimed that investigators suspected Sobchak of being involved in an extortion scheme along with her media director and alleged that a warrant was issued for her arrest. The Russian news agency Tass also cited information from the probe indicating that Sergei Chemezov, a longtime Putin associate who heads the state Rostec corporation, a conglomerate controlling Russian aviation industries and other high-tech assets, was the victim of alleged extortion. The claims couldn't be independently confirmed. Sobchak dismissed the case as the Russian government's attempt to put pressure on her media group. ""It is clear that it's an attack on my editorial team, the last remaining free editorial team in Russia which had to be pressured,"" Sobchak said on Telegram, which has 1.4 million followers. Sobchak, the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, a liberal mayor of St. Petersburg for whom Putin served as a deputy in the 1990s, has extensive contacts among Russia's rich and powerful, and the search of her home topped domestic news. She has 9.4 million followers on Instagram, and her glamour, sharp wit and defiant ways have made her both loved and loathed. Sobchak first gained fame as a fashionable socialite and reality TV star and was once dubbed the ""Russian Paris Hilton,"" but later sought to shed her spoiled and arrogant image. She got involved in politics when joining the massive protests in Moscow against Putin in 2011-12, and later reinvented herself as a serious TV journalist and opposition activist. Sobchak has denied serving the Kremlin's agenda by running as a challenger to Putin in 2018. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny denounced her for discrediting the opposition by joining the race, saying that she was a ""parody of a liberal candidate"" and her involvement in the campaign helped the Kremlin cast the opposition in a negative light. Kirill Sukhanov, the commercial director of Attention Media, was arrested earlier in the week as part of the investigation. Attention Media runs a number of social media projects, including Sobchak's YouTube channel that has over three million subscribers. ""Kirill, we love you and we don't believe anything,"" Sobchak said on Telegram. AFP contributed to this report.",3.135031029762301,3.17589633509848,-0.040865305336178714,6
2022-10-27,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/pentagon-reviews-say-china-poses-greatest-security-challenge-to-u-s-while-russia-is-acute-threat/,"Pentagon reviews: China is ""pacing challenge"" and Russia poses ""acute threat""","Despite the international focus on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China remains the ""pacing challenge"" — or the nation that threatens to surpass the U.S. — according to strategic documents the Pentagon released Thursday. ""The [People's Republic of China] is the only competitor out there with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly the power to do so,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday. The Pentagon released the unclassified versions of the National Defense Strategy, Nuclear Posture Review, and Missile Defense Review. The classified versions of these documents were submitted in March shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, but senior defense officials said Thursday the Pentagon did not need to change the strategy since there were already indications last fall that Russia intended to invade. The National Defense Strategy identifies Russia as an ""acute threat."" ""Unlike China, Russia can't systemically challenge the U.S. over the long term, but Russian aggression does pose an immediate and sharp threat to our interests and values,"" Austin said. Since the last National Defense Strategy was released in 2018, the security environment ""has unfortunately only continued to deteriorate,"" a senior defense official told reporters Thursday. Over the last few months, Russia's war in Ukraine has continued and Russian President Vladimir Putin has not ruled out the possibility of using nuclear weapons. China has rapidly expanded its nuclear arsenal in recent years. The Pentagon's recent China Military Power Report released last fall noted that China has accelerated its production of nuclear warheads, outpacing the Pentagon's estimates. The senior defense official who briefed reporters on the Nuclear Posture Review, said, ""In the coming years, for the first time, we will have to deter two major nuclear armed competitors, both Russia and China."" To prevent an arms race, the National Defense Strategy emphasizes diplomacy as an approach to convince China to come to the negotiating table on arms control. But so far, China has been unwilling to engage, the official said. China and Russia are identified as the ""pacing challenge"" and ""acute threat"" in the document, but it also takes note of North Korea and Iran. Austin said other serious threats include North Korea's expanding nuclear and missile capabilities, as well as Iran's movement on its nuclear program and export of drones to Russia. The 2022 Missile Defense Review predicts the usage rate of drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), will only increase because they're relatively cheap and accessible. Their appearance in the review is new — drones were not specifically identified as emerging threats in the Missile Defense Review released in 2019. Russia, the review notes, has resorted to help from Iran in part because it has depleted its own conventional weapons. The senior defense official said the Pentagon is working to understand how Russia's forces have been degraded since its invasion of Ukraine and noted that one effect of Russia's depletion of its conventional weapons is ""unfortunately"" an ""even greater reliance on their nuclear forces."" The official reiterated what President Biden and senior leaders have said before – that any use of nuclear weapons on any scale would be met with severe consequences. Defense officials this week have said there are no indications Russia has made a decision to use nuclear weapons or a dirty bomb in Ukraine.",3.0440706711634604,2.314467965520557,0.7296027056429035,2

The warning comes as U.S. forces and NATO allies conduct routine military drills in international waters, and as NATO's annual nuclear exercise is underway over northwestern Europe. ""It would be absolutely wrong if I went into the exact way we will react, but Russia knows that there will be severe consequences,"" Jens Stoltenberg told CBS News aboard the USS George H.W. Bush, a Navy aircraft carrier taking part in the defense drills. ""We are vigilant and ready to react if something bad happens."" ""Something bad"" could be a ""dirty bomb"" — an explosive loaded with radioactive material. Russia claims Ukraine wants to use one on the battlefield, although there is no evidence to support the allegation. A ""dirty bomb"" is not a nuclear bomb, and would be less harmful, but by using conventional explosives to spread radioactive material, it is an effective weapon of terror. Stoltenberg said the accusation could be a strategic tactic from Russia, foreshadowing what it aims to do instead. ""We have seen before that Russia has accused others for doing what they intend to do themselves,"" he said. ""So therefore, we are sending a strong message to Moscow that they should not try to use a false pretext as an excuse for escalation of the war in Ukraine."" For now, NATO says its best weapon is overwhelming deterrence with a display of firepower from fighter jets, helicopters and surveillance. If called upon, the fighters are ready to strike, but only to defend the alliance and not to provoke Russia, the organization insists. ""We don't seek conflict with Russia,"" Stoltenberg said. ""But of course, when we see more threats, when we see a more dangerous world, it's even more important that we send a clear message to any potential adversary that we are ready to defend all allies because that's the best way to prevent an attack and preserve peace.""

2022-10-25,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/progressives-retract-ukraine-letter-biden-after-backlash/,Progressives retract Ukraine letter to Biden after backlash,"A group of progressive Democrats in Congress said Tuesday it had retracted a letter to the White House urging President Joe Biden to engage in direct diplomatic talks with Russia after it triggered an uproar among Democrats and raised questions about the strength of the party's support for Ukraine. In a statement, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Progressive Caucus, said the caucus was withdrawing the letter it jhad sent less than 24 hours earlier. It was signed by 30 members of the party's liberal flank. ""The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting,"" the Washington Democrat wrote in a statement. As chair of the caucus, Jayapal said she took responsibility for this. The unusual retraction capped a tense 24-hour period for Democrats. Many reacted angrily to the appearance of flagging support for the president's Ukraine strategy, coming just weeks before a midterm election where their majorities in Congress are at risk. The back-and-forth spotlighted the fragile nature of Biden's relationship with the progressive wing of his party, raising stark questions about their ability to work together not only on Ukraine funding — which seems secure, for now — but on more pressing issues that are top priorities for liberals. The letter had called for Biden to pair the unprecedented economic and military support for Ukraine with a ""proactive diplomatic push, redoubling efforts to seek a realistic framework for a cease fire."" ""The alternative to diplomacy is protracted war, with both its attendant certainties and catastrophic and unknowable risks,"" the letter read. Jayapal said the letter was unfairly conflated with recent comments from Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who warned that Republicans will not write a ""blank check"" for Ukraine if they win back the House majority in November. ""The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance that Democrats, who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military, strategic, and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people, are somehow aligned with Republicans who seek to pull the plug on American support"" for Ukraine, Jayapal said. Yet Jayapal did not disavow the substance of the letter or the push for Biden to engage in diplomacy. Members of the caucus have been calling for a diplomatic solution since Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. The text of the letter had been circulating since at least June, but only a handful of lawmakers signed on at the time, according to two Democrats familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity to discuss internal party deliberations. Some Democrats who signed the letter months ago said they no longer support it. ""I signed this letter on June 30, but a lot has changed since then,"" Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of New York said on Twitter. ""I wouldn't sign it today."" ""We have to continue supporting Ukraine economically and militarily to give them the leverage they need to end this war,"" she said. Despite the retraction and messy behind-the-scenes process, some Democratic lawmakers said they still backed the sentiments behind the letter, arguing that it is the prerogative of Congress to debate the issue as it continues to approve billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. ""I have voted for arms to Ukraine and will continue to support providing arms to Ukraine to stand up against Putin's brutal aggression,"" Rep. Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, said in an interview Tuesday. ""At the same time, it's my obligation to make sure we are mitigating the risk of nuclear war, that we are making sure that the conflict doesn't escalate and that we are working toward a negotiated settlement that will be a just peace. That is the framework of the letter."" John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Monday that the White House had received the letter and appreciates the progressives' ""very thoughtful concerns"" about the conflict in Ukraine. ""They express support in that letter for the president's approach and we welcome that as well,"" Kirby said. The backlash against the progressives who signed the letter — including some of the most outspoken voices of the caucus like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar — came most pointedly at Jayapal, who is the face of the liberal faction. It was the latest setback for the congresswoman, who has worked for the better half of the past year to help Biden and the Democrats deliver on some of the party's core legislative promises, often at a cost to some of her caucus's more liberal priorities. Most notably, last fall, Jayapal helped lead the bipartisan infrastructure package over the finish line after party divisions threatened its passage in the House. The recent mishap also casts doubt on her whispered ambitions to join Democratic leadership. Since the war began, Congress has approved tens of billions in emergency security and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, while the Biden administration has shipped billions worth of weapons and equipment from military inventories. Last month, lawmakers approved about $12.3 billion in Ukraine-related aid as part of a bill that finances the federal government through Dec. 16. The money included aid for the Ukrainian military as well as money to help the country's government provide basic services to its citizens. That comes on top of more than $50 billion provided in two previous bills. Financial support for Ukraine garnered strong bipartisan support in the Senate and the House after Russia's invasion, but conservative opposition was present from the start. Republicans accounted for the only votes against a $40 billion aid package in the spring. Recent comments from McCarthy have more clearly reflected the GOP's growing skepticism about the cost of financial support for Kyiv. In private, GOP lawmakers who support aid to Ukraine say there could be an opportunity to pass one more tranche of assistance in an end-of-year spending package, before Republicans potentially take control in the next Congress.",1.7315072889645393,5.040342539299402,-3.3088352503348633,7

The Russian ""Grom,"" or Thunder nuclear exercise, typically involves large-scale maneuvers of strategic nuclear forces, including live missile launches, a senior military official said earlier this month. Officials have expected the annual exercise for several weeks but only recently received notification from Russia. According to AFP, state television showed Russian President Vladimir Putin overseeing the drills from a control room. ""Russia is complying with its arms control obligations and its transparency commitments to make those notifications,"" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters Tuesday, after confirming the U.S. has been notified of the annual exercise. The Russian exercise coincides with the long-planned NATO nuclear exercise ""Steadfast Noon."" This year's NATO exercise, hosted by Belgium, takes place from Oct. 17 to Oct. 30 and involves 14 countries. U.S. B-52 long-range bombers will participate, flying from Minot Air Base in North Dakota. The exercise also includes fourth and fifth generation fighter jets, but no live weapons will be used. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters earlier this month that the NATO exercise is meant to ensure NATO's nuclear deterrence capabilities ""remain safe, secure and effective."" Stoltenberg said NATO will ""monitor"" the Russian exercise and ""will remain vigilant not least in light of the veiled nuclear threats and the dangerous nuclear rhetoric we have seen from the Russian side.""

2022-10-24,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-dirty-bomb-ukraine-us-reject-sergei-shoigu-warning-of-false-flag-attack/,"Kyiv, U.S. and other allies reject Russian defense chief's claim of ""dirty bomb"" provocation from Ukraine","Ukraine and several of its allies, including the United States, have rejected a claim from Russia's defense minister, who said that Ukraine was preparing to detonate a ""dirty bomb"" in its own territory. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made the claims in a series of calls with U.S., British, French and Turkish defense officials. ""We reject reports of Minister Shoigu's transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,"" said U.S. National Security Coucil spokesperson Adrienne Watson. A ""dirty bomb"" uses conventional explosives to spew radiological materials into the air and contaminate the surrounding area. The size of the area contaminated would depend on the size of the explosion.Russian authorities repeatedly have made allegations that Ukraine could detonate a dirty bomb in a false flag attack and blame it on Moscow. Ukrainian authorities, in turn, have accused the Kremlin of hatching such a plan. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace strongly rejected Shoigu's claim and warned Moscow against using it as a pretext for escalation. The British Ministry of Defense noted that Shoigu, in a call with Wallace, ""alleged that Ukraine was planning actions facilitated by Western countries, including the U.K., to escalate the conflict in Ukraine."" ""The Defense Secretary refuted these claims and cautioned that such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation,"" the ministry said. In a televised address Sunday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that Moscow itself was setting the stage for deploying a radioactive device on Ukrainian soil. ""If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means only one thing: that Russia has already prepared all of it,"" Zelenskyy said. The mention of the dirty bomb threat in Shoigu's calls seemed to indicate the threat of such an attack has risen to an unprecedented level. The French Ministry of the Armed Forces said Shoigu told his counterpart, Sebastien Lecornu, that the situation in Ukraine was rapidly worsening and ""trending towards uncontrollable escalation."" ""It appears that there is a shared feeling that the tensions have approached the level that could raise the real threat for all,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, the Kremlin-connected head of the Council for Foreign and Defense policies, a Moscow-based group of top foreign affairs experts. The rising tensions come as Russian authorities reported building defensive positions in occupied areas of Ukraine and border regions of Russia, reflecting fears that Ukrainian forces may attack along new sections of the 620-mile front line of the war, which enters its ninth month on Monday. In recent weeks, Ukraine has focused its counteroffensive mostly on the Kherson region. Their relentless artillery strikes cut the main crossings across the Dnieper River, which bisects the southern region, leaving Russian troops on the west bank short of supplies and vulnerable to encirclement. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-installed regional administration in Kherson, said Sunday in a radio interview that Russian defensive lines ""have been reinforced and the situation has remained stable"" since local officials strongly encouraged all residents of the region's capital and nearby areas Saturday to evacuate by ferry to the river's east bank. The region is one of four that Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed last month and put under Russian martial law on Thursday. Kherson city has been in Russian hands since the early days of the war, but Ukraine's forces have made advances toward reclaiming it. About 20,000 Kherson residents have moved to places on the east bank of the Dnieper River, the Kremlin-backed regional administration reported. The Ukrainian military said Sunday that Russia's military also withdrew its officers from areas on the west bank, leaving newly mobilized, inexperienced forces. The Ukrainian claim could not be independently verified. As Ukraine presses south after liberating the Kharkiv region in the north last month, authorities in the western Russian provinces bordering northeastern Ukraine appeared jittery. The governor of Russia's Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said Sunday that two defensive lines have been built and a third one would be finished by Nov. 5. Defensive lines were also established in the Belgorod region, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said. More defensive positions were being built in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, said Yevgeny Prigozhin, a millionaire Russian businessman who owns the Wagner Group, a mercenary military company that has played a prominent role in the war. Prigozhin said his company was constructing a ""Wagner line"" in the Luhansk region, another of the Ukrainian provinces Putin illegally annexed last month. Prigozhin posted images last week showing a section of newly built defenses and trench systems southeast of the town of Kreminna. The British Defense Ministry said Sunday ""the project suggests Russia is making a significant effort to prepare defenses in depth behind the current front line, likely to deter any rapid Ukrainian counteroffensives."" Russia's forces captured Luhansk several months ago. Pro-Moscow separatists declared independent republics in the region and neighboring Donetsk eight years ago, and Putin made controlling all of both provinces a goal at the war's outset. The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington, said Sunday that Russia's latest strategy of targeting power plants appeared aimed at diminishing Ukrainians' will to fight and forcing the government in Kyiv to devote more resources to protecting civilians and energy infrastructure. It said the effort was unlikely to damage Ukrainian morale but would have significant economic impacts. President Zelenskyy said Sunday that utilities workers were well on their way to restoring electricity supplies cut off by large-scale Russian missile strikes Saturday, but acknowledged that it would take longer to provide heating. Nine regions across Ukraine, from Odesa in the southwest to Kharkiv in the northeast, saw more attacks targeting energy and other critical infrastructure over the past day, the Ukrainian army's general staff said. It reported a total of 25 Russian airstrikes and more than 100 missile and artillery strikes around Ukraine. In response, Zelenskyy appealed to mayors and other local leaders to ensure that Ukrainians heed official calls to conserve energy. ""Now is definitely not the time for bright storefronts and signs,"" he said.",1.816287916008049,2.3653164031879794,-0.5490284871799305,3

""They're not acting 100% themselves right now,"" said refuge spokesman Taylor Logan. The animals had to be sedated to get some medical work done before a CBS News Colorado crew visited the Las Animas County facility this week. The Wild Animal Refuge isn't open to the public. It's a secondary space belonging to Weld County's popular The Wild Animal Sanctuary. The lions had quite the journey to get there. ""They flew from Romania to Dallas and got driven up,"" said Logan. Before all that, they were the pride of the zoo in Odessa, Ukraine. ""They're essentially like house cats if you break it down. Just bigger claws, bigger teeth. Everything's kind of escalated but they are very playful with each other. They like to wrestle just like your housecats will,"" said Logan. That life for the lions came to an end when Russia invaded Ukraine. They had to be evacuated to Romania to save them from the bombing. They stayed there while zookeepers tried to find them a new home. That's when Colorado's The Wild Animal Sanctuary got involved. ""When it seemed like it might be a longer-term thing and they were having trouble finding places, they gave us a call,"" said Logan. The lions went from a zoo habitat to living out their days in a brand new 80-acre enclosure where they are free to roam or just relax. It's quite the upgrade and adjustment for them. ""This is all a brand-new process,"" said Logan. ""It was a long trip for them, so they were a little on edge, a little hungry. Just wanted to get out of their smaller cages and we got them in here but within a day or two just giving them some space and giving them some fresh water, they started to calm down."" Despite everything, though, it's a far better fate than anyone could have imagined for them when the bombing began. ""They're very comfortable. Their personalities are out, and they all love to play,"" said Logan. The Wild Animal Sanctuary got 9 lions in total. Seven of them are down at the facility in Las Animas County but two are at their facility in Keenesburg.",4.359905896645141,3.5663558088193796,0.7935500878257611,0

Ukrainian officials confirmed at least half a dozen regions were targeted, including the capital city, Kyiv. The air force said it downed 18 out of 33 cruise missiles launched from air and sea. ""Several rockets"" targeting the capital were shot down on Saturday morning, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging service. Similar reports were made by the governors of six western and central provinces, as well as the southern Odesa region on the Black Sea. The attack is part of Russia's latest strategy. Over the past two weeks, Moscow has increased its attacks on key civilian infrastructure across Ukraine, as the country braces for a cold winter. About 40% of the country's electric power system has been severely damaged, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier in the week that 30% of Ukraine's power stations have been destroyed since Oct. 10. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people in central and western Ukraine woke up to power outages. The western city of Khmelnytskyi, which straddles the Bug river and was home to some 275,000 people before the war, was left with no electricity Saturday, shortly after local media reported several loud explosions. The city council urged local residents to store water, ""in case it's also gone within an hour,"" in a social media post on Saturday. The mayor of Lutsk, a city of 215,000 in Ukraine's far west, made a similar appeal on Telegram on Saturday. Power in Lutsk had been partially knocked out after Russian missiles slammed into local energy facilities, he said. The central city of Uman, a key pilgrimage center for Hasidic Jews which counted some 100,000 residents before the war, was also plunged into darkness after a rocket hit a nearby power station, regional authorities said on Telegram. In the capital and four surrounding regions, including Cherkasy, rolling blackouts came into effect on Saturday morning in response to the reduced power supplies. The state energy company Ukrenergo continued to urge all Ukrainians to conserve energy. Earlier this week, Zelenskyy called on consumers to curb their power use between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. daily, and avoid using energy-guzzling appliances such as electric heaters.",2.9028036489651172,2.1424928192322024,0.7603108297329149,5
2022-10-21,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/ukraine-news-russia-us-army-101st-airborne-nato-war-games-romania/,The U.S. Army's 101st Airborne is practicing for war with Russia just miles from Ukraine's border,"Mihail Kogălniceanu, Romania — The U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division has been deployed to Europe for the first time in almost 80 years amid soaring tension between Russia and the American-led NATO military alliance. The light infantry unit, nicknamed the ""Screaming Eagles,"" is trained to deploy on any battlefield in the world within hours, ready to fight. CBS News joined the division's Deputy Commander, Brigadier General John Lubas, and Colonel Edwin Matthaidess, Commander of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, on a Black Hawk helicopter for the hour-long ride to the very edge of NATO territory — only around three miles from Romania's border with Ukraine. From the moment Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, his forces have advanced northward from the Crimean Peninsula, a Ukrainian region that Moscow illegally seized control of in 2014. For more than seven months, Russian troops have tried to push along the Black Sea coast into the Kherson region, aiming to capture the key Ukrainian port cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa. Their goal is to cut off all Ukrainian access to the sea, leaving the country and its military forces landlocked. That threat, so close to NATO territory in Romania, is why one of America's most elite air assault divisions has been sent in, with some heavy equipment. ""We're ready to defend every inch of NATO soil,"" Lubas told CBS News. ""We bring a unique capability, from our air assault capability… We're a light infantry force, but again, we bring that mobility with us, for our aircraft and air assaults."" Skirting northward along Romania's Black Sea coast, the Black Hawk eventually touched down at a forward operating site where U.S. and Romanian troops were pounding targets during a joint ground and air assault exercise. The tank rounds and artillery fire were real. The drill was meant to recreate the battles Ukraine's forces are fighting every day against Russian troops, just across the border. The war games so close to that border are a clear message to Russia and to America's NATO allies, that the U.S. Army is here. ""The real meaning for me, to have the American troops here, is like if you were to have allies in Normandy before any enemy was there,"" Romanian Major General Lulian Berdila told CBS News, referring to the landmark World War II battle on France's north coast. The American forces have been establishing a garrison at the Romanian military's air base. In all, about 4,700 soldiers from the 101st Airborne's home base in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, have been deployed to reinforce NATO's eastern flank. Matthaidess told CBS News that he and his troops were the closest American forces to the fighting in Ukraine. From their vantage point, they've been ""closely watching"" the Russian forces, ""building objectives to practice against"" and conducting drills that ""replicate exactly what's going on"" in the war. ""It keeps us on our toes,"" he said. The ""Screaming Eagles"" commanders told CBS News repeatedly that they are always ""ready to fight tonight,"" and while they're there to defend NATO territory, if the fighting escalates or there's any attack on NATO, they're fully prepared to cross the border into Ukraine.",2.2641629138961648,1.776385834631134,0.48777707926503067,0

""He has asked everyone to respect his privacy at this time,"" Cramer said. ""I intend to do that."" Cramer and the state's other Republican senator, John Hoeven, said they are grateful for Groszhans' safe return home. Groszhans, from Ashley, North Dakota, has ancestors from Ukraine and went there to farm in 2017.

Groszhans and his assistant were arrested on charges of plotting to assassinate Leshchenko, who was then Ukraine's agriculture minister. Groszhans said in a statement Friday that the Ukrainian officials made up the charges in an ""effort to shut me up"" after he discovered corruption ""at the highest levels"" of the government. ""I am grateful to be home after this horrible ordeal,"" Groszhans said. ""My family and supporters worked tirelessly over a long period of time to make this happen, and it was nice to be able to celebrate my birthday on North Dakota soil.

2022-10-21,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-us-nuclear-fusion-iter-cooperation-amid-energy-crisis-ukraine-war/,"Amid global energy crisis, U.S. and Russia still working together in quest for unlimited, clean power from nuclear fusion","Saint-Paul-lez-Durance, France — As global energy prices soar, 35 countries are working together at a sprawling facility nestled in the French countryside to try to create a new source of unlimited, clean power for the entire planet. Their ambition is to harness the power of the stars: nuclear fusion. Some of the participating countries — which include the United States, Russia, China, India, South Korea, Japan, and the nations of the European Union — are frequent collaborators, but some are major adversaries on the world stage. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted an unprecedented barrage of sanctions against Moscow from some partner nations, for example, and in response, Moscow has restricted its natural gas supplies to Europe, exacerbating the energy crisis. But despite the animosity among some of the partners, construction on the multibillion-dollar fusion project known as ITER — which means ""the way"" in Latin, and is short for ""International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor"" — continues. It's ""separate from the war in Ukraine,"" Tim Luce, director of science at ITER, told CBS News in his office at the massive work site. ""The need for energy is universal, and if one entity has it and another doesn't, it doesn't matter who — which flags or which hats — we put on the people. The inequity will always cause conflict."" Nuclear fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars. It has fascinated scientists for decades — and eluded their efforts to harness it. In fusion, small atoms, such as hydrogen, are fused together to generate energy. It's the opposite of the nuclear fission process used in today's nuclear power plants, which splits atoms apart. Fission, while offering many benefits, also comes with some risks: There have been well-known cases of nuclear fission reactors melting down and spills contaminating large areas. Scientists believe fusion, on the other hand, would provide a clean, safe, and unlimited energy source — if the process can be mastered. ""It can't run away. It's a very difficult reaction to sustain; it needs to be driven. Whereas fission can run on a chain reaction, and it has to be controlled,"" explained Luce. Fusion also creates much less radioactive byproduct, and what it does leave behind is ""not water soluble — they won't get into the food supply, the water supply."" Under the umbrella of the ITER project, the 35 partnering nations are building the world's largest ""tokamak"" — a giant, doughnut-shaped contraption made of incredibly powerful magnets. ITER bills its tokamak as the ""world's most complex machine."" Entering the building site in France is like visiting a mini-United Nations. Security is tight, and inside, staff from all over the globe are hard at work. Giant magnets and other parts are readied for assembly in a huge warehouse, where dozens of people in white clean-suits attend to pieces of equipment so massive they look as though they could be from, or for, another world. ""Every time you come in, it's different,"" Luce said, standing under a giant, hollow, kidney-shaped piece of machinery called Sector Module 7. Next door, in a partially underground area, is the seven-story ""pit."" This is where Sector Module 7 will eventually be welded to other sector modules to create the hollow, doughnut-shaped tokamak. ""You get a real feeling that things are moving,"" Luce said, looking around the site. The tokamak will, ITER hopes, create net energy by producing more power from the fusion reaction than is required to trigger it. That would demonstrate that it's possible to create commercially viable fusion energy using similar technology. Fusion ""has the highest promise of any energy source,"" Luce told CBS News. ""It doesn't depend on the sun being out. You can site it anywhere. If it proves, as we expect, to be completely safe, you can site it near where the energy is consumed, so you don't lose anything in transmitting energy from place to place. So it seems ideal. Some people say it seems too good to be true, but I think it's worth it for us to go find out whether it is able to be done or not."" The current animosity between Russia and the West mirrors the circumstances around the history of ITER's foundation. The international science experiment was born out of an attempt to cool tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. ""It came out of their weapons programs,"" Luce said. ""This became a bridge between these different political entities, to be able to talk to each other."" In 1985, then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met to discuss how they might ease the tension between the two superpowers. ""They didn't agree on much, except that they would jointly work on fusion as an energy source,"" Luce said. The idea for the ITER project developed from that meeting, taking various iterations over the years until it grew to include the 35 partner nations involved today, many of which have sent scientists, engineers, or project managers to work at, and live around, the site in France. ""I came to my first ITER meeting in 1989, so it's been quite a wait to actually see these objects being made,"" Luce said. ""It's really coming to the point where we're almost there, but we have to complete the task."" The various nations working on ITER are responsible for building different parts of the tokamak. ITER says 85% of the parts are being manufactured within the borders of member countries, so they can develop their domestic fusion capacities and industries. After the parts are built, they're sent to the site in France where they are stored in massive warehouses near the main worksite until it's time for them to be added to the overall assembly. There have been delays to ITER's timeline over the years, and when the COVID-19 pandemic mired global transport and supply chains in 2020, there were more. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February caused further complications. There was concern, for example, that one of the Russian-built magnets for ITER might face hurdles making it to France from St. Petersburg. ""We're outside of the national sanctions, so to speak, but we have to convince various entities that that's true, and that they'll accept that. They don't have to accept it,"" Luce told CBS News. ""There has been some slowing. Obviously, we're subject to the global market and the global supply chain. Just like with COVID, we had issues with transportation. Now we still have issues with transportation, just because it requires special permission for ships of a certain flag to go from place to place, and we have large objects that can only be moved by ship. So we have to deal with this. But it's working."" While some other major international scientific bodies, including the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), have severed ties with Russia and publicly condemned its invasion of Ukraine, ITER has not. ""We have a charge. We have members. We're a treaty organization. We don't take a position on political stance. We have a purpose,"" Luce said. ""On the other hand, it's good to be mindful that we are a bridge for communication. We have a common need. We have a common means to talk to each other. And so, this is what fusion has been in the past: It was a vehicle for political entities who didn't agree on much else to have a way of talking to each other."" The U.S. government is betting on fusion energy. In March, the White House announced a plan to accelerate fusion's commercial development over the coming decades through continued investment in ITER and by working with the private sector. It heralded fusion's ""potential to revolutionize the energy industry, helping combat the climate crisis while meeting the growing electricity needs of the U.S. and the world."" ""Of the more than 30 fusion companies in the world, two-thirds are based in the U.S., and most were founded in the last decade,"" the White House said. ""By partnering with these companies, we have an opportunity to keep these companies growing within our borders and cement U.S. technological leadership on fusion."" The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is chaired by Senator Joe Manchin, who visited the ITER facility earlier this year. The committee recently held a hearing to examine how the federal government could further support the commercial development of fusion energy. ""Touring a facility dedicated to international scientific and engineering collaboration among our geopolitical rivals, including Russia, including China — they still paying? — and allies, helps restore faith in what we can do together, given so much conflict at present,"" Manchin said. ""For me, fusion provides a vision of, and potential pathway toward, world peace."" Luce, who testified at the hearing, said ITER would help the U.S. achieve its fusion goals. Other experts urged the U.S. to maximize public support for the private fusion sector in the United States to help America become a leader in the field. ""The race to fusion is also a race for future global leadership,"" said Dr. Scott C. Hsu, lead fusion coordinator at the Office of the Undersecretary for Science and Innovation at the U.S. Department of Energy. ""While fusion has long enjoyed international collaboration and should continue to do so, make no mistake, fusion is now also an international competition. Failure to act now may relegate the U.S. to being importers rather than exporters of fusion technology."" Despite its massive scale and multibillion-dollar budget, Luce stressed to CBS News that ITER is still an experiment, and many obstacles must be overcome before fusion becomes a viable commercial energy source. Even if and when the ITER tokamak is eventually completed, it will not be a power plant — it's an experiment designed to inform the construction of a subsequent demonstration fusion power plant, which would still need to be built. There are also possible supply issues with a material needed to fuel ITER's fusion reactions, as well as growing competition from other fusion projects using newer or different technologies. But regardless of who gets there first, Luce said fusion could be the world's best bet at developing an unlimited source of clean energy that doesn't destroy the environment. ""I am hopeful about the energy future, because I think we have in hand a solution,"" Luce said. ""Fusion is not going to fix today's problem. It will solidify the solution that we find and make it permanent, make it extensible, make it sustainable in a way that society can count on it. That's our dream. That's our goal. Oftentimes we're too focused on short-term returns. This is the long-term goal, and we have to ensure that. Because if we don't invest now, it won't be here when we need it.""",3.991763744883939,1.7219892142846187,2.2697745305993204,4

The 28-year-old posted an image on Instagram, apparently showing himself in a Ukrainian military uniform. In the caption, Kennedy says he was ""deeply moved by what I saw happening in Ukraine over the past year."" CBS News has not independently verified Kennedy's claims. CBS News has reached out to the legion, Military Defense of Ukraine and Kennedy for comment and is awaiting response. ""I told one person here [in the U.S.] where I was, and I told one person there [in Ukraine] my real name,"" he said. ""I didn't want my family or friends to worry, and I didn't want to be treated differently there."" He said he had no prior military experience ""and wasn't a great shot,"" but he ""could carry heavy things and learned fast."" ""I was also willing to die there,"" he writes. ""So they soon agreed to send me to the northeastern front."" Kennedy said his time in Ukraine was short and he liked being a soldier more than he expected. Anyone with ""a strong will to defend world peace"" can join the legion, which enlists troops from around the world to help fight for Ukraine. Those who wish to enlist can contact the Ukrainian Embassy in their country and interview for the role. The war in Ukraine began in February, when Russian President Vladimir Putin began an unprovoked attack on the country. Russia launched new airstrikes this week, insisting it is only targeting power installations. Russia has hammered Ukraine's energy and water supplies, and as power cuts spread through the country, civilians are being urged to ration power. Civilians are also being killed daily by ""suicide drones,"" launched by Russia along with its missiles. Last month, the Biden administration announced it will send another $600 million in military aid to Ukraine. This week, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. will continue to support Ukraine ""as best as we can,"" but reiterated that the U.S. will not put troops on the ground in Ukraine. The U.S. is leading and coordinating international efforts to get additional weapons and capabilities to the country, Kirby said. In his post, Kennedy said his friends in Ukraine knew why he had to come home. ""l'll always owe them for their example. I know I'm lucky I made it back, but I would also take all the risks we took over again,"" he said. He called the war horrific and praised the brave people he met. He encouraged others to join the legion or help in other ways, like sending medical supplies. Kennedy is the son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his first wife Mary Richardson Kennedy. He made headlines for dating Taylor Swift in 2012. His grandfather was assassinated in 1968 while running for president, and his great-uncle, President John F. Kennedy Jr., was assassinated in 1963 while in office. His Instagram post was quickly filled with supportive comments. ""Conor. Oh Conor,"" his stepmother, actress Cheryl Hines, wrote, including a string of heart emojis. ""I love you big brother,"" his sister, Kyra Kennedy wrote. ""You are the bravest man I've ever known, my love,"" his girlfriend, singer Giulia, wrote.

Security Council meeting late Wednesday, the U.S., U.K. and France accused Iran of selling drones to Russia in violation of a U.N. Security Council ban against the transfer of drones. Russia has used drones in a series of devastating attacks on Ukrainian cities this past week. Both Russia and Iran claimed to reporters that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or drones, were not sold by Iran to Russia, and not used in conflict. Nate Evans, spokesperson and communications director for the U.S. Mission to the U.N., called for an ""expert briefing"" in the Security Council ""on recent evidence that Russia illegally procured Iranian UAVs that it is using in its war on Ukraine."" Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, wrote a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres Tuesday requesting U.N experts visit Ukraine to inspect the recovered UAVs which have been used to attack Ukrainian cities. The attacks have caused about 30% of Ukraine's power to shut down. In his letter, Kyslytsya noted that the drones used in the attacks meet the requirements under U.N. Security Council resolution 2231, passed in 2015, which bans the transfer of drones capable of traveling more than 300 kilometers. ""The United States began warning in July that Iran was planning to transfer UAVs to Russia for use in Russia's brutal war against Ukraine, and we now have abundant evidence that these UAVs are being used to strike Ukrainian civilians and critical civilian infrastructure,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement following the meeting. Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said that the 15-nation Security Council had no authority to send inspectors, an issue that will be taken up on Friday in an open Security Council meeting on Ukraine. Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's U.N. ambassador, denied that Iran transferred drones to Russia for use in the war. James Kariuki, U.K.'s deputy ambassador to the U.N., tweeted Wednesday that ""Iran has obligations not to export these weapons."" On Wednesday, self-detonating drones launched by Russia struck power plants, and forced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to convene an emergency meeting to avoid what he called a ""breakdown of [Ukraine's] energy system."" Beginning about a week ago, Russia launched a flurry of attacks using Iranian-made self-detonating drones packed with explosives. Since the first kamikaze drone was launched last month, Ukraine claims it has shot down 223 of them.

On Wednesday, self-detonating drones launched by Russia struck power plants, and forced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to convene an emergency meeting to avoid what he called a ""breakdown of [Ukraine's] energy system."" Retired U.S. Gen. Frank McKenzie, who was at one point in charge of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, said the 11-foot-by-8-foot drone carries a relatively small 90-pound warhead that is powerful enough to destroy transformer yards. ""If you launch enough of them, the theory is you will be able to overcome air defense, because they fly at low altitudes, and they're very cheap to produce,"" McKenzie told CBS News. He added that Iran produces thousands of the drones. Since the first self-detonating drone was launched last month, Ukraine claims it has shot down 223 of them. U.S. officials estimate Ukraine has a roughly 50% success rate, which would mean Russia has launched nearly 450 drones. A 50% rate means more than 200 have gotten through, even though the Ukrainians use everything from guided missiles to small arms fire to try to bring them down. ""They don't necessarily fly a straight line,"" McKenzie said. ""They can do dog legs, different routes to try to avoid where they think you have your own air defenses up that can shoot at them.""",1.872484690413448,1.4970522793927439,0.3754324110207041,3

2022-10-18,https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/how-air-defense-systems-work-ukraine-russia-ballistic-cruise-missiles/,How air defense systems work and why Ukraine is eager for more protection,"Iain Boyd is a professor of aerospace engineering sciences at University of Colorado—Boulder. Ukraine has received a broad array of military supplies from the U.S. and other allies. Recently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an urgent plea specifically for additional air defense resources from the West in response to increased air attacks by Russia. To understand Zelenskyy's emphasis on air defense, it's important to look at the types of air weapons that Ukraine faces and how air defenses work to counteract those threats. It's also important to understand why this type of warfare is all about the number of assets each side has at its disposal. On Oct. 10, 2022, Russia launched a large barrage of airborne weapons against a variety of targets in Ukraine. The types of weapons involved in the attack included short-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. Ballistic missiles are accelerated by rockets from the ground or from aircraft, tend to follow a predictable path and are somewhat easier to track. Cruise missiles carry a propulsion system that allows them to maintain speed and fly more unpredictable flight paths, including trajectories that are close to the ground. They are much more difficult to detect, track and shoot down. Then, on Oct. 17, Russia launched a barrage of explosive drones at Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv. Explosive drones, known as loitering munitions, tend to be small weapons that are difficult to defend against. By circling overhead, they are able to surveil a region of interest, gathering information before identifying a specific target to attack. Russia has acquired explosive drones from Iran, according to U.S. officials. The defense against all such air threats involves an integrated system of several elements. Early warning radars located at Ukraine's borders first detect the approach of missiles. These weapons are further tracked along their flight trajectories by a dispersed network of additional radars. The primary defensive countermeasure against ballistic and cruise missiles involves surface-to-air missiles: You destroy a missile using a missile. This is no easy feat because the SAM must track, home in on and hit a high-speed target that may be changing direction. In the U.S., key strategic assets such as the White House are protected against aerial attack by the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS). NASAMS was designed to counteract a variety of incoming threats, including cruise missiles, aircraft and drones. Each NASAMS contains 12 interceptor SAMs. No information is available publicly on its effectiveness. NASAMS is one of the options being considered by the U.S. to help support Ukraine. Another notable example of an air defense system is the Israeli Iron Dome. The system is designed to defend against rockets and artillery shells launched from up to 155 miles (250 kilometers) away. Each Iron Dome missile battery consists of three to four missile launchers, each with up to 20 interceptor SAMs. The system is reported to have a 90% kill rate for rockets launched against Israel. Veteran national security correspondent Mark Thompson described Iron Dome as possibly the most effective missile defense system the world has seen. Both NASAMS and Iron Dome are reported to be effective against drones. However, SAMs are an expensive way to defend against such low-cost targets, and they could be overwhelmed by large numbers of drones. Directed energy weapons such as high-energy lasers are being developed and deployed to provide a potentially more cost-effective approach to neutralizing low-cost drones. The significance of the plea by Zelenskyy for additional air defense systems can be understood in the context of a numbers game. Different air defense systems have a range of effectiveness against different aerial threats. However, none of the defense systems is 100% effective. Moreover, an adversary can significantly reduce the effectiveness of air defense by launching salvos of multiple weapons simultaneously. Therefore, an attacker can always overwhelm a defender if the attacker has more attack missiles than the defender has defensive missiles. Conversely, a sufficient number of defensive systems may cause an attacker to stop firing altogether. It becomes a war of attrition, with the winner being the side with the most missiles. Ukraine likely has sufficient air defenses to protect strategic military targets such as command and control centers and ammunition dumps. They do not have coverage of many other key assets such as transportation hubs and power and water facilities, the types of targets Russian forces have been targeting in recent days. Should the West agree to provide significant numbers of air defense systems to Ukraine, it could significantly change the course of the conflict. At some point, Russia will have to confront the finite depth of its missile stockpile. The number of remaining Russian high-precision missiles is already reported to be running low. Without the ability to wear down and demoralize Ukraine through airstrikes, Russia would be faced with the much more daunting and drawn-out prospect of relying solely on ground forces to grind out its objectives.

Moscow insists it is only targeting power installations, and it has indeed hammered Ukraine's energy and water supplies, including a power plant in Kyiv that was hit Tuesday. With power cuts already spreading as Ukraine's harsh winter approaches — and with civilians being killed daily by the ongoing barrage of ""suicide drones"" that Russia is launching along with its missiles — Kyiv's mayor and Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy have labeled Russia a ""terrorist state."" A swarm of the Iranian-made, explosives-packed drones slammed into buildings in Kyiv on Monday killing four people, including Viktoria Zamchenko, who was reportedly six months pregnant with her first child. Ukraine claims Russia has ordered nearly 2,500 suicide drones from Iran, reportedly at a cost of around $20,000 each, a fraction of the price of a guided missile. Iran has denied that it is providing Russia with weapons for the war, but the Reuters news agency reported Tuesday, citing unnamed Iranian sources, that Tehran had actually agreed to provide Russia with even more weapons in a new deal arranged during an early-October visit by Iranian security officials to Moscow. The deal, which CBS News could not independently verify, apparently saw Iran promise not only drones, but surface-to-surface missiles. Ukraine's foreign minister said Tuesday that he was submitting a proposal to Zelenskyy to sever the country's diplomatic ties with Tehran completely over its provision of drones to Russia. Last week, a top British intelligence official said the Russian military's ""supplies and munitions are running out."" ""The world must stop this terror,"" Zelenskyy said Monday night, renewing his months-long plea for Western nations to provide Ukraine with more, and more advanced, air defense systems. Many of Ukraine's cities, including Kyiv, had been relatively calm for months. But since General Sergei Surovikin, or ""General Armageddon"" as he's also known, took over as commander of Putin's struggling war effort, Moscow has increasingly relied on the small, relatively cheap suicide drones, and they could have a significant impact on the course of the war. Russia's goal, according to Ukrainian officials, appears to be to destroy enough infrastructure and civilian lives that support for the war wanes inside Ukraine, and among its international partners. While there's been no indication that the Russian tactic is working to that end, Ukrainian officials have started warning people to brace for a difficult winter. ""The situation is critical now across the country,"" Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of President Zelenksyy's office said on television. ""The whole country needs to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages."" Zelenskyy said in a tweet that ""30% of Ukraine's power stations"" had been destroyed over the last week alone, leading to ""massive blackouts across the country."" The power cuts were already hitting parts of the capital, the Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv, and Dnipro in the south. ""The terrorist state will not change anything for itself with such actions,"" Zelenksyy said in another message posted to the Telegram messaging app. ""It will only confirm its destructive and murderous essence, for which it will certainly be held to account."" In the meantime, Ukrainian civilians continue to pay the price. ""They [Russians] probably get pleasure from this,"" the owner of a flower shop in the southern city of Mykolaiv told the Reuters news agency after a Russian missile slammed into a nearby apartment building, killing one person and damaging his store. ""They get pleasure from us feeling bad. I think they want us to bomb and shell [their] city buildings. But we won't do that, to be different from them.""",1.069190821746055,1.8491567307201395,-0.7799659089740845,5

""With two decrees, the Russian government has unilaterally terminated our interests in Sakhalin-1, and the project has been transferred to a Russian operator,"" an Exxon Mobil spokeswoman said. She didn't disclose whether Exxon received compensation for the assets, but added that Exxon plans to reserve its legal rights under international law and its production-sharing agreement to pursue remedies. Russia's move to seize Exxon's assets come after seven months of negotiations over a transfer of the company's stake in the Sakhalin-1 project, according to Reuters, which first reported on Exxon's move to complete its withdrawal from the country. ""We made every effort to engage with the Russian government and other stakeholders,"" an Exxon spokesperson told the news service. In March, the energy giant announced it planned to exit Russia in response to the nation's invasion of Ukraine and that it would not make any new investments in Russia. Exxon's Russia holdings were valued at more than $4 billion as of 2021, according to company documents. The Sakhalin-1 project, which Exxon has managed since 2005, has generated $16 billion for the Russian government, according to Exxon. Earlier this year, Exxon took a $3.4 billion after-tax charge for its Sakhalin-1 assets. It also said the operations represented less than 2% of its total 2021 production, or about 65,000 barrels per day, and 1% of its operating earnings. The fallout from the Sakhalin-1 project highlights the clash between Western nations and Russia over Putin's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. The U.S. and other Western democracies have imposed sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion, aiming to weaken the country's economy, which is largely dependent on energy exports. Russia, one of the world's top three crude producers, joined with other members of OPEC+ earlier this month to sharply cut production to support sagging oil prices. Economists believe such a move could deal the struggling global economy another blow, while also raising politically sensitive gas pump prices for U.S. drivers just ahead of key national elections.",1.8365415497229176,3.63994105960902,-1.8033995098861022,4

SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet services have been a vital source of communication for the country's military during the war with Russia, but as CNN exclusively reported earlier this week, SpaceX warned the Pentagon that it may stop funding the service in Ukraine unless the US military kicks in tens of millions of dollars per month, according to documents obtained by CNN. The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine's government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months. The report elicited a torrent of tweets from social media users both defending and criticizing the move. A tweet from Musk's verified account posted Saturday said, ""The hell with it ... even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free."" Since they first started arriving in Ukraine last spring, the Starlink satellite internet terminals made by Musk's SpaceX have allowed Ukraine's military to fight and stay connected even as cellular phone and internet networks have been destroyed in its war with Russia. A Pentagon spokesperson said Friday afternoon that it had been in communication with SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product as well as other topics. In response Saturday to a follower who replied to Musk's tweet, ""No good deed goes unpunished,"" Musk said, ""Even so, we should still do good deeds."" Musk on Friday had doubled down on SpaceX's request to the Pentagon in a series of tweets. ""SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable,"" read one post from Musk's verified account. He also said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk's Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: ""F*** off."" Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk's claimed peace plan for Russia's Ukraine war by saying: ""F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk."" SpaceX's suggestion that it would stop funding Starlink also came amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk's allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he ""still very much support[s] Ukraine"" but fears ""massive escalation."" One Ukrainian official, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, appeared to extend an olive branch in a tweet posted Friday, writing, ""Let's be honest. Like it or not, @elonmusk helped us survive the most critical moments of war."" ""Business has the right to its own strategies,"" Podolyak's tweet read.

The assaults reportedly killed at least eight people and came after a week of massive, coordinated Russian air strikes across the country. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in Ukraine, but as CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reported, one of the neighborhoods hit in Kyiv on Monday is packed with apartment buildings, schools and restaurants. Apartment blocks and a non-residential building were set alight in the capital's central Shevchenko district, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska tweeted photos of the damage in the capital and said three people were killed when a drone hit the apartment building, including a pregnant woman. ""Civilians, children, pregnant women — the ones RF [Russian Federation] is actually fighting with,"" said Zelenska, vowing that ""Ukrainians will never forget who murdered our relatives."" Emergency services later said a total of four people were killed in the strike on the building in the capital, and four others in drone strikes on the Sumy region. News photographers caught images of some of the drones as they flew into Kyiv, with triangle-shaped wings and a pointed warhead clearly visible against the blue sky. Drones came in several waves and buzzed overhead with angry hums from their engines. Videos posted to social media, including one seemingly taken by the body-camera worn by a member of Ukraine's national police force, showed security forces taking aim at the small aircraft from the ground with rifles. Russian strikes over the past week have hit apartment buildings and other civilian infrastructure, but also targeted infrastructure, including power facilities. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said the strikes on Monday hit critical energy infrastructure in three regions, knocking out electricity to hundreds of towns and villages. ""Russian terrorists once again attacked the energy infrastructure of Ukraine in three regions,"" Shmygal said, noting five strikes in Kyiv, in addition to attacks in the Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions. ""Hundreds of settlements were cut off as a result of the attack,"" he said. Explosions were heard from the same central Kyiv district where a missile strike a week ago tore a hole in a children's playground. Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, wrote in a post on the Telegram social media site that Russian forces struck Kyiv with Iranian Shahed drones. Russia has repeatedly been using the self-detonating drones in recent weeks to target urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations. ""The Russians think it will help them, but it shows their desperation,"" he said, according to AFP. ""All night and all morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday. ""Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine. The enemy can attack our cities but it won't be able to break us."" Strikes in central Kyiv became a rarity in the last several months after Russian forces failed to capture the capital in the beginning of the war. Last week's early morning strikes were the first explosions heard in Kyiv's city center in several months and put Kyiv as well as the rest of the country back on edge as the war nears the nine month mark. Monday's blasts seemed to continue what many fear could become more common occurrences in urban centers. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week's strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Putin blames Ukraine for masterminding the blast, which suspended traffic over the bridge and curtailed Moscow's ability to use the bridge to supply Russian troops in the occupied regions of southern Ukraine. The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Zelenskyy said in his evening address Sunday that there was heavy fighting around the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region. The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the bulk of the industrial east known as the Donbas, and were two of four regions annexed by Russia in September in defiance of international law. On Sunday, the Russian-backed regime in the Donetsk region said Ukraine had shelled its central administrative building in a direct hit.

What lives had they lived? We promised ourselves, then, that we would return to tell the stories of the lost souls of Bucha. At St. Andrew's Church, in the days before Orthodox Easter, 116 souls rose from the grave. The town of Bucha was excavating the trench to rebury each victim with respect and with their name. Photos of the dead were posted online, DNA was taken. And families grieved to learned the fate of the missing. Inside, St. Andrew's was illuminated by prayer and, last month, we asked some of the families to join us there to introduce us to the ones they loved. ""My father, Viktor, worked as a set designer for TV studios,"" Dmytro Kozyarevich told us. He identified his father and his mother, Nadiya, from photos of the dead. Dmytro Kozyarevich (translation): She was very kind, and I feel her absence very much. Scott Pelley: Viktor was 75. Nadiya was 65. They were in their apartment, minding their own business. And I wonder if you know how they died. Dmytro Kozyarevich (translation): According to what our neighbors told us, there was a tank 120 [yards] away. Perhaps someone inside the tank just had the urge to shoot at something, so they chose this building. My mother died from the blast wave. My father died [crushed by] pieces of the brick wall. Mr. and Mrs. Kozyarevich, married 43 years, were found, days later, in their apartment. Atrocities, like theirs, were what we saw in April—the senseless slaughter of civilians. Bucha, 20 miles from Kyiv, was a modern suburb of 37,000, with big box stores and apartment blocks. But over 27 days in March its people suffered a distinct kind of cruelty—the cruelty inflicted by soldiers facing defeat. 458 were killed--their forsaken bodies calling out to Serhii Kaplychnyi, the Bucha city official in charge of burials. Serhii Kaplychnyi (translation): There were bodies just lying in the streets. We understood that they must be buried, but we didn't know how to go about it. The Russians had left them where they fell--on the street, at their own homes. Serhii Kaplychnyi had to negotiate with the Russians for permission to gather them. We spoke with him and the men who worked with him, Serhii Matiuk and Vladyslav Minchenko. Scott Pelley: I imagine that a mass grave was the last thing that you wanted. Why was it necessary? Serhii Matiuk (translation): There was no more room in the morgue. Serhii Kaplychnyi (translation): We were just placing bodies near the morgue because we had no idea what to do anymore. Scott Pelley: Serhii, where were you finding bodies around town and what kind of condition were they in? Serhii Kaplychnyi (translation): With a lot of the bodies, it was obvious it was the work of a sniper because they were shot in the head. Serhii Matiuk (translation): Some were riding their bicycle, some were bringing firewood in their car, loaded in their car… remember, we picked up that man and woman? They had just loaded firewood into their car and were bringing it back to heat their home. They were shot. Scott Pelley: Was it possible for you to determine how these people had been killed? Vladyslav Minchenko (translation): Most often they shot people in the back. Those who were killed walking down the road – they were shot in the back. The [people] we gathered from the basements – they were all shot in the back. People were on their knees, blindfolded... Serhii Matiuk (translation): The people who were tied up, they were tortured. They were shot… first in a leg or arm, and then the finishing shot was to the head. The Russians were killing too many too fast. There was no electricity for refrigeration. A temporary mass grave was inevitable. Kaplychnyi's only choice in the matter was to dig it in the shadow of god. Vladyslav Minchenko (translation): None of them deserved to die this way. God sees everything. Because of the way they died, their deaths…these people will never be forgotten. Their names, their faces. Let people remember and know that this was done by Russia. For what? For nothing. Most of those killed for nothing were men, but there were also 86 women and 9 children. Some, hands tied, were executed. Elena Rubailo's husband was discovered in the mass grave. Elena Rubailo (translation): He laid in the street for a week and a half until they picked him up and brought him to the [mass grave] He'd been shot in the head. Volodymyr Rubailo was 70. His body was found near a store where he shopped. But like nearly all of the bereaved, Elena has no idea why he was killed. Elena Rubailo (translation): This year would have been our 50th wedding anniversary, but he didn't quite live to see it. We loved each other very much. We had two children, two girls. Volodymyr, retired from a forest management company, stayed in Bucha to watch their home while Elena sheltered in her daughter's basement on the edge of town. Elena Rubailo (translation): There were 21 people, [in the basement], 9 children and 12 adults. We took the neighbors into the basement too. One of our neighbors was shot [March] 4th. He walked out of his gate, and he was killed. And a little further up that same street, a son was driving to his parents' home. He was 10 [yards] away, him and his girlfriend and a friend, and they were all shot in their car. That poor mother, dragging her own son in the door and burying [all of] them in the garden. Just horrible. Scott Pelley: What does Volodymyr's death tell us about this war? Elena Rubailo (translation): This war is terrible. These aren't humans. Could humans really do this? Just come in and kill people... A person just walking down the street… How?? I don't know. This is a terrible war. I pray for our Ukraine every day--for our soldiers. My heart hurts every day when I hear and see this ruin, these rockets flying. So many children have died, so many women, young girls. My heart hurts. My heart really hurts. In Bucha, heartache is part of being. Father Andriy Halavin, the priest of St. Andrew's, told us, ""Since the occupation I've had to bury more than 200 people."" Scott Pelley: And you have buried people who have no name? Father Andriy Halavin (translation): Out of the people whom I buried, 75 had not been identified. Scott Pelley: How do you say a funeral mass for someone who has no name? Father Andriy Halavin (translation): God knows each person's name. He does not distinguish people by whether they are living or dead. For him, everyone is alive. As Christians, we believe in resurrection after death. That's why for God, there is no difference. Of all the bereaved who met us at St. Andrew's, none lost more than Oleksandr Chikmariov. Oleksandr Chikmariov (translation): [They were] my happiness. [They were] my everything. I wish I could bring everything back. Chikmariov and his wife, Rita, tried to flee the shelling of Bucha. In their car, with their sons, 9-year-old Matviy and 4-year-old Klym, they came across a Russian armored vehicle. Oleksandr Chikmariov (translation): We stopped. Rita yelled for me to make a U-turn and drive back. I heard shots. I turned to the back seat, and Rita shouted [""I'm hit!""] Rita and my children were dead. I was in such shock; I didn't notice that my leg was only hanging on by a piece of skin. I didn't even feel the pain. I got down behind the car, and then the car burst into flames. Oleksandr Chikmariov was rescued by firemen and watched his family burn. He wanted us to see his family so he led us, on his artificial leg, across the street from St. Andrew's. Their home happened to be next to the makeshift cemetery where his family was first laid to rest. Remembering lives like these, lost to the Russian invasion, is the reason we returned to Bucha. Scott Pelley: What would you like the world to remember about them? Oleksandr Chikmariov (translation): For the world to remember…well... So much joy. Such a thirst for life. Why did he have to die? For what? It doesn't make any sense. Why? It doesn't make sense, in any world, to kill them. Why? What was he killed for? How can I go on living? Just to keep crying, and keep breathing? What should I do? What else can I do? He's not here anymore, I cannot hug him, I cannot kiss him, I cannot do anything. They were the meaning of my life. How can I live with this? How? Just hold on and endure? To just endure, to fight everything inside of myself? What should I do next? I don't know how to live. Scott Pelley: I am so very sorry. Bucha is learning how to live again. In the fresh earth of the city cemetery, bodies from the mass grave have been laid to rest with dignity. But, about 50 remain unidentified. This marker reads, ""here lies number 282,"" ""remember forever."" The city says it will work forever to replace each number with a name. The bereaved will know what lives were lost but never the reason why. Produced by Maria Gavrilovic and Alex Ortiz. Broadcast associate, Michelle Karim.

The ministry said in a statement that the shooting took place in the Belgorod region in southwestern Russia that borders Ukraine. It said that the two men from an unnamed ex-Soviet nation fired on soldiers during target practice and were killed by return fire. The ministry called the incident a terrorist attack. The shooting comes amid a hasty mobilization ordered by President Vladimir Putin to beef up Russian forces in Ukraine — a move that triggered protests and caused hundreds of thousands to flee Russia. Putin said on Friday that over 220,000 reservists already had been called up as part of an effort to recruit 300,000. Even though the Russian leader declared that only people who had recently served in the military will be subject to the call-up, activists and rights groups reported military conscription offices rounding up people without any army experience — some of whom were also unfit for service for medical reasons. Some of the freshly called-up reservists posted videos of them being forced to sleep on the floor or even outside and given rusty weapons before being sent to the front lines. Authorities have acknowledged that the mobilization was often poorly organized and promised to improve the situation.",1.7870796261311643,1.2229341024536482,0.5641455236775161,3

Musk had said on Friday that SpaceX would not be able to pay for Starlink in Ukraine indefinitely. And the U.S. military confirmed it was communicating with the billionaire's company about funding for the key network. The discussions come as Musk has been embroiled in public spats with Ukrainian leaders who were angered by his controversial proposals for de-escalating the conflict, which included acknowledging Russian sovereignty over Crimea. Starlink, a constellation of more than 3,000 small satellites in low Earth orbit, has been vital to Ukraine's communications as it fights against Russia's invasion. SpaceX has donated some 25,000 ground terminals to Ukraine, according to an updated figure given by Musk last week.",2.739944260297029,2.296267894755839,0.44367636554119017,8

In the past, his team has been sent to help with earthquakes in Haiti, Mexico, and Japan. He says there are differences between those catastrophes and what he has seen in Ukraine.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter not yet made public, said the issue has been discussed in meetings and senior leaders are weighing the matter. There have been no decisions. Musk's Starlink system of more than 2,200 low-orbiting satellites has provided broadband internet to more than 150,000 Ukrainian ground stations. Early Friday, Musk tweeted that it was costing SpaceX $20 million a month to support Ukraine's communications needs. In addition to the terminals, he tweeted that the company has to create, launch, maintain and replenish satellites and ground stations. CNN was the first to report the Musk request. The request from the world's richest man to have the Pentagon take over the hundreds of millions of dollars he says the system is costing comes on the heels of a Twitter war between Musk and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And in tweets overnight Musk referred to the friction, suggesting it may affect his decision to end his company's largesse in funding the systems. In a Twitter exchange last week, Musk argued that to reach peace Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimea Peninsula, which it seized in 2014. He also said Ukraine should adopt a neutral status, dropping a bid to join NATO. Musk also started a Twitter poll asking whether ""the will of the people"" should decide if seized regions remain part of Ukraine or become part of Russia. In a sarcastic response, Zelenskyy posted a Twitter poll of his own asking ""which Elon Musk do you like more?"": ""One who supports Ukraine"" or ""One who supports Russia."" Musk replied to Zelenskyy that ""I still very much support Ukraine, but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world."" Andrij Melnyk, the outgoing Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, responded to Musk's original tweet with an obscenity. Musk's request that the Pentagon begin to pick up the tab comes as the Space Force and Pentagon have been looking at how commercial vendors will play a role in national security. In March, commander of U.S. Space Command Army Gen. James Dickinson said that having many vendors providing needed capabilities, such as Maxar's satellite imagery of stalled Russian convoys, has become essential, because it frees up limited military satellite assets to focus on other things. In his tweets, Musk also raised a question that various vendors and the Pentagon are considering as space becomes a more critical part of wartime operations: If a commercial vendor is assisting the U.S. and is targeted, does the U.S. owe it protection? ""We've also had to defend against cyberattacks & jamming, which are getting harder,"" Musk tweeted.",1.902564266337619,2.8159921325624606,-0.9134278662248416,8

The drone attack set off air raid sirens and sent people running for shelters yet again in the capital, in a fourth day of reprisals by Moscow for a bombing that damaged a bridge providing the only land link between Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula. Vladimir Putin's escalating war on Ukraine is now led by a hard-line commander whose reputation for brutality earned him the nickname ""General Armageddon."" For days it has been clear that the strategy is to increase the aerial assault not only on the front lines, where Russia has lost ground in recent weeks, but across Ukraine. It wasn't immediately clear if the self-detonating drones had killed or wounded anyone, but Ukrainian officials said Thursday that 13 people were killed and almost 40 others wounded over the preceding 24 hours of Russian missile strikes all around Ukraine. The southern city of Mykolaiv was struck again early Thursday, with Russian missiles destroying a five-story apartment building. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said an 11-year-old boy was rescued from the debris six hours after the strike, but seven others remained missing. Kim said Russia hit the building with an S-300 missile — a weapon designed, and usually used to bring down enemy aircraft. Russia has seemingly turned to the S-300s more often to carry out indiscriminate attacks on Ukrainian cities, amid intelligence reports that Putin's army is running low on weaponry, and on morale. ""We know, and Russian commanders on the ground know, that their supplies and munitions are running out,"" Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of Britain's cyber intelligence agency GCHQ said in a speech on Tuesday. The city of Zaporizhzhia — in Ukrainian-held territory but not far from the sprawling, Russian-occupied nuclear power plant that has been the focus of rising concern over a possible nuclear accident — was also hit again on Thursday. The city, about 20 miles from the nuclear plant, has been the target of relentless Russian bombardment. Some of the missiles have slammed down in residential areas, and CBS News saw rescuers pulling one victim from beneath the rubble of an apartment building. Over the past two weeks, more than 70 civilians have been killed by Russia's aerial assault in Zaporizhzhia alone, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine's military claims it has managed to shoot down dozens of the missiles and Iranian-made ""Shahed-136"" drones Russia has fired over the past week, but with so many still getting through to wreak havoc on the country's infrastructure and beleaguered civilians, it is desperate for more help. To stop the aerial assault, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy begged this week for the U.S. and other partners to send Ukraine more, and more advanced, missile defense systems. He was assured that help is on the way.",1.8426063573537763,1.3254139668400864,0.5171923905136899,9

Saudi Arabia was among the nations who voted in favor of the resolution. By a 143-5 margin, the General Assembly condemned Russia's ""attempted illegal annexation"" of four Ukrainian territories, and called for Russia to ""immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces."" The five nations who voted against the measure were Russia, Syria, Nicaragua, North Korea and Belarus. China was among 35 nations who abstained from voting. The resolution, which also called on nations to ""refrain from any action that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status,"" marked the strongest support to date for Ukraine from the 193-nation General Assembly since the start of the Russian invasion. President Biden, in a statement Wednesday night praising the vote, said ""143 nations stood on the side of freedom, sovereignty, and territorial integrity."" ""The stakes of this conflict are clear to all — and the world has sent a clear message in response: Russia cannot erase a sovereign state from the map. Russia cannot change borders by force,"" Biden's statement read. ""Russia cannot seize another country's territory as its own. Ukraine is entitled to the same rights as every other sovereign country. It must be able to choose its own future, and its people must be able to live peacefully inside its internationally recognized borders."" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. ambassador to U.N., told world leaders in General Assembly Hall that ""our message is loud and clear: It does not matter if you as a nation are big or small, rich or poor, old or new. If you are a U.N. member state, your borders are your own and are protected by international law. The path to peace does not run through placations. The path to peace does not involve turning the other way in the face of these flagrant violations. Peace does not, and has never, come from silence."" After the vote, Thomas-Greenfield told reporters it was a ""monumental day,"" and later tweeted, ""Kherson is Ukraine. Zaporizhzhya is Ukraine. Donetsk is Ukraine. Luhansk is Ukraine,"" referring to the territories that Russia now claims as its own. Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, told CBS News the vote was a ""collective effort of an overwhelming majority, and the call of moral duty and reason."" ""Who wants or can afford to be on the wrong side of the fence at this historic moment?"" Kyslytsya asked. On Oct. 5, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed laws annexing four Ukrainian regions in the wake of ""referendums"" staged by Moscow in the areas. Those referendums were condemned by the international community as shams, with Ukraine, the head of the U.N., the U.S. and many other countries dismissing the move as a blatantly illegal land grab. ""A trail of blood is left behind the Russian delegation when it enters the General Assembly,"" Kyslytsya told the General Assembly Wednesday, referring to the brutality of attacks against civilians since the war began. The vote was telling in how far the international community has come to send a unified message to Russia. All members of the Gulf Cooperation Council - which includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates - voted in favor of the resolution. Abdulaziz Alwasil, Saudi Arabia's U.N. ambassador, said that the support for the measure comes out of a ""commitment to the firm principles of international law and Charter of the United Nations ... We confirm the need to respect the sovereignty of states with neighboring relationships."" Prior to the vote, Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's U.N. ambassador, warned that the measure could ""destroy any and all efforts in favor of a diplomatic solution to the crisis."" His caution was not heeded. Following an Oct. 8 explosion which caused the partial collapse of a bridge linking Russia with the Crimean Peninsula, Russia launched two days of retaliatory strikes on Monday and Tuesday in which dozens of missiles and drones were fired at Ukraine. At least 19 people were killed and more than 100 injured. Russia on Wednesday announced that it had arrested eight people in connection with the explosion. ""The latest barrage of missile attacks against civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and cities that Russia now claims as its own through its sham referenda, reveal to us the true nature of this war,"" Bob Rae, Canada's U.N. ambassador, told the General Assembly Wednesday. ""This is not a ""special military operation,"" he added. ""It is a war to punish and destroy Ukraine."" Olof Skoog, European Union ambassador to the U.N., told reporters after the vote that ""the result today is a resounding statement that rejects Russia's actions and considers them illegal: the sham referenda, the alleged annexations, all of it. It proves today that it will not stand, and that it is declared null and void, and simply has no validity."" Josep Borrell, high representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, tweeted that ""Russia will be held accountable,"" adding that the General Assembly vote ""unequivocally rejected Russia's illegal annexation."" Wednesday's vote came after the U.N. Security Council failed to adopt a resolution in late September on the same topic because of Russia's veto. Although General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, the weight of a condemnation by almost 75 percent of the world's nations sends a message to Russia, U.S. officials said. ""There is a very simple way to end this war,"" a senior White House official, speaking on background, told reporters last week, echoing what President Biden told the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""Russia can stop the fighting, pull back its troops to Ukraine's borders, and the war will be over.""",2.745641234429653,2.4174222006854267,0.32821903374422634,7

The assault prompted Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to implore G-7 leaders on Tuesday, including President Biden, for more help. Zelenskyy told his fellow leaders that with enough modern, effective air defense systems, Ukraine could render useless the most damaging instruments of Russia's terror — its missiles, rockets and explosives-laden kamikaze drones. President Vladimir Putin has defined the dramatic escalation in Russia's attacks as retaliation for a huge explosion that damaged the 12-mile Kerch Bridge, the only ground link between Ukraine's Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula and mainland Russia. Two days of retaliatory strikes on Monday and Tuesday saw Russia fire dozens of missiles and drones at Ukraine — many of which were intercepted by air defense systems the country already has, but not enough of them. At least 19 people were killed and more than 100 injured as the bombs rained down on cities across Ukraine. A hospital in the capital city of Kyiv said Wednesday that a veteran cancer doctor was among those killed on Monday as she rushed to work after dropping her child off at daycare. The blistering assault on Ukraine's infrastructure and civilians began just two days after Putin — whose most senior generals have come under mounting pressure over Russia's territorial losses — put a new commander in charge of the war in Ukraine. General Sergei Surovikin, lionized by Russia's pro-Kremlin press as ""General Armageddon,"" was previously the commander of Russia's Air Force. He earned his reputation by a stint leading Russia's ruthless bombing campaign in Syria, flattening entire cities and killing thousands of civilians in support of dictator Bashar Assad's regime. Now Surovikin has been tasked with turning the tide for Russia's troops in Ukraine as they face daily crushing defeats on the front lines in the country's south and east. On Wednesday morning, Ukraine's Defense Ministry announced the recapture of five more villages in the southern Kherson Oblast, one of four Ukrainian regions that Putin unilaterally declared Russian territory with an illegal annexation about two weeks ago. CBS News has seen first-hand how Ukrainian tactics and firepower have overwhelmed Russian troops in Kherson. In the towns and villages where Ukrainian forces have ousted the invaders and raised their national flag again over recent weeks, soldiers have dug in deep, and there are armored personnel carriers, tanks, heavy artillery, and rocket launchers everywhere. It's clear their lightning counteroffensive hasn't been about just taking ground back from Russia, but holding onto it. The city of Kherson, the regional capital with a pre-war population of around 300,000, was the first major city to fall to Russia after Putin ordered his invasion on February 24. His forces still hold it, but Ukrainian troops are inching closer every day. If Ukraine's military manages to force the Russian occupiers out of the strategic stronghold in the south, it would be Putin's most humiliating defeat since he launched his war, so it's not something Russia is likely to give up without a fight - or further retaliation.",1.7878570930228077,1.2286616198376126,0.5591954731851951,3

The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant suffered a ""blackout"" when a missile damaged an electrical substation, leading to the emergency shutdown of the plant's last remaining outside power source, operator Energoatom reported. All six of the reactors were stopped earlier due to the war. But they still require electricity to prevent them from overheating to the point of a meltdown that could cause radiation to pour from Europe's largest nuclear plant. Energoatom said diesel generators were supplying the plant but Russian troops had blocked a convoy carrying additional fuel for the back-up equipment. ""Russian shelling and damage to the energy infrastructure associated with the operation of nuclear power plants are the same manifestation of nuclear terrorism as the direct shelling of the (Zaporizhzhia plant) and lead to the same consequences and radiation accident threats,"" the company said. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported, the latest power cut to the Zaporizhzhia facility came after two days of blistering Russian missile and drone attacks on cities across Ukraine. The strikes — Russian retaliation for an attack over the weekend on a strategic bridge linking Crimea and Russia — appeared to be the first act ordered by Vladimir Putin's new overall Ukraine war commander. Gen. Sergei Surovikin was handed the reins of Putin's war machine just a couple days before the missile strikes commenced. His ruthless tactics as a Russian commander in Syria, levelling entire cities in defense of the dictator Bashar Assad, earned him the nickname ""General Armageddon"" in the Russian press. Zaporizhzhia is one of four regions that President Vladimir Putin has declared Russian territory with an illegal land grab. Putin signed a decree a week ago declaring that Russia was taking over the nuclear plant. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry called it a criminal act and said it considered Putin's decree ""null and void.""

2022-10-12,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-crimea-bridge-explosion-arrests-missile-attacks-zaporizhzhia-power-plant/,Russia arrests 8 in bridge explosion as missile attacks in Ukraine lead to nuclear plant blackout,"Russia's main domestic security agency said eight people were arrested over an explosion on a bridge that links Russia to the Crimean Peninsula. Russia's Federal Security Service, known by the Russian acronym FSB, said it arrested five Russians and three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia in the attack on the Kerch Bridge. A truck loaded with explosives blew up while driving across the bridge Saturday, killing four people and causing sections of road to collapse. The span opened four years after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, serving as a symbol of Moscow's regional dominance as well as a crucial route for getting military supplies to Ukraine and Russian travelers to a popular vacation destination. The FSB alleged the detained suspects acted on orders of Ukraine's military intelligence to secretly move the explosives by a convoluted route into Russia and forge accompanying documents. The Russian security services have pointed the finger at Ukraine's intelligence directorate and its head, Kyrylo Budanov. Ukraine's Defense Ministry on Wednesday dismissed accusations of Ukrainian involvement. ""The entire activity of the FSB and the Investigative Committee is nonsense,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Andriy Yusov told reporters. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the blast by ordering missile strikes across Ukraine, where his forces over the last month lost ground in the east and south as Ukraine's military waged a counteroffensive. The Ukrainian president's office said on Wednesday that strikes Moscow ordered in retaliation for the bridge attack killed at least 14 people and wounded 34 in the last day. On Monday, Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles killed 19 people, including five in Kyiv, the capital. Meanwhile, the missile attacks caused a crippled nuclear plant in Ukraine to lose all external power for the second time in five days, increasing the risk of a radiation disaster because critical safety systems need electricity to operate, Ukraine's state nuclear operator said Wednesday. Ukrainian nuclear power operator Energoatom said the Zaporizhzhia plant suffered a ""blackout"" Wednesday morning when a missile damaged an electrical substation, leading to the emergency shutdown of the plant's last external power source. On-site monitors from the U.N.'s atomic energy watchdog reported the last remaining outside line to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was restored about eight hours later. The war-related interruption nonetheless highlighted ""how precarious the situation is"" at Europe's largest nuclear plant, International Atomic Energy Agency Director Rafael Grossi said. All six of the reactors were stopped earlier due to the war. But they still require electricity to prevent them from overheating to the point of a meltdown that could cause radiation to pour from Europe's largest nuclear plant. Energoatom said diesel generators were supplying the plant but Russian troops blocked a convoy carrying additional fuel for the back-up equipment. ""Basically what we've got here is the weaponization of civil nuclear, perhaps for the first time,"" Paul Dorfman, a nuclear expert at England's University of Sussex said. ""And in an increasingly unstable world, it's important to understand this and what this implies for nuclear worldwide."" Ukrainian workers later found a way to repair the line and connected the plant to the Ukrainian power grid, the company said. The chief of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, told The Associated Press last month the plant typically had enough diesel on hand to run the generators — ""the station's last defense before a radiation accident"" for 10 days. The bombardment also hit civilian buildings. Over the past two days, Russian strikes damaged about 1/3 of the country's energy infrastructure, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said Wednesday. Ukraine's presidential office said in a morning update that eight Ukrainian regions in southeast were affected by Russian shelling and attacks involving drones, heavy artillery and missiles in the previous 24 hours, while strikes on central and western parts of Ukraine had ceased. More than a dozen missiles were fired at the city of Zaporizhzhia and its suburbs, damaging residential buildings. While part of a larger eponymous region that Moscow has claimed as its own in violation of international law, the city remains in Ukrainian hands. Russian forces control the area about 53 kilometers (33 miles) away by air where the nuclear plant is located. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, said Russian shelling left at least 14 people dead in the Zaporizhzhia region and the Donetsk region to the east. At least 34 people were wounded in five regions, he wrote on Telegram. Ukraine's southern command said on Wednesday its forces recaptured five settlements in the southern Kherson region, on the western fringe of an arc of Russian-controlled territory in eastern and southern Ukraine. Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk are four regions recently annexed by Russia, a move condemned as illegal under international law by many countries and the U.N. secretary-general. Despite the advance, Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said Ukrainian forces' counteroffensive in the south was losing pace while regrouping in the east to deliver a ""powerful blow"" on the front line between the cities of Svatove and Kreminna in Luhansk region. Western governments, in the wake of the punishing missile and drone strikes Russia carried out across Ukraine this week, were shipping new weapons systems to Ukraine or gearing up to provide more help: The U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group and NATO defense ministers held meetings in Brussels on Wednesday.",1.562415502611173,1.2382985363344594,0.3241169662767136,2
2022-10-11,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/imf-dims-outlook-for-2023-global-economy-ukraine-russia-war/,IMF dims outlook for global economy in 2023 amid Russia's war in Ukraine,"The International Monetary Fund is downgrading its outlook for the world economy for 2023, citing a long list of threats that include Russia's war against Ukraine, chronic inflation pressures, punishing interest rates and the lingering consequences of the global pandemic. ""We have high inflation and the deteriorating global economic outlook. At the same time, we have geopolitical risks with economic spillovers from the war in Ukraine. On top of all of this, global financial conditions have tightened as central banks continue to raise interest rates,"" Tobias Adrian, IMF's financial counsellor, announced Tuesday in Washington, D.C., following the release of the report. The 190-country lending agency forecast that the global economy would eke out growth of just 2.7% next year, down from the 2.9% it had estimated in July. The IMF left unchanged its forecast for international growth this year — a modest 3.2%, a sharp deceleration from last year's 6% expansion. The bleaker forecast was no surprise. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, noting the grim backdrop to this week's fall meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, warned that the ""risks of recession are rising'' around the world and that the global economy is facing a ""period of historic fragility.'' In its latest estimates, the IMF slashed its outlook for growth in the United States to 1.6% this year, down from a July forecast of 2.3%. It expects meager 1% U.S. growth next year. The fund foresees China's economy growing just 3.2% this year, down drastically from 8.1% last year. Beijing has instituted draconian zero-COVID policy and has cracked down on excessive real estate lending, disrupting business activity. China's growth is forecast to accelerate to 4.4% next year, still tepid by Chinese standards. In the IMF's view, the collective economy of the 19 European countries that share the euro currency, reeling from crushingly high energy prices caused by Russia's attack on Ukraine and Western sanctions against Moscow, will grow just 0.5% in 2023. ""Looking at the global banking sector, we can see that it has withstood the pressures up to now, helped by high levels of capital and ample liquidity. However, the IMF's global bank stress test shows that these buffers may not be enough for some banks,"" Adrian said. The world economy has endured a wild ride since COVID-19 hit in early 2020. First, the pandemic and the lockdowns it generated brought the world economy to a standstill in the spring of 2020. Then, vast infusions of government spending and ultra-low borrowing rates engineered by the Federal Reserve and other central banks fueled an unexpectedly strong and speedy recovery from the pandemic recession. But the stimulus came at a high cost. Factories, ports and freight yards were overwhelmed by powerful consumer demand for manufactured goods, especially in the United States, resulting in delays, shortages and higher prices. (The IMF expects worldwide consumer prices to rise 8.8% this year, up from 4.7% in 2021.) In response, the Fed and other central banks have reversed course and begun raising rates dramatically, risking a sharp slowdown and potentially a recession. The Fed has raised its benchmark short-term rate five times this year. Higher rates in the United States have lured investment away from other countries and strengthened the value of the dollar against other currencies. ""We see that rising interest rates have brought on additional stress. Both governments facing high debt levels, as well as non-bank financial institutions such as insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers dealing with stretched balance sheets,"" Adrian said, adding that ""the strains are particularly severe for smaller developing economies."" Outside the U.S., the stronger dollar makes imports that are sold in the American currency, including oil, more expensive and therefore heightens global inflationary pressures. It also forces foreign countries to raise their own rates — and burden their economies with higher borrowing costs — to defend their currencies. A global ""recession coupled with high inflation,"" according to the IMF counsellor, would cause ""up to 29% of bank assets in emerging markets"" to exceed capital requirements. ""At the same time, most banks in advanced economies would pull through,"" he said. Maurice Obstfeld, a former IMF chief economist who now teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, has warned that an overly aggressive Fed could ""drive the world economy into an unnecessarily harsh contraction.''",6.453095469806485,4.667280392243152,1.785815077563333,4
2022-10-11,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-abducts-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-official/,Ukraine says Russia has abducted another senior official from occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,"Kyiv, Ukraine — Ukraine's state nuclear operator accused Russian forces on Tuesday of abducting another senior official at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The sprawling plant sits just inside Russian-held territory in eastern Ukraine, and the ongoing military occupation of it and fighting around it have fueled fears for months of a possible nuclear accident or incident. Energoatom wrote on its channel on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday that Valeriy Martyniuk, the plant's deputy director general for human resources, had been kidnapped. It wrote that ""they keep holding him at an unknown location and (are) probably using methods of torture and intimidation."" The plant has been held by Russian forces for months but its Ukrainian staff have continued to operate the facility. Reports of intimidation of the staff and abductions began trickling out over the summer. Ukrainian authorities said that the plant's director, Ihor Murashov, was seized and blindfolded by Russian forces on his way home from work, then released in the early days of October after being forced to make false statements on camera. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said it ""condemns in the strongest terms the illegal detention"" of Murashov. The nuclear plant is located in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region, which Russian leader Vladimir Putin declared annexed Russian territory late last month, along with the three neighboring regions of Donetsk, Lugansk and Kherson. Shelling around the plant has damaged the facility — Europe's largest nuclear power plant — and spurred calls from Kyiv and its Western allies to demilitarize areas around all nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Russia has indicated no willingness, however, to remove its forces from the Zaporizhzhia plant. The exiled mayor of the city of Melitopol, which sits in the Russian-occupied portion of the Zaporizhzhia region, told CBS News earlier this month that he expected Putin to lash out with a tactical nuclear strike in retaliation for the loss of territory in the occupied regions. Ukraine, along with the U.S. and other partners, has warned for weeks that Putin could order some kind of attack on or incident at the nuclear plant to use as a pretext for his own nuclear attack. The Russian leader has made it clear that his nuclear arsenal remains on the table in the ongoing war with Ukraine. In the meantime, Russia has spent two days hammering Ukrainian cities with conventional missile and drone strikes, killing at least 19 civilians according to Ukrainian officials. Some of the worst damage has been inflicted upon the city of Zaporizhzhia, which sits about 20 miles southwest of the power plant, in Ukrainian-held territory. A monitoring team from the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, visited the Zaporizhzhia plant in early September, and the IAEA has been pushing Kyiv and Moscow to agree to set up a security zone around the plant since then, to avoid any nuclear accidents. Putin met Tuesday with the IAEA's Director General, Rafael Grossi, who visited Moscow to discuss the recent fighting around the nuclear plant.",1.4943988742738203,1.34689309203567,0.14750578223815025,2
2022-10-11,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-missile-strikes-day-2-putin-deaths-despite-losses/,Russia hammers Ukraine with missiles for 2nd day as Putin proves deadly capabilities despite losing ground,"Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine — Ukraine faced yet another day of brutal Russian attacks on Tuesday. Multiple cities were hit again after dozens of missiles and explosives-packed drones rained down across Ukraine on Monday. Many hit packed neighborhoods during the morning rush-hour, as civilians made their way to work in cities including the capital Kyiv, which had largely escaped Russia's artillery for months. Ukrainian officials said at least 19 people were killed in the first round of strikes on Monday, and more than 100 injured. The toll from Tuesday's onslaught wasn't immediately clear. Air raid sirens pierced the quiet of the early morning hours, accompanied by new alerts sent out via cell phones, warning of incoming missiles. Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed Tuesday that it had continued its ""massive attack using high-precision long-range air- and sea-based armament."" Moscow has called the aerial assault retaliation for an apparent Ukrainian attack on the Kerch Bridge over the weekend — the only land link between Ukraine's Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula and mainland Russia. The Ukrainian military said Russia fired more than 75 cruise missiles at the country on Monday, with around 40 intercepted by air defense systems. About two dozen Iranian-made suicide drones were used in the attacks, too. Ukraine's infrastructure — the only target of the strikes, according to Russia — has indeed taken a pounding. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asked businesses to close after 6 p.m. and residents to limit appliance use during peak hours in a bid to conserve electricity. On Tuesday morning, Ukraine was still reeling from the onslaught as the fresh barrage of missiles struck. People emerged onto rubble-strewn streets to survey the damage and count the costs. But contrary to Russia's claims, those costs were being counted not only in damaged infrastructure, but dead civilians. The assault sent residents in Kyiv back into subways and other underground shelters for the first time in many weeks, where they defiantly sang Ukrainian folk songs and their country's national anthem. But while President Vladimir Putin may have proven Russia's ability to reach right across Ukraine, to recklessly rain missiles down on civilian neighborhoods, his soldiers are taking a beating on the battlefield. ""That is why they resort to this terror,"" said Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, adding a call for his own forces to ""make the battlefield even more painful for the enemy."" CBS News visited villages near the raging front lines in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, one of four that Putin recently declared Russian territory in an illegal land grab. Despite his purported annexation, Ukraine's troops have recaptured territory in Kherson and some other regions in a counterattack so rapid that it is being measured daily, by the mile. The villages there were among the first to fall to Russia and they remained under its iron grip for seven months, until they were liberated only about a week ago. Resident Oksana told CBS News she was still in a state of disbelief, but when she saw Ukrainian troops enter her village, all she felt was ""happiness."" ""We were suffering,"" she said, fighting back tears as she described life under Russian occupation. ""It was so hard, and so scary."" At a high school that was used for months as a military headquarters by the occupying Russian soldiers, the building itself tells the story of the brutal battle that brought the village back under Ukrainian control. Huge chunks of concrete are missing from the walls, every window is smashed, the buildings are scorched and the grounds are littered with the burnt-out carcasses of armored personnel carriers bearing the white ""Z"" of the Russian army. CBS News found teacher Sveltana Reznichenko taking stock of the filth and squalor left behind by the retreating Russian forces. It looked more like the remnants of a ragtag militia than a professional army. ""When I came in there and saw this horror, I still had faith that we will rebuild everything,"" she said. Zelenskyy vowed on Monday night that his nation would ""rebuild all the objects that had been damaged in today's Russian terrorist attacks. It's just a matter of time."" By Tuesday morning, there was even more to rebuild, and plenty more fighting still to do.",1.4976899880602417,1.389701912946278,0.10798807511396369,9
2022-10-11,https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/ukraine-russia-putin-biden-no-fly-zone/,Ukraine supporters in Philadelphia call for no-fly zone,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- G7 leaders on Tuesday will convene an emergency meeting after Russia targeted civilian areas throughout Ukraine. More than 80 Russian missile strikes rocked major cities. Ukrainian officials say at least 14 people were killed. Russian President Vladimir Putin says the attacks were in response to the destruction of a key bridge linking Russia to Crimea over the weekend. Ukrainian Americans and their supporters in our area continue to call for an end to the violence. More than seven months after Putin invaded Ukraine, the war rages on. A group supporting Ukraine's efforts in the fight gathered Monday night at City Hall to call for increased action from the American government and increased pressure, to that end, from American citizens. Just as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged NATO to enact a no-fly zone over Ukraine so too did those assembled at City Hall Monday. The umbrellas they carried were symbolic of their wishes to have Ukraine protected from the sky meaning attacks from Russian forces. ""Presiden [Joe] Biden and the administration are promising more help,"" Ulana Mazurkevich said, ""but we need an iron-clad dome. We need an umbrella. That is why we are standing here with our blue and yellow umbrellas to symbolize we want an umbrella over Ukraine."" Speaking of President Biden, he issued a statement regarding Russia's brutal attacks on Monday. It reads, in part, ""These attacks killed and injured civilians and destroyed targets with no military purpose. They once again demonstrate the utter brutality of Mr. Putin's illegal war on the Ukrainian people."" Meanwhile, back at City Hall, CBS Philadelphia heard concern over what could be a domino effect if Putin isn't stopped in Ukraine. ""We have to put a stop to this bully,"" Mazurkevich said. ""Bullies have to be stopped."" And that's where some believe you at home can help. ""I would say to remember Ukraine in your hearts and help where you can,"" Karen Golovko said. The United States has committed over $16 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of the war in late February. As for a no-fly zone? The U.S. Is extremely reticent to enact one because it would literally mean engaging Russia militarily and the prospect of war between the two countries on earth with the vast majority of the planet's nuclear weapons.",1.6933081928260396,2.0105360714228917,-0.3172278785968521,7
2022-10-11,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-spy-jareh-dalke-nsa-job-russia-secrets/,Alleged spy caught in Colorado sought job at NSA to give secrets to Russia,"A new document filed in federal court lays out the government's case that a man arrested in Colorado for attempting to share state secrets with Russia purposely sought out a job at the National Security Agency with the intent of accessing high-level secret information and selling them to the Russian government. In the government's ""Memorandum to Support Detention,"" lawyers representing the United States government claim that Jareh Dalke began working for the NSA on June 6th with a Top Secret/SCI clearance. That level of clearance grants access to classified information held only in certain places to ensure they are not released. His last day at the NSA was July 1st. The new filing claims that Dalke ""undertook a deliberate and calculated effort to steal classified national defense information he knew would benefit Russia and harm the United States."" In his explanation to a covert agent, he applied for the NSA position because he had ""questioned our role in damage to the world in the past and by mixture of curiosity for secrets and a desire to cause change."" Less than a month later, Dakle allegedly began communicating with a covert agent he believed was working for the Russian government, but was in fact an FBI agent. In August, Dalke requested $85,000 in return for the secrets he had taken. The filings show he then re-applied for a job at the NSA. The government remains unsure of exactly how much classified information was taken. Dalke faces six counts, each of which could potentially carry a life sentence if convicted. At a hearing Tuesday, the government will petition a federal judge to continue to detail Dalke.",6.472473171432388,4.67565391004505,1.7968192613873386,1
2022-10-10,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-kyiv-missile-attack-putin-crimea-bridge/,Russia rains missiles down on Ukraine's capital and other cities in retaliation for Crimea bridge blast,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that people were killed and injured in multiple missile strikes across Ukraine, including the first bombardment of the capital, Kyiv, in months. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata said the strikes, which could signal a major escalation in the eight-month-old war, appeared to be entirely punitive — retaliation meant to terrorize Ukrainian civilians in densely-populated urban neighborhoods, close to government buildings, with one even hitting a children's playground. The lethal barrage smashed into civilian areas, knocking out power and water, shattering buildings and killing at least 14 people. The bombardment came two days after Russia suffered a serious blow with the bombing that damaged its sole bridge to Crimea. Ukraine's Emergency Service said nearly 100 people were wounded in the morning rush hour attacks that Russia launched from the air, sea and land against at least 14 regions, spanning from Lviv in the west to Kharkiv in the east. Many of the attacks occurred far from the war's front lines. Though Russia said missiles targeted military and energy facilities, some struck civilian areas while people were heading to work and school. One hit a playground in downtown Kyiv and another struck a university. The attacks plunged much of the country into a blackout, depriving hundreds of thousands of people of electricity and creating a shortage so severe Ukrainian authorities announced they would have to stop power exports to Europe starting Tuesday. Power outages also often deprive residents of water, given the system's reliance on electricity to run pumps and other equipment. The head of Ukraine's law enforcement said Monday's attacks damaged 70 infrastructure sites, of which 29 are critical. Zelenskyy said that of the 84 cruise missiles and 24 drones Russia fired, Ukrainian forces shot down 56. Andriy Yermak, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the strikes had no ""practical military sense"" and that Russia's goal was to cause a ""humanitarian catastrophe."" Russian President Vladimir Putin said his forces used ""precision weapons"" to target key energy infrastructure and military command facilities in retaliation for Kyiv's ""terrorist"" actions — a reference to Ukraine's attempts to repel Moscow's invasion forces, including an attack Saturday on a key bridge between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula that Putin called a ""terrorist act"" masterminded by Ukrainian special services. Putin vowed a ""tough"" and ""proportionate"" response should Ukraine carry out further attacks that threaten Russia's security. ""No one should have any doubts about it,"" he told Russia's Security Council by video. The explosions in Kyiv and other cities came just a day after Putin blamed Kyiv for the massive explosion on a 12-mile bridge connecting Crimea with Russia. Crimea is a large Ukrainian peninsula that Russia occupied and then unilaterally annexed eight years ago during a previous invasion. The annexation of that territory, like Putin's recent land grab of four Ukrainian regions that he declared Russian soil last week, have been condemned as illegitimate and illegal by Ukraine, the United Nations, the U.S. and other countries. The blast that hit the bridge sparked celebrations among Ukrainians and others on social media — but officials in Kyiv have made no direct claim of responsibility. The Russian president has been under intense domestic pressure to take more aggressive action to stop a largely successful Ukrainian counteroffensive and to react forcefully to Saturday's attack on the Kerch bridge, whose construction he used to cement his 2014 annexation of Crimea. Putin's increasingly frequent descriptions of Ukraine's actions as terrorist could portend even more bold and draconian actions. But in Monday's speech, Putin — whose partial troop mobilization order last month triggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of men of fighting age from Russia — stopped short of an expected escalation from what he calls a ""special military operation"" to a counterterrorism campaign or martial law. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on world leaders to declare Russia a terrorist state because of its attacks on civilians and alleged war crimes. Zelenskyy emerged onto a street in Kyiv on Monday to record a selfie video with a message to his people and the world, denouncing Russia for the barrage of missiles which he said had targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, and its civilians. Zelenskyy's wife, Olena, posted a video showing people sheltering on the stairs of a Kyiv subway station singing a Ukrainian folk song, ""In a Cherry Garden,"" whose final lines are: ""My dear mother, you are old and I'm happy and young. I want to live, to love."" ""They have specifically chosen such a time and such targets to cause as much damage as possible,"" the president said. ""But we Ukrainians, we help each other, believe in ourselves, rebuild everything. Now the shortages of electricity may occur, but not the shortage of our defiance and our confidence in our victory."" The strikes sent residents of Ukraine's two largest cities — Kyiv and Kharkiv — into bomb shelters, including subway stations. While air raid sirens have continued throughout the war in cities across the country, in Kyiv and elsewhere many Ukrainians had begun to ignore their warnings after months of calm. Just as traffic was picking up Monday morning, a commuter minibus was struck near Kyiv National University. Nearby, at least one strike landed in Shevchenko Park, leaving a large hole near a children's playground. Another target was the Klitschko pedestrian bridge — a landmark in central Kyiv with glass panels. Closed-circuit video footage showed a huge explosion under the bridge, with smoke rising, and a man running away after the blast, apparently unhurt. No significant damage to the bridge was immediately apparent. Air raid sirens sounded in every region of Ukraine except Russia-annexed Crimea for four straight hours. Videos posted on social media showed black smoke rising above several areas of the city. Russia's last strike on the capital was on June 26. Associated Press journalists saw multiple bodies at an industrial site on the outskirts of Dnipro. Four people were killed and 19 injured in the city, officials said. Witnesses said one missile landed in front of a bus during the morning rush hour, damaging the vehicle but not killing any passengers. Kharkiv was hit three times, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. The strikes knocked out the electricity and water supply. Energy infrastructure was also hit in Lviv, regional Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi said. Three cruise missiles launched against Ukraine from Russian ships in the Black Sea crossed Moldova's airspace, said the country's foreign affairs minister, Nicu Popescu. As the European Union condemned Russia's attack and said the targeting of civilians amounted to ""a war crime,"" Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed the ""massive strike with long-range precision weapons."" It claimed the missiles had targeted ""objects of the military command and control, communications and energy systems of Ukraine"" and that ""all assigned objects were hit."" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was ""deeply shocked by today's large-scale missile attacks"" on Ukraine, his spokesman said in a statement, adding that the strike ""constitutes another unacceptable escalation of the war and, as always, civilians are paying the highest price."" Some feared Monday's attacks may just be the first salvo in a renewed Russian offensive. As a precautionary measure, Ukraine switched all schools to online learning until at least the end of this week. In an ominous move, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced Monday that he and Putin have agreed to create a joint ""regional grouping of troops."" He offered no details. Lukashenko repeated his claims that Ukraine is plotting an attack on Belarus, sparking fears he would take preemptive action. His defense minister, Viktor Khrenin, later issued a video warning Ukraine not to provoke Belarus, but added, ""We don't want to fight.""

Some of the missiles hit the center of the capital. Previous attacks largely targeted Kyiv's outskirts. Videos posted on social media showed black smoke rising above several areas of the city. Russia's last strike on the capital was on June 26. Other major cities hit by explosions Monday included Lviv, in Ukraine's far west, which has been a refuge for many people fleeing the fighting in the east. The foreign minister of Moldova, a small nation that sits along Ukraine's southwest border, said three cruise missiles ""from Russian ships in the Black Sea"" had flown through Moldova's airspace as they headed for Ukraine on Monday morning. Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu added in his Twitter message that he had ""instructed that Russia's ambassador be summoned to provide an explanation."" As the European Union condemned Russia's attack and said the targeting of civilians amounted to ""a war crime,"" Russia's Defense Ministry confirmed the ""massive strike with long-range precision weapons."" It claimed the missiles had targeted ""objects of the military command and control, communications and energy systems of Ukraine"" and that ""all assigned objects were hit."" Witnesses also reported a loud explosion Monday morning in Russia's Belgorod region, meanwhile, which sits right along Ukraine's eastern border. One witness told Reuters there was a loud bang and windows shook. The cause of the blast wasn't clear. The explosions came a day after Putin said Ukraine was behind an explosion on the Kerch bridge, linking Crimea with Russia, that left three people dead. ""The authors, perpetrators and sponsors are the Ukrainian secret services,"" Putin said of Saturday's bridge bombing, which he described as a ""terrorist act."" Putin spoke during a meeting with the head of the investigation committee he has set up to look into the bombing, Russian news agencies reported. The Russian leader was gearing up for a meeting with his Security Council later Monday, the Kremlin told local news agencies. ""Tomorrow the president has a planned meeting with the permanent members of the Security Council,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The blast that hit the bridge sparked celebrations among Ukrainians and others on social media. But Zelenskyy, in his nightly address on Saturday, didn't directly mention the incident, and officials in Kyiv have made no direct claim of responsibility. On Saturday, Russia said some road and rail traffic had resumed over the strategic link, a powerful symbol of the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea. The bridge has served as a vital supply link between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula during its current invasion of south and eastern Ukraine. Some military analysts argue the explosion could have a major impact if Moscow sees the need to shift already hard-pressed troops to Crimea from other regions — or if it prompts a rush by residents to leave. Mick Ryan, a retired Australian senior officer now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said even if Kyiv wasn't behind the blast, it constituted ""a massive influence operation win for Ukraine. ""It is a demonstration to Russians, and the rest of the world, that Russia's military cannot protect any of the provinces it recently annexed,"" he said on Twitter. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, denounced a Russian missile strike on Sunday that killed at least 17 people in Zaporizhzhia, the latest deadly bombardment of the southern Ukrainian city. The attack also wounded 89 people, according to a statement from the president's office. Zelenskyy described the ""merciless strikes on peaceful people"" and residential buildings as ""absolute evil"" perpetrated by ""savages and terrorists."" Regional official Oleksandr Starukh posted pictures of heavily damaged apartment blocks on social media and said a rescue operation had been launched to find victims under the rubble. Russian officials, meanwhile, denounced on Sunday what they said was a surge in Ukrainian fire into its territory that had hit homes, administrative buildings and a monastery. Russia's FBS, which is responsible for border security, said on Sunday: ""Since the start of October, the number of attacks from Ukrainian armed formations on Russia's border territory has considerably increased."" More than 100 artillery attacks, concentrated on the western border regions of Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk, had hit housing and administrative buildings, said the statement. The attacks had killed one person and wounded five others.",1.327696752539995,2.4625627720646435,-1.1348660195246485,9
2022-10-08,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/crimea-bridge-russia-war-in-ukraine-damaged-key-supply-route-putin-birthday/,"Blast damages Crimea bridge, key supply route in Russia's war in Ukraine","An explosion caused the partial collapse of a bridge linking the Crimean Peninsula with Russia on Saturday, damaging a key supply artery for the Kremlin's faltering war effort in southern Ukraine. Russian authorities said a truck bomb caused the blast and that three people were killed. Images on social media Saturday showed the Kerch Bridge, which has train and automobile sections, in flames. The railway bridge was ablaze and a section of the parallel road bridge collapsed into the sea. The bombing came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin turned 70, dealing him a humiliating blow that could lead him to up the ante in his war on Ukraine. One military analyst called it a punch in the face for Putin on his birthday, CBS News' Charlie D'Agata reports. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree late Saturday tightening security for the Kerch Bridge and for energy infrastructure between Crimea and Russia. Russia's federal security service, the FSB, was put in charge of the effort, according to a Kremlin statement. The speaker of the Russian-backed regional parliament in Crimea accused Ukraine of the bombing, but Moscow didn't apportion blame. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly threatened to strike the bridge, and some lauded the destruction on Saturday. But Kyiv stopped short of claiming responsibility. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a video address, indirectly acknowledged the attack on the bridge by talking about the weather in Crimea but did not address its cause. ""Today was a good and mostly sunny day on the territory of our state,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it was cloudy in Crimea."" He said Ukraine wants a future ""without occupiers. Throughout our territory, in particular in Crimea."" The speaker of Crimea's Kremlin-backed regional parliament immediately accused Ukraine, though the Kremlin didn't apportion blame. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly threatened to strike the bridge and some lauded the attack, but Kyiv stopped short of claiming responsibility. The explosion risked a sharp escalation in Russia's eight-month war, with some Russian lawmakers calling for Putin to declare a ""counterterrorism operation"" in retaliation, shedding the term ""special military operation"" that had downplayed the scope of fighting to ordinary Russians. Such a move could be used by the Kremlin to further broaden the powers of security agencies, ban rallies, tighten censorship, introduce restrictions on travel and expand a partial military mobilization that Putin ordered last month. Hours after the explosion, Russia's Defense Ministry announced that the air force chief, Gen. Sergei Surovikin, would be named commander of all Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. It was the first official appointment of a single commander for all Russian forces in Ukraine. Surovikin had led Russian forces in Syria and was accused of overseeing a brutal bombardment that destroyed much of the city of Aleppo. The Kerch Bridge opened in 2018 and is a tangible symbol of Moscow's claims on Crimea. It has provided an essential link to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The $3.6 billion bridge, the longest in Europe, is vital to sustaining Russia's military operations in southern Ukraine. Putin himself presided over the bridge's opening in 2018. The attack on it ""will have a further sapping effort on Russian morale, (and) will give an extra boost to Ukraine's,"" said James Nixey of Chatham House, a think tank in London. ""Conceivably the Russians can rebuild it, but they can't defend it while losing a war."" Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee said the truck bomb caused seven railway cars carrying fuel to catch fire, resulting in a ""partial collapse of two sections of the bridge."" A man and a woman riding in a vehicle across the bridge were killed by the explosion, Russia's Investigative Committee said. It didn't provide details on the third victim or what happened to the truck driver. The blast occurred even though all vehicles crossing the bridge undergo checks for explosives by state-of-the-art control systems, drawing a stream of critical comments from Russian war bloggers who urged Moscow to retaliate by striking Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. The truck that exploded was owned by a resident of the Krasnodar region in southern Russia. Russia's Investigative Committee said investigators searched the man's home and were looking at the truck's route. Train and automobile traffic over the bridge was temporarily suspended. Automobile traffic resumed Saturday afternoon on one of the two links that remained intact from the blast, with the flow alternating in each direction and vehicles undergoing a ""full inspection procedure,"" Crimea's Russia-backed regional leader, Sergey Aksyonov, wrote on Telegram. Rail traffic was resuming slowly. Two passenger trains departed from the Crimean cities of Sevastopol and Simferopol and headed toward the bridge Saturday evening. Passenger ferry links between Crimea and the Russian mainland were being relaunched Sunday. The Russian Defense Ministry said troops in the south were receiving necessary supplies through the land corridor along the Sea of Azov and by sea. Russia's Energy Ministry said Crimea has enough fuel for 15 days. Putin was informed about the explosion and he ordered the creation of a government panel to deal with the emergency. Gennady Zyuganov, head of the Russian Communist Party, said the ""terror attack"" should serve as a wake-up call. ""The special operation must be turned into a counterterrorist operation,"" he declared. Leonid Slutsky, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Russian parliament's lower house, said ""consequences will be imminent"" if Ukraine was responsible. And Sergei Mironov, leader of the Just Russia faction, said Russia should respond by attacking key Ukrainian infrastructure, including power plants, bridges and railways. Such statements may herald a decision by Putin to declare a counterterrorism operation. The parliamentary leader of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's party stopped short of claiming that Kyiv was responsible, but cast the bridge explosion as a consequence of Moscow's takeover of Crimea. ""Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire. The reason is simple: If you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode,"" said David Arakhamia of the Servant of the People party. The Ukrainian postal service announced it would issue stamps commemorating the blast, as it did after the sinking of the Moskva, a Russian flagship cruiser, by a Ukrainian strike. The secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, tweeted a video with the Kerch Bridge on fire and Marilyn Monroe singing her ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"" song. In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said ""the reaction of the Kyiv regime to the destruction of civilian infrastructure shows its terrorist nature."" Local authorities in Crimea made conflicting statements about what the damaged bridge would mean for residents. The peninsula is a popular destination for Russian tourists and home to a Russian naval base. A Russian tourist association estimated that 50,000 tourists were in Crimea on vacation on Saturday. Moscow, meanwhile, continues to suffer battlefield losses. On Saturday, a Kremlin-backed official in Ukraine's Kherson region announced a partial evacuation of civilians from the southern province, one of four illegally annexed by Moscow last week. Kirill Stremousov told Russia's state-run RIA Novosti agency that young children and the elderly could be relocated because Kherson was getting ""ready for a difficult period.""",1.203118313342559,2.5158688007380756,-1.3127504873955167,3
2022-10-07,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/ukraine-news-russia-nuclear-strike-fear-putin-bombs-zaporizhzhia-civilians/,Inside a Ukraine city where civilians are being punished by Russian bombs for Putin's military losses,"Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine — We've been to the front lines, and to cities recently liberated from Russian occupation amid Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive. But you don't have to go that far to see the destruction Russia is capable of. We visited the city of Zaporizhzhia, miles from any front-line combat, not long after it was hit with a barrage of Russian rockets on Thursday. The explosions sent emergency teams scrambling in a desperate search for those who survived the strike. At times, they found only those who had not. We arrived to find firefighters dousing a mountain of twisted metal and debris. War crimes investigators were already looking through the rubble. Residents stood nearby, staring in disbelief. Just a few hours after the rocket attack, it was no longer a rescue mission. The building in the middle of a main street in an upmarket part of Zaporizhzhia, several miles from any front line and at least 25 miles from Russian-held territory, was still smoldering. The city of Zaporizhzhia has remained firmly under Ukrainian control, but it's the regional capital of one of the four areas Russian President Vladimir Putin illegally annexed just a few days ago. Resident Olena got a phone call from her 70-year-old mother at 5 a.m. on Thursday, saying she was trapped beneath the rubble. ""She has broken ribs, a lung contusion and broken leg,"" Olena told CBS News. ""But she is alive."" Despite the ordeal, Olena seemed remarkably composed. Her real emotions, however, were simmering just underneath the calm veneer. ""I'm very angry, very angry,"" she told us. ""We need help,"" she said, begging the wider world to ""stop this."" Lying on the pavement outside were body bags containing three of 11 people known to have been killed by the Russian strike. With the search still going on Friday, it was possible more innocent victims of Putin's senseless war were yet to be found. It was the second major missile attack on civilians in Zaporizhzhia in just a week. Last Friday we saw the aftermath of a strike on a civilian convoy that killed at least 30 people. Ukrainian troops continue to smash through front lines in the south and the east, forcing the Russian invaders to retreat. Battlefield commanders tell us Russian forces are in ""complete disarray."" One of the factors behind the recent success, according to a British intelligence report released on Friday, is the vast number of Russian tanks the Ukrainians have captured. The report estimates that at least 440 have been seized — amounting to roughly half of Ukraine's current tank fleet. Infuriated by the losses, Putin has retaliated by launching long-range weapons into residential areas far from the fighting, spreading terror. What Russia cannot capture, it seeks to destroy. The fear, voiced bluntly on Thursday by President Biden, is that the Russian leader will feel so backed into a corner that he'll resort to even more lethal tactics in that strategy, including his nuclear arsenal.",0.9386575380885587,2.959213835015259,-2.0205562969267,2

2022-10-05,https://www.cbsnews.com/seattle/news/opec-cuts-oil-production-by-2-million-barrels-per-day/,OPEC and Russia slash oil production in bid to boost prices,"The OPEC+ alliance of oil-exporting countries on Wednesday decided to sharply cut production to support sagging oil prices, a move that could deal the struggling global economy another blow and raise politically sensitive pump prices for U.S. drivers just ahead of key national elections. Energy ministers meeting at the Vienna headquarters of the OPEC oil cartel cut production by 2 million barrels per day starting in November at their first face-to-face meeting since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides a token trim in oil production last month, the major cut is an abrupt turnaround from months of restoring deep cuts made during the depths of the pandemic and could help alliance member Russia weather a looming European ban on oil imports. In a statement, OPEC+ said the decision was based on the ""uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks."" The impact of the production cut on oil prices — and thus the price of gasoline made from crude — will be limited somewhat because OPEC+ members are already unable to meet the quotas set by the group. The alliance also said it was renewing its cooperation between members of the OPEC cartel and non-members, the most significant of which is Russia. The deal was to expire at year's end. The decision comes as oil trades well below its summer peaks because of fears that major global economies such as the U.S. or Europe will sink into recession due to high inflation, rising interest rates meant to curb rising consumer prices, and uncertainty over Russia's war against in Ukraine. The fall in oil prices has been a boon to U.S. drivers, who saw lower gasoline prices at the pump before costs recently started ticking up, and for President Biden as his Democratic Party gears up for congressional elections next month. Nationwide, the average price for a gallon of regular gas is $3.83, down a June peak of $5.02, according to AAA, although fuel costs have edged up in recent weeks. ""An average cut of 2 million barrels a day should push gasoline prices higher, but not at a pace that would bring back prices to the $5 a gallon that led to the Biden administration draining supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,"" Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, said in an email. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday that the U.S. would not extend releases from its strategic reserve to increase global supplies. Biden has tried to receive credit for falling gas prices, with administration officials highlighting a late March announcement that a million barrels a day would be released from the strategic reserve for six months. High inflation is a fundamental drag on Biden's approval and has dampened Democrats' chances in the midterm elections. Oil supply could face further cutbacks in coming months when a European ban on most Russian imports takes effect in December. A separate move by the U.S. and other members of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies to impose a price cap on Russian oil could reduce supply if Russia retaliates by refusing to ship to countries and companies that observe the cap. The EU agreed Wednesday on new sanctions that are expected to include a price cap on Russian oil. Russia ""will need to find new buyers for its oil when the EU embargo comes into force in early December and will presumably have to make further price concessions to do so,"" analysts at Commerzbank wrote in a note. ""Higher prices beforehand — boosted by production cuts elsewhere — would therefore doubtless be very welcome."" Dwindling prospects for a diplomatic deal to limit Iran's nuclear program have also lowered prospects for a return of as much as 1.5 million barrels a day in Iranian oil to the market if sanctions are removed. Oil prices surged this summer as markets worried about the loss of Russian supplies from sanctions over the war in Ukraine, but they slipped as fears about recessions in major economies and China's COVID-19 restrictions weighed on demand for crude. International benchmark Brent has sagged as low as $84 in recent days after spending most of the summer months over $100 per barrel. At its last meeting in September, OPEC+ reduced the amount of oil it produces by 100,000 barrels a day in October. That token cut didn't do much to boost lower oil prices, but it put markets on notice that the group was willing to act if prices kept falling.",3.8483688029331633,5.696545876250515,-1.848177073317352,4

The ambassador said the ongoing provision of heavy weapons to Ukraine had cemented ""Washington's status as a participant in the conflict."" The latest American military aid package for Ukraine, announced Tuesday, includes additional ""HIMARS"" advanced rocket systems — weapons credited with helping the country gain momentum against Russia's occupying forces — as well as other artillery systems, ammunition and armored vehicles. ""The supply of military products by the U.S. and its allies not only entails protracted bloodshed and new casualties, but also increases the danger of a direct military clash between Russia and Western countries,"" Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov said on the Telegram messaging app. ""We call on Washington to stop its provocative actions that could lead to the most serious consequences."" Russian forces have taken significant losses on the battlefield in southern and eastern Ukraine in recent days — in areas that Russia now claims as its own. Putin signed laws Wednesday that were passed by Russia's rubber-stamp legislature, formally annexing four Ukrainian regions in the wake of ""referendums"" staged by Moscow in the areas. Those referendums were condemned by the international community as shams, with Ukraine, the head of the United Nations, the U.S. and many other countries dismissing the move as a blatantly illegal land grab. Despite the Kremlin's claims over the territory, Ukraine has recently taken back more and more ground in at least two of the regions over which Russia has declared dominion. ""They will be with Russia forever,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declared of the four regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — as Putin signed the paperwork on Wednesday to formalize the annexation. Peskov insisted there was ""no contradiction whatsoever"" in Russia's leader claiming the territory even as Russian forces have been pushed back from lines they've held for months in south and east Ukraine. Ukraine's military said Wednesday that it had retaken more villages in the southern Kherson region, and that Ukraine's national flag was again flying over seven villages recently clawed back from the occupying Russian forces, the Associated Press reported. There were multiple explosions, meanwhile, in Bila Tserkva, a city 50 miles south of the capital Kyiv, on Wednesday. A regional Ukrainian official said the blasts appeared to have been caused by suicide drones launched by Russian forces. Russia has reportedly used such Iranian-made drones in recent weeks. The explosive-laden drones can stay in the air for long periods of time before diving to hit targets and exploding at the last moment.",2.181837661385102,2.638287582506835,-0.45644992112173277,3

He also said Ukraine should adopt a neutral status, dropping a bid to join NATO following Russia's partial mobilization of reservists. Musk also crossed red lines for Ukraine and its supporters by suggesting Monday that four regions Russia is moving to annex following Kremlin-orchestrated ""referendums"" denounced by the West as a sham should hold repeat votes organized by the United Nations. Musk noted Crimea was part of Russia until it was given to Ukraine under the Soviet Union in 1950s and said that a drawn-out war will likely not end in a resounding Ukrainian victory. These positions are anathema for Zelenskyy, who considers them pro-Kremlin. The Ukrainian leader has pledged to recover all the terrain conquered in the war and considers Crimea as Ukraine's to reclaim as well. Musk also launched a Twitter poll asking whether ""the will of the people"" should decide if seized regions remain part of Ukraine or become part of Russia. In a sarcastic response, Zelenskyy posted a Twitter poll of his own asking ""which Elon Musk do you like more?"": ""One who supports Ukraine"" or ""One who supports Russia."" Musk replied to Zelenskyy that ""I still very much support Ukraine, but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to Ukraine and possibly the world."" Andrij Melnyk, the outgoing Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, responded to Musk's original tweet with an obscenity. ""Russia is doing partial mobilization. They go to full war mobilization if Crimea is at risk. Death on both sides will be devastating,"" Musk wrote in another tweet. ""Russia has (over) 3 times population of Ukraine, so victory for Ukraine is unlikely in total war. If you care about the people of Ukraine, seek peace."" The Kremlin itself chimed in, praising Musk for his proposal but warning that Russia will not backtrack on its move to absorb the Ukrainian regions. ""It's very positive that such a person as Elon Musk is trying to look for a peaceful settlement,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.

2022-10-04,https://www.cbsnews.com/atlanta/news/russia-nuclear-weapons-train-video/,Rare video shows Russia moving equipment belonging to a nuclear weapons unit,"A video shared online of a train in Russia carrying equipment belonging to a Russian military unit that handles nuclear weapons should be taken as a message to the West, a military analyst says. The video, which a U.S. official told CBS News could not be independently confirmed, shows an armored personnel carrier with a cannon attached, as well as another vehicle belonging to the unit, being transported on the train, the analyst said. ""Such videos are never released by chance. I'm 100% sure that there was a purpose behind posting or releasing such a video,"" Konrad Muzyka, an aerospace and defense consultant focused on Russia and Belarus, told CBS News. Muzyka said that it was highly unusual to see a video of that particular Russian unit, the 12th main directorate of the Russian Ministry of Defense, on the internet. ""This video of a train is a very good example of Russian strategy of trying to increase the pressure on the West and signal its — maybe not necessarily readiness — but willingness to escalate the situation,"" Muzyka said. The video surfaced amid reports, which CBS News has been unable to independently verify, that the U.S.-led NATO military alliance had warned its member nations that Russia could be preparing to test its nuclear-capable Poseidon torpedo. The weapon was reportedly on a Russian military submarine headed toward the Arctic. There were also reports in the British press, which Muzyka said were incorrect, that the train featured in the online video was heading toward Russia's border with Ukraine. ""Going forward, we are going to see more reports about Russian activities that relate to nuclear weapons, that relate to drills of units which can potentially be carrying nuclear warheads,"" Muzyka said. ""Russia will try to increase the pressure on the West, and it will try to indicate to the world that, from its point of view, the nuclear option is being considered. But, you know, I still think that, to a large extent, it is a bluff."" Myzyka said that by declaring recently that all options are on the table, the Russian leader has put himself in a position where he ""cannot really back down right now. And they will try to test Western resolve, and they will try to influence Western and Ukrainian decision making."" Fears that Russia could launch a tactical, or small-scale nuclear strike have mounted since Putin issued his warning last week that he would defend Russian territory — including parts of Ukraine he unilaterally declared dominion over this week — by ""all the means at our disposal."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to take the threat seriously, telling CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday: ""Maybe yesterday it was a bluff. Now, it could be a reality."" ""He wants to scare the whole world. These are the first steps of his nuclear blackmail,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I don't think he's bluffing. I think the world is deterring it and containing this threat. We need to keep putting pressure on him and not allow him to continue."" CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata asked the exiled mayor of Melitopol, a Ukrainian city currently occupied by Russian forces, whether he believed the Russian leader would resort to nuclear weapons as he lashes out in anger over battlefield losses. ""I expect it,"" Mayor Ivan Federov told CBS News. Justin Crump, a veteran of the British army and the CEO of the intelligence consulting firm Sibylline, told BBC News earlier Tuesday, however, that Russia was likely stoking concern over a possible nuclear attack primarily to influence Western decision making. ""I think it's pretty clear that Russian intent is to keep us nervous, to try across a whole spectrum of activities to dislocate Western support for Ukraine,"" Crump said. ""I suspect that there's quite a high likelihood of some kind of nuclear test in the Arctic, probably showcasing their new technology. That could well happen at this time of year anyway. But of course, anything like that now will be jumped on as proof that Russia is increasing the tension, increasing the ante, is getting ready to use weapons… These are not things to indicate something is imminent, but they're being jumped on and extrapolated in this climate of fear. So that's something we do have to be quite aware of.""",2.078626256294455,2.548791239108062,-0.47016498281360697,3

""This is moral idiocy, repetition of Kremlin propaganda, a betrayal of Ukrainian courage and sacrifice, and puts a few minutes browsing Crimea on Wikipedia over the current horrific reality of Putin's bloody war,"" Kasparov tweeted. In the first weeks of the invasion in early March, Musk came to Ukraine's aid when his SpaceX company shared its Starlink satellite system that helps deliver internet access to areas that lack coverage. At the time, Zelenskyy thanked Musk for the equipment that he said would help maintain communications in cities under attack. However, in April, Musk said that as a ""free speech absolutist"" Starlink would not block Russian state media outlets that spread propaganda and misinformation on the war in Ukraine.",3.00808335474748,4.480790912542926,-1.4727075577954465,8
2022-10-03,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/ukraine-russia-troops-continue-offensive-claim-new-gains/,Ukraine claws back more territory in areas Russia is trying to absorb,"Ukrainian forces scored more gains in their counteroffensive across at least two fronts Monday, advancing in the very areas that Russia is trying to absorb and challenging Moscow's effort to engage fresh troops and its threats to defend incorporated areas by all means. In their latest breakthrough, Ukrainian forces penetrated Moscow's defenses in the strategic southern Kherson region, one of the four areas in Ukraine that Russia is in the process of annexing. Kyiv's troops also consolidated gains in the east and other major battlefields, re-establishing Ukrainian control just as Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to overcome problems with manpower, weapons, troop morale and logistics, along with intensifying domestic and international criticism. Putin faces disarray and anger domestically about his partial troop mobilization and confusion about the establishment of new Russian borders. Ukraine's advances have become so apparent that even Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov, who usually focuses on his military's successes and the enemy's losses, was forced to acknowledge it. ""With numerically superior tank units in the direction of Zolota Balka and Oleksandrivka, the enemy managed to forge deep into our defenses,"" Konashenkov said Monday, referring to two towns in the Kherson region. He coupled that with claims that Russian forces inflicted heavy losses on Ukraine's military. Ukrainian forces have struggled to retake the Kherson region due to its open terrain, in contrast to their successful breakout offensive in the northeast around the country's second-largest city of Kharkiv that began last month. Ukraine has pressed its counteroffensive in the Kherson region since the summer, relentlessly pummeling Russian supply lines and making inroads into Russian-held areas west of the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian military has used U.S.-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to repeatedly hit the main bridge across the Dnieper and a dam that served as a second crossing. It also has struck pontoon bridges that Russia has used to supply its troops. As the front lines shifted, Russia's lower house of parliament rubber-stamped annexation treaties for Ukraine's Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions to join Russia. The upper house will follow suit Tuesday. This follows annexation referendums that the Kremlin orchestrated last week that the U.N. chief and Western nations have said were illegal and fraudulent. Russia's moves to incorporate the Ukrainian regions, as well as Putin's effort to mobilize more troops, have been done so hastily that government officials have struggled to explain and implement them. On Monday, the issue was basic: Exactly what areas of Ukraine is Russia trying to incorporate? Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Donetsk and Luhansk are joining Russia with the same administrative borders that existed before a conflict erupted there in 2014 between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces. But he added that the borders of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are still undecided. ""We will continue to discuss that with residents of those regions,"" Peskov said. A senior Russian lawmaker offered a different view. Pavel Krasheninnikov said Zaporizhzhia will be absorbed within its ""administrative borders,"" meaning Moscow plans to incorporate parts of the region still under Kyiv's control. He said similar logic will apply to Kherson, but that Russia will include two districts of the neighboring Mykolaiv region that are now occupied by Russia. In addition to the Kherson areas that Russia's Defense Ministry cited, other sources showed Ukrainian flags, soldiers deployed or other signs that Kyiv's forces had retaken the villages of Arkhanhelske, Myroliubivka, Khreshchenivka, Mykhalivka and Novovorontsovka. There was no immediate confirmation from Kyiv on the gains. The situation in the regional capital, also called Kherson, was so precarious that Russian authorities are restricting people from leaving, Ukraine's presidential office said. A Russian-installed official in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, acknowledged that the Ukrainian forces ""have broken through a little deeper"" but insisted that ""everything is under control"" and that Russia's ""defense system is working."" Still, Russia claimed some success at pushing back. The Moscow-appointed chief of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said Ukrainian troops tried to advance toward Dudchany along the Dnieper's western bank, seeking to reach a key dam at Nova Kakhovka, but that Russian warplanes destroyed two Ukrainian battalions and halted the offensive. Saldo also said Russian forces fended off Ukraine's attempted inroads into the Kherson region from Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih. Neither Saldo's nor Stremousov's claims could be independently verified. Ukraine reported advances in other areas Russia is annexing. The Ukrainian governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said Kyiv's forces retook the village of Torske, 12 miles from the city of Kreminna. Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said the area is ""key for controlling the entire Luhansk region, because further beyond (the city) the Russians don't have any more lines of defenses."" ""Retaking this city opens up operational space for Ukrainians to rapidly advance to the very state border with Russia,"" Zhdanov told The Associated Press. He said Russian troops had retreated from the Kharkiv region. Ukraine's army reportedly liberated most of Borova in the Kharkiv region across the Oskil River, 31 miles north of the city of Lyman. Officials posted a video while driving along recaptured streets, waving the Ukrainian flag. ""Finally, you are home. Finally, it's Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!"" an onlooker yelled. Elsewhere in the Kharkiv region, a doctor was killed and nurse wounded in a Russian missile attack on a hospital in Kupiansk that caused major damage, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported. Last week, at least 24 civilians were killed in an attack on a convoy trying to flee Kupiansk. Ukraine also has retaken Lyman, a strategic eastern city that the Russians had used as a key logistics and transport hub. Lyman is in the Donetsk region near the border with Luhansk. Ukraine's push to recapture territory has embarrassed the Kremlin and prompted rare domestic criticism of Putin's war. Tens of thousands of Russian men have fled Russia since the Sept. 21 call-up. Many flew to Turkey, one of the few countries maintaining air links with Russia. Others have left in cars, creating long traffic jams at the Russian borders with Georgia, Kazakhstan and Finland. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said Monday that the director general of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant — Europe's largest — had been released from Russian custody. Russian forces had blindfolded and detained Ihor Murashov on Friday for questioning.",2.907667895157169,2.4300115247584215,0.4776563703987473,5

""I welcome the release of Ihor Murashov, director general of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant; I have received confirmation that Mr Murashov has returned to his family safely,"" Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Twitter. Kyiv on Saturday called for the immediate release of Murashov, condemning his ""illegal detention."" Zaporizhzhia — Europe's largest nuclear energy facility — has been at the center of recent tensions after Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of strikes on and near the plant, raising fears of an atomic disaster. Murashov was detained by a ""Russian patrol"" on Friday at around 4:00 p.m. local time (8:00 a.m. Eastern) on his way from the plant to the city of Energodar, the head of Ukraine's nuclear agency Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said in a statement. He said Murashov's vehicle was stopped, he was taken out of the car and ""with his eyes blindfolded, he was driven in an unknown direction."" Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement it ""condemns in the strongest terms the illegal detention."" Murashov ""bears the main and exclusive responsibility for the nuclear and radiation safety"" of the Zaporizhzhia plant, according to Kotin. The nuclear plant is located in Russian-held territory of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region, which Russia on Friday annexed together with three other territories in Ukraine: Donetsk, Lugansk and Kherson. Shelling around the plant has spurred calls from Kyiv and its Western allies to demilitarize areas around nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Russia has indicated no willingness, however, to remove its forces from the Zaporizhzhia plant. A monitoring team from the U.N. visited Zaporizhzhia in early September, and the IAEA has been pushing Kyiv and Moscow to agree to set up a security zone around the plant to seek to avoid any nuclear accidents. Grossi said over the weekend that he was expecting to travel to Kyiv and Moscow this week to discuss the issue, but as CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported on Monday, the tension between Russia and Ukraine is only mounting. D'Agata reported from the city of Dnipro, one of the many towns in Ukrainian-held territory where civilians are bearing the brunt of Vladimir Putin's anger as his own forces are pushed back from ground they've held for months. The exiled mayor of the city of Melitopol, which sits in the Russian-occupied portion of the Zaporizhzhia region, told D'Agata he expects Putin to lash out with a tactical nuclear strike in retaliation for the loss of territory.",3.0119417095373513,2.539019550942688,0.47292215859466324,2
2022-10-01,https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-chief-detained-russia/,"Russia detains Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant chief, Ukraine says","Russian forces blindfolded and detained the head of Europe's largest nuclear plant, Ukraine's nuclear power provider said Saturday, reigniting long-simmering fears over the plant's security. The alleged kidnapping on Friday apparently took place shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin escalated his war in Ukraine and pushed it into a new, dangerous phase by annexing four Ukrainian regions that Moscow fully or partially controls and heightening threats of nuclear force. In a possible attempt to secure Moscow's hold on the newly annexed territory, Russian forces seized the director-general of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Ihor Murashov, around 4 p.m. Friday, the Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom said. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Saturday that Russia told it that ""the director-general of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was temporarily detained to answer questions."" The Vienna-based IAEA said, ""in line with its nuclear safety mandate,"" it ""has been actively seeking clarifications and hopes for a prompt and satisfactory resolution of this matter."" Putin on Friday signed treaties to absorb the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, including the area around the nuclear plant. Energoatom said Russian troops stopped Murashov's car, blindfolded him and then took him to an undisclosed location. ""His detention by (Russia) jeopardizes the safety of Ukraine and Europe's largest nuclear power plant,"" said Energoatom President Petro Kotin, demanding the director's immediate release. Russia did not immediately acknowledge seizing the plant director. The power plant repeatedly has been caught in the crossfire of the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian technicians continued running the power station after Russian troops seized it. Its last reactor was shut down in September as a precautionary measure as constant shelling nearby damaged electric transmission lines to the plant. The plant is a strategic trophy for Russia and has triggered worldwide concern as the only nuclear plant caught up in modern warfare. Active fighting nearby means it's unlikely to start producing electricity again soon even if Russia installs its own management. It is like a town unto itself, with some 11,000 workers before the war. While many have fled amid the fighting, others have stayed to ensure the safety of its radioactive material and structures. Energoatom spokespeople told The Associated Press on Saturday that employees of the Zaporizhzhia power plant are being forced to submit applications to report to Rosatom, Russia's state-run nuclear energy giant that operates Russian nuclear plants. Murashov was against handing the Zaporizhzhia plant over to Rosatom, but Energoatom's spokespeople couldn't confirm that this was the reason for his kidnapping. Murashov had access to security codes, coordinated all the work at the plant, made sure protocols were being followed and reported to Kyiv, according to Energoatom's spokespeople. Ukrainian authorities appointed him to run the plant several days before Russian troops rolled into Ukraine. Nevertheless, Energoatom said it hasn't lost connections with the plant and all important parameters of its work are still being reported to Kyiv.",2.0935814817242093,2.403958317028962,-0.3103768353047527,2
2022-09-30,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/army-major-wife-charged-giving-medical-secrets-russia/,Army major and wife indicted for conspiring to give Russia medical secrets,"An Army physician and her anesthesiologist wife have been indicted for conspiring to give Russia medical information to help its invasion of Ukraine, the Justice Department announced Thursday. Maj. Jamie Lee Henry, a doctor at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, and her wife Anna Gabrielian, an anesthesiologist in Maryland, told an undercover FBI agent in August they'd provide medical information to the Russian government, according to the indictment unsealed Thursday. The Justice Department indictment refers to Henry as male, but in 2015, BuzzFeed News reported that Henry became the nation's first known active duty transgender active- duty U.S. Army officer, after the Army granted her request to change her name and gender. Henry and Gabrielian met with an individual they believed was associated with the Russian government but who was really an undercover agent, the indictment said. The couple allegedly told the agent they could pass on medical records to Russia of U.S. military, military family members and other individuals. Later, in a meeting at a hotel, Gabrielian allegedly provided the agent with medical information of two people: the spouse of an employee at the Office of Naval Intelligence and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. Gabrielian pointed out a medical issue in the first record that Russia could exploit, the Justice Department said. Henry provided the information of at least five individuals who were patients at Fort Bragg and were either military veterans or related to military veterans, the indictment said. Henry and Gabrielian both allegedly told the agent they were committed to helping Russia. The indictment said Gabrielian had reached out to the Russian embassy offering help, and Henry had allegedly even tried to join the Russian military after the invasion started but was told Russia only wanted individuals who had combat experience, which Henry lacks. Henry was more hesitant about violating the law limiting healthcare providers from sharing confidential medical records, but Gabrielian said she violated the law ""all the time,"" the Justice Department said. According to the indictment, Gabrielian told the agent Henry was a more valuable source for Russia because Henry had information on how the U.S. military establishes army hospitals in war conditions and about previous training the U.S. military had provided to Ukrainian personnel. A U.S. military service record provided to CBS News verified that Henry is currently assigned to Fort Bragg, N.C., as a staff internist with a rank of Major and has no combat deployments. The indictment said Henry holds a Secret-level security clearance, which allows access to information whose release would cause serious damage to national security. During their first meeting in a hotel room, the Justice Department said Gabrielian told the agent that if anything were to happen to her and Henry, she wanted their children ""to have a nice flight to Turkey to go on vacation because I don't want to end in jail here with my kids being hostages over my head."" Gabrielian and Henry were both expected to have their first court appearances Thursday.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2022-09-29,https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/ukraine-russia-putin-to-annex-occupied-regions-after-sham-referendums/,"Russia to annex 4 occupied regions of Ukraine this week after ""referendums"" staged by Moscow","Kyiv — Russia confirmed on Thursday it will formally annex parts of Ukraine where occupied areas held Kremlin-orchestrated ""referendums"" on living under Moscow's rule that the Ukrainian government and the West denounced as illegal and rigged. Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend a ceremony on Friday in the Kremlin when four regions of Ukraine will be officially folded into Russia, spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said the pro-Moscow administrators of the regions will sign treaties to join Russia during the ceremony at the Kremlin's St. George's Hall. The official annexation was widely expected following the votes that wrapped up on Tuesday in the areas under Russian occupation in Ukraine and after Moscow claimed residents overwhelmingly supported for their areas to formally become part of Russia. The United States and its Western allies have sharply condemned the votes as ""sham referenda"" and vowed never to recognize their results. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Thursday joined other Western officials in denouncing the referendums. ""Under threats and sometimes even (at) gunpoint people are being taken out of their homes or workplaces to vote in glass ballot boxes,"" she said at a conference in Berlin. ""This is the opposite of free and fair elections,"" Baerbock said. ""And this is the opposite of peace. It's dictated peace. As long as this Russian diktat prevails in the occupied territories of Ukraine, no citizen is safe. No citizen is free."" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a statement condemning the Russian plan. ""The UN Charter is clear,"" he said. ""Any annexation of a State's territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Principles of the UN Charter and international law."" ""I must be clear,"" stressed Guterres. ""The Russian Federation, as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, shares a particular responsibility to respect the Charter. Any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned. It cannot be reconciled with the international legal framework."" Armed troops had gone door-to-door with election officials to collect ballots in five days of voting. The suspiciously high margins in favor were characterized as a land grab by an increasingly cornered Russian leadership after embarrassing military losses in Ukraine. Moscow-installed administrations in the four regions of southern and eastern Ukraine claimed Tuesday night that 93% of the ballots cast in the Zaporizhzhia region supported annexation, as did 87% in the Kherson region, 98% in the Luhansk region and 99% in Donetsk. Ukraine too has dismissed the referendums as illegitimate, saying it has every right to retake the territories, a position that has won support from Washington. The Kremlin has been unmoved by the criticism. After a counteroffensive by Ukraine this month dealt Moscow's forces heavy battlefield setbacks, Russia said it would call up 300,000 reservists to join the fight. It also warned it could resort to nuclear weapons if its territory is attacked — and many have viewed the looming annexations as a way for Putin to create the pretext of exactly such a direct attack on Russia. Also on Thursday, Ukrainian authorities said Russian shelling has killed at least eight civilians, including a child, and wounded scores of others. A 12-year-old girl has been pulled out of rubble after an attack on Dnipro, officials said. ""The rescuers have taken her from under the rubble, she was asleep when the Russian missile hit,"" said local administrator Valentyn Reznichenko. Reports of new shelling came as Russia appeared to continue to lose ground around a key northeastern city of Lyman while it struggles to press on with chaotic mobilization of troops and prevent the fighting-age men from leaving the country, according to a Washington-based think-tank and the British intelligence reports. The Institute for the Study of War, citing Russian reports, said Ukrainian forces have taken more villages around Lyman, a city some 100 miles southeast of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The report said Ukrainian forces may soon encircle Lyman entirely, in what would be a major blow to Moscow's war effort. ""The collapse of the Lyman pocket will likely be highly consequential to the Russian grouping in northern Donetsk and western Luhansk oblasts and may allow Ukrainian troops to threaten Russian positions along the western Luhansk"" region, the institute said. The British military intelligence report claimed the number of Russian military-age men fleeing the country likely exceeds the number of forces Moscow used to initially invade Ukraine in February. ""The better off and well educated are over-represented amongst those attempting to leave Russia,"" the British said. ""When combined with those reservists who are being mobilized, the domestic economic impact of reduced availability of labor and the acceleration of 'brain drain' is likely to become increasingly significant."" That partial mobilization is deeply unpopular in some areas, however, triggering protests, scattered violence, and Russians fleeing the country by the tens of thousands. Miles-long lines formed at some borders and Moscow also reportedly set up draft offices at borders to intercept some of those trying to leave.

Anna Gabrielian and Maj. Jamie Lee Henry allegedly communicated to someone they believed to be working for the Russian government, who was actually an undercover FBI agent, that they were willing to provide the medical records of military personnel and of certain patients of Johns Hopkins Hospital. Both live in Rockville. The indictment only refers to Johns Hopkins as ""medical institution 1,"" but Gabrielian, 36, says she is employed at Johns Hopkins Hospital on her LinkedIn and is also listed as an anesthesiology instructor at Hopkins Medicine. ""We were shocked to learn about this news this morning and intend to fully cooperate with investigators,"" a spokesperson for Johns Hopkins Medicine told WJZ. The indictment said Maj. Henry, 39, held a Secret level security clearance, which permits an individual to have access to information classified Secret, ""the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security."" Maj. Henry was stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, one of the largest military installations in the world. A 2015 Buzzfeed article profiled Maj. Henry as the first out transgender active duty U.S. Army officer, as a transgender woman. Prosecutors in the indictment referred to them as Gabrielian's ""husband"" and used he/him pronouns. The two are charged with conspiracy and offenses related to violating HIPAA, a federal law that protects sensitive health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge. Gabrielian allegedly met with the undercover FBI agent at a Baltimore hotel on August 17 after the agent told her they were associated with the Russian Embassy. The anesthesiologist told the agent she had previously reached out directly to the Russian Embassy by email and phone to offer her and Maj. Henry's assistance after the nation invaded Ukraine, the indictment alleges. Maj. Henry allegedly went to the hotel the same night and told the undercover of their commitment to ""assisting Russia,"" according to prosecutors. The major is quoted in the indictment as telling the agent ""…until the United States actually declares war against Russia, I'm able to help as much as I want. At that point, I'll have some ethical issues I have to work through."" Gabrielian allegedly replied: ""You'll work through those ethical issues."" Gabrielian was ""motivated by patriotism toward Russia,"" and allegedly said her spouse had info on how the U.S. establishes field hospitals. She allegedly told the agent their information needed to be used ""for something tactically advantageous…not just check if this person has polyps."" Maj. Henry allegedly hesitated in handing over the information. The week after the clandestine hotel meeting, Gabrielian allegedly told the agent her spouse was a ""coward"" concerned about HIPAA violations. She said she ""had no concerns and violated HIPAA 'all the time,'"" prosecutors said. Despite any initial misgivings, prosecutors say the couple met with the agent on Aug. 31 at a Gaithersburg hotel to handover the medical information of: ""The fact they went through with this, or tried to go through with it, is troubling,"" said Michael Greenberger Director of the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security. ""That could be used by Russia to blackmail the individual whose information is released."" The two had their initial appearances Thursday at the U.S. District Court in Baltimore. Both have been released on home detention with 24/7 location monitoring. Gabrielian also has a $500,000 unsecured bond.

Security Council, slamming the illegitimate votes that Russia is forcing on citizens in occupied Ukraine. His speech came as Moscow-backed officials declared that all four regions voted in favor of joining Russia. ""In front of the eyes of the whole world, Russia is conducting this so-called sham referenda on the occupied territory of Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said. ""People are forced to fill out some papers while being threatened by submachine guns."" He said that the proposed annexation of occupied territories in Ukraine, as a result of the vote, ""is an attempt to steal the territory of another state...a very cynical attempt to force the male population in the occupied territory of Ukraine to mobilize into the Russian army in order to send them to fight against their own homeland."" In response to Russia's actions, Zelenskyy called on nations to completely isolate Russia by removing it as a permanent member of the Security Council — with the right of veto — and excluding it from all international organizations; impose stronger sanctions against Russia; send Ukraine necessary defense and financial support; and give Ukraine ""clear and legally-binding guarantees of collective security."" ""Such a clear signal is what is now needed from every country in the world. I believe in your ability to act,"" Zelenskyy said. Back in April, the Ukrainian leader spoke to the Security Council, presenting evidence that Russian forces deliberately killed civilians, many of them shot in yards, streets and homes, and left their bodies in the open. He again detailed the atrocities committed against the country's civilians when he spoke to the U.N. General Assembly last week, and asked the U.N. to hold Russia accountable for the alleged crimes. Tuesday's address was intended to lay out what the world must do to stop Russia from annexing Ukrainian territory. On the implications, Zelenskyy has been clear. The ""pseuda referenda,"" Zelenskyy said last week on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" makes it impossible ""to continue any diplomatic negotiations."" As Zelenskyy spoke on Tuesday, the Kremlin announced all four occupied regions of Ukraine voted to join Russia, clearing the way for — in Russia's view — annexation of the occupied regions. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia objected at the onset of the meeting to a live videoconference address by Ukraine's president – suggesting that only in-person participation is appropriate, and again spoke of ""Russophobic hysteria."" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that the U.S. and Albania would introduce a Security Council resolution to condemn the ""sham referenda."" She was joined by Albania's Ambassador Ferit Hoxha, a co-sponsor of the measure. The draft resolution, obtained by CBS News, demands that Russian forces leave Ukraine, and reaffirms the ""commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders."" It goes on to say that the referenda ""have no validity and cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine."" The U.S.-Albania resolution ""calls on all states calls upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any purported acquisition by the Russian Federation of any or all of Ukraine's regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson or Zaporizhzhya, and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status."" During Tuesday's meeting, Thomas-Greenfield told diplomats that the purpose of the referenda is evident: ""Russia intends to try to annex these territories."" ""Putin intentionally chose this moment to insult the Charter that outlines principles we all collectively stand for — sovereignty, territorial integrity, peace and security,"" she said last week, as diplomats from almost 200 nations were at U.N. headquarters. She described in brutal detail what was happening with the Russian vote, calling it ""a well-worn Kremlin playbook."" ""Russia runs sham referenda, in areas controlled by Russia's military and its proxies, coercing people to 'vote' at gunpoint,"" Thomas-Greenfield. ""It then uses these referenda to try to lend a semblance of legitimacy to its attempted annexations of another sovereign state's territory."" She said that the U.S. ""will never recognize any territory Russia attempts to seize or allegedly annex as anything other than part of Ukraine."" Thomas-Greenfield clarified that the resolution that will be introduced — and surely vetoed by Russia — will be brought to the General Assembly ""to send an unmistakable message to Moscow."" Hoxha, who co-sponsored the resolution, echoed concerns over Russia's referenda. ""We see protests against the call for going to Ukraine, because we believe that the Russian citizens do not want to go there, why they have to die in this war they do not want,"" Hoxha said. After the meeting, Thomas-Greenfield told reporters that the resolution will be introduced later this week or early next week in the Security Council.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3

The Japanese diplomat based in the eastern city of Vladivostok was deemed ""persona non grata over illegal intelligence activities"", top government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters, citing the Russian foreign ministry. ""The official was blindfolded, with pressure applied to both his hands and head so he was unable to move while being detained, and then he was questioned in an overbearing way,"" Matsuno said. Japan ""strongly protests these unbelievable acts"", he said, denying the espionage allegations. The diplomat has been released and will leave Russia by Wednesday, he added. Japan summoned the Russian ambassador and ""demanded a formal apology"" for the treatment of the diplomat, which Matsuno said violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Russia said Monday that it had detained a Japanese consulate official based in the eastern city of Vladivostok for soliciting ""restricted"" information, according to Russian news agencies. ""A Japanese diplomat was detained red-handed while receiving, in exchange for financial reward, restricted information about Russia's cooperation with another country in the Asia-Pacific region,"" the FSB, the KGB's successor agency, was cited as saying through its press service, without specifying the third country. The FSB identified the official as Tatsunori Motoki, accusing him of seeking out information on ""the impact of Western sanctions"" on the surrounding Primoriye region, according to news agencies. The FSB distributed a short video it said showed the diplomat acknowledging that he had violated Russian laws, and reportedly said Moscow had lodged a protest with Tokyo through diplomatic channels. Russia considers Japan to be a ""hostile"" country -- a designation it shares with all European Union countries, the United States and its allies, including Britain and Australia. Tokyo had complex relations with Moscow before the invasion of Ukraine in February, and the two sides have yet to sign a post-World War II peace treaty. Attempts to do so have been hampered by a long-running dispute over islands controlled by Russia, which calls them the Kurils.

2022-09-27,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-referendums-pro-moscow-officials-say-occupied-areas-voted-to-join/,Pro-Moscow officials say occupied areas have voted to join Russia in referendums dismissed as illegitimate by the West,"The Kremlin paved the way Tuesday to annex part of Ukraine and escalate the war by claiming that residents of a large swath of occupied Ukraine overwhelmingly supported joining with Russia in stage-managed referendums that the U.S. and its Western allies have dismissed as illegitimate. Pro-Moscow officials said all four occupied regions of Ukraine voted to join Russia. According to Russia-installed election officials, 93% of the ballots cast in the Zaporizhzhia region supported annexation, as did 87% in the Kherson region, 98% in the Luhansk region and 99% in Donetsk. In a remark that appeared to rule out negotiations, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council by video from Kyiv that Russia's attempts to annex Ukrainian territory will mean ""there is nothing to talk about with this president of Russia."" The preordained outcome sets the stage for a dangerous new phase in Russia's seven-month war in Ukraine because it is expected to serve as a pretext for Moscow to annex the four areas. That could happen as soon as Friday. The referendums in the Luhansk and Kherson regions and parts of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia began Sept. 23, often with armed officials going door-to-door collecting votes. The ballots asked residents whether they wanted the areas to be incorporated into Russia. Moscow-backed officials in the four occupied regions in southern and eastern Ukraine said polls closed Tuesday afternoon after five days of voting. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address Russia's parliament about the referendums on Friday, and Valentina Matviyenko, who chairs the parliament's upper house, said lawmakers could consider annexation legislation on Oct. 4. Meanwhile, Russia ramped up warnings that it could deploy nuclear weapons to defend its territory, including newly acquired lands, and continued mobilizing more than a quarter-million more troops to deploy to a front line of more than 620 miles. After the balloting, ""the situation will radically change from the legal viewpoint, from the point of view of international law, with all the corresponding consequences for protection of those areas and ensuring their security,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday. Many Western leaders have called the referendum a sham, and the U.N. Security Council was scheduled to meet later Tuesday in New York to discuss a resolution that says the voting results will never be accepted and that the four regions remain part of Ukraine. Russia is certain to veto the resolution. The balloting and a call-up of Russian military reservists that Putin ordered last Wednesday are aimed at buttressing Moscow's exposed military and political positions. The referendums follow a familiar Kremlin playbook for territorial expansion. In 2014, Russian authorities held a similar referendum on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, under the close watch of Russian troops. Based on the voting, Russia annexed Crimea. Putin cited the defense of Russians living in Ukraine's eastern regions, and their supposed desires to join with Russia, as a pretext for his Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Putin has been talking up Moscow's nuclear option since Ukrainians launched a counteroffensive that reclaimed territory and has increasingly cornered his forces. A top Putin aide ratcheted up the nuclear rhetoric Tuesday. ""Let's imagine that Russia is forced to use the most powerful weapon against the Ukrainian regime that has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state,"" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of the Russian Security Council that Putin chairs, wrote on his messaging app channel. ""I believe that NATO will steer clear from direct meddling in the conflict."" The United States has dismissed the Kremlin's nuclear talk as a scare tactic. The referendums ask residents whether they want the areas to be incorporated into Russia, and the Kremlin has portrayed them as free and fair, reflective of the people's desire for self-determination. Tens of thousands of residents had already fled the regions because of the war, and images shared by those who remained showed armed Russian troops going door-to-door to pressure Ukrainians into voting. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko, who left the port city after the Russians seized it after a months-long siege, said only about 20% of the 100,000 estimated remaining residents cast ballots in the Donetsk referendum. Mariupol's pre-war population was 541,000. ""A man toting an assault rifle comes to your home and asks you to vote, so what can people do?"" Boychenko asked during a news conference, explaining how people were coerced into voting. Western allies sided firmly with Ukraine, dismissing the referendum votes as a meaningless sham. British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the ballots were ""a desperate move"" by Putin. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said while visiting Kyiv on Tuesday that France was determined ""to support Ukraine and its sovereignty and territorial integrity."" She described the ballots as ""mock referendums."" Ukrainian officials said Paris and Kyiv had moved closer to an agreement that would supply Ukrainian forces with French Caesar artillery systems. Elsewhere, trouble emerged for Putin in the mass call-up he ordered of Russians to active military duty. The order has triggered a massive exodus of men from Russia, fueled protests in many regions and sparked acts of violence. On Monday, a gunman opened fire in an enlistment office in a Siberian city and gravely wounded the local chief military recruitment officer. Scattered arson attacks had been reported earlier on other enlistment offices. One destination of fleeing Russian men is Kazakhstan, which reported Tuesday that about 98,000 Russians have crossed into Kazakhstan over the past week. The European Union's border and coast guard agency says 66,000 Russian citizens entered the 27-nation bloc from Sept. 19 to 25, a 30% increase over the preceding week. Russian officials tried to intercept some of the fleeing reservists on one of the main exodus routes, issuing conscription notices on the Georgian border. According to the state-run TASS agency, an enlistment task force was handing out notices at the Verkhnii Lars checkpoint, where an estimated 5,500 cars were lining up to cross. Independent Russian news sources have reported unconfirmed claims that draft-age men will be banned from leaving after the referendum.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3
2022-09-23,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/ukraine-russia-war-referendums-voting-russian-held-regions/,Voting begins in Russian-held regions of Ukraine on referendums to become part of Russia,"Kyiv, Ukraine — Voting began Friday in Moscow-held regions of Ukraine on referendums to become part of Russia, Russian-backed officials there said. The Kremlin-orchestrated referendums, which have been widely denounced by Ukraine and the West as shams without any legal force, are seen as a step toward annexing the territories by Russia. The votes are being held in the Luhansk, Kherson and the partly Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. The votes, which asks residents if they want their regions to be part of Russia, are certain to go Moscow's way. That would give the Kremlin the pretext to claim that attempts by Ukrainian forces to regain control are attacks on Russia itself, dramatically escalating the seven-month war. The referendums follow Russian President Vladimir Putin's order of a partial mobilization, which could add about 300,000 Russian troops to the fight. The balloting will continue for five days through Tuesday. As the votes were getting underway in the occupied regions, Russian social media sites were full of dramatic scenes of tearful families bidding farewell to men departing from military mobilization centers. In cities across the vast country, men hugged their weeping family members before departing as part of the draft. Russian anti-war activists, in the meantime, planned more protests against the mobilization. Widespread demonstrations that followed the announcement of the partial call-up have seen more than 1,000 arrests, according to an independent monitor group. Flights from Russia were said to be filling up and lines of outgoing traffic at the border with Finland and other countries were miles long at one point. Traffic was still heavy Friday morning, the Reuters news agency reported. Election officials will be bringing ballots to people's homes and setting up makeshift polling stations near residential buildings during the first four days of the referendums, according to Russian-installed officials in the occupied regions, who cited safety reasons. Tuesday will be the only day when the voters will be invited to come to regular polls. Polls also opened in Russia, where refugees from the occupied regions can cast their votes. Denis Pushilin, separatist leader of Moscow-backed authorities in the Donetsk region, called the referendum on Friday ""a historical milestone."" Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, addressed the occupied regions Friday in an online statement, saying: ""If you decide to become part of the Russian Federation - we will support you."" Valentina Matviyenko, chair of Russia's upper parliament house, said that residents of the occupied regions were voting for ""life or death"" at the referendums. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy only briefly mentioned the ""sham referenda"" in his nightly address in which he switched from speaking in Ukrainian to Russian to directly tell Russian citizens they are being ""thrown to their deaths."" ""You are already accomplices in all these crimes, murders and torture of Ukrainians,"" he said. ""Because you were silent. Because you are silent. And now it's time for you to choose. For men in Russia, this is a choice to die or live, to become a cripple or to preserve health. For women in Russia, the choice is to lose their husbands, sons, grandchildren forever, or still try to protect them from death, from war, from one person."" The voting takes place against the backdrop of incessant fighting in Ukraine, with Russian and Ukrainian forces exchanging fire as both sides refuse to concede ground. On Friday morning, pro-Russia officials in the Zaporizhzhia region reported a loud blast in the center of Melitopol, a city that Moscow captured early in the war. Official Vladimir Rogov didn't offer any details as to what caused the explosion and whether there were damage and casualties. Moscow-backed authorities in the Donetsk region also accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the city of Donetsk, the region's capital, and the nearby city of Yasynuvata. Ukrainian officials, in turn, reported new rounds of Russian shelling in various parts of the country. Vitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region in southern Ukraine that borders the Kherson region, said explosions rang out in the city of Mykolaiv in the early hours of Friday. Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, said the Russians unleashed a barrage of shelling on Nikopol, a city across from the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, on Friday morning.",0.0,0.0,0.0,2
