2022-11-05,https://abcnews.go.com/US/explainer-law-enforcement-responding-election-threats-country/story?id=92686448,Explainer: How law enforcement is responding to election threats around the country,"Election security is on the minds of many Americans in the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections. The aftermath of the 2020 elections coupled with an increased threat of foreign interference through election tampering, fraud, and intimidation have forced the federal government to create an election security umbrella that never existed before. That umbrella is, in large measure, coordinated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with support from the Department of Homeland Security's Critical Security and Infrastructure Agency as well as the National Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. military Cyber Command. For the FBI, the threats can be in person, in writing, via phone, or made online. They can include: - Voter suppression, where bad actors spread disinformation about voting using various methods such as social media platforms, texting, or peer-to-peer messaging applications on smartphones. They may provide misleading information about the time, manner, or place of voting. This can include inaccurate election dates or false claims about voting qualifications or methods, such as false information suggesting that one may vote by text, which is not allowed in any U.S. jurisdiction. - Threats against election workers, which includes any threat to an election worker or volunteer that causes fear, danger or intimidation. - Voter fraud, by giving false information when registering to vote (such as false citizenship claims), by voting when ineligible to vote, and by voting more than once or using someone else's name to vote. - Election fraud, which includes changing a ballot tally or engaging in other corrupt behavior as an elections official; providing a voter with money or something of value in exchange for voting for a specific candidate or party in a federal election; threatening a voter with physical or financial harm if they don't vote or don't vote a certain way; and trying to prevent qualified voters from voting by lying about the time, date, or place of an election, i.e., voter suppression. - Campaign fraud, which includes excessive campaign contributions above the legal limit, conduit contributions or straw donor schemes, contributions from prohibited sources, cording between Super PACs and independent expenditure organizations and a candidate's campaign, and using campaign funds for personal or unauthorized use. The threats can emanate from domestic and foreign sources, including state and non-state actors and radical U.S.-based groups. In every case, these attempts are meant to sway voters and the election process in one direction or another. In August of 2020, then-Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanna warned that China, Russia and Iran were attempting to sway American voters and influence the election. The same holds true today as these same state actors, once again, are trying to usurp the U.S. election process. To combat this, in addition to its broad partnerships, the FBI has created a robust and expansive election intelligence effort aimed at identifying and mitigating any threat to the election process. This includes the creation of the Foreign Influence Task Forces, which brought the FBI's national security and traditional criminal investigative expertise under one umbrella to prevent foreign influence in our elections. Additionally, as has been done in the past, on Election Day the FBI will spin up command posts across the nation that will monitor and respond to investigative tips as well as real time election issues. These command posts are staffed by investigators and analysts from the FBI and its partners, including local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, that coordinate and work together to thwart any evidence of election tampering, fraud or abuse. Since all alleged Election Day offenses get referred to the FBI for investigation and potential prosecution by the Department of Justice, the Justice Department will run a nationwide Election Day Program, where an assistant U.S. attorney is appointed by the United States attorney in that district as the election coordinator. All of this is in an effort to ensure that the election is safe and that any nefarious actors are identified and stopped, in order to protect the voting process. Donald J.

2022-11-04,https://abcnews.go.com/International/muppets-moscow-true-story-making-sesame-street-russia/story?id=92540407,Muppets in Moscow: The true story of making 'Sesame Street' in Russia,"When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, producers, artists, writers and other creative people became involved in creating culture for what they imagined would be a new, more open society. Natasha Lance Rogoff, a journalist and filmmaker living in Russia at the time, author of the new book ""Muppets in Moscow: The Unexpected Crazy True Story of Making Sesame Street in Russia"" was one of these people. ""This was an exciting time. There was so much hope,"" Rogoff told ABC News Live anchor Linsey Davis. Rogoff said she was approached by the executives of ""Sesame Street"" about making an international co-production of the show in Russia. It was a remarkable and ambitious project, she said, adding that ""the idea was that the Muppets would be the best ambassadors to bring idealistic values to post-communist Russia."" ""Sesame Street,"" which launched in the U.S. in 1969, has had international spin-offs from the start, with early co-productions in Brazil, Mexico, Canada and Germany. There are currently more than 30 international co-productions of the show, and “each show in every different country reflects the culture and values of that society,” according to Rogoff. Russia, which had been part of the Soviet Union and ruled under the political ideology of Communism for nearly seven decades, began to loosen the state's control over all aspects of society in 1991. ""I thought that Sesame Street could really help in terms of modeling different values and skills that children would need to thrive in a new, open society,"" said Rogoff. The Russian co-production of ""Sesame Street,"" translated as ""Ulitsa Sezam,"" first aired in 1996. The characters of ""Sesame Street"" were adapted to a Russian audience so Big Bird, for example, was modeled after the character of Domovoy in Russian folklore. But certain ideas and themes did not always translate. Rogoff recounted the story of how she suggested a storyline for the show that featured a lemonade stand, which she suggested could teach children counting and team-building skills. It was met with ""complete horror,"" she said, with Russian educators, who were consultants for the show, telling the team it would be ""shameful to show children selling things on the street."" ""Under communism,"" she explained, ""the people who would be illegally selling items on the street for profit under communism would be criminals and the mafia."" Moments like this illustrate how sensitive the situation was at times. ""It was a very intense period,"" Rogoff said, ""not only in Russia, but for us, for our team, trying to be sensitive to help, you know, as much as we could create a show that reflected their society, but also would promote values which would help them move a transition towards an open society.” ""Ulitsa Sezam” last aired in Russia and other nations of the former Soviet bloc in 2010, reportedly because it lost the support of the Putin regime. Rogoff said the war in Ukraine has an additional layer of meaning for her because she experienced the modern-day nation of Russia in its infancy, witnessing the culture shift from the 1980s to the 1990s. ""I watched the Soviet Union collapse,"" she said. ""That changed in my lifetime."" Rogoff suggested that her work on the ""Ulitsa Sezam"" had, and continues to have, an impact on Russian society. ""The 20-year-olds, late twenties, and the 30-year-olds who are now marching out of Russia because they don't want to fight,"" said Rogoff, ""that is the Sesame Street generation."" ""And on the Ukrainian side, same thing,"" she added. ""That's the 20-year-olds, the same age cohort that are defending their freedom and independence that they got and built during the period of creating 'Ulitsa Sezam.' Those adults now also grew up on the show.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,7
2022-11-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-fetterman-celebrates-oprah-endorsement-unbelievable/story?id=92662674,John Fetterman celebrates Oprah endorsement: 'It's unbelievable',"Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman told the hosts of ABC's ""The View"" on Friday he's thrilled about receiving Oprah Winfrey's endorsement over his Republican opponent, and her former TV sidekick, Dr. Mehmet Oz. ""She’s an icon. It’s unbelievable,"" Fetterman said. ""It’s an honor and I’m so grateful that she understands what’s at stake here in this race."" Winfrey, whose hit daytime show gave Oz national attention as ""America's Doctor"" in the 2000s, announced Thursday night she's supporting Fetterman in the highly contested Senate race that could determine which party wins control of the chamber. ""If I lived in Pennsylvania, I would have already cast my vote for John Fetterman, for many reasons,"" Winfrey said during an online discussion about the importance of voting. For months, Winfrey had been silent about Oz's candidacy. The Oz campaign responded to her endorsement of Fetterman late Thursday night. ""Doctor Oz loves Oprah and respects the fact that they have different politics,"" said spokesperson Brittany Yanick. ""He believes we need more balance and less extremism in Washington."" Fetterman suffered a stroke in May and has since worked with a speech therapist. As an aid for Fetterman's auditory processing issues during his debate with Oz last week, two monitors were hung above moderators' heads to transcribe both the questions and Oz's answers in real time. A week before his debate with Oz, Fetterman's doctors said he was ready for ""full duty"" in office. Still, he declined to release his medical records. Fetterman addressed his health on ""The View."" ""I continue to get better and better every day,"" he said. ""I really do fundamentally believe that both our doctors believe we're fit to serve, and we've been able to maintain the ... rigors of running a campaign going all across Pennsylvania, and spending thousands and thousands of miles all across the state."" ""The View"" co-host Ana Navarro pointed out that while senators in the past have faced serious health challenges in office, none have had these health issues before being elected. With only having released two letters from his doctor and failing to share his medical records, Navarro questioned if Fetterman owes voters full transparency regarding his health. ""I really feel that we have been leaving the same equivalent, kind of, medical information that Dr. Oz did,"" he said. ""We have been very transparent in all our doctors' beliefs, both from June, and also in October, all agree that I am fit to serve."" ""I believe in the team of my doctors, and believe that we're here today, right now on live TV, being able to have this conversation,"" he added. ""I feel that we're running a very transparent race about health issues."" Fetterman addressed his debate with Oz last week, saying that ""it certainly wasn't an even event"" for him, but he thought it was ""critical"" that he ""showed up."" ""I was proud to show up,"" he continued. ""It was much more pleasant being with all of you today than it was on the stage with Dr. Oz."" During his debate with Oz, Fetterman pressed him on his wealth, including the number of mansions he owns. Acknowledging that he has a privileged upbringing himself, Fetterman explains the difference between him and his opponent in that regard. ""It's not necessarily a full equivalence in terms of the money involved, but I really dedicated my career to help young people get their GEDs; to run for mayor of the community; to fight against gun violence as they try to create economic development,"" Fetterman said. ""Dr. Oz chose to really fight for his bank account,"" he added. During last week's debate, Oz made a controversial comment about a woman's choice to have an abortion when he said, ""I don't want the federal government involved with that at all. I want women, doctors, local and political leaders leading the democracy ... to put the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves."" On ""The View,"" Fetterman said that ""as a local political official"" himself, it's not his decision to make. ""I've always believed that the choice is always between a woman and their doctor,"" he said. ""I've always believed in Roe v. Wade."" Another hot button issue during the debate was fracking. While Fetterman previously opposed it, he came out in support of it during his debate. He told co-host Alyssa Darah Griffin on Friday, ""Any of the issues I ever had with fracking is really around environmental regulations. Once those were passed and they were addressed, you know, I support fracking."" ""I'm absolutely supporting energy independence as well, too, and making sure we can never be held by a country like Russia, and making sure we produce as much American energy as possible,"" he continued. ""I fully support fracking."" Fetterman added that he thinks it's important ""to walk that line between ... making sure we produce as much energy from traditional sources here, but we also make the kind of investment to make sure we make the transition to more and more green energy."" On ""The View,"" Fetterman acknowledged that inflation is ""really critical"" to voters and ""a tax on working people,"" something he believes Oz couldn't relate to. ""To really fully understand how to fight inflation, you have to understand how it works and how it impacts working people, as well. And I just fundamentally believe Dr. Oz doesn't really understand that,"" Fetterman said, adding that it's ""critical that we step up and fight against"" corporate greed and price gouging. ""Inflation, as we know, hurts working families all across Pennsylvania. And I think that leads to, you know, record profits for corporations,"" he continued. ""It is more critical we stand with American workers and making sure that we manufacture more and more things here, both in Pennsylvania and in America. Closing out his interview on the daytime talk show, Fetterman shared his message with Pennsylvania voters, calling out his opponent for ""using Pennsylvania"" in the process. ""I believe that I'm running to serve Pennsylvania because I've made that long career serving Pennsylvania, and I believe Dr. Oz is essentially using Pennsylvania,"" he said. ""[Oz] is attempting to buy the seat here, and he is gonna be spending over $20 million of his own money."" ""I really want to fight for every person in Pennsylvania that ever got knocked down, that had to get back up,"" Fetterman continued. ""I fundamentally believe that I'm always gonna keep getting better and better, and Dr. Oz is gonna remain to be the kind of fraud in the kind of career, lying and kind of selling these kinds of magic pills, and enriching himself.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,1
2022-11-04,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/women-turn-home-abortions-unregulated-pill-sites-expand/story?id=92599420,"Women turn to at-home abortions, as unregulated pill sites expand operations","Jane was living in rural New Mexico when she discovered she was pregnant. She never wanted to have children or carry a pregnancy and knew immediately she wanted an abortion. But while abortion remains legal in the state, she says she also didn't want to take her chances with long waitlists at a clinic or a sudden change in the law that would put her in limbo. She had volunteered at an abortion hotline years ago and knew that even before the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, waiting periods and mandated ultrasounds can cost extra time and money. So, instead she turned to her closet, where she kept a package of abortion pills purchased online for $150 after an earlier pregnancy scare. Rather than a doctor, she relied on the counsel of a few close friends and called the M+A Hotline, an anonymous help line that counsels women experiencing miscarriages and abortions. ""I was not in a place where I could call a bunch of (clinics), and get 'no's,'"" said Jane, who agreed to tell her story on condition that ABC not use her real name -- or identify the online pharmacy she used -- because of privacy concerns and fear of criminal prosecution. ""I wanted certainty,"" she added. ""And I didn't want to be pregnant."" Less than five months after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the impact on women across the country has become almost impossible to measure. Abortion access has become considerably more restricted on paper – at least 14 states have ceased nearly all legal abortion services, including prescriptions for medication abortions. Data released this week estimated there were 10,670 fewer legal abortions since the Supreme Court decision. But advocates say those numbers aren't telling the whole story. They estimate that demand for abortion pills has exploded, even in states where abortion remains accessible because of the legal uncertainty. Stepping in to fill that demand are online pill brokers that are buying generic versions of the drugs in bulk from pharmacies in India, Russia and Vietnam. The drugs are then shipped illegally to U.S. consumers at a significant markup -- as much as 10 times the original cost or higher -- but still a fraction of the $400 to $500 price tag charged by many abortion clinics, advocates say. The result in many cases is that online abortion medication is emerging as a cheaper, easier option, if also unregulated in many cases. ""We have known for a long time -- even when people have access to clinics -- that some people may prefer other routes of access because of privacy, convenience or cost reasons,"" said Elisa Wells, founder of the online abortion site Plan C, which helps people find services that will deliver abortion medication. While a precise accounting of self-managed abortions is nearly impossible, there's no doubt it's growing dramatically, she said. ""There's a big market for these pills,"" Wells said. Mifepristone, also sold under the brand name Mifeprex, has been available in the U.S. for 22 years. It works by blocking the hormone progesterone needed to continue a pregnancy. It is typically prescribed with a second drug, misoprostol, which causes cramping and bleeding to empty the uterus. Under rules by the Food and Drug Administration, only certified providers can prescribe mifepristone to someone less than 10 weeks pregnant. The person must be screened for potential health complications like bleeding disorders. They also would would want to rule out an ectopic pregnancy, which requires immediate life-saving treatment. While state rules can be stricter, or might ban the drug outright, the FDA says mifepristone is safe enough to be offered via telehealth and mailed to a person's house without seeing a doctor in person -- so long as it comes from one of two government-inspected manufacturers -- Danco Laboratories and GenBioPro. ""You should not buy Mifeprex or its approved generic over the Internet because you will bypass important safeguards designed to protect your health,"" the FDA warns online. Still, as Americans in recent decades have crossed the U.S.-Canadian border for cheaper insulin or flown to India for more affordable medical procedures, many women post-Roe appear to be bypassing these warnings and state laws to get the abortion pill delivered to their doorstep. One site, Medside24, said it's based in Kazakhstan and ships medication into the U.S. from overseas. The company said it began operations three years ago as an anonymous ""no questions asked"" way for people to access the drug. In answers to questions emailed by ABC, the company said its suppliers can change based on availability but generally come from Vietnam, Thailand, China and Russia. It said it takes about a 30% profit margin -- down this year from 50% as manufacturers raise their prices to supply the drug. Medside24 said its abortion medication is ""genuine because we use them in our family planning clinics in Kazakhstan"" and have never had a problem. When asked about the FDA's warning not to use unregulated medications procured from overseas, the company said it's not surprising a U.S. regulatory agency would discourage use of any product it can't control. ""If the kits are used according to instructions then it would be fine,"" the company wrote in a statement. A research paper published Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA found another online site Aid Access -- which offers women telehealth appointments and writes abortion prescriptions filled by a pharmacy in India and shipped to their home -- saw a spike in requests for pills from the U.S. following the Supreme Court decision. Requests increased the most in states with near-total bans, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Oklahoma. ""The evidence that we've seen shows us that when you ban or severely restrict abortion, you don't do anything to change the need for abortion. But what you seem to do is change how and where people access care,"" said Dr. Abigail Aiken, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the co-authors on the study, in an interview with FiveThirtyEight. Other online pharmacies appear to offer little or no medical evaluation, shipping the medication directly with few questions asked. That leaves many people getting abortions with medical concerns that they can't always take to their doctor due to fears of prosecution. April Lockley, the medical director of the M+A Hotline, which answers medical questions about miscarriages and abortions but does not provide access to abortion medication, said the line saw an uptick in calls after Texas passed its abortion ban and again after the Supreme Court decision last summer. She said the hotline is currently averaging about 25 to 50 contacts per day. It's not immediately clear whether the FDA has any of these online pharmacies on its radar, or if the agency has the bandwidth or appetite to go after them. While the agency has written stern warning letters to Aid Access, no other enforcement actions have been made public. Online medication abortion is an option that Texas resident Jessica Garza wished was on her radar last year when she found out she was six-weeks pregnant. Garza said she was struggling with severe depression following the traumatic birth of her daughter six months prior. A stay-at-home mom, she arranged to travel to Louisiana, which at the time allowed surgical abortions. At the clinic, Garza faced a lengthy wait list and state-mandated restrictions that meant she had to make the trip multiple times. She was 15 weeks along before she could get the abortion – a wait she described as agonizing and traumatic. ""I believe if I was forced to carry that pregnancy to term – I don't think I would have survived it. I was in such a bad place,"" said Garza. For Jane, she said she has no regrets working outside the system. ""As much as I worried about what I Googled and who I texted – going to a clinic physically in some ways felt more visible and legally risky,"" she said. With clinics, she said, ""you've got to cross borders and you've got to cross picket lines. No thank you.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,9
2022-11-03,https://abcnews.go.com/US/brittney-griner-meets-us-officials-russia-white-house/story?id=92616275,Brittney Griner meets with US officials in Russia as White House works to secure her release,"WNBA star Brittney Griner, who is facing nine years in a Russian prison, met with U.S. Embassy officials in Russia on Thursday, according to State Department spokesman Ned Price. ""They saw firsthand her tenacity and perseverance despite her present circumstances. We continue to press for the immediate release of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan and fair treatment for every detained American,"" Price said in a tweet announcing the visit. Thursday's visit marks the first time U.S. officials have been able to gain direct Griner since early August. Most recently, they were able to speak with her over the phone on her birthday on Oct. 18. Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained on Feb. 17 at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returned to Russia to play during the WNBA's offseason after she was accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that the Biden administration was told that Griner is ""doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances."" Jean-Pierre said that securing the freedom of Griner and Whelan, a U.S. citizen and former Marine who has been detained in Russia since 2019, continues to be a ""top priority"" for the White House. ""As we have said before, the U.S. government made a significant offer to the Russians to resolve the current unacceptable and wrongful, wrongful detentions of American citizens Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""I can also tell you that in the subsequent weeks, despite a lack of good faith negotiation by the Russians, the U.S. government has continued to follow up on that offer and propose alternative potential ways forward with Russians through all available channels."" Price previously expressed concern about the irregular access to Americans detained in Russia. ""We continue to impart on the Russian government the necessity of consistency and regular consular access to Brittney Griner but also to all of those Americans who are detained in Russia,"" Price said last month. Griner's meeting with U.S. officials comes after a Russian court denied Griner's appeal in a hearing on Oct. 25. Griner appeared virtually at her appeal hearing and urged the court to reassess her sentence, saying that people found guilty of lesser crimes were given shorter sentences. ""I beg that the court takes in all of the stakes that was overlooked in the first court and reassess my sentence here,"" Griner said, apologizing for her ""mistake"" and saying that it has been ""traumatic"" to be away from her family. Prior to the denial of her appeal, Griner's attorney, Alexandr Boikov, told ABC News, ""Her being afraid of not being released is mostly connected to the negotiations, which we are not aware of at all."" Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, told ""The View"" in an interview that aired on Tuesday the denial of the WNBA star's appeal was ""just disheartening"" and left her in ""complete disbelief."" ""I understand being in the field of law that every state, every country has their own rules, but this is just absurd,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""The crime and the punishment is disproportionate at its finest. ... There are people convicted of murder in Russia who [have] a sentence way less than B.G., and it just makes absolutely no sense to me."" Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges in July, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage mistakenly and that she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,"" meaning the U.S. will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department has said. Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained, and some officials have expressed concern that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing war.

2022-11-03,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/midterms-outcome-shape-us-foreign-policy/story?id=92146530,How the midterms outcome might shape US foreign policy,"While domestic issues such as inflation, crime, and abortion access have dominated the run-up to the midterm elections, how Americans cast their ballots may also have consequences for a host of pressing international concerns, including Vladimir Putin's ruthless campaign in Ukraine and Iran's rapidly accelerating nuclear program. ABC News spoke to foreign policy and national security experts and former officials about how the outcome of the midterms vote might drive the country's foreign policy for the next two years. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the leading candidate for House speaker if Republicans take control of the chamber, warned last month that his party wouldn't ""write a blank check"" to Ukraine, suggesting a Republican red wave might mean rolling back support for Kyiv's efforts to fend off Russia's invasion. Scott Anderson, a former U.S. diplomat and a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, says opposition to major aid packages for Ukraine could build in a Republican-run House -- but it's unlikely to happen overnight. ""I suspect it is going to be a slow, gradual shift over the course of the next Congress. Generally, support for Ukraine seems pretty popular right now,"" he said. ""I don't think Republicans are going to want to run headlong against that."" But Anderson says McCarthy's comments likely resonate with at least some Republicans who have remained mostly quiet through the Ukraine crisis so far -- a group closely aligned with former President Donald Trump. ""It's the contingent that was most vocally opposed to Ukraine in the first impeachment, that was more skeptical of Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- who is now broadly seen as a pretty heroic figure -- and more friendly to Vladimir Putin, who is coming out of this not just looking like a villain, but looking like an incompetent villain,"" he said. ""So, it's been very embarrassing for them to talk about, but those underlying views haven't really changed."" Those lawmakers could soon become louder, according to Anderson. ""Because it's a wing tied to Donald Trump and his political support base, it's tied to a lot of people who right now are some of the biggest funders and most active organizers in the Republican Party. So, they have a kind of outsize influence, because they're the ones who can help House races and members of Congress fight in competitive elections,"" he stated. Recently, Democratic politicians have also cast doubt on whether their party will remain united behind the Biden administration's approach to Ukraine. In late October, a letter signed by 30 House progressives was released calling for the White House to link aid to Kyiv with movement towards a negotiated end to the conflict, but withdrew it after they faced significant blowback. Anderson says the letter was poorly timed, but illustrative of a faction that could ultimately break with President Joe Biden even if Democrats hold onto the House. ""They frame themselves more as noninterventionist -- folks who are worried about promoting conflict or exercising too much malign influence overseas,"" he said, adding that if the tides change in Ukraine during the months to come, those lawmakers may feel embolden and more aggressively advocate for a different approach. Both Anderson and Anthony Cordesman, the Emeritus Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former national security assistant to GOP Sen. John McCain, argue that economic woes could eventually challenge support for Ukraine across the political spectrum. ""When you really look at the money going abroad, it so far is still pretty limited compared to what we were spending on Afghanistan,"" Cordesman said. ""But if there is a steady increase in inflation and economic problems, there may be pressure for civil spending at the expense of defense spending."" Cordesman thinks the economy would have to suffer a few more blows to get to that point, but it ""doesn't mean that there won't be a lot of noise"" about money flowing abroad coming from Capitol Hill when the new Congress is sworn in in January. A Republican-dominated Congress could push the Biden administration to pay more attention to another thorn in its side: Iran. Originally, the president's approach to curbing Iran's nuclear program was dominated by its efforts to coax it back into the Obama-era pact that Trump exited in 2018. After months of sputtering negotiations, that aim has been all but abandoned -- but the White House has not officially declared that the talks are dead. ""The Biden administration has signaled that the nuclear deal is not its priority, but there is a significant disconnect between its actions and its words on the Iran threat,"" said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who argues there is a persisting perception that the U.S. remains eager to resurrect the agreement in exchange for rolling back other penalties against Tehran. ""If there is a change in control of Congress, because of how partisan unfortunately a lot of Iran policy has become, there would be more pressure--given that the current administration and many Democrats in general campaigned on resurrecting a deal and engaging with Iran,"" he said. ""There certainly will be desire for more scrutiny and oversight."" Regardless of which party is in the driver's seat, Taleblu says the next Congress' first order of business should be demanding a clear strategy from the White House on combatting the blooming partnership between Iran and Russia. ""There is a lot to unpack there, and in order to move forward on policy, Congress needs answers first,"" Taleblu said. After OPEC+ announced last month it would cut oil production, potentially hurting Democrats' chances at the ballot box, members of the party started calling for its de facto leader -- Saudi Arabia -- to be punished, calling for a block on arm sales to Riyadh or for the U.S. to pull troops from the country. President Biden has promised ""consequences"" for the kingdom but slow-walked any action, while administration officials have stressed the U.S has a range of interests in Saudi Arabia extending beyond energy needs. Anderson says no matter the outcome of the elections, any sharp retaliation is unlikely. ""Even if you see Democrats being more vocal and threatening sanctions for Saudi Arabia, they aren't going to disagree with the Biden administration. They're just playing bad cop to the Biden administration's good cop, and trying to encourage Saudi Arabia to take a little bit of a different tack,"" he said. But Taleblu predicts that if Democrats have enough momentum and the votes to follow through on their proposals next year, the measures could prove detrimental when it comes to stamping out mutual threats in the Middle East. ""Ally maintenance is sometimes harder than adversary maintenance, especially when it intersects with partisan politics,"" he said. ""If the relationship with Saudi Arabia and other states in the Persian Gulf are further politicized and the dividends of the existing national security relationships are not appreciated, Washington could be shooting itself in the foot."" Cordesman argues that regardless of how the midterms play out, how bitter things get with Saudi Arabia depends on whether winter brings surging energy costs. ""The more prices rise, the more people may find themselves feeling that more pressure should be put on Saudi Arabia other Gulf exporters to go back to the higher levels of export,"" he said.",0.0,0.0,0.0,7
2022-11-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/american-elections-resilient-vulnerable/story?id=89859386,Why American elections are resilient but still vulnerable,"This story is part of the ABC News series ""Democracy in Peril,"" which examines the inflection point the country faces after the Jan. 6 attacks and ahead of the 2022 election. America's elections system, though battle-tested and proven over decades, is facing a political environment in which public distrust has quickly eroded voters' confidence and threats to elections officials have raised new concerns. Voter confidence has wavered significantly following the 2020 election after former President Donald Trump denied Joe Biden's victory and promptly instructed his allies and supporters to demand the election results be overturned, leading to the violent events of Jan. 6. That, despite an election that experts called the most secure in the nation's history. Election skepticism stretches back years -- and, experts and polls say, is getting worse -- fueled in part by Trump's attacks on early and mail voting and before that, in 2016, doubt began to grow with reports of foreign interference. The reality, though, is that federal elections in America are hard to manipulate, nonpartisan experts told ABC News. Increased federal funding to support election staff and technological upgrades, expanded verified paper ballots and post-election audits, they say, along with electing public servants who fundamentally believe in the elections process, have produced federal elections that are mostly resilient. Experts from the Brennan Center, the States United Democracy Center and other groups who spoke with ABC News said elections succeed because of how diffuse they are -- any disruption would likely occur at the local level but not affect counting on a state or national scale. While fraud at any level is extremely rare, they say, there are more opportunities for interference at the local level because of thousands of different elections systems. These experts also said the election system's overall function and integrity falls squarely on the shoulders of one group -- elections officials -- from secretaries of state to election night volunteers -- who despite an unprecedented number of recent threats have mostly risen to the occasion to ensure accuracy and fairness throughout the process. Senior FBI officials told ABC News their election security task force has received more than 1,000 tips about threats to election workers since June 2021. Those threats were overwhelmingly through email, along with some others by phone and social media. Fifty-eight percent of the threats involved disputed election results, with roughly 11% of those more than 1,000 tips warranted further federal investigation. ""I'm not concerned about this upcoming election, because we have been relying on these public servants who really are willing to put partisanship aside, do the right thing to make sure our elections are reliable,"" said Gowri Ramachandran, senior counsel in the Brennan Center for Justice Elections & Government Program. ""But I would also say in the longer term, you know, we can't take those people for granted and we shouldn't take them for granted."" Elections in the United States, even on the national scale during presidential contests, are run largely at the county level. In some states, it's even more local, down to a municipality or township. Those on the front lines of elections are some of the biggest players: state and local governments, election officials, federal partners, and vendors. The top election official is usually the secretary of state, board, commission, elected or appointed individual, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Then, various levels of county officials, clerks or election boards who are tasked with designating polling locations and overseeing the volunteers who direct voters at the ballot box, run tabulation machines and observe lines, among other responsibilities, said Joanna Lydgate, the co-founder and CEO of the States United Democracy Center. ""The fact that election administration is so decentralized in the United States, it is an asset when it comes to election security, because it means that if there is some kind of disruption, often the impact of that is limited to just that local jurisdiction,"" Ramachandran said. ""It really severely limits the impact of any mistakes or interference that does happen."" But because American elections vary by jurisdiction, their safety and security also depend on the locality. Elections officials are typically trained through rigorous certification programs specifically tailored to their duties. In a state like Georgia, election superintendents provide training to all poll officers and poll workers regarding the use of voting equipment, voting procedures, all aspects of state and federal law applicable to conducting elections, and the poll officers' or poll workers' duties in connection to each election. Tina Taylor, who worked elections in Charleston County, South Carolina, in 2016 and 2020, said it was during her training that she really got a sense of how secure the voting process was in her county, given the number of different people and steps involved. ""How the voting machines are set up, there's no way that someone can cheat. I mean, we have so many checks and balances … you have to go through so much just to vote,"" she said. ""Everything is locked. Everything is calibrated, everything is numbered. Everything is initialed two to three times, witnessed by two or three people at the same time … I was just like, 'Well, I really don't know how someone could cheat.'"" Taylor's trust in the election process echoes what election security experts have long stated: disrupting federal elections in a significant way would be extremely difficult, if not nearly impossible. While mail ballots are more susceptible to fraud than in-person voting, it is still more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to commit mail voting fraud, according to one Brennan Center report. ""Elections are run by states, but one thing that's consistent across the country is that state and local election officials have strict procedures in place to protect your ballot. These measures make sure that every vote is cast by a registered voter, and then counted and certified. Your vote is secure, no matter how you choose to cast your ballot -- whether you use a drop box, put your ballot in the mail, vote early, or vote in person on Election Day. We have a long history in this country of safe and secure elections. This year is no different,"" said Lydgate. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, dozens of state and local officials across the country told ABC News that preparations for the election are being hampered ongoing threats against election workers, but federal and state laws may provide protection. The nation's top intelligence and law enforcement agencies -- from the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security -- Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, U.S. Election Assistance Commission -- have confirmed the security of the 2020 election, saying there were no significant instances of voter fraud. The courts have also struck down cases alleging wide-scale voter fraud through legal challenges, Trump and his allies ""have failed to discount a significant number of votes, block the certification of results, or overturn the results of any race,"" according to a Brennan Center report. ""To date, [DOJ investigators] have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,"" said Trump Attorney General William Barr in December 2020. One of the primary resiliency measures employed in 2020, Ramachandran said, is that many election jurisdictions made significant progress on using voting systems that have verifiable paper records, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. Widespread mail-in voting added to that paper trail during the coronavirus pandemic, along with printouts of the voter's choices at in-person polling locations. ""The good news is that a lot of those are still in place, in terms of people's confidence in the upcoming midterms,"" said Ramachandran. There's also a promising trend of information sharing between The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (created in 2018) and state and local election officials, she said, with the federal government providing warnings and alerts to local officials, along with increased security at physical voting locations. Post-election tabulation audits, or checks on the equipment and procedures used to count votes during an election, are another foolproof way to ensure the safety of elections. This is already required in most states, including many battleground ones like Pennsylvania and Nevada -- states that have also been subject to intense voter fraud speculation from certain groups. Joanna Lydgate of the States United Democracy Center said that as she travels the county and talks with election officials, she's also encountered an ""incredible resilience and a commitment"" to the work, which is a promising trend ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. ""It's a very difficult environment right now in which to be doing these jobs. That said, I think that there is so much. There is so much resilience, and, you know, we saw in 2020 How good pro-democracy election officials from both sides of the aisle stood up and did their jobs under the most challenging circumstances,"" said Lydgate. ""You trust nurses and doctors with your health, you trust teachers, with your children's education, you trust a car mechanic with your vehicle. Election officials are professionals in the same way. They're trained to run our elections and we've trusted them to do that for decades."" Because elections are run at the local level, the process can also easily become subject to interference due to the vast number of opportunities for meddling among the thousands of different elections systems. Interference could occur through foreign adversaries, harassment and intimidation of election workers or even voter suppression measures, Ramachandran said, but because each election is conducted locally, those vulnerabilities would not affect voting on a nationwide or even statewide scale. ""Having so many different entities involved in elections … provides checks and balances, but it also provides more opportunities for interference,"" said Ramachandran. Taylor has been a poll worker at the same precinct in Charleston, South Carolina for six years. The 2016 cycle went off without a hitch, she said, with no recollection of fear and threats. During Election Day in 2020, she remembers a few Trump-aligned people who were not registered to vote at the location that showed up with aims to harass voters and poll workers. ""We had a couple of Trump supporters that came in. One in particular really took like, a couple of hours to get off the premises,"" Taylor said. ""She was trying to convince us that we were seeing things the wrong way … it was mostly mixed with QAnon and MAGA."" Taylor is not planning on returning as a poll worker at a time when South Carolina is seeing a mass exodus of election employees -- 22 South Carolina election directors across 19 counties who have left office since the 2020 general election. Two others have announced plans to leave at the end of the year, according to a new report by The State newspaper. And that's not unique to South Carolina. Another Brennan Center survey of nearly 600 local officials across the country found that one in five reported they were unlikely to continue serving through the 2024 presidential election. The problem is evident in places like rural Gillespie County, Texas, where all the elections officials abruptly left their posts just ahead of the midterm elections, or as large as in Georgia's largest county, Fulton County, detailed by former election worker Wandrea ArShaye ""Shaye"" Moss, who testified during a June 21 Jan. 6 committee hearing about her experience with harassment following false claims made by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Senior FBI agents told ABC News that foreign governments, especially Russia, continue to try to take full advantage of lies and misinformation suggesting mistrust in election results. Russia -- now embedded in the U.S. social media ecosystem and elsewhere digitally -- is using technology to covertly push and amplify false narratives about the election, they said. While Russian counterintelligence operatives used to create false narrative content themselves -- they can now rely on lies about the election being told by Americans and U.S. organizations, the senior FBI officials told ABC News. The officials also said that China is beginning to use some Russian tactics aimed at undermining confidence in U.S. elections and in some cases is targeting state and local officials. --ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas contributed to this report.",0.0,0.0,0.0,9
2022-11-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-acting-worried-sounding-midterms-note/story?id=92396229,Democrats acting more worried than they're sounding about midterms: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein You can measure Democrats' confidence in their own midterm prospects by Twitter jubilation over polls that show tied Senate races, excitement over scattered early voting numbers or hype around late-breaking storylines that could impact a small handful of Senate races. Or you can look at where they're spending and what they're doing in the final stretch of voting -- and, in some cases, even what they're saying about how things look. Sandwiched between stops in Florida on Tuesday and weekend campaigning in Pennsylvania, President Joe Biden is campaigning in New Mexico and San Diego this week, where he hopes to help a gubernatorial candidate and a House incumbent in jurisdictions he carried by double digits two years ago. Biden will spend election eve in deep-blue Maryland, where he can celebrate a Democratic rising star in a race for governor, but where he is unlikely to move any congressional needles. Vice President Kamala Harris is also boosting a likely gubernatorial winner Wednesday in Massachusetts before heading to New York City on Thursday to help save another blue-state governor who is suddenly endangered. Former President Barack Obama is hitting a range of battlegrounds with specific hopes of juicing turnout among Black and Latino voters. Meanwhile, former President Bill Clinton has popped up down the stretch primarily in his adopted home state of New York, for his former White House aide, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney -- the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- and with more travel planned upstate on Wednesday. Biden has adjusted his messaging a touch in the last few days. He said after voting over the weekend that the election should rightfully be a choice and ""not a referendum."" That's a common refrain for the party in power -- but also one that points to the messaging difficulties in running on accomplishments that voters aren't necessarily feeling. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, recovers from a brutal attack by a hammer-wielding individual, some Republicans have made light of the incident. ""Nancy Pelosi, well, she's got protection when she's in D.C. -- apparently her house doesn't have a lot of protection,"" Kari Lake said at an event in North Scottsdale on Monday night. ""There's no room for violence anywhere, but we're going to send [Nancy Pelosi] back to be with him in California,"" Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin told a crowd last week while campaigning for Virginia congressional candidate Yesli Vega. Donald Trump Jr. retweeted a picture Sunday of a hammer and underwear with the message, ""Got my Paul Pelosi Halloween costume ready."" The insensitive remarks about the attack are in addition to false conspiracy theories floated by conservative figures including former president Donald Trump, who claimed on a conservative radio show Tuesday that Pelosi's attacker didn't break into the home. Law enforcement officials have denounced these claims. Both Democrats and Republicans have been on the receiving end of political threats and violence, but it's impossible to ignore the escalation of the rhetoric from the right that has fueled threats and attacks by extremists. Speaker Pelosi issued a statement Monday that her husband is ""making steady progress on what will be a long recovery process."" Paul Pelosi's accused attacker, David DePape, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to state charges stemming from the incident. He was expected to be arraigned Wednesday on federal charges he's facing. Many Republicans have condemned the attack of Paul Pelosi. In an interview with ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said, ""We do have to lower the temperature, and words have meaning. Words sometimes mean someone might come after you and take action."" The TIP with Alisa Wiersema The number of independent candidates threatening the possibility of upending statewide races fell slightly on Tuesday, as libertarian Marc Victor announced he is dropping out of Arizona's Senate race. As he ended his candidacy, Victor gave his endorsement to Republican Blake Masters, who is facing off with incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. Victor told ABC News' Libby Cathey in a written statement that Masters approached him and agreed to a public conversation, which ultimately pushed Victor to end his candidacy and give him support. ""I publicly offered to meet with either Mark Kelly or Blake Masters to have an unscripted discussion about why it was in the interests of freedom, peace and civility for me to step down and endorse either of them,"" Victor said. ""Blake Masters availed himself of that opportunity yesterday, and we had a public conversation where I asked him whatever I wanted. I was impressed with Blake Masters and his commitment to being a Live and Let Live senator from Arizona."" Despite dropping out of the race a week out from Election Day, Victor's name will still appear on the ballot in Arizona, and he has already had ballots cast in his favor. According to a spokesperson with Arizona's secretary of state's office, any votes cast for him will not be tabulated. Third-party candidates in Oregon and Utah could still impact their respective races. In Oregon, Democrats are at risk of losing supporters to independent gubernatorial candidate Betsy Johnson, a former state legislator who served for nearly two decades as a Democrat and is attracting support by presenting herself as a median between her opponents. In Utah, incumbent Sen. Mike Lee is in a tough contest against independent Evan McMullin, who is getting a boost from Democrats who chose not to advance a candidate from their own party.

""The divisiveness that now grips this country is something that our adversaries, our adverse nation-states seek to exploit,"" Mayorkas told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas. ""And they do that on online platforms."" The three main adversaries, he said, are Russia, China and Iran, which purposely attempt to sow discord ""in the American public."" The secretary was asked whether or not former President Donald Trump makes his job harder because people believe his falsehoods about the 2020 election. The secretary, while not directly addressing Trump by name, said the words of leaders ""matter"" and that the misinformation leaders perpetuate makes their job harder. He was also asked if DHS has a responsibility to neutralize claims of election fraud. ""It is the responsibility of government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, the responsibility of government. It is a responsibility of leaders. It is the responsibility of people in positions of trust to communicate accurate information to the American public and disabuse them of falsehoods,"" he said. Mayorkas, when asked, said he has not communicated with the former president about taking the temperature of the rhetoric down. Last week, the department warned in a bulletin obtained by ABC News that violent extremists could pose a ""heightened threat"" to the midterm elections, which are on Tuesday. ""The integrity of an individual's right to vote and to be able to vote with a complete feeling of safety and security is absolutely vital. That is the foundation of our democracy,"" Mayorkas said. ""Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in this country. That does not mean that one gets to scream fire in a movie theater or incite people to violent acts."" Mayorkas, who oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is primarily in charge of securing the nation's cyber infrastructure during the midterms and beyond, said they are doing everything they can do to protect the vote, including by combatting misinformation, and that the election infrastructure is ""safe and secure."" ""I think what's important is that we will do everything that we can to protect the American public, to protect the integrity of the vote,"" he said, adding that there is no credible direct threat to the election. ""It is our responsibility as a country to make sure that the American public understands what is true and what is not, in the sense that we have to build digital literacy. We have to make sure that an individual who reads things online or otherwise learns to assess the credibility of the source and make decisions for themselves as to fact or fiction,"" he said. Mayorkas also said there are a ""number of forces that are fueling violent extremism, ideologies of hate, false narratives, anti-government sentiment, personal grievances."" The attack against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, is just one example of the moment the country is in, he said. On Friday, a suspect assaulted Paul Pelosi with a hammer after breaking into the couple's San Francisco home in what the district attorney called ""politically motivated violence."" The suspect is facing a slew of state and federal charges. Since Mayorkas took the job in 2021, he has been sounding the alarm on domestic violent extremism in the United States. On Tuesday, he called what happened on Jan. 6 a wake-up call, along with the assault at the Pelosi home. ""Let's think about that assault and the fact that there is not unanimity of condemnation and abhorrence in this country over that brutal act,"" the secretary said. ""It should be another wake-up call with respect to the moment that we're in.""",1.739575907265573,2.1267285777945113,-0.3871526705289383,9
2022-11-02,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-announce-13-billion-assistance-cut-energy-costs/story?id=92526007,Harris to announce over $13 billion in assistance to help cut energy costs this winter,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday will announce new steps the Biden administration is taking to help lower energy costs for Americans this winter. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is providing $4.5 billion in assistance to help cut heating costs for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), according to the White House. ""In addition to covering home heating costs this winter and unpaid utility bills, the program will help families make cost-effective home energy repairs to lower their heating and cooling bills,"" the White House said in a statement. Over the last year, LIHEAP has helped 5.3 million households across the United States with heating, cooling and weatherization, according to the White House. The U.S. Department of Energy will also allocate $9 billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to support up to 1.6 million households nationwide in upgrading their homes to decrease energy bills. This will be separated into two rebate programs: one for whole home energy efficiency retrofits and another for highly efficient and electric home appliances, according to the White House. ""In addition to lowering costs, energy-efficient and electric building and appliance upgrades can reduce indoor and local outdoor air pollution, improving health in our communities,"" the White House said. ""In addition, they will cut millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year to help tackle climate change."" Harris will discuss the initiatives while visiting a union hall and training facility in Boston on Wednesday, according to the White House. Nearly half of U.S. households rely on natural gas for heating and their bills could jump 28% this winter, compared with last winter, while bills for heating oil are projected to be 27% higher and electricity 10% higher, according to a recent analysis from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, an independent agency within the U.S. Department of Energy. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents the state directors of LIHEAP, said in a recent report that energy costs are expected to be the highest this winter in more than a decade. This comes amid soaring inflation rates, with U.S. consumer prices increasing to a 40-year high 6.6% in September. There are a number of contributing factors, including a rebound in global energy consumption from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has triggered price spikes, and Russia's war in Ukraine further increasing prices and reducing supplies.",3.1624573450910396,3.013780357497275,0.14867698759376458,6
2022-11-01,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-citizen-imprisoned-saudi-arabia-tweets/story?id=92478196,US citizen imprisoned in Saudi Arabia over tweets,"U.S. citizen and Florida resident Saad Ibrahim Almadi was arrested for a series of tweets he published that were critical of Saudi Arabia while visiting family in the Kingdom last November. His son, Ibrahim Almadi, spoke with ABC News' Linsey Davis Monday about his fight for his father's release and what he knows about the case. Almadi said his father has been tortured and sentenced to 16 years in prison, and that the U.S. is not doing enough to help his father. The U.S. State Department said in a statement to ABC News, ""we've consistently and intensively raised our concerns regarding his case at senior levels of the Saudi government several times in both Washington and Riyadh and will continue to do so. The Saudi government understands the priority we attach to resolving this matter."" PRIME: Thank you so much for joining us. Talk to me about that day that you last saw your dad. How did you hear about what happened? ALMADI: Last time I saw my dad, I thought everything was okay. I didn't know about his situation until December 20. That's when I reached out to the State Department and our embassy in Riyadh. PRIME: And what did you hear? ALMADI: They told me, ""we'll try to locate your father. We have no idea where he is right now."" PRIME: And did you ever learn then about some charges? How did that information come to you? ALMADI: Nothing until March 29th, when they saw my father at Al-Ha'ir prison. It's a political prison where they throw all the Saudis there for practicing freedom of speech, which they don't have in their constitution there but as American citizens, we have it here. PRIME: And so what are they accusing him of? ALMADI: Terrorism, trying to destabilize the kingdom and they torture him until convicted himself that he made these tweets to do that. PRIME: And you say that he's been tortured. What evidence do you have of that? ALMADI: That's his own words, his own reply to the judge. The judge wanted to sentence him for 42 years. But after reading my father's reply to the way the investigation went, they discounted him to 16 years from 42. PRIME: You've not been able to talk to your father. ALMADI: Until now. And the Department of State has no news about my father since August 10th. PRIME: So you don't really know his status at all? Is there any way to get any kind of update or what is the United States— ? ALMADI: I mean, the White House needs to recognize my father. He's a senior American citizen. I don't want my father to die in prison like Dr. Abdullah Mohammed. PRIME: Of course, you're aware of the publicity and the push to get the United States to free Paul Wheelan and Brittney Griner from Russia. Do you feel that there are any similar efforts underway to get your dad out? ALMADI: That's that's what I'm that's what I'm hoping for, but nothing yet. PRIME: You've said that the State Department has mishandled your father's case. And I do want to give you a quote that they have told ABC, they say ""we've consistently and intensively raised our concerns regarding his case at senior levels of the Saudi government several times in both Washington and Riyadh and will continue to do so. The Saudi government understands the priority we attach to resolving this matter"" and that they have no further updates. How do you respond to that? ALMADI: I mean, if His Highness Crown Prince, is quite sensitive from Twitter, I suggest he buy the rest of the stake, he can shut down Twitter. He can't send a senior American citizen to prison for practicing his First Amendment. PRIME: And so what does the U.S. State Department tell you? Do you get any updates from them at all? ALMADI: Nothing. Last time I talked to them was two weeks ago, and that is nothing. PRIME: And what did they say? ALMADI: We're still working on it. We submitted a ticket to see your father, but the Saudis didn't respond to the ticket. PRIME: If you could talk to your dad, what would you say to him? ALMADI: I love you so much. I will do everything to bring you back home. PRIME: Is there anything else that you can do? Do you feel, are your hands tied because you're just waiting for the State Department to act? ALMADI: Absolutely. They need to act and they must act. My father is facing the most aggressive sentence for an American citizen overseas. The Saudi court under MBS they broke a new record. They need to act. PRIME: Did your dad express any concern when he was going over there to Saudi Arabia, that because he had been critical of the government that something might happen? ALMADI: That's a lovely question. My father had his American passport printed, a photo of it, in his bedroom. And he told me 'son, if I'm gone, immediately reach out to our embassy.' PRIME: And you did that? ALMADI: Absolutely. PRIME: And you feel that the response has not been adequate? ALMADI: Not yet. PRIME: Well, we thank you so much for sharing your story, your father's story with us, and hope that it will do some good for you.

2022-11-01,https://abcnews.go.com/US/suspect-paul-pelosi-attack-now-facing-federal-charges/story?id=92424128,"Suspect in Paul Pelosi attack wanted to break Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps, according to court documents","The suspect accused of attacking Paul Pelosi told authorities he wanted to break Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps to show members of Congress that there are ""consequences to actions,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court Monday. The new revelation came Monday as the Department of Justice filed federal charges of assault and attempted kidnapping against the man suspected of attacking Paul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, last week. David DePape, 42, is accused of attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer in the couple's San Francisco home just before 2:30 a.m. Friday, according to San Francisco police. The state later announced charges against DePape including attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, false imprisonment of an elder, and threats to a public official and their family. ""What is clear based on the evidence thus far is that this house and the speaker herself were specifically targets of the defendant,"" San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said during a press conference Monday. Jenkins will ask for DePape to be held without bail on Tuesday. He is expected to appear physically in court for his arraignment. Nancy Pelosi issued a new statement Monday night, giving an update on her husband's condition and saying, ""Since the horrific attack on Paul early Friday, we have been deluged with thousands of messages conveying concern, prayers and warm wishes. We are most grateful."" ""Thanks to the excellent trauma care medical team at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, Paul is making steady progress on what will be a long recovery process,"" she said. ""Our family thanks everyone for their kindness."" DePape was charged with one count of assault of an immediate family member of a United States official with the intent to retaliate against the official on account of the performance of official duties, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, according to a criminal complaint filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. He is also charged with one count of attempted kidnapping of a United States official on account of the performance of official duties, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Federal charges were always a possibility due to early evidence suggesting the suspect appeared to be motivated to allegedly break into the home, at least in part, to reach the speaker, sources told ABC News. The attack was intentional, San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said Friday, describing a chaotic scene at the home once police arrived. Paul Pelosi woke up to the suspect confronting him about the whereabouts of the House speaker, Jenkins said Monday during the press conference. Paul Pelosi, who had been sleeping, was wearing a loose-fitting pajama shirt and boxer shorts, and was forced to get out of bed, Jenkins said. At some point, Paul Pelosi attempted to access the home's elevator, which contains a phone, but the suspect blocked his access, she said. At some point, Paul Pelosi asked to go to the bathroom, where he was able to call 911, the district attorney said. The defendant realized Paul Pelosi had called 911 and took him downstairs near the front door, Jenkins said. Paul Pelosi and DePape each had one hand on a hammer when officers from the San Francisco Police Department arrived before DePape was allegedly able to wrestle the hammer away and begin ""violently"" attacking Paul Pelosi with it, Scott said. Officers then tackled DePape and disarmed him, Scott said. DePape allegedly later told officers ""that he was going to hold Nancy hostage and talk to her"" and that he wanted to use the House speaker to lure another unnamed individual, the affidavit states. The suspect also allegedly told investigators that he intended to break Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps if she didn't tell him the ""truth"" about ""lies told by the Democratic Party"" and said she would have to be wheeled into Congress, therefore showing other members of Congress that there are ""consequences to actions,"" according to the criminal complaint. Paul Pelosi was struck at least twice with the hammer, sources told ABC News. He underwent successful surgery on Friday to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands, the speaker's spokesperson, Drew Hammill, said in a statement. Although his injuries are significant, he is expected to make a full recovery, Hammill said. DePape allegedly shouted ""Where's Nancy?"" repeatedly after entering the home through a sliding glass door and moving about the house, law enforcement officers familiar with the investigation told ABC News. The speaker was in Washington, D.C., at the time, according to Capitol Police. The suspect was carrying a bag that contained duct tape and zip ties, two law enforcement officials briefed on the probe told ABC News on Sunday. DePape was hospitalized with injuries following the attack. While police are still investigating the motive, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank dedicated to researching extremism and disinformation, said DePape ""likely was motivated by a wide range of conspiratorial beliefs."" ""In the last two months, DePape has posted dozens of articles and videos to his blogs spreading conspiracies and hateful rhetoric related to COVID-19, women, Hillary Clinton, the Jewish community, federal law enforcement (e.g., FBI), government censorship, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the climate crisis, QAnon, the 2020 election, the transgender community, and 'grooming' in schools,"" the ISD said in a statement, though no posts were found specifically mentioning Nancy Pelosi. Among the number of social media posts being examined by investigators include some in which DePape allegedly espouses conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines, 2020 false election theories, frustration with the Jan. 6 congressional hearings and anger over the conviction of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd, law enforcement officials told ABC News. Chief Scott said the department is working with Capitol Police, and that the SFPD is providing security. ""We will do whatever is necessary ... but right now, we want to make sure that people are safe, that they feel safe."" The incident has ""shaken a lot of people, and we want to make sure we do what we can,"" he said. ""It's sad to see that we are once again at a point in history where people believe that it's OK to express their political sentiment through violence,"" the chief added. DePape is expected to be arraigned Tuesday. It is unclear whether he has retained an attorney.

2022-10-31,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ufo-report-week-incidents-unexplained/story?id=92303931,"Another UFO report expected this week, some incidents still unexplained","The enduring debate about whether UFOs are caused by extraterrestrial beings will once again be front and center this week as U.S. intelligence agencies will provide Congress with an updated report on UFO incidents over the past year. Meanwhile, it appears that other more recent incidents are being attributed to weather balloons, other airborne clutter, and foreign surveillance, according to a U.S. official. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines has until Monday to provide Congress with its first annual unclassified update on Unexplained Aerial Phenomena, the new term for UFOs, that includes all new UAP incidents over the past year and any previously unreported incidents. The report was required by the 2022 Defense Bill that mandated that the DNI provide an annual declassified update and a classified annex by Oct. 31 of every year through 2026. The update follows the DNI's first-ever report released in June 2022 that listed 144 UAP incidents, only one of which could be explained. At a congressional hearing earlier this year Pentagon officials said that the number of UAP incidents under investigation had risen to more than 400. While it is unclear how many new reports will be included in the upcoming update, a U.S. official told ABC News that the most recent UAP incidents can be explained as a mix of weather balloons, airborne clutter, and foreign surveillance. But the official stressed that other incidents still cannot be explained. The official added that it cannot be determined who is behind the foreign surveillance but the most likely candidates would be China and Russia since they have the most interest in monitoring the U.S. military. ""There is no single explanation that addresses the majority of UAP reports,"" Sue Gough, a Defense Department spokesperson, said in a statement. ""We are collecting as much data as we can, following the data where it leads, and will share our findings whenever possible. We will not rush to conclusions in our analysis"" ""In many cases, observed phenomena are classified as 'unidentified' simply because sensors were not able to collect enough information to make a positive attribution,"" said Gough. ""We are working to mitigate these shortfalls for the future and to ensure we have sufficient data for our analysis."" Analysis of more recent UAP incidents is helped by the amount of information and data available as compared to older incidents. The U.S. official told ABC News that two of the three videos declassified by the Pentagon in 2020 and recorded from the sensors aboard fighter aircraft now have plausible explanations. In the ""Go Fast"" video Navy pilots are heard exclaiming how fast an object is moving above the water. According to the U.S. official, the leading assessment from experts is that what the pilots saw on their video screens was actually an optical illusion of an object that was not moving very fast at all. The illusion was created by the angle and height at which the object was viewed by the sensors as it moved above the water. The ""gimbal"" video taken in 2015 by a jet fighter crew that shows an object rotating in the clouds. The official says it's now believed that the object's strange movements and observed spinning was caused by the sensor aboard the plane that captured that image. There is no assessment for what is being seen in the third video commonly referred to as the ""Flir"" video that was taken in 2004. The general public's appetite for UFOs is sure to continue, and just last week NASA announced the 16 people who would serve on a new panel tasked with studying UAPs. Their report, based on unclassified information, is slated to be released in mid-2023. ..",2.1355496935435085,2.5902005354927744,-0.45465084194926586,2

Nancy Pelosi said in a Dear Colleague letter to all House members Saturday that she and her family were left ""heartbroken"" and ""traumatized"" by the attack on her husband. ""We are grateful for the quick response of law enforcement and emergency services, and for the life-saving medical care he is receiving,"" the letter read. ""Please know that the outpouring of prayers and warm wishes from so many in the Congress is a comfort to our family and is helping Paul make progress with his recovery. His condition continues to improve."" The attack was intentional, and not random, according to San Francisco Police Chief William Scott. The suspect, 42-year-old David Depape, attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer when officers responded to a priority well-being check at 2:27 a.m. local time, San Francisco police said. Officers found both Paul Pelosi and Depape with one hand on a hammer when they responded to the home, according to Scott. When they commanded both men to drop the weapon, ""Mr. Depape took the hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently attacked him with the hammer,"" Scott told reporters during a press briefing Friday evening. Officers tackled the suspect and disarmed him, police said. ""This was not a random act. This was intentional. And it's wrong,"" Scott said. ""Our elected officials are here to do the business of their cities, their counties, their states and this nation. Their families don't sign up for this, to be harmed."" ""Everybody should be disgusted about what happened this morning,"" he added, getting emotional. Paul Pelosi, 82, was struck at least one time, though it's unclear how many, Scott said. He underwent ""successful"" surgery Friday to repair a skull fracture and ""serious injuries"" to his right arm and hands, and his doctors ""expect a full recovery,"" the speaker's spokesperson, Drew Hammill, said in a statement. Two sources familiar with the matter told ABC News his injuries are ""significant."" Depape allegedly entered the house through a sliding glass door, law enforcement sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. The suspect shouted ""Where's Nancy?"" before allegedly striking Paul Pelosi, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington, D.C., with her protective detail at the time, according to the Capitol Police. Police said it was Paul Pelosi who called 911, and that the dispatcher could listen in to what was going on during his interaction with the suspect. Scott credited the dispatcher with using her intuition to know something was wrong and ""read between the lines"" of what she was being told. She dispatched the call at a higher priority than a welfare check would normally get, he said. ""I think this was life-saving,"" Scott said. Depape, who was hospitalized with injuries, will be booked on charges including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and elderly abuse, police said. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said her office plans to bring forward ""multiple felony charges"" on Monday. His arraignment will likely be on Tuesday, she said. The motive is under investigation, Hammill said. Scott said they are not ready to publicly say what the motive was. But according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank dedicated to researching extremism and disinformation, Depape ""likely was motivated by a wide range of conspiratorial beliefs."" ""In the last two months, DePape has posted dozens of articles and videos to his blogs spreading conspiracies and hateful rhetoric related to COVID-19, women, Hillary Clinton, the Jewish community, federal law enforcement (e.g., FBI), government censorship, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the climate crisis, QAnon, the 2020 election, the transgender community, and 'grooming' in schools,"" the ISD said, though no posts were found specifically mentioning Nancy Pelosi. Authorities are examining a number of social media posts that appear to be associated with Depape which espouse conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines, 2020 false election theories, frustration with the Jan. 6 congressional hearings and anger over the conviction of Derek Chauvin for the killing of George Floyd, law enforcement officials told ABC News. The FBI is expected to seek search warrants for any phones, computers or other devices that might be associated with Depape, the officials said. FBI agents were also interviewing people who know Depape across the Bay area on Friday, according to federal law enforcement sources. President Joe Biden spoke with Nancy Pelosi Friday morning ""to express his support after this horrible attack,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. ""It's despicable,"" Biden said during a fundraiser in Philadelphia Friday evening. ""Enough is enough. Every person of good conscience needs to clearly and unambiguously stand up against the violence in our politics regardless of what your politics are."" Vice President Kamala Harris told ABC News' Allison Pecorin that she also spoke with the speaker this morning. She condemned what she called an ""act of extreme violence."" ""I think we're looking at it at a time in our country where there is so much discourse that is fueled by hate and division. And anyone who professes to be a leader I think has to really understand the meaning and the impact of their words,"" Harris said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement, ""What happened to Paul Pelosi was a dastardly act. I spoke with Speaker Pelosi earlier this morning and conveyed my deepest concern and heartfelt wishes to her husband and their family, and I wish him a speedy recovery."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted that he's ""horrified and disgusted"" by the attack, adding, ""Grateful to hear that Paul is on track to make a full recovery."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy reached out to Nancy Pelosi to ""check in on Paul and said he's praying for a full recovery,"" according to his spokesperson.

2022-10-27,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraine-war-expected-accelerate-clean-energy-transition-report/story?id=92201504,"Ukraine war expected to accelerate clean energy transition, new report finds","The war in Ukraine is reshaping the global energy landscape and is expected to speed up the transition away from fossil fuels as countries scramble for alternatives to Russian energy, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency. Russia has been one of the world's largest exporters of fossil fuels like oil and natural gas, but Russia has cut off supplies of natural gas to Europe since they invaded Ukraine and sanctions on Russian exports have threatened energy supplies and increased prices all over the world. The IEA report found that government's responses to this energy crisis like the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. as well as clean energy packages in the European Union, Japan and Korea will bring down global demand from fossil fuels and accelerate the deployment of less emitting forms of energy like wind and solar. China and India have also set new goals to roll out more renewable energy. ""The government responses around the world given to this energy crisis promise to be that we are seeing a turning point in the history of energy and this crisis, indeed, accelerates clean energy transitions,"" IEA Director Fatih Birol said at a press conference. The report found that these policies will contribute to a peak in fossil fuel demand for the first time since the industrial revolution, with demand for natural gas expected to peak this century and increasing use of electric vehicles contributing to a peak in demand for oil in the 2030s. ""In this scenario, coal use falls back within the next few years, natural gas demand reaches a plateau by the end of the decade, and rising sales of electric vehicles (EVs) mean that oil demand levels off in the mid-2030s before ebbing slightly to mid-century,"" the report said. ""This means that total demand for fossil fuels declines steadily from the mid-2020s to 2050 by an annual average roughly equivalent to the lifetime output of a large oil field."" United Nations climate reports have found that global greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels need to peak this century to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the target set by the Paris Agreement to prevent more dangerous impacts of climate change. The report expects that the short-term increases in demand for oil and coal burning to offset the lack of Russian gas are likely temporary and will be replaced by lower emissions sources of energy in the long-term. ""Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in the press release. ""Even with today's policy settings, the energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system.""",6.40895055165285,4.774256222345828,1.6346943293070222,6
2022-10-26,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-vows-breathing-room-families-midterms/story?id=92127477,Biden vows 'breathing room' for families going into midterms,"President Joe Biden, highlighting his administration's war on rising costs less than two weeks ahead of the midterm elections, announced new initiatives Wednesday he said will provide ""a little breathing room"" for American families. Speaking at the White House, Biden said the initiatives on what he called ""junk fees"" aim to ""lower the cost of everyday living for American families, to put more money in the pockets of middle-income and working- class Americans and to hold big corporations accountable."" ""These steps will immediately start saving Americans collectively billions of dollars in unfair fees,"" he said. The administration's actions to provide financial relief come amid steep inflation. Republicans have seized on high prices ahead of the midterms, arguing Democrats' policies are to blame for surging costs. Polling shows the GOP has an edge on the issue. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey found 36% of Americans trust Republicans to handle inflation while 21% trust Democrats. On the state of the economy overall, 36% of Americans trust Republicans to do a better job while 24% trust Democrats on the issue. Biden announced Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued guidance effectively banning two popular ""junk fee"" practices: surprise overdraft fees or depositor fees. Those actions will save consumers more than $1 billion per year, according to the White House. ""This is real money back in the pockets of American families,"" said Rohit Chopra, the director of the CFPB. ""It's good for them, and it's good for businesses that follow the law."" The CFPB will also develop guidance on other bank and credit card fees that currently cost consumers more than $24 billion per year, the White House said. Biden said his administration's looking to take action on other charges, including processing fees for concert tickets or resort fees. The Federal Trade Commission announced last week it would be launching a rule-making process to reduce such fee practices across the economy. Such fees, Biden said, ""hit marginalized Americans the hardest, especially low-income folks and people of color."" Biden, speaking just 13 days before Election Day, also took the opportunity to tout other moves his administration made to lower costs, including making hearing aids available over-the-counter and a program to lower Americans' monthly broadband bills. He again blamed high prices, particularly energy prices, on Russian President Vladimir Putin's ongoing war in Ukraine. Biden also repeated his call on gas companies to pass savings down to consumers, and predicted gas prices will continue to fall. ""I'm optimistic,"" Biden said. ""It's gonna take some time, and I appreciate the frustration and American people.""",2.8610392939272797,2.9479197577443244,-0.08688046381704462,8
2022-10-26,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-hones-crime-debate-messaging-overlaps-note/story?id=92072154,GOP homes in on crime as debate messaging overlaps: The Note,"The TAKE with Rick Klein The biggest debate of the election cycle was about the outsized personalities in Pennsylvania -- and it was Democrat John Fetterman who was the first to mention the medical condition that couldn't help but draw notice. ""Let's talk about the elephant in the room: I had a stroke. He's never going to let me forget that,"" Fetterman said at the top of the first and only Senate faceoff in Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night. But his GOP opponent, Mehmet Oz, wasn't there to remind voters of that or to highlight halting answers that went into immediate social-media circulation. Oz was on the attack on other fronts -- repeatedly calling Fetterman a ""radical,"" ""extreme"" and ""dishonest"" -- and leaning in on crime and the southern border, where so many other Republicans are eager to go. ""John Fetterman takes everything to an extreme,"" Oz said. ""We should be talking about crime and inflation."" He was, and they did -- just like the candidates for governor of New York, debating an hour earlier on the same night, two weeks before the election, were also doing. Republican Lee Zeldin said at his debate with Democratic incumbent Kathy Hochul that he was there to ""save our state"" -- hitting on a theme that's recurred throughout debate season this fall. The fallout of the Pennsylvania debate is impossible to handicap. Fetterman repeated a refrain about his campaign being about anyone who ""got knocked down that had to get back up again."" And while his doctor says he's ready to serve and his team has touted his resilience, his recovery could be an awkward journey for some voters. But if Oz wins -- and he's had polling momentum, with more resources heading his way -- it's likely to be more about the issues he's raising than the words his opponent is using. In that sense, a highly unusual race could wind up looking something close to normal. The RUNDOWN with Averi Harper House Progressives are retracting a letter that called for President Joe Biden to engage in talks with Russia regarding its invasion of Ukraine. The letter, signed by 30 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, stated that ""if there is a way to end the war while preserving a free and independent Ukraine, it is America's responsibility to pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine."" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, subsequently issued a statement on Tuesday withdrawing the letter that drew intense criticism from within her party. She claimed it was ""drafted several months ago"" and ""released by staff without vetting."" ""As Chair of the Caucus, I accept responsibility for this,"" she wrote. She later added that because the letter was issued after the House GOP leader, Kevin McCarthy, said there shouldn't be a ""free blank check"" from the U.S. for Ukraine, ""The proximity of these statements created the unfortunate appearance that Democrats, who have strongly and unanimously supported and voted for every package of military, strategic, and economic assistance to the Ukrainian people, are somehow aligned with Republicans."" The controversy comes ahead of midterm elections that could shake up progressive ranks. It also puts a spotlight on intraparty divisions. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the letter when asked Tuesday. The TIP with Libby Cathey In what could be an early sign of the ballot battles to come in 2022, a federal judge in Arizona will hear a newly filed lawsuit on Wednesday afternoon that is petitioning the court to block armed ""vigilantes"" from surveilling ballot drop box sites, according to court documents obtained by ABC News' Ali Dukakis. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi on Tuesday ordered an in-person hearing for the motion filed by two Arizona advocacy groups after reports of potential voter intimidation at two drop box locations over the last week. ""And things are getting worse,"" the lawsuit states. ""On Friday, two of the drop box watchers were armed and wearing tactical gear, and again on Saturday, armed and masked individuals were gathered near drop boxes."" The Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans and Voto Latino, in the complaint filed Monday, accused Clean Elections USA, the group's founder Melody Jennings and individuals who carried out ballot box surveillance associated with them of conducting a ""coordinated vigilante intimidation campaign"" -- in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 -- and ""with the express purpose of deterring voters … from depositing their ballots."" Jennings, who was a guest last week on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's podcast and talked there about finding ""mules,"" a reference to the debunked ""2000 Mules"" film, posted on Truth Social over the weekend that some of the individuals at the drop boxes were not associated with her group. (Jennings and her attorney did not respond to requests for comment.) Wednesday's hearing comes after Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, also the Democratic nominee for governor, announced Monday that she's already referred six cases of potential voter intimidation to the Justice Department. ""Immediate relief is necessary,"" the lawsuit stated. ""Voting is already underway, and there are only 15 days left until election day.

2022-10-25,https://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-court-set-rule-brittney-griners-appeal-year/story?id=91997072,Russian court denies Brittney Griner's appeal of 9-year prison sentence,"A Russian court has denied the appeal of WNBA star Brittney Griner, who is facing nine years in a Russian prison on drug charges. Griner appeared virtually at her appeal hearing on Tuesday and urged the court to reassess her sentence, saying that people found guilty of lesser crimes were given shorter sentences. ""I beg that the court takes in all of the stakes that was overlooked in the first court and reassess my sentence here,"" Griner said, apologizing for her ""mistake"" and saying that it has been ""traumatic"" to be away from her family. Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native who plays professional basketball for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained on Feb. 17 at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returned to Russia to play during the WNBA's off-season after she was accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Griner pleaded guilty to drug charges in July, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage mistakenly and that she had no ""intention"" of breaking Russian law. Griner's agent, Lindsay Colas, called the appeal decision ""disappointing, yet unsurprising,"" and one that ""further validates the fact that she is being held hostage and is being used as a political pawn."" ""Brittney Griner is being held by Russia simply because she is an American,"" Colas said in a statement. ""We call on all people, fellow Americans, along with the global sports community, to unite in their support for [Griner] and President [Joe] Biden's efforts to do what is necessary to rescue her."" The U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, reiterated in a statement following the court's decision on Tuesday the Biden administration's commitment to securing Griner's freedom, calling the appeal hearing ""another sham judicial proceeding."" ""In recent weeks, the Biden-Harris Administration has continued to engage with Russia through every available channel and make every effort to bring home Brittney as well as to support and advocate for other Americans detained in Russia, including fellow wrongful detainee Paul Whelan,"" Sullivan said. ""The President has demonstrated that he is willing to go to extraordinary lengths and make tough decisions to bring Americans home, as his Administration has done successfully from countries around the world. The Administration remains in regular touch with representatives of the families, and we continue to admire their courage in the face of these unimaginable circumstances."" Later Tuesday, Biden told reporters at an event while receiving a COVID-19 booster that ""we are in constant contact with Russian authorities to get Brittney and others out and, so far, we've not been meeting with much positive response. But we're not stopping."" As the U.S. works to secure the basketball star's freedom, Griner's attorney told ABC News earlier this month that Griner is worried that she may not be released. ""Her being afraid of not being released is mostly connected to the negotiations, which we are not aware of at all,"" Griner's attorney Alexandr Boikov told ABC News on Oct. 13. After being detained in Russia for more than five months, Griner was found guilty on drug charges in a Moscow-area court on Aug. 4 and was sentenced to nine years in prison. Her attorneys filed an appeal on Aug. 15. ""She is not very much hopeful for the appeal because the first court decision -- the verdict showed that the case is totally unjust even by present Russian standards, and we are not hoping for a big release, but of course we hope for the best,"" Boikov previously told ABC News. The WNBA star turned 32 behind bars in Russia on Oct. 18 but she was able to spend a few hours with her lawyers, who relayed birthday messages to her, as well as speak on the phone with U.S. officials. ""Thank you everyone for fighting so hard to get me home. All the support and love are definitely helping me,"" Griner said through a message shared by her attorneys. The U.S. government classified Griner's case on May 3 as ""wrongfully detained,"" meaning the U.S. will more aggressively work to negotiate her release even as the legal case against her plays out, the State Department has said. Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine began one week after Griner was detained, and some officials have expressed concern that Americans jailed in Russia could be used as leverage in the ongoing war.

2022-10-25,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/backlash-house-progressives-retract-letter-biden-ukraine-strategy/story?id=92063699,"After backlash, House progressives retract letter to Biden on Ukraine strategy","House progressives on Tuesday retracted a letter they sent Monday to President Joe Biden in which they urged him to directly negotiate with Russia on an end to the war in Ukraine, now in its ninth month. ""The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting,"" Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said in a statement Tuesday. Jayapal said she accepts responsibility for its release. Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar confirmed in a statement to ABC News Tuesday that the 30 progressives wrote the letter over the summer ""in response to reports that Ukraine was being pressured by Washington not to negotiate."" The retraction follows backlash from both Democrats and Republicans, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It also comes less than a day after Jayapal clarified the letter's meaning after initial criticism from lawmakers. ""Let me be clear: we are united as Democrats in our unequivocal commitment to supporting Ukraine in their fight for their democracy and freedom in the face of the illegal and outrageous Russian invasion, and nothing in the letter advocates for a change in that support,"" Jayapal said Monday. ""Diplomacy is an important tool that can save lives -- but it is just one tool."" When asked if the White House advised the Progressive Caucus to retract the letter, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday declined to comment on the letter. ""We appreciate the bipartisan effort,"" she said about funding for the war effort to date, ""and we are going to continue to be in conversations with members of Congress on how to continue to move forward in order to support Ukraine in their efforts,"" Jean-Pierre said at her daily press briefing. Speaking Tuesday, Pelosi vowed that Ukrainian aid would be included in an end-of-year funding bill. While the progressives who penned the letter urged direct talks with Russia, none of them have opposed more aid for Ukraine. ""Congress has secured over $60 billion in security, economic, humanitarian and budget assistance for Ukraine,"" she said at an international aid conference summit in Zagreb, Croatia. ""And more will be on the way when we pass our omnibus funding bill this fall."" In her remarks, Pelosi made it clear that the U.S. will continue defending democracy in Ukraine ""until victory is won."" Those comments make her the highest-ranking Democrat to seemingly buck the Progressive Caucus' message, which other Democratic lawmakers have criticized. Arizona Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego pushed back on the letter on Twitter, saying, ""The way to end a war? Win it quickly. How is it won quickly? By giving Ukraine the weapons to defeat Russia.""The letter also ruffled feathers among some who signed it. ""I signed this letter on June 30, but a lot has changed since then,"" California Democrat Sara Jacobs tweeted. ""I wouldn't sign it today."" Wisconsin Democrat Mark Pocan also said in a tweet that the letter was written over the summer and held for release until now. ""I have no idea why it went out now. Bad timing,"" he said. Directly engaging with Moscow as the now-retracted letter called for would mark a major shift from Biden's strategy of providing billions in military and economic aid as talks with Russia have faltered in recent months. House Republicans plan to put up a fight on passing Ukraine aid. Top House Intelligence Committee Republican Mike Turner of Ohio told reporters Monday that the end-of-year funding is going to be ""the wild, wild west of spending"" as Democratic lawmakers attach their final wish list of items during the upcoming lame-duck session. ""The problem with Ukrainian funding in the House is not Ukraine,"" he said. ""It's all the things that are being attached to it that have nothing to do with Ukraine."" Turner later signaled that the House GOP, including Leader McCarthy, would support providing more weapons to Ukraine. It all comes weeks before the midterm elections in which Republicans could take over control of the House. Last week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Punchbowl News that a Republican House majority in the next Congress would not support ""a free blank check"" for Ukraine as Americans face a recession at home. Asked about the letter during her press briefing Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration is ""very thankful"" for the ""bipartisan support"" for Ukrainian aid it has enjoyed in Congress since earlier this year. Jean-Pierre said she had not seen the letter but that the White House would ""continue to keep those lines of communication open and continue to have conversations with members of Congress.""",2.2068626685039217,2.522048345103589,-0.31518567659966745,8
2022-10-25,https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-brittney-griners-detention-russia-us-vows-secure/story?id=87925739,Timeline of Brittney Griner's detention in Russia as US vows to secure her release,"WNBA star Brittney Griner, who has been detained in Russia for over five months, was found guilty on drug charges in a Moscow-area court Thursday. She was sentenced to nine years in prison. As the U.S. floats a proposal to negotiate her release, here's a look back at major developments since she was detained in Russia more than five months ago. Feb. 17 Griner, a 31-year-old Houston native and professional basketball player for the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, is detained at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Khimki as she returns to Russia to play during the WNBA's off-season. She is accused of having vape cartridges containing hashish oil, which is illegal in the country. Feb. 24 Russia invades Ukraine, unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases. March 16 After imposing a wave of new sanctions against Russia, President Joe Biden labels Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" during a press conference at the White House amid a State Department review of whether the U.S. considers Russia's attacks on Ukrainian civilians a war crime. March 17 Concerns in the U.S. over the well-being of Brittney Griner grow as Russia extends the pre-trial detention of the WNBA star until May 19. The extension of Griner's detention comes during a volatile time for U.S.-Russian relations as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates attacks on Ukraine. March 18 The U.S. State Department issues a statement demanding access to Griner. ""We are closely engaged on this case and in frequent contact with Brittney Griner's legal team. We insist the Russian government provide consular access to all U.S. citizen detainees in Russia, including those in pre-trial detention, as Brittney Griner is,"" it says. March 23 Griner meets with U.S. officials for the first time since being held in pre-trial detention in Russia for over a month. ""The consular officer who visited with Brittney Griner was able to verify that she is doing as well as can be expected under these very difficult circumstances,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price tells reporters. Griner's meeting comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken announces that the State Department has made a formal assessment that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. ""Based on information currently available, the U.S. government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources,"" Blinken said in a statement. April 27 Calls to free Griner and other Americans detained in Russia escalate following the release of U.S. Marine veteran Trevor Reed on April 27, who was freed from a Russian prison as part of a prisoner exchange. Former Marine Paul Whelan has also been detained in Russia since 2019. May 3 The U.S. State Department announces that the U.S. government has classified Griner's case as ""wrongfully detained"" in Russia. With this classification, the U.S. becomes more involved in negotiating for her freedom as opposed to waiting for her case to play out in the Russian legal system. May 6The WNBA honors Griner with a floor decal bearing her initials and jersey number (42) on the sideline of all 12 WNBA teams as the 2022 season kicked off. May 13Russia extends Griner's pre-trial detention until June 18 as the U.S. works to secure her release. May 25Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, speaks with ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts about her wife's detention and urges President Joe Biden to do everything he can to bring her home. Cherelle Griner says that her wife texted her when she was first taken into custody, but Brittney's phone is taken soon after. She says she is ""grateful"" for a call from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but adds that she would also like to also speak with Biden. ""I just keep hearing that, you know, he has the power. She's a political pawn,"" she said. ""So if they're holding her because they want you to do something, then I want you to do it."" June 8As the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors prepare to face off in the 2022 NBA finals, players call attention to Griner's case. ""She needs to be home, she needs to be safe, she needs to be with her family,"" Warriors point guard Steph Curry tells ESPN. June 14A Russian court extends Griner's pre-trial detention for a third time, and says that she will remain in custody until July 2. June 20Cherelle Griner tells The Associated Press that she has lost ""trust"" in the U.S. government after a planned anniversary call between the couple didn't take place because the embassy line wasn't staffed over the weekend. ""I was distraught. I was hurt. I was done, fed up,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""We deeply regret that Brittney Griner was unable to speak with her wife because of a logistical error,"" a State Department spokesperson told ABC News, adding that the call will be rescheduled for a later date. June 27Griner attends a preliminary hearing as her detention is extended for the fourth time and the first day of her trial is set for July 1. June 30Friends and family members of Griner gather for a vigil outside the Russian Consulate in New York City, as pressure mounts on the U.S. to secure the release of the WNBA star. July 1Griner's trial begins in Russia. July 4Griner personally reaches out to President Biden, urging him to help get her out of Russian custody, in a handwritten letter delivered to the president on the 4th of July. ""As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I'm terrified I might be here forever,"" Griner wrote to the president. July 5White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tells reporters during a briefing that Biden read Griner's handwritten letter and her case is a ""top priority"" for the president. July 6Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris calls Cherelle Griner to ""reassure"" her that they are working to secure her wife's release, the White House announced. July 7Griner pleads guilty on drug charges, saying that the vape cartridges containing hashish oil were in her luggage unintentionally. She said that she had ""no intention"" of breaking Russian law and packed the cartridges by accident. During the hearing, U.S. officials who attended the trial delivered a response letter to Griner from Biden, the State Department said. July 8Cherelle Griner speaks out at a press conference, saying that she read the letter Biden wrote to her wife and it brought both of them ""so much joy.""""I believe every word that she said to him, he understood and he sees her as a person,"" Cherelle Griner said. ""And he has not forgotten her, which was her biggest cry in her letter."" July 14Character witnesses take the stand in Griner's trial as the U.S works to secure her release. July 15Griner appears for the fourth day of her trial, where her attorney presents a letter from an American doctor giving Griner permission to use cannabis to reduce chronic pain. Griner is expected to testify but her testimony is delayed. July 26Griner returns to court, where she speaks briefly with ABC News and shares a message for her wife, Cherelle, who recently graduated from law school. ""Good luck on the bar exam,"" Griner said. July 27Griner testifies in court, saying she did not mean to leave the vape cartridges in her bag, but that she was in a hurry and was stressed after recovering from COVID-19 that month. She adds that she had permission to use medical cannabis and used a certificate to buy it in the U.S. In a sharp reversal, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced later that day that he will hold a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""in the coming days"" to discuss securing Griner and Whelan's freedom. ""We put a substantial proposal on the table weeks ago to facilitate their release,"" he said. July 29Blinken tells reporters that he had a ""frank and direct conversation"" with Lavrov about a U.S. proposal to exchange convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout in return for Griner and Whelan's freedom. ""I pressed the Kremlin to accept the substantial proposal that we put forth on the release of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner,"" Blinken said. ""I'm not going to characterize his responses and I can't give you an assessment of whether I think things are more or less likely, but it was important that [he] hear directly from me on that."" Aug. 4Griner is found guilty on drug charges and sentenced to nine years in prison as her trial came to an end. Griner's attorneys, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, told reporters outside of the courthouse in Moscow on Thursday that they plan to file an appeal. Biden slammed Russia in a statement and called on Russia to ""release her immediately."" ""My administration will continue to work tirelessly and pursue every possible avenue to bring Brittney and Paul Whelan home safely as soon as possible,"" he said. Aug. 14A senior Russian diplomat confirms that exchange talks between the U.S. and Russia are underway. ""This quite sensitive issue of the swap of convicted Russian and US citizens is being discussed through the channels defined by our presidents. These individuals are, indeed, being discussed,"" Alexander Darchiev, head of the foreign ministry's North America Department, told Russian state news agency TASS. ""The Russian side has long been seeking the release of Viktor Bout. The details should be left to professionals, proceeding from the 'do not harm' principle."" Aug. 15Griner's attorneys file an appeal for her nine-year prison sentence, according to Blagovolina. Oct. 25A Russian judge rejects Griner's appeal of her nine-year prison sentence after just a half hour. Griner appeared via video before the appeal was denied, saying, ""I beg that the court takes in all of the stakes that was overlooked in the first court and reassess my sentence here."" ""I want to apologize for this mistake,"" Griner said. ""I did not intend to do this but I understand the charges brought against me. ... It's been very stressful and traumatic [being away from my family].""

2022-10-24,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-russias-dirty-bomb-claims-pretext-escalation-ukraine/story?id=92010587,US says Russia's 'dirty bomb' claims are pretext for escalation in Ukraine,"U.S. officials are flatly rejecting as false repeated Russian claims being made to senior western officials that Ukraine is preparing to use a radioactive ""dirty bomb"" in Ukraine, saying at the same time they are not seeing any indications that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons. In this weekend's phone calls to top officials at the Pentagon, Russian military leaders indicated that the alleged Ukrainian use of a dirty bomb would be a justification for an escalation in the conflict, a U.S. official told ABC News. Over the weekend, in an unprecedented series of phone calls to senior defense officials in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Turkey, senior Russian defense officials repeatedly claimed that Ukraine was possibly preparing to use a dirty bomb. A dirty bomb is an explosive device paired with radioactive material that is intended to widely disperse radiation over a wide area while a nuclear weapon is a device that uses nuclear fission to produce a massive atomic or thermonuclear explosion. ""Obviously, we're concerned about these allegations that the Russians raised, them, not us,"" John Kirby, the National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications told reporters on Monday. ""They're the ones that made a public issue of this."" ""We reject the false allegation that the Russians made in the phone call that they placed at their request to (Defense) Secretary Austin, that the Ukrainians were planning to use a dirty bomb,"" said Kirby. ""We just reject that allegation. It's just not true."" On Sunday and Monday, in a rare move, Russian defense minister Sergey Shoygu and Russia's top military commander Gen. Valery Gerasimov initiated phone calls to their American counterparts and, according to Russia's defense ministry, raised their concerns that Ukraine was preparing to use a dirty bomb. Those calls, and similar calls to other western leaders, resulted in a joint statement by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France rejecting the Russian claim as a pretext to escalate tensions in Ukraine. ""Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory,"" said the statement. ""The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation. We further reject any pretext for escalation by Russia."" A U.S. official said that, in this weekend's calls to top officials at the Pentagon, Russian military leaders described any alleged Ukrainian use of a dirty bomb as a justification for an escalation in the conflict, presumably a reference to the use of nuclear or chemical-biological weapons. However, U.S. officials pointed out repeatedly on Monday that they are not seeing any indications that Russia's military is making preparations for the use of nuclear weapons. ""We continue to see nothing in the way of preparations by the Russian side for the use of nuclear weapons and nothing with respect to the potential use for a dirty bomb at this point,"" said Kirby. ""We're watching this as closely as we can."" ""We have seen in the past that the Russians have, on occasion, blamed others for things that that they were planning to do,"" said Kirby. Meanwhile in Moscow, the Russian government continued to say that Ukraine was preparing to use a dirty bomb. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed that Russia was in possession of information alleging that Ukraine was preparing dirty bombs at locations in Kyiv and central Ukraine. Earlier, the Russian defense ministry had published a map indicating that Ukraine was preparing a dirty bomb at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that has seen constant shelling for weeks.",3.2631856615790893,1.1703635726301727,2.0928220889489166,4
2022-10-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/top-ukrainian-general-discusses-war-russia-putins-nuclear/story?id=91989074,"Top Ukrainian general discusses war against Russia, Putin's nuclear threat: Exclusive","KHARKIV, Ukraine -- The commander of the Ukrainian Ground Forces warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine is real and that the West ""should be worried,"" but said his country is nonetheless winning the war. Gen. Col. Oleksander Syrskiy made the comments in an exclusive interview with ABC News' Chief Foreign Correspondent Ian Pannell in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Sunday. As the 57-year-old top commander of his country's land forces, Syrskiy has played a decisive role in turning the war in Ukraine's favor, first leading the successful defense of the capital, Kyiv, and then -- most recently -- masterminding the spectacular counteroffensive in the northeast that upended the monthslong conflict and threw Russian forces onto the defensive. The rare interview, airing Monday on ""Good Morning America,"" is one of the few times Syrskiy has spoken publicly at length and he described Ukraine's tactics, the importance of Western support, the threat of renewed attacks from Belarus and his determination that Ukraine will reclaim all of its territory, including the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. Ukraine's successes, however, have been shadowed by the recent threats from Putin that Russia might resort to nuclear weapons to reverse the course of his war in Ukraine. Syrskiy told ABC News that he takes the threats seriously. ""We are and should be worried,"" Syrskiy said. ""I do believe that such a threat really exists and we have to take it into account."" The urgency of those worries was underlined on Sunday when Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu made telephone calls to his counterparts in France, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, alleging that Ukraine was preparing to use a ""dirty bomb"" on its own territory. Shoigu's claim sparked fears that Russia might be laying the groundwork to use a nuclear weapon and blame Ukraine for it. Following Shoigu’s call with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson dismissed the allegations as ""transparently false."" ""The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,"" Watson said. Russia's nuclear threats have grown louder as its position in Ukraine has become increasingly desperate, and Ukrainian troops now threaten to force the Russians to retreat from the key port city of Kherson -- yet another potential turning point in the war. Syrskiy is one of the minds behind the two crucial victories so far that have enabled Ukraine's stunning success in pushing back Russian forces. When Russian troops advanced on Kyiv in late February, shortly after launching the invasion of neighboring Ukraine, Syrskiy directed the defense that shattered Putin’s initial objectives. Then in September, Syrskiy led the counteroffensive in northeastern Ukraine that liberated thousands of miles of Russian-occupied territory -- a disaster for Moscow that forced Putin to order a military draft and, for the first time, raised the prospect that Russian forces might suffer a full defeat in Ukraine. ""Of course I think we are winning,"" Syrskiy told ABC News. ""Because, first and foremost, we are winning the psychological battle."" But the commander warned against complacency, noting the heavy sacrifices that success has required of Ukrainians. ""We have success on the battleground, but war is difficult,"" he added. ""There hasn't been any wars at that scale in Europe, or elsewhere in the world, since the Second World War. And we understand that this war is about survival of our people and our state, and this is why we have no other option but to win."" Syrskiy was given the Hero of Ukraine award in April for his efforts defending the capital city. But the victory in Kharkiv, his hometown, was especially personal. Cerebral and reflective, Syrskiy is also a military leader who prefers to see the frontlines himself, regularly visiting positions to personally meet some of the soldiers he is sending into battle. He told ABC News he feels that responsibility and has a ""spiritual connection"" with his troops. Although he was appointed to his current post in 2019, Syrskiy has helped lead Ukraine's defense against Russia since 2014, when Russian troops and separatist proxies seized parts of the disputed Donbas region, the predominately Russian-speaking industrial heartland of Ukraine's east. Syrskiy has a deep familiarity with the tactics of his enemy, having been trained in the same Soviet school of warfare. In the 1980s, he studied at the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School. Now, he's exploiting that knowledge on the battlefield. ""It's easier to understand your enemy's actions,"" he told ABC News. ""You can foresee what he might do in different situations."" But as a commander, like the rest of Ukraine's military leadership, Syrskiy has embraced a different mode of military thinking since even before 2014 -- adopting NATO doctrines that grant greater initiative to more junior officers on the ground and moving away from the top-down Soviet approach. ""Of course there was a change in mentality,"" he said. ""Understanding that victory is achieved not by increasing the number of troops, but by using them smartly."" Despite his familiarity with Russia, Syrskiy said he had not believed Moscow would go through with a full-scale invasion. Even as Russian forces massed near the border, he said he believed an attack would be limited to the east, though he still prepared for the worst. ""To be honest, I did not expect that scale and level of invasion from the enemy,"" he told ABC News. Now fighting in Donbas, Syrskiy said Ukraine's strategy was to avoid full-frontal clashes that favoured Russia's massed artillery and instead, steadily degrade Russia's firepower by hitting supply hubs while launching constant mobile attacks. The goal, he said, was to achieve objectives with minimal losses. ""We achieve this by reliably hitting the firepower of the enemy, their artillery, avoiding frontal assaults, emphasizing raids and manoeuvers, attacking from the flanks and from the back,"" he added. ""We create the conditions under which we can make the enemy nervous, start taking losses and abandon their positions."" The successful counteroffensive in the northeast led by Syrskiy has been hailed by military experts as a masterstroke that will go down in the history of warfare, alongside other victorious operations like the D-Day landings during World War II or the Battle of Saratoga in the American Revolutionary War. Ukraine's success relied on patience and misdirection, declaring a counteroffensive in its south over the summer which lured Russia into pulling some of its best troops from the northeastern frontline. Once Russia had thinned its defenses in the northeast, Ukraine struck, rapidly breaking through and causing Russia's lines to collapse. Initially, the northeastern counteroffensive had itself been planned as a feint to tie up Russian units, according to Syrskiy. But he said he realized while planning the operation that Russian forces there were weaker than expected, opening up an opportunity to deliver a blow that would have a much wider effect. ""When we were planning it, it became obvious to me that an advance in Kharkiv as an operation will benefit us most and will have the most negative impact on the enemy,"" Syrskiy told ABC News. ""I noticed it first in May during the first offensive operation around Kharkiv, when we managed to liberate 10 to 30 kilometers of areas surrounding the city,"" he added, before noting that it was only in the summer that the change in the balance in forces made the counteroffensive possible. A similar Ukrainian success now looks possible in Kherson. Russia has ordered all civilians to leave the southern city amid reports it has already pulled back some veteran troops. But there are also concerns Russia might blow up the nearby Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, which Ukrainian officials allege Russian troops have rigged with explosives, threatening to flood Kherson. Syrskiy declined to comment on the battle for Kherson, saying only that he believes ""in the success of our armed forces."" He said the threat Russia might also blow up the Kakhovka dam should also not be underestimated. There is also renewed concern around neighboring Belarus, from where Russia launched its failed assault on Kyiv and where it has recently again begun moving in more troops and equipment. Western and Ukrainian officials have said that, for now, the new build up in Belarus is small and more likely a feint aimed at drawing Ukrainian troops away from the south. But Syrksiy said he believes the Russian moves in Belarus do reflect preparations to try to move the fighting into new areas once again. ""Of course they are getting ready for escalation of the battle and switching the conflict to other combat zones,"" he told ABC News. ""They are getting ready for action aimed at weakening our groupings and, to my mind, the possible purpose of that would be to cut or degrade our lines of communication and supplies."" But he said by doing so, Russia again risks stretching itself too thin in the north. ""They risk stepping on the same rake twice and hitting themselves in the face,"" he added. Most experts believe Putin is preparing for a long war, hoping his military mobilization and the arrival of winter weather will allow Russia to stablize its frontlines and then outlast Western determination to support Ukraine. The possibility of Republicans taking control of the U.S. Congress in the midterm elections next month is also raising questions whether American aid will continue as strongly for Ukraine. Republicans are divided on the issue and some party leaders have suggested they might scale aid back. When asked if he was worried that U.S. support could dry up if Republicans win more seats in Congress, Syrskiy said he doesn't get involved in politics. ""I trust the government. I trust the people of the United States of America. I trust that our strategic partner will continue to help us overcome our enemy come what may,"" he said. Syrskiy said he was grateful to the American people for the aid, which he said played a key role in Ukraine's victories. Without U.S. weapons and ammunition, he said he couldn't even imagine how much harder the task would be. When asked whether he believes Putin would stop if Ukraine succeeded in liberating all its territory, Syrskiy said it doesn't matter and that the fastest way to end the war was for Ukraine to push Russia out as quickly as possible. ""We have no other option, we have to go forward, move straight to our state borders,"" he said, adding that victory would only be when Ukrainian flags were flying over all Ukraine's borders, ""including Ukrainian Crimea."" Syrskiy recalled seeing razed villages last week as he drove near the recently liberated city of Lyman in northeastern Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast. ""You can't look at these scenes without getting emotional,"" he told ABC News. ""You literally feel pain in my heart, in my soul, so certainly you want to deliver such a blow to the enemy that they can never get back to Ukraine.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,3
2022-10-24,https://abcnews.go.com/International/satellite-photos-reveal-fortification-plans-russia-occupied-ukraine/story?id=91734319,Satellite photos reveal fortification plans in Russia-occupied Ukraine: Analysts,"LONDON -- As it looks ahead to a decisive winter, Russia is constructing a massive fortification in the eastern Ukrainian territory it occupies, according to satellite imagery and statements by a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Satellite imagery provided by Planet Labs shows significant work is underway to build a trench in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine, with a planned length of some 120 miles. In satellite images taken on Oct. 17, the fortifications for this defensive line begin just south of Russian-held Popasna in the Luhansk region. An ABC News analysis of the satellite images overlaid on Google Earth suggests the fortifications, as of that date, were 7.9 miles long. Another section of fortifications, near the town of Hirske, can be seen on satellite imagery from Oct. 6. The image shows two rows of pyramid-shaped concrete blocks followed by a large vehicle-trapping ditch, both meant to slow down tanks and heavy machinery. An analyst for Janes, the defense intelligence provider, told ABC News the trenches “are considerably larger and more sophisticated than most Russian trench lines seen throughout the war."" The trench is being dubbed ""The Wagner Line"" in Russian media after the Russian private military company of the same name. Wagner’s founder, billionaire Evgeniy Prigozhin, told Russian media outlet New Day that Wagner was behind the project. Plans for the trench published by a Prigozhin-linked media outlet, FAN, show it will extend to Lysychansk to the north before turning and going east toward the Russian border. Completed according to this plan, it would run about 120 miles. The Janes analyst says this is an ambitious plan. ""It will take the Russians considerable time to construct it if they try to, and it’s time they may well not have,” given Ukraine’s offensive in the east. Even so, the Russians are using what the military analysts said are rare and expensive trench-digging systems, seen in videos published by FAN, to build it. This could mean ""the towns near these trenches are considered to be important enough by Russian commanders to merit their use."" The plan for the completed line goes through towns that the Janes analyst describes as strategic hubs important to Russia’s long-term goals in the region: Popasna, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk and Luhansk. But by protecting these towns, the line would actually bisect the Luhansk oblast, all of which Russia currently holds, staying instead within the borders of the Luhansk People’s Republic, the Russian-backed separatist republic within the oblast, the experts said. Colonel Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesman for Ukraine's Eastern Command, sees this as proof that the war is not going Russia’s way. ""It is the evidence of their losses as they proclaimed both Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts in general as Russia and here, in the middle of this territory they are building this fortified line,"" Cherevatyi told ABC News. And while the Wagner Line may be a defensive tool, Cherevatyi suspects there is a political reason for it as well. ""it looks as if they want to demonstrate how important it is for them, that they will stand till the end defending these territories.""

Demissie is covering Missouri and North Carolina. Below, she describes what she saw and heard in North Carolina as early voting got underway last week -- with control of Congress hanging in the balance. See more of Demissie's work with the embed team and anchor George Stephanopoulos on Hulu's ""Power Trip: Those Seeking Power and Those Who Chase Them."" We're entering crunch time in the final weeks of the 2022 election cycle. Amid that countdown, a slew of big-name surrogates have been turning out for North Carolina's Democratic and Republican Senate nominees, Cheri Beasley and Rep. Ted Budd -- who are locked in a close, potentially crucial, race. Thursday stands out for me as a moment when the contest between Beasley and Budd may have started to shift. It was the first day of early in-person voting in the state, and some political heavyweights joined the campaigns. After months of the polling showing a virtual tie between the two candidates, according to FiveThirtyEight, Budd also began to open up a small but notable lead. Over the course of the day, though, both he and Beasley insisted that every vote mattered: not just for their race but for which party would have a Senate majority come January, with the power to block or confirm presidential appointments and shape or filibuster legislation on abortion, the economy and more. I started Thursday off with the North Carolina Democratic Party, which held a rally to kick off the first day of early in-person voting. There, Beasley, a former state judge, spoke along with other down-ballot Democratic candidates -- setting the stakes as she saw them. ""We know that the fundamental freedom to pursue life, liberty and happiness must be protected,"" she said, ""and we are the protectors every time we exercise our right to vote."" Another influential Democrat who joined the rally was North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who won reelection in 2020 despite former President Donald Trump winning the state that same year. Cooper notably expanded his margin of victory from 2016 in what one expert told ABC News was an example of the purple state's ""blue tinge"" at the state level. Beasley -- emphasizing health care and abortion access -- hopes to build on that success, despite her party's headwinds over inflation and the economy. Speaking Thursday, Gov. Cooper focused on what he called the GOP's extremism after Jan. 6. ""It's pretty clear that a majority of the Republican Party prefers an autocracy to a democracy as long as their guy is in charge,"" he said. ""If we want to preserve our democracy, we have to make sure that we're electing people who believe in it."" Following the overturning of Roe v. Wade this summer, abortion has become one of the most critical issues in North Carolina and Democrats have seized on the opportunity. During Thursday's rally, Beasley promised to use her Senate vote to codify Roe's protections, if elected. ""I will fight, and I will fight to make sure that Roe vs. Wade is the law of the land,"" she said. After she spoke, Beasley headed to a polling station in Raleigh -- trailed by reporters like me -- to cast her early vote alongside her husband and one of her sons. From there, I drove to Greensboro, where Budd was holding a campaign event with Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. During the event, Scott emphasized the importance of conservatives holding onto the North Carolina Senate seat after Richard Burr's retirement. ""We have to win in North Carolina,"" Scott said. ""If we don't win North Carolina, we're not gonna get a majority."" During Scott and Budd's remarks, both hit on the economy and underlined how many Americans are feeling the pain of historically high inflation. ""If you like paying more for everything, you should vote for Beasley and [President] Joe Biden, because they did that,"" Scott said Thursday. Budd was even more blunt, saying he'd heard directly from locals about how the rising cost of living made their daily needs less attainable. ""This is the grocery cart that she could afford two years ago,"" he said, describing one anecdote from a voter. ""And unfortunately, this is the grocery cart that [she] can afford now -- which is pretty empty."" Polls consistently show the economy and inflation are top of mind of many voters, who in turn give the edge on addressing it to the GOP. Republicans blame Democratic spending policies while Democrats, who defend themselves by citing low unemployment, say prices are fueled by supply chain issues, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other factors. Voters also largely disapprove of the president. On Thursday, as North Carolina voters began casting their ballots, Budd wanted them to think about Biden and Beasley as a package deal. ""I've got a record in the U.S. Congress that I'm running toward,"" he said. ""She's going to try to hide. She's going to run away from Joe Biden.""

2022-10-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/reason-vladimir-putin-imposed-martial-law-ukraine-analysis/story?id=91863245,Here's likely reason why Vladimir Putin imposed martial law in Ukraine: Analysis,"President Vladimir Putin's declaration of martial law on Wednesday officially imposed it only in four occupied regions of Ukraine. But many experts said in reality Putin appeared to have laid the groundwork to apply a form of martial law across the whole of Russia, just under another name. In his public address, Putin portrayed the martial law declaration as a technicality, limited to the Ukrainian regions he illegally annexed last month. But a second decree, published at the same time, also placed all of Russia's other regions into various levels of increased ""readiness."" Under those readiness levels, powers were granted to local authorities that closely resemble some of those under martial law. It was still unclear how the powers will be applied in practice, but some experts said it meant Putin had imposed a form of martial law across all Russia. ""It creates legal basis to impose martial law across the country or parts of the country without actually declaring it,"" Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, told ABC News. The most severe form outside the Ukrainian regions is in eight Russian regions neighboring Ukraine, where local administrations are granted powers to impose curfews, restrict movement, take over factories and transport, potentially apply censorship as well as order the temporary resettlement of people. The regions are under a ""form of martial law lite,"" Mark Galeotti, a veteran Russia analyst, wrote in the Spectator Magazine. ""Vladimir Putin has just moved Russia one step closer to totalitarianism."" Russia's southern and central regions, including Moscow, have slightly fewer powers and the rest of the country marginally less. The decrees grant governors the power to take any measures directed toward supporting Russia's war effort, in theory giving them almost unlimited authority. ""What's been declared is the right of the government to take any decision that seems to them necessary. Wherever, for whatever reason,"" Gleb Pavlovsky, a former political advisor to Putin and now a political analyst, said in a recent interview. For now, many regions have sought to reassure citizens the measures will not affect daily life. And most experts said it remained to be seen how they would be applied in practice. But the move appeared to be an attempt by Putin to rescue his invasion in Ukraine after presenting it as a limited ""Special Military Operation."" The decrees' primary goal, experts said, was to allow Russian authorities to mobilize resources needed to support the mass troop mobilization. ""I was waiting for this announcement. Their system can't mobilize this many people without mobilizing state resources too. The state needs more resources directed to the military,"" Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at RAND Corporation, wrote on Twitter. The move also appeared to re-direct Russia's economy toward supporting the war effort. It suggested the Kremlin is trying to ready Russia for a long war while also bracing for possible shocks to the political system coming from the battlefield, such as the likely loss of Kherson, Gabuev said. ""It looks like the Kremlin sees serious sources of worry,"" he said. ""Here the government really wants to be prepared."" He added, ""It's significant and it shows the change in the estimate of how the war is going and what kind of mobilization internally first and foremost will be needed to kind of toughen it out and then ultimately win this war by the Kremlin's definition.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,3
2022-10-22,https://abcnews.go.com/International/chinas-xi-jinping-flipped-script-world-10-years/story?id=91858424,How China’s Xi Jinping flipped the script on the world during his 10 years in power,"Xi Jinping will stroll across the red-carpeted dais inside Beijing’s gargantuan Great Hall of the People on Sunday, having firmly secured a norm-busting third term as leader of the Chinese Communist Party, cementing his power atop a more confident -- and more defiant -- China. When he did the same walk 10 years ago, there was a brief sense of hope in the West that China was about to embark on a kinder and gentler age. “Just as China needs to learn more about the world,” Xi told the gathered press with a modest smile in his first speech as party leader in November 2012, “so does the world need to learn more about China.” In the lead-up, many sifted through his available biography for clues of what kind of leader he would be. He came of age during the chaotic years of Mao’s Cultural Revolution, rose to govern two of China’s most prosperous coastal provinces as well as the country’s most cosmopolitan city, Shanghai. Xi oversaw the well-received 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, sent his daughter to study at Harvard and often talked about the fond memories of an Iowa homestay in the 1980s. The son of a revolutionary-turned-liberal reformer, many China-watchers had hoped that the son would be like the father. This resume led many, like New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, to boldly predict in January 2013 that “Xi Jinping will spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao’s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch, and Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer, will be released from prison.” “I may be wrong entirely,” Kristof cautioned. Ten years on, not only is Mao’s body still comfortably lying in his mausoleum, but Liu was never released from prison until the final months before his death from cancer in 2017. Meanwhile, Xi’s China has become more confident, powerful and influential than ever before. Xi brought the Communist Party back to the forefront of daily life in China, linking the party to the country’s growing strength and success, which, in return, has fostered a nationalism that has become inseparable from the party itself. Yet, at the same time, his policies -- most notably his signature zero-COVID policy -- also has also left China more isolated and xenophobic than it has been in generations. In ten years, Xi has reshaped China Citing ""disorderly capital,"" Xi has cracked down on private companies, like tech giants Alibaba and Tencent, that powered much of China’s growth in the last 15 years and signaled a desire to return to the heavily self-reliant state-run model. Instead of political reforms, Xi dismantled China’s nascent civil society, shuttered NGOs and locked up human rights lawyers, stifled religious institutions from Tibetan Buddhism to Christian churches across the country -- perhaps nowhere more prominently than in the western region of Xinjiang where many mosques were dismantled and hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uyghurs have been forcibly re-educated in the name of anti-terrorism. He muzzled the domestic media, dictating that they must ""serve the party,"" suppressed Hong Kong’s once-promised autonomy and built a high-tech surveillance state that ultimately gave the state the ability implement its zero-COVID measures throughout the pandemic. Xi modernized the party’s People’s Liberation Army, encouraged a more strident foreign policy -- especially over territorials claims like Taiwan, the South China Sea and the Himalayas where Chinese soldiers had a deadly tussle with Indian troops in June 2020. He has sought to challenge the U.S.-backed world order by cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin whom Xi called in 2018 “my best, most intimate friend.” It turns out that pre-leadership Xi was not only a cypher to the West, but also worked within the opaque operations of the Party itself. Deng Yuwen, the former deputy of editor of the Central Party School’s journal, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this week that, according to party insiders, Xi was selected by party elders believing his low key demeanor would lend to him being more controllable than his rivals. “One can only imagine their regrets,” Deng wrote. Many should have taken heed when Chinese state media reported that one of the Xi’s favorite films was “The Godfather.” Like Michael Corleone, Xi quickly out maneuvered his rivals within the party and consolidated power through anti-corruption and loyalty campaigns and muted the influence of retired party members. ‘Redder than Red' Much more prescient at the time was the leaked 2009 U.S. State Department cable entitled “Portrait of Vice President Xi Jinping: ‘Ambitious Survivor’ of the Cultural Revolution.” Sourced from a private acquaintance of Xi, the summary read “Xi is ‘exceptionally ambitious’ confident and focused, and has had his 'eye on the prize' from early adulthood.” Unlike many youth who ""made up for lost time by having fun"" after the Cultural Revolution, Xi ""chose to survive by becoming redder than the red."" If the Party was China’s church, Xi is the ultimate true believer and, in Xi’s China, there is no separation between church and state. During the last party congress in 2017, Xi triumphantly declared, “Government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west -- the party leads them all.” Standing between China and chaos The exact same day as Kristof’s optimistic column on Jan. 5, 2013, the true Xi revealed himself to the party elite, delivering a secret speech that was only published in its entirety in the party’s magazine “QiuShi” -- Seeking Truth” in 2019. “Hostile forces at home and abroad … doing all in their power to smear and vilify,” he warned. “They aim to incite [the people] into overthrowing both the Communist Party of China’s leadership and the socialist system of our country.” His internal party speeches at that time reveals Xi’s greatest motivating factor: for the Communist Party of China to avoid the fate of the Soviet Union. In party study sessions, Xi would often pose the question, ""why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Communist Party of the Soviet Union fall to pieces? “In the end, no one was man enough, and no one came out to fight,” he answered in one speech. This was the period of the Arab Spring when popular uprisings in the Middle East overthrew their authoritarian dictators, Xi saw crises everywhere and a strong Communist Party with him at the helm was the only thing standing between China and chaos. During this time a secret document circulated within the party known as “Document No. 9” which warned that western democratic ideals like universal values, civil society, free market economy and the West’s idea of journalism threatened China’s security and needed to be eradicated. It read like roadmap for Xi’s eventual heavy hand. A veteran Chinese journalist was later sentenced to seven years in prison for leaking the document deemed ""a state secret"" to an overseas media outlet. There are no official polls in China but by all accounts, Xi enjoys popular support by those who have not been negatively affected by his policies. The Chinese government often points to a Harvard survey that found that 95.5% of Chinese respondents in 2016 were either “relatively satisfied” or “highly satisfied” with their government. As he is poised this weekend for even greater power, Xi once again highlighted looming external threats in his speech in front of the congress this week and doubled down on the path he has set for China and, by extension, the world. “The world has entered a new period of turbulence and change,” Xi warned the delegates. “External attempts to suppress and contain China may escalate at any time.” “We must therefore be more mindful of potential dangers, be prepared to deal with worst-case scenarios, and be ready to withstand high winds, choppy waters, and even dangerous storms.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,6
2022-10-21,https://abcnews.go.com/International/uks-prime-minister-potential-candidates/story?id=91851680,Who will be the UK's next prime minister? Here are the potential candidates,"LONDON -- Liz Truss announced her resignation on Thursday after only 45 days in office, making her the shortest-serving U.K. prime minister in history. Her resignation follows weeks of political and economic turmoil after her government introduced a ""mini-budget"" that sent financial markets into crisis and cratered the value of the Great British Pound. As a result, members of the Conservative Party’s 1922 Committee, the ruling group that sets out leadership contest rules, have introduced immediate changes to the process as the party prepares to name its third prime minister in two months. Potential prime ministerial candidates will need the support of at least 100 fellow Members of Parliament to secure their spot on the ballot to become the next party leader. The Conservative Party currently has 357 members in Parliament meaning there will be a maximum of three leadership candidates that could be put forward. The increased threshold of MPs needed to support a candidate for office “can be achieved by any serious candidate with a chance of going through” Sir Graham Brady, Chairman of the 1922 Committee, said on Thursday. Many see these changes as an attempt to bypass the Conservative Party’s internal membership voting in the leadership contest and, as a result, could produce another leader who creates further political and economic instability. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is speculated to make a dramatic return to the frontline of British politics only 6 weeks after he reluctantly resigned amid intense scandal. He remains popular with Conservative Party members but is seen as a liability by many of his fellow colleagues. On the potential return of Johnson, John Baron, MP for Basildon and Billericay, told the BBC that “we've now got to look forward and pick a new candidate, somebody who has credibility, experience and can unite the party.” Johnson has not yet confirmed if he is standing for office again but will be flying back to the U.K. this weekend after enjoying a vacation in the Caribbean. Former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is seen as another likely candidate after he came second to Liz Truss in this summer's leadership contest. Sunak repeatedly warned Truss that her economic plans and proposed tax cuts would create economic turmoil. The subsequent financial fallout looks to have proven him correct. Sunak is a potential calming voice and remains the U.K.’s seventh most popular politician, according to analytics firm, YouGov. However, reports that his wealthy family used non-domiciled status to reduce their tax payment is seen as a potential gift to Labour, the U.K.’s opposition party, amid the current cost of living crisis. Penny Mordaunt, who placed third in the leadership contest, is another likely favorite. Mordaunt served as former Prime Minister Theresa May’s defense secretary, the first woman to hold the post in British history, and her previous experience within the Ministry of Defense could be a vital benefit when it comes to how the U.K. deals with the war in Ukraine. Suella Braverman, the former Interior Minister -- who lasted a day less in office than Liz Truss did -- is another probable contender for the top job. A renowned anti-immigration and Brexit supporter, Braverman proposed strengthening the punishment for possessing cannabis and is seen as the preferred candidate for the ideological right of the Conservative Party. Across the aisle, however, Leader of the U.K.’s Opposition Party, Sir Keir Starmer, has joined other political leaders from the minority parties in calling for a general election. “The British public deserve a proper say on the country’s future” and “we need a general election,” he said on Twitter. The next prime minister will be announced by Oct. 28.",0.0,0.0,0.0,1
