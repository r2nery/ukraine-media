2022-10-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/565699-un-dirty-bomb-inspection/,UN inspectors visit Ukrainian nuclear sites,"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors have begun “verification activities” at two locations in Ukraine, the US body announced on Monday. Russia has accused Kiev of using these sites to produce a ‘dirty bomb’, which would then be detonated to frame Moscow and draw NATO forces into the conflict. The inspectors’ work will be completed soon, and IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi will present his initial conclusions later this week, the UN organization stated in a press release. While the IAEA said that the inspections were performed at the request of the Ukrainian government, Russia initially singled out the two facilities – the Institute for Nuclear Research in Kiev and the Vostochny Mining and Processing Plant in Dnipropetrovsk Region – as locations where Ukraine was allegedly preparing a radioactive ‘dirty bomb’. In a letter to the UN Security Council last week, Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia said that staff at these locations “have received direct orders from [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky’s regime to develop such a dirty bomb,” and that plans to create such a device were “at their concluding stage.” The IAEA announced last Thursday that it would investigate these claims, which have been denied by Kiev and dismissed as false by Western leaders. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu phoned his counterparts in the US, UK, France, Türkiye, India, and China last week to warn them of a possible provocation by Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin also referenced the two nuclear facilities in a lengthy speech, adding that he believed Kiev was attempting to cover its tracks ahead of the IAEA’s visit. A ‘dirty bomb’ is not a nuclear bomb in the traditional sense. Rather, it uses conventional explosives to scatter radioactive material over a wide area. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba described Russia’s allegations last week as “absurd,” suggesting that Moscow may harbor its own plans to detonate such a device. Russia has repeatedly stated that it will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and the US intelligence community has acknowledged that there is no evidence it plans to. The IAEA said that it had investigated one of the nuclear sites a month ago and found “no undeclared nuclear activities or materials” there. However, Nebenzia cautioned Grossi to “be vigilant,” as the two locations are not the only ones where a dirty bomb could be built.",0.0,0.0,0.0,9
2022-10-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/565698-putin-grain-deal-suspension/,Putin clarifies position on grain deal,"The grain deal between Moscow and Kiev has not met its stated goals, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. Most of the Ukrainian agricultural products exported under the agreement have not reached the poorer nations they were supposedly intended for and have instead ended up in Europe and Türkiye, he argued. Putin said Moscow was suspending its participation in the deal, but not fully withdrawing from it. The deal was promoted to “secure the interests of the poorer nations,” he said, adding that, according to Russian intelligence, the real structure of Ukraine’s grain exports is vastly different. “We agreed to that [grain deal] precisely in the interests of the poorer nations,” the Russian president said. “On the whole, it looks like 34% of [the Ukrainian] grain gets to Türkiye, 35% or even more is taken by the EU nations and only between three and four … or five percent, according to our Agriculture Ministry … goes to the poorer nations,” Putin said. His words came as the Russian military closed the Black Sea grain corridor used to export Ukrainian grain under the agreement reached in Istanbul in July. The agreement – mediated by the UN and Türkiye – was initially hailed as critical for easing the global food crisis and helping the world’s poorest nations avoid starvation. Russia has since repeatedly pointed out that the grain, in fact, goes to other destinations. Moscow decided to halt its participation in the deal following a massive drone attack on its naval base in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol last week. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the naval drones used in the attack navigated through the grain corridor’s security zone to reach their targets. One of them might have even been launched from a civilian vessel chartered to transport Ukrainian grain shipments, it added. Earlier on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia was ready to compensate the missing Ukrainian grain export volumes from its own stocks. At the same time, he said that Moscow could not yet name the conditions that would make it resume its participation in the deal. In the wake of Moscow’s decision to suspend its participation in the deal, the UN has insisted that “food must flow” regardless of circumstances. Civilian vessels “can never be a military target or held hostage,” the UN coordinator for the Black Sea grain initiative, Amir Abdulla, said. Russia has previously said that it could not guarantee the security of the grain corridor if Kiev used it for military purposes.",0.0,0.0,0.0,7
2022-10-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/565697-gazprom-nord-stream-inspection/,Nord Stream blasts were ‘act of terrorism’ – Putin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the damage to the two Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea, telling reporters on Monday evening what Gazprom investigators saw after being allowed to inspect the site. “It was an obvious act of terrorism,” Putin explained during a press conference in Sochi, following his meeting with leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. When the September blasts that damaged Nord Stream came up, the Russian president said that Gazprom was allowed to inspect the damage. Sweden had refused to involve Russia in the investigation, citing information “that is subject to confidentiality directly linked to national security.” The blast “tore off” a 40-meter section of the pipe and separated the lines by 250 meters, Putin said, adding there was “a piece bent by 90 degrees and thrown against another part of Nord Stream.” Putin also described accusations in the West that Russia itself might have been behind the blasts as “nonsense.” Moscow has fingered the UK as taking part in “planning, supporting and implementing” the plot to destroy the gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. The defense ministry in London responded by accusing Russia of “peddling false claims of an epic scale” in order to distract from its “disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine.” Since “European partners” have made it difficult for Russia to work with them, Moscow chose Türkiye for the construction of a natural gas hub instead, Putin said, calling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “a man of his word.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,8
2022-10-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/565696-tinkov-citizenship-russia-renounces/,Business mogul renounces Russian citizenship,"Oleg Tinkov, the founder of one of Russia’s largest private banks, has revealed that he has renounced Russian citizenship due to Moscow’s “crazy war” in Ukraine. On Monday, the tycoon shared an English-language copy of a “certificate of the ending of the citizenship of the Russian Federation,” issued in Geneva on October 26, on Instagram. “I can’t and won’t be associated with a fascist country, that started a war with their peaceful neighbor and killing [sic] innocent people daily. It is a shame for me to continue to hold this passport,” Tinkov wrote. He expressed hope that “more prominent Russian businessmen” would follow his lead in order to weaken “Putin’s regime and his economy.” He concluded the post by saying that he hated “Putin’s Russia,” but loved all Russians “who are clearly against this crazy war.” In a Russian version of his statement, Tinkov called himself “a true Russian hero.” Публикация от Oleg Tinkov (@olegtinkov) Unlike the US, Russia doesn’t impose an exit tax on people who renounce their citizenship. Tinkov, who was convicted of tax fraud in 2021 and agreed to pay more than $500 million in penalties, allegedly lied about his net worth to avoid the exit tax when he renounced his US citizenship in 2013. Since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, Tinkov’s fortune has dramatically decreased. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his net worth exceeded $8 billion in November last year. By early March, amid Western sanctions on the Russian banking system, Tinkov’s shares slumped by more than 90% and his fortune shrank to less than $1 billion, according to Forbes. In April, after being subjected to UK sanctions, he sold his family’s share in TSC Group, which controls Tinkoff Bank, to Interros – a company controlled by one of the richest people in Russia, Vladimir Potanin. At the time, Tinkoff Bank, which is considered to be the world's largest digital bank, was not commenting on its founder’s political stance but announced a change of name plan. Tinkov is not the first business mogul to renounce his Russian citizenship. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the co-founder and chief executive officer of the London-based fintech startup Revolut, Nikolay Storonsky, had also cut ties to his homeland. Earlier this month, Moscow-born and California-based billionaire Yuri Milner renounced his Russian citizenship. Several other Russian-born businessmen tried to distance themselves from their native country amid public outrage in the West over the Ukraine conflict and efforts by the US and its allies to seize the assets of so-called oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin. Milner was among at least seven Russian billionaires who asked US-based Forbes magazine to refrain from mentioning their national origins.",0.0,0.0,0.0,5
2022-10-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/565694-partial-mobilization-completed-ministry/,Partial mobilization completed in Russia – MoD,"Russia’s partial mobilization campaign has been completed, the defense ministry annouced on Monday. All military district commanders were ordered to report on the results of the enrollment by November 1, officials added, noting that its points across Russia would now return to their normal work and no further reservists would be called up. “All the measures linked to the call-up… of reservists have been halted,” the ministry said, adding that no draft notices would be issued from now on. The announcement comes as Russia is about to start its regular conscription draft, which was postponed until November 1 because of the mobilization. In addition to their regular functions, the military induction centers will only accept volunteers and those willing to join Russia’s professional armed forces as contract servicemen, the ministry added. Earlier, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said some 13,000 people had volunteered for the armed forces without waiting for summonses. “No additional tasks are planned,” the minister said last week, commenting on potential further call-ups. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the partial mobilization of troops in Russia on September 21. The defense ministry said at the time that it planned to boost the strength of the standing army by some 300,000 people amid the protracted conflict with Ukraine, which Moscow launched in late February. Last week, Shoigu told Putin the mobilization drive had reached the targeted results, with 300,000 reservists drafted as planned. According to the defense minister, 82,000 mobilized troops were sent to the conflict zone. Another 218,000 draftees were getting ready for combat duty at training centers and training grounds, he said at that time. In mid-October, Putin said he expected the enrolment of military reservists to be completed in “approximately” two weeks. Some regions, including the Russian capital of Moscow, filled their mobilization quotas early. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced an end to the capital’s enrollment efforts on October 17, adding that the city had completed its plan for calling-up military reservists.",0.0,0.0,0.0,2
2022-10-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/565692-grain-deal-gate-closed/,Russia closes Black Sea ‘grain corridor’,"The Russian military has shut the so-called “grain corridor” used to ship Ukrainian agriculture products through the Black Sea. The move was provoked by the actions of Kiev, which has used the route to launch attacks, the Russian Defense Ministry explained, on Monday. The announcement follows a Ukrainian drone offensive, in the early hours of Saturday morning, which damaged some Russian ships used to police the Black Sea. Moscow has blamed the UK for the incident, near Sevastopol, and said a British Navy unit masterminded operations from the port of Ochakov. London has dismissed the accusation. “Any navigation through the security corridor designated under the Black Sea [grain shipment] initiative will be halted until the situation around the Ukrainian … terrorist attack on the military and civilian vessels in Sevastopol is cleared up,” the Russian Defense Ministry outlined in a statement. Officials also said that Kiev had specifically committed not to use the corridor for military purposes. At the same time, it maintained that Russia is not withdrawing from the deal but only suspending it for an indefinite period of time. Earlier on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia was ready to compensate for the missing Ukrainian grain exports to the poorer nations from its own stocks. He also warned that the grain deal has become “much more risky, dangerous” now since Russia cannot guarantee maritime security in the waters of the designated grain corridor. Russia is “still in contact” with other parties, including the UN and Türkiye, Peskov said, adding, however, that Moscow was not ready to be talked into resuming its participation in the deal. A dozen ships carrying Ukrainian grain were cleared to leave Turkish ports earlier on Monday. The Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul agreed on a plan to inspect a further 40 vessels, despite Moscow’s decision to suspend the deal.

2022-10-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/565651-lieberman-israel-ukraine-mirotvorets/,Israeli finance minister added to Kiev’s ‘kill list’,"Israeli finance minister, Avigdor Lieberman has been added to the controversial Mirotvorets website “enemies of Ukraine” database on Sunday. The authors of the site, which is believed to have links to the Ukrainian security services, described Lieberman as an “agent of influence” for Russia, who had been manipulating publicly significant information in favor of Moscow. They also blamed him for taking part in acts of “humanitarian aggression” against Ukraine. Among the actions that led to Lieberman being placed on the list, were his refusal to finance an Israeli field hospital in Ukraine in March and his neutral stance on who is to blame for the massacre in the Kiev suburb of Bucha in April. The website also shared a link to an article, claiming that he had ties with Russian gas giant Gazprom. Ukrainian authorities have frequently expressed their disappointment with the level of support they’ve been getting from Israel during the conflict with Russia. The country has only provided Kiev with humanitarian aid and life-saving defense equipment, but not weapons and munitions. Israel also refrained from joining international sanctions on Moscow. Last week, Liberman said that Israeli assistance to Ukraine since the outbreak of the fighting between Russia and Ukraine in late February amounted to some $40 million. Liberman has been finance minister since 2021. He’s a veteran politician, who has occupied various high positions in the Israeli government over the years, including foreign minister, defense minister, and deputy PM. The 64-year-old is also the head of Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home), which holds seven seats in the country’s parliament, the Knesset. Liberman was born in Chisinau, Moldova when the republic was part of the Soviet Union and immigrated to Israel in 1978. The Mirotvorets website, translated as ‘peacemaker’, was launched in 2014, positioning itself as an independent database run by anonymous moderators to help Ukrainian authorities and “special services” apprehend pro-Russian terrorists, separatists, and war criminals, among others. However, some have branded the database a ‘kill list,’ which is backed by the government, after several individuals, including writer Oles Buzina, politician Oleg Kalashnikov, and Russian journalist Darya Dugina were assassinated shortly after their profiles appeared on the website. The most recent high-profile additions to Mirotvorets included Kazakhstan's president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters. There were claims that the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, was put on the database in mid-October, but swiftly removed from it. The alleged addition happened after Musk offered a peace plan, which envisaged Kiev giving up territories to Moscow.",0.0,0.0,0.0,5
2022-10-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/565654-food-grain-deal-un/,‘Food must flow’ – UN grain deal chief,"Amir Abdulla, the UN coordinator for the Black Sea grain initiative, has insisted that civilian cargo vessels should never be military targets. Moscow pulled out of the scheme, which was mediated by the UN and Türkiye in July, after a Ukrainian attack on the port of Sevastopol. “Civilian cargo ships can never be a military target or held hostage. The food must flow,” the UN official tweeted on Monday. On Sunday, the Joint Coordination Center (JCC) in Istanbul announced that UN, Turkish and Ukrainian officials had given the green light to 16 ships for navigation along the corridor for October 31. Russia was informed about the decision, it said. According to maritime traffic data, at least two ships left the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odessa in the morning, reporting Istanbul as their destination. The Russian Defense Ministry announced on Saturday that it was suspending its participation in the arrangement after an aerial and sea drone attack on the Crimean port of Sevastopol, which it attributed to Ukraine. The Ukrainian military used the corridor designated for passage of food transports during the attack, the ministry claimed. One of the drones may have been deployed from a civilian vessel previously hired to haul cargo under the scheme, it added. Moscow has long complained about the implementation of the agreement, stating that grain shipped out of Ukraine was predominantly going to rich European nations rather than countries hit most by surging food prices. It also blamed the UN for failing to secure relief from Western sanctions, which are hampering Russian exports of food and fertilizers. Moscow proposed donating some of the products to the needy for free. On Saturday, Russian Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev said the country was ready to send the world’s poorest nations up to 500,000 tons of grain within the next four months. Before the deal was reached, Kiev and its foreign supporters accused the Russian government of putting people in poor nations at risk of hunger by allegedly blocking exports of grain via the Black Sea. Moscow denied the claim and said civilian traffic was free to go, as far as Russia was concerned, and blamed sea mines deployed by Ukraine for putting ships at risk. The terms of the deal agreed with Türkiye and the UN includes several security provisions, including inspections by experts of the JCC for the possible smuggling of weapons.",1.634262067829597,2.1571113366857118,-0.5228492688561148,7
2022-10-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/565639-ukraine-missile-attacks-energy/,Airstrikes on critical infrastructure reported across Ukraine,"Officials in Ukraine reported Russian attacks on critical infrastructure on Monday, with one claiming that some 40 missiles had been detected in the air. Moscow insisted that all targets had been successfully hit. All Ukrainian regions sounded the alarm in the morning, with the media reporting explosions in several parts of the country, including the capital Kiev. Anton Gerashchenko, an aide to the interior minister, urged people to take cover in shelters, claiming on social media that “at the moment, there are already 40 [Russian] missiles” incoming at targets in the country. Some hits have been confirmed by regional officials. Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko reported that strikes on the capital had caused a partial blackout and disrupted the water supply. He said that due to damage to energy infrastructure, some 350,000 apartments were without power, while around 80% of consumers didn’t have water. Kharkov Mayor Igor Terekhov, said there were two airstrikes, which targeted a “critical infrastructure site.” The city’s metro system also suspended work. Igor Taburets, the head of the Cherkasy regional administration, reported an attack on critical infrastructure too, adding that it had caused a partial blackout. His counterpart in Vinnitsa Region, Sergey Bozov, claimed that one missile was intercepted and “fell on civilian sites.” A report on social media, claimed a transformer station serving the Dnieper hydropower plant in the city of Zaporozhye had been hit. Footage purportedly shot near the station’s dam showed black smoke billowing into the sky. Local authorities, loyal to Kiev, confirmed the strike and warned of possible blackouts, but offered no details. Russia started targeting Ukrainian energy sites earlier this month. President Vladimir Putin justified the change of tactic by what he described as Kiev’s ‘sabotage’ attacks on critical Russian infrastructure. The final straw was the deadly bombing of the Crimean Bridge, he said. Ukrainian officials confirmed significant damage to the national energy system. Grid operator Ukrenergy introduced rolling blackouts in many regions, stating that reduced consumption was necessary to avoid a total collapse. Kirill Tymoshenko, the deputy head of President Vladimir Zelensky’s office, previously announced that starting this week the outages would become “regular, not an emergency response,” calling the situation difficult.",3.862301558669745,4.279386973476867,-0.4170854148071217,0

The news came on a day when Moscow saw its first snowfall of the season. “There were several minor accidents involving 54 cars, a motorcycle, and a Moscow city bus. As a result, according to updated data, five people were injured, one of them a child,” the agency's source said. Two people have been hospitalized, according to TASS. RIA Novosti’s source in the capital police said that about 20 cars were involved in a road accident, while the agency’s source in the emergency services said the number of affected vehicles could be as high as 50. The Moscow state traffic inspectorate has not specified the number of cars involved but confirmed the incident took place on the overpass on Ryabinovaya street and that “several vehicles were damaged.” Two people “sought medical attention,” according to the authority.

One of them ended up in a hospital after suffering a heart attack following a brutal police detention. Valery Klimenco, the honorary leader of the opposition Shor Party, was among the politicians, who were leading a thousands-strong column of demonstrators through central Chisinau on Sunday, when the law enforcement blocked the roads to prevent it from moving further, according to the media reports. Videos that surfaced on social media show several officers brutally snatching Klimenco, 69, away from the crowd and dragging him to a police van. The politician tried to resist the police but was quickly overpowered by the officers. Another politician, Sergey Burgudji, sought to aid Klimenko but was pushed away by the police, who refused to let him accompany the elderly politician to the police office. The officers then dragged Klimenko to another police vehicle. According to a Moldovan MP, Vadim Fotescu, Klimenco felt unwell at the police station and was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. Fortescu told journalists that the politician was ""recovering"" but otherwise provided few details about his condition. Klimenco is also a local MP in Chisinau and the head of the ‘Congress of the Russian Communities of the Moldova Republic’ – a civic movement positioning itself as the defender of the interests of the Russian population in Moldova. Klimenco was not the only politician detained on Sunday. The law enforcement also arrested Dinu Turcanu, another Shor Party member and the head of Moldova’s central Orhei region, his deputy and the Orhei city mayor, according to TASS news agency. According to the police, around 40 people were detained during the protests. Footage published by Ruptly video news agency shows uniformed officers and those in plain clothes kicking a man whose hands are twisted behind their backs. Another protester can be seen being thrown to the ground by several officers, who snatched him out of the crowd. Moldova has seen weeks of massive protests organized by the opposition slamming President Maia Sandu’s austerity policies. The opposition demands that the government provide financial assistance to citizens to ease the burden of rising energy and gas prices, which have increased by almost seven times since last year, according to the media. The Sunday rally was particularly organized by the Shor Party and the Moldovan Communists. The protesters were chanting: ""Early elections!"" ""Resign!"" ""No to dictatorship!"" and ""Shame!"" The opposition also demands the resignation of Sandu’s government and early elections amid the continued economic hardships. The government has so far reacted by restricting the rules for holding protests. Rallies are only allowed to take place on the weekends, and any action can last no longer than four hours under the new regulations. In mid-October, the police also demolished a tent camp set up by the protesters outside of the parliament building in mid-September. The developments come as Europe struggles to cope with the ongoing energy crunch, partly caused by the EU’s campaign to phase out Russian energy exports. In June, Moldova received EU candidate status.",2.6736865549650846,4.094007309578545,-1.4203207546134609,4
2022-10-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/565626-israel-weapons-ukraine-us/,Ukraine wants US to pressure Israel,"The United States should persuade Israel to provide military assistance to Kiev, Ukrainian Ambassador to Tel Aviv Evgeny Korniychuk has said. In an interview with The Hill newspaper, published on Sunday, Korniychuk claimed that, as the US is “the only country that Israel is listening to,” Washington should also ensure that its close ally abides by Western sanctions on Russia. Revealing that he meets with the US ambassador to Israel on a weekly basis, Korniychuk jokingly referred to Tom Nides as a “secret weapon” in his campaign to push Israel out of its neutral status. “This is why we discuss the different measures of support, and again, we need to change this major trend that makes Israel’s position different from the rest of the democratic world, and have more military technical cooperation,” he said. The Ukrainian ambassador admitted that there has been some “positive development” in relations with Israel, which recently offered his country a missile warning system. However, Ukraine is expecting “more from Israel, of course,” he said. He expressed hope that alleged military ‘collaboration’ between Russia and Iran in Ukraine – something that both countries have been denying – would make Israel change its stance on arms supplies. Korniychuk’s remarks came less than a week after Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, citing “the operational limitations,” made it clear to his Ukrainian counterpart Alexey Reznikov that Israel “will not provide weapon systems to Ukraine.” However, Israel is prepared to continue supplying Kiev with humanitarian aid and life-saving defense equipment, Gantz said. Russia, meanwhile, has been consistently warning the West against “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons, explaining that it would only prolong the conflict and cause unnecessary casualties. Korniychuk revealed that the second most important issue for him, after getting military assistance from Israel, is to ensure that Israel enforces anti-Russia restrictions. While Tel Aviv doesn’t have its own sanctions legislation, its government said the country “is doing everything it can” in order to be part of the international sanctions effort. “The issue of sanctions is also important and the Americans are in a much better position to check whether the Israelis are following those sanctions or not,” Korniychuk said. A Treasury Department spokesperson told The Hill that it works “closely” with its partners, including Israeli, “to cut off avenues” for Russia to evade sanctions.",3.035612477822126,2.955528001809824,0.08008447601230184,8

Europeans are already suffering from anti-Russia sanctions “many times more than the US,” he said in an interview published on Sunday. “There is a growing number of economists, not only in our country, but also in the West, who come to a conclusion that the US goal is to completely ‘bleed’ and deindustrialize the European economy,” he said. “It is also in Washington’s interests to weaken Europe militarily. To constantly keep it under pressure, to force it to pump weapons into Ukraine, and in return fill the EU countries’ arms depots with American supplies,” Lavrov said. In pursuing such a policy, Washington has been guided by “economic, purely selfish calculations, as well as by ideological complexes of superiority,” he suggested. Earlier this month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Americans were making “crazy money” by selling gas to European states at exorbitant prices against a backdrop of EU sanctions on Russian energy supplies. He said this would inevitably lead to the “deindustrialization” of the EU which, in turn, will have “very, very deplorable consequences” for the bloc “over the next 10 to 20 years.” In the wake of sweeping sanctions the EU imposed on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, gas prices have surged. The bloc is now struggling with the prospect of energy shortages in winter and soaring inflation. Brussels has largely followed Washington’s stance of seeking to weaken Moscow by imposing sanctions, while supporting Kiev through weapons supplies and financial aid.",2.9562265820013347,1.9003149732852174,1.0559116087161173,8
2022-10-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/565623-crimea-drone-attack-grain-corridor/,New details emerge of Ukrainian attack on Crimea,"Those behind a major drone attack on the Russian naval base in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol made active use of a UN-brokered Black Sea grain corridor, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement after studying the wreckage of the unmanned combat vehicles. The ministry’s specialists retrieved the navigational modules of the drones destroyed by the Russian warships and naval aviation, the statement said, adding that the Canadian-made devices stored data on the vehicles’ path to their target. Most of them were launched from the Ukrainian Black Sea coast, not far from the port city of Odessa, the Russian military said. “The naval drones were then moving within the security zone of the grain corridor before changing course and heading towards the Russian naval base in Sevastopol,” the statement said. Navigational data from at least one naval drone shows that it was launched from a sea location within the grain corridor security zone, the ministry added. According to Russian specialists, it might have been launched from a civilian vessel chartered by Ukraine or its “western backers” to transport Ukrainian agricultural produce. Saturday’s assault, which involved nine aerial and seven naval drones, targeted vessels of the Russian Black Sea Fleet docked in Sevastopol. It was repelled, with just one ship suffering minor damage, according to the ministry. According to Moscow, the Russian ships that were targeted by the Ukrainian drones had been involved in providing security for the “grain corridor,” which was set up to allow exports of Ukrainian food products through the Black Sea as part of a deal negotiated in Istanbul between Moscow and Kiev with UN and Turkish mediation this summer. The attack prompted Russia to indefinitely suspend its participation in the deal, a move that has sparked an angry reaction from the US. Russia blamed Kiev for the attack, which it claimed was “carried out under the supervision of British experts.” Kiev has been reluctant to claim responsibility for the assault. Andrey Yermak, the head of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s office, took to Telegram to accuse Russia of “making up terrorist acts at its facilities.” On Sunday, the New York Times reported that it was Ukrainian forces that launched Saturday’s attack, citing an unnamed Ukrainian official.",2.766966842704026,3.0337230238864805,-0.26675618118245437,0
2022-10-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/565617-russia-talks-ukraine-impossible/,Kremlin outlines why solo talks with Ukraine are ‘impossible’,"Russia is open to negotiations over Ukraine, but any agreement with Kiev would have little credibility because it could be rescinded by the West, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday. This means that any possible settlement should be primarily discussed with the US, he added. A unilateral diplomatic engagement with Ukraine is unlikely to succeed because “the deciding vote rests with Washington,” the spokesman told Rossiya-1 TV channel. “It’s just impossible to discuss something, for example, with Kiev,” he stated. According to Peskov, while Russia could try to reach some agreements with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, “based on what happened in March, these agreements are worthless, because they can be instantly canceled upon orders” from outside actors. The Kremlin press secretary was referring to several rounds of talks that took place in late February and March after Russia launched its military operation against the neighboring state. At the time, these diplomatic efforts failed to cease hostilities. Meanwhile, Peskov signaled that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready for talks over Ukraine. “The president has repeatedly said he is open to the negotiation process… Whether they are ready or not, but the West should know and hear this,” Peskov reiterated. The official also suggested that Putin and US President Joe Biden could hold negotiations if Washington is willing to take heed of Moscow’s security concerns that were outlined by the Russian Foreign Ministry in the draft documents on security guarantees released in mid-December last year prior to the Ukraine conflict. Earlier this month, Zelensky signed a decree on Ukraine officially rejecting peace talks with the Russian president. The move came just hours after Putin signed agreements on the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions joining Russia following referendums that saw overwhelming public support for the move. At the time, Moscow maintained that it is still ready to look for a negotiated solution to the conflict, adding, however, that “it takes two parties to negotiate.”",4.234977361429982,2.751167543971249,1.4838098174587326,8
2022-10-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/565614-russia-nuclear-submarine-test/,Russia tests new nuclear submarine – Navy chief,"Russia is conducting a trial run of a new strategic nuclear submarine, the Navy commander in chief announced on Sunday, at a time of heightened tensions with the West. “The newest nuclear-powered strategic missile undersea cruiser Generalissimo Suvorov is being tested,” Admiral Nikolay Yevmenov said, speaking on the 326th anniversary of the Russian Regular Navy’s establishment. The Navy chief said the submarine was built at the Sevmash enterprise, Russia’s largest shipbuilding facility, in the northern city of Severodvinsk. The ‘Generalissimo Suvorov’ is the sixth vessel of Russia’s 4th generation ballistic missile submarines and the second mass-produced ship of the upgraded Borei-A class. Each Borei-A vessel can carry up to 16 Bulava-class submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which could be armed with nuclear warheads. The boat was named after the 18th century general Alexander Suvorov, who is considered one of the greatest military commanders in Russian history. Yevmenov went on to say that the Russian Navy is being reinforced by other state-of-the-art new ships, including the ‘Ufa’ diesel-electric submarine, which “has successfully passed official testing.” The vessel, which is intended for the Russian Pacific Fleet, is expected to be formally accepted by the Navy next month, he stated. Submarines of this type are armed with ‘Kalibr’ cruise missiles. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin personally oversaw nuclear strike drills involving Moscow’s land, sea, and aviation deterrence forces. This military activity coincided with similar exercises conducted by NATO, named ‘Steadfast Noon.' The bloc’s nuclear drills, which are set to last until October 30, are taking place over Belgium, the North Sea and the UK. Despite high tensions between Russia and the West, NATO described the exercises as “routine” and “not linked to any current world events.” In the context of the Ukraine conflict, Putin recently vowed that Russia would use “all the means available to us” to defend its people and territory, a statement that Washington and its NATO allies have interpreted as a veiled threat to deploy nuclear weapons. However, several Russian senior officials insisted that Moscow is not threatening anyone with its nuclear arsenal.",3.5672279734352093,2.4579399940721935,1.1092879793630157,0
2022-10-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/565528-100-year-path-history/,"How Lenin's Bolsheviks placed Russia's new regions on a collision course with Ukraine, 100 years ago","When four formerly Ukrainian regions joined Russia nearly a month ago, the collective West tried to present the occurrence as treacherous, unprecedented, and lacking local support. However, the reunification was preceded by a century-long struggle by a large amount of the regions’ inhabitants for the right to be considered Russians. In February 2015, the deputies of the parliament of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) signed a memorandum declaring the continuity of their statehood from the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic, one of the numerous entities that emerged during the Russian Civil War. This quasi-state, which was created by the Bolsheviks in 1918 and aspired to become part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), included not only Donbass, but also the Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions. History may zigzag, but time puts everything in its place. Today, Russian Donbass is restoring lost ties with Russia and establishing new ones,” wrote Denis Pushilin, the head of the DPR, shortly before the start of Russia’s military offensive. In this article, RT explores the brief history of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic and explains why the residents of Donbass wanted to live as part of Russia even 100 years ago. Back in 1999, the famous Russian political geographer and theorist Vladimir Kagansky wrote a large article entitled ‘Ukraine: Geography and Fate of the Country’, in which he made a forecast: Ukraine will inevitably transform, and this transformation mainly depends on Russia. He concluded that its self-determination would inevitably be anti-Russian, citing the country’s “stretchable borders” as one of the main reasons. At a minimum, this would encompass just the right bank of the Dnieper, or even Galicia alone. At a maximum, the borders would stretch to the southern Russian cities of Voronezh and Stavropol. “The USSR and the CIS are a semi-empire of republics around Russia, and Ukraine is the main link in this necklace, a geopolitical pendant. Ukraine divides the space of the former USSR into separate, geographically separated blocks, and connects three blocks (Belarus and the Baltic States – Moldova – the Caucasus). Ukraine is the only alternative to Russia as the center of the current CIS and the entire post-Soviet space. It is the only way to potentially bypass Russia – the main anti-Russian bastion, and Russia’s main partner in the arrangement of this space,” wrote Kagansky. In other words, Ukraine is a crossroads of borders, where the main civilizational frontier divides the country roughly in half. This is mainly due to the historical formation of Ukraine. Its entire territory was once part of other, now neighboring countries, as well as independent principalities, and represented the core of individual countries – not only of Kievan Rus, but also the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Moreover, the regions in present-day Ukraine were united for the first time relatively recently – only after the Second World War. At that time, a number of cities and industrial zones were created as parts of a single Soviet space. When Ukraine finally became fully independent, its authorities faced the task of blending together regions (fragments of the former USSR) that differed in terms of culture, ethnic makeup, and religion. Nevertheless, the Orange Revolution of 2004 and then Euromaidan of 2014 demonstrated that the country remained split into macro-regions. After the ‘Revolution of Dignity’, as it was dubbed by supporters of the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovich, mass anti-Maidan protests erupted in the Russian-speaking southeastern regions, whose borders demark the historical and cultural territory of Novorossiya. The subsequent attempt of the post-coup authorities to enforce a radical shift in cultural and linguistic policy led to the loss of Crimea and an armed conflict in Donbass, as well as the further marginalization of the Russia-leaning southeastern part of the country. It was this region that Canadian historian Orest Subtelny singled out back in the 1980s. The results of his ethnolinguistic research on the distribution of native speakers of the Russian and Ukrainian languages in Ukraine showed a stable line that divides the country into two parts with different cultural, linguistic, and, as it turned out, ideological preferences. Russian Ukraine encompasses territories that were never part of the historical Ukraine. These lands include the northern Black Sea region, which was conquered from the Turks and Tatars during the reign of Catherine II; what is known as Sloboda Ukraine, which had been a part of Russia since 1503; Donbass, with part of the territory of the former Province of the Don Cossack Host; and also Crimea. One of the main macro-regions, which included the former Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye, and Kherson Regions that recently joined Russia, is made up of the historical territories of Novorossiya. These were annexed to the Russian Empire as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars in the second half of the 18th century. Novorossiysk Province (later called Novorossiysk Region) first appeared as an administrative unit in the 1760s. At various times, it included the Yekaterinoslav, Taurida, Kherson, and Bessarabia Provinces, as well as territories in modern Russia – the Kuban Region, the Black Sea and Stavropol Provinces, and the Province of the Don Cossack Host. After the October Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks incorporated most of the lands of Novorossiya into the Ukrainian SSR, and the term ‘Novorossiya’ itself was banned. Nevertheless, even among the Bolsheviks, there was serious disagreement as to the territorial arrangement of Soviet Ukraine because some of the regions, most of which became part of Russia in 2022, already gravitated towards the RSFSR. From April 25 to May 6, 1917, the 1st Congress of Soviets of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog region was held in Kharkov at which the executive committee and system of the region’s district councils were formed. By that time, Donetsk Region had already become the most problematic for Ukraine. Economically, it was connected with the Great Russian core, supplying the latter mainly with coal and other minerals. The population was heavily mixed, with a predominance of former peasants that had come to the area from central Russia to work in the factories. This was also evident in the party’s geographic concentration: of the 51,000 Bolsheviks who lived in what was the territory of modern Ukraine prior to the Maidan Revolution, 31,000 were in the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog basin, and another 5,000 in Crimea. The fact is that before the revolution, the Donetsk coal basin was located in two administrative regions: the Kharkov Province and the Don Cossack Region. After the February Revolution of 1917, the autonomous Central Rada of Ukraine incorporated Kharkov Province into an autonomous Ukraine, proclaiming independence on January 25, 1918. However, the power of the Central Rada never extended to the territory of Donbass. In December 1917, the creation of the Ukrainian SSR was proclaimed in Kharkov. At the same time, detachments of Ataman Alexey Kaledin’s Don Cossacks entered the territory of Donbass, including Kharkov Province, but were defeated by the Red Guard in January-February 1918 and left. Meanwhile, the external situation was deteriorating. In Brest-Litovsk (modern Brest in Belarus), the German Empire recognized the Central Rada of Ukraine and signed a peace treaty with it according to which the Germans and Austrians could bring their troops into the territory of Ukraine “to maintain order.” The Austro-German occupation had begun. According to the Brest Treaty, the Bolsheviks had no right to interfere in events in Ukraine. However, the workers of Donbass were not going to obey the Ukrainian nationalists or Germans. In response, on February 12, 1918, at the 4th Regional Congress of Soviets of Workers’ Deputies of the Donetsk and Krivoy Rog basins held in Kharkov, the Donetsk Republic was proclaimed, and it was emphasized that it was part of Russia. The chief ideologue behind the move, ‘Comrade Artyom’ (Fedor Sergeev), sent a telegram to the head of the Central Executive Committee, Yakov Sverdlov, on the same day, announcing: “The Regional Congress of Soviets has adopted a resolution on the creation of the Council of People’s Commissars of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog basin as part of the All-Russian Federation of Soviets.” Sverdlov’s answer was brief: “We consider isolation harmful,” by which he meant separating from Soviet Ukraine. Although initiatives to unite the Donetsk and Krivoy Rog coal basins into one administrative and economic structure existed at the beginning of the 20th century, they were rejected at the government level, as this would have led to an increase in the imbalance between the southern regions of the Russian Empire. However, after the October Revolution of 1917, the autonomist movement in the Donbass began to gain strength, despite the emphatic rejection of this idea by the central authorities. In particular, Vladimir Lenin repeatedly insisted that Ukraine should be united. The most intriguing issue here is the territory of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic, the borders of which, as was the case with most short-lived “states” that emerged during the Civil War, were not clearly delineated. However, Comrade Artyom, the main ideologue of the fledgling republic, repeatedly insisted that it encompassed what would be the Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, and Zaporozhye Regions of modern-day Ukraine, together with parts of its Kharkov, Sumy, Kherson, and Nikolaev Regions, as well as a part of Russia’s Rostov Region: “Just a few months ago… the eastern borders of Ukraine were established right along the line which was and still is the western border of our republic. The western borders of the Kharkov and Yekaterinoslav Governorates, including the parts of the Krivoy Rog district and Kherson Governorate which are covered by railways and the districts of the Taurida Governorate above the Isthmus of Perekop have always been and still are the western borders of our republic. The Sea of Azov all the way to Taganrog and the borders of the Soviet coal-mining districts of the Don Region along the railway line connecting Rostov and Voronezh up to Likhaya Station, the western borders of the Voronezh Governorate and the southern borders of the Kursk Governorate complete the borders of our republic.” Interestingly, Comrade Artyom, a Bolshevik, is citing the agreements reached on July 15, 1917, by Mikhail Tereshchenko, a minister of the Russian Provisional Government, and the Central Rada of Ukraine. Those talks were not coordinated with the central government, the results disappointed both Kiev and Petrograd, and the agreements were never ratified, which means the borders Comrade Artyom is referring to are nothing more than hypothetical. Kharkov, which used to be the capital of Soviet Ukraine, was chosen as the seat of the government of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic. Another thing to be aware of is that, according to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Ukrainian People’s Republic (UPR) officially discontinued its participation in World War I and was promised military assistance to free its territory from Soviet Russian troops. The Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Republic was thus doomed as it would have been a part of the UPR by default. Yet, no substantial action was taken to eliminate the Soviet Ukrainian republics, five of which were technically in existence at the time (the Ukrainian, Odessa, Don, Donetsk, and Crimean). Soviet Russia signed its own Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers on March 3, effectively confirming the UPR boundaries set in the ‘Ukrainian’ Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Donetsk–Krivoy Rog was not an independent state and essentially reported to two different governments, that of Soviet Russia (the All-Russian Central Executive Committee) and the Central Executive Committee of Ukraine. However, the need to make swift decisions to combat counterrevolution led the Council of People’s Commissars of Donetsk–Krivoy Rog to establish its own independent General Staff with a mandate to coordinate the patchwork of Red Guard squads active in Donbass (one of those squads was led by a young pipe fitter named Nikita Khrushchev). Tensions kept rising, which prompted the Donetsk commissars to address workers in early March with the following plea: “The enemy has come very close and is beginning to threaten the Donets Basin. Dispatch all armed units to Kharkov immediately.” On March 8, an emergency meeting was convened in Kharkov to draw up a defense plan, where a mobilization campaign was launched. Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, the head of Soviet Ukraine at the time, proposed a “military union of the Soviet Republics of the South,” which would bring disparate military forces under unified command. On March 16, the Council of People’s Commissars of Donetsk–Krivoy Rog issued a “Decree on Military Action,” where it announced the “accession of the republic to the South Russia Military Union for the purposes of jointly fighting German occupation.” Only three days later, on March 19, the Second All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in Yekaterinoslav (present-day Dnepr) decided to unite all quasi-states on Ukrainian territory as the Ukrainian People’s Republic of Soviets. This effectively spelt the end of the Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Republic, although documents signed by its Council of People’s Commissars continued to be issued until May. Initially, Russia’s central government was in favor of an independent Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic, which it hoped would prevent the Germans and Austrians from advancing into this territory under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which the UPR had signed first. Curiously, just a few days later, Lenin changed tack. In a letter to the then-provisional commissar extraordinary for the Ukraine area Sergo Ordzhonikidze dated February 14, 1918, Lenin wrote: “Immediate evacuation of grain and metals to the east, the creation of insurgency groups, the establishment of a unified front of defense from Crimea to Great Russia, and a decisive and unconditional restructuring of our forces in Ukraine in the Ukrainian fashion – these are the tasks at hand… As for the Donetsk Republic, tell our comrades… that, as much as they may contrive to carve their region out of Ukraine, it will still, based on [secretary of internal affairs of the UPR Vladimir] Vinnichenko’s geography, be included in Ukraine, and the Germans will attempt to conquer it. Given that, it would be absolutely ridiculous for the Donetsk Republic to refuse to join a unified front of defense together with the rest of Ukraine.” According to Lenin’s plan, the high percentage of Bolsheviks in Donbass (60% of their total number in Ukraine) was going to serve as both the catalyst for the fight against the Germans and, later, as the main conduit for Bolshevik policies in the whole of Ukraine. Ultimately, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) held on March 15, 1918, decided to “consider the Donets Basin as a part of Ukraine.” That, however, did not save Donbass from being occupied by the Germans in April–May 1918. The Red Army recaptured Donbass in the winter of 1918–1919, but the Soviet leadership did not reinstate the Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Republic, instead keeping the region within Soviet Ukraine as the key proletarian counterweight to the largely peasant Ukrainian population. They did not stop at the part of Donbass formerly belonging to the Kharkov Governorate and endowed the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic with a region in the south that they took from the Province of the Don Cossack Host. By 1920, Soviet Ukraine contained the whole of Donbass and the port of Taganrog on the Sea of Azov. That redrawing of borders could not be explained by ethnic motives. Even though the majority of people living around Taganrog were Little Russians (Ukrainians), the Donbass proletariat was mostly of Great Russian origin and represented a balanced cross section of Russia’s general population. The only reason for giving Donbass to Ukraine was its status as a major industrial powerhouse in the south of Russia. Had it remained in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic would have been an almost exclusively agrarian region without a sizeable proletarian population. At that time, the Bolsheviks were skeptical about peasants, especially well-to-do ones, as most Ukrainian farmers had been prior to the revolution. Lumping Donbass together with Ukraine was an attempt to have a loyal class in the nascent republic. In 1925, a small part of Donbass with the towns of Shakhty and Kamensk, as well as Taganrog were given back to the RSFSR and the current Russian-Ukrainian border was established. However, most of Donbass, including the major cities of Yuzovka (Donetsk) and Lugansk, remained in the Ukrainian SSR so that it could have at least some industrial production of its own. Eventually, the Bolsheviks merged the coal-mining regions of Donbass first into the Donetsk Governorate and then into the Stalino Region, which later split into the Donetsk and Lugansk Regions.",4.7026069645825235,4.89222900883887,-0.1896220442563461,2
2022-10-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/565613-crimea-drone-ukraine-nyt/,Ukraine behind drone attack in Crimea – NYT,"The New York Times newspaper has said Ukraine was behind a massive but unsuccessful drone attack on the port city of Sevastopol in Crimea on Saturday, despite officials in Kiev refusing to claim responsibility for the incident. The Russian Defense Ministry has also blamed the “terrorist attack” on Ukraine, saying Kiev’s forces carried it out under the supervision of British experts. The assault, which involved nine aerial and seven naval drones, targeted the vessels of the Russian Black Sea Fleet docked in Sevastopol. It was repelled, with just one ship suffering minor damage, according to the ministry. The Ukrainian authorities have been reluctant to acknowledge their responsibility for the attack. Andrey Yermak, the head of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s office, took to Telegram to accuse Russia of “making up terrorist acts at its facilities.” On Saturday, the NYT dedicated an article to new attack capabilities allegedly obtained by Kiev during the conflict with Russia, saying that those “were on display in the predawn hours of Saturday when Ukrainian drones hit a Russian vessel docked in the Black Sea Fleet’s home port of Sevastopol.” In another article, the outlet pointed out the Ukrainian authorities “have maintained a policy of official ambiguity about strikes behind the front lines.” However, it said the attack on Sevastopol “appeared to be the most recent example of Ukrainian forces striking sensitive Russian sites from afar, illustrating how homemade drones and powerful weapons provided by Western nations have given the Ukrainians abilities that only the Russians had early in the war.” The paper then cited an unnamed senior Ukrainian official, who claimed that the Russian minesweeper ‘Ivan Golubtsov’ had been severely damaged in the drone assault, while another vessel, the frigate ‘Admiral Makarov’, received minor, easily repairable damage. According to Moscow, the Russian ships that were targeted by the Ukrainian drones had been involved in providing security for the “grain corridor,” which was set up to allow exports of Ukrainian food products from the Black Sea ports in line with a deal reached between Moscow and Kiev with UN and Turkish mediation in the summer. The attack has prompted Russia to indefinitely suspend its participation in the pact, which caused an angry reaction from US President Joe Biden, who said the move was “purely outrageous” and that it would “increase starvation.” Moscow’s ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov responded to Biden by saying that the really “outrageous” fact was that Washington again refrained from condemning “the reckless actions of the Kiev regime.” Antonov also rejected “insinuations” that Russia was causing global starvation, noting that Moscow had repeatedly highlighted the importance of supplying the poorest countries with agricultural goods. On Saturday, Russian Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev said Moscow was ready to supply up to 500,000 tons of grain to poor nations for free in the next four months, with assistance from Türkiye.",2.904806392040537,2.381995957707503,0.5228104343330342,0
2022-10-30,https://www.rt.com/news/565611-russia-talks-biden-putin/,Kremlin reveals possible basis for Putin-Biden talks,"Potential talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Joe Biden would depend on Washington’s willingness to hear Moscow’s security concerns, the Kremlin press secretary said on Sunday. Speaking to the Rossiya-1 TV channel, Dmitry Peskov said high-level re-engagement could happen if the United States “pays heed to our concerns.” It would be contingent on “the US desire to go back to the state of things as of December-January and ask the question: what the Russians are offering may not suit all of us, but maybe we should still sit down with them at the negotiating table?” The spokesman explained that he was referring to the draft documents on security guarantees that Moscow submitted to both Brussels and Washington before the Ukraine conflict broke out in late February. In mid-December last year, the Russian Foreign Ministry published the drafts of two treaties – one with the US and one with NATO – with a list of Moscow’s security demands, in a bid to lower tensions in Europe. At the time, Russia wanted the West to ban Ukraine from entering NATO and limit the deployment of troops and weapons on the bloc’s eastern flank. It also insisted that the military alliance retreat to its borders as of 1997, before it expanded eastwards. While neither the US nor NATO gave written responses to Russia’s proposals, they both rebuffed Moscow’s demand that Ukraine should be barred from the bloc. Earlier this month, Putin said he saw no need for talks with his US counterpart, explaining that “there is no platform for any negotiations yet.” The statement was echoed by the White House, which stated that Joe Biden does not plan to meet with the Russian leader at the G20 summit next month, despite earlier refusing to rule out the possibility. The last time the two leaders met in person was in June 2021 in Geneva, Switzerland. The talks were followed up by a virtual summit in December, with Ukraine being one of the topics on the agenda.",1.8055689417605396,2.582418889610159,-0.7768499478496194,8
2022-10-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/565601-russia-grain-deal-suspension-criticism/,Moscow responds to criticism over grain deal suspension,"Russia’s decision to suspend the grain deal with Ukraine was prompted by Kiev’s reckless actions, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington said on Sunday, while describing Western condemnation of the move as unwarranted. Russia halted its compliance with the agreement, brokered by the UN and Türkiye, after Kiev conducted a major drone attack on ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet involved in securing safe passage for agricultural cargo. Speaking to reporters, Anatoly Antonov said: ""Washington's reaction to the terrorist attack on the port of Sevastopol is truly outrageous,” adding that the US refrained from condemning “the reckless actions of the Kiev regime.” Antonov noted the West’s “complete disregard” of Russia’s allegations that the bombing of Russian ships was organized with the involvement of the British military. The UK Ministry of Defence has denied the accusation. Amid “attacks and provocations against Russian military and merchant vessels involved in the Black Sea Initiative”, Moscow cannot continue operations without paying attention to security issues, Antonov insisted. The envoy also addressed “insinuations” that Russia is causing global starvation, saying Moscow has repeatedly highlighted the importance of supplying the poorest countries with agricultural goods. “However, under the grain scheme, a good half of all dry-cargo carriers went to developed countries. At the same time, Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan and Afghanistan received only about 3% of agricultural products,” he noted. On Saturday, Russia’s Defense Ministry announced that it was suspending the implementation of agreements on the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports, citing a Ukrainian “terror attack” against ships of the Black Sea Fleet and civilian vessels involved in ensuring the security of the grain corridor. US President Joe Biden denounced Moscow’s decision as “purely outrageous,” claiming it would “increase starvation.” “There’s no merit to what they’re doing. The UN negotiated that deal and that should be the end of it,” he said. Meanwhile, commenting on Russia’s decision to suspend the grain deal, Andrey Ermak, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s chief of staff, accused Moscow of “blackmail.” The breakthrough deal between Moscow and Kiev was reached in Istanbul in July with mediation by the UN and Türkiye. It aimed to unlock agricultural exports via the Black Sea from Russia and Ukraine, which had come to halt due to the conflict between the two nations. The deal was praised as critical for easing the global food crisis and helping the world’s poorest nations to avoid starvation. Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, repeatedly accused Western nations of taking over grain exported from Ukraine, instead of allowing it to be delivered to developing countries. Moscow also warned that it could quit the grain deal if an agreement to ease restrictions on its food and fertilizer exports were not implemented.",1.621757116683259,2.81154074621958,-1.1897836295363209,7

Ukraine has been accusing Moscow of using Iranian UAVs to attack Kiev and other cities. The Ukrainian Armed Forces reported the findings on their official channel Military TV UA on Wednesday. They said they took apart an Iranian Mohajer-6 surveillance and combat drone that had made an emergency landing after being hit by the country’s air defenses. “Three quarters of the components are US-made. There are also components from Japan, China, Sweden, and Austria,” a spokesman for the Defense Ministry’s Defense Intelligence (GUR) said. “And there is a component which was made in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky accused Russia this week of deploying Iranian Shahed-136 kamikaze drones, which Moscow allegedly rebranded as Geran-2 (Geranium-2), against Ukraine. Tehran has denied supplying weapons to either side of the conflict. Moscow did not confirm the claims of receiving drones from Iran. Russia has maintained that all weapons used by its troops on the battlefield in Ukraine, including the Geran-2 UAVs, are from domestic stockpiles.

2022-10-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/565588-russia-suspends-grain-deal/,Russia suspends participation in grain deal after Ukrainian attack,"Russia announced on Saturday that it has halted its compliance with a grain deal, brokered by the UN and Türkiye earlier his year. The move came after Ukraine launched a major drone attack on ships involved in securing safe passage for agricultural cargo, the Russian Defense Ministry explained. In a post on its Telegram channel, the ministry said Russia “is suspending its participation in the implementation of agreements on the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports”. It explained that the move was prompted by “a terror attack” against the ships of the Black Sea Fleet and civilian vessels involved in ensuring the security of the grain corridor. The ministry also alleged that the bombing was organized with the involvement of British military. The UK Defence Ministry has denied any involvement in the Ukrainian drone attack on the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, claiming that Moscow “is resorting to peddling false claims of an epic scale” in an effort to distract the global community from “their disastrous handling of the illegal invasion of Ukraine.” “This invented story, says more about arguments going on inside the Russian Government than it does about the West,” it added. Commenting on Russia’s decision to suspend the grain deal, Andrey Ermak, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s chief of staff, accused Moscow of “blackmail.” “Russian blackmail is primitive across the board: blackmail in nuclear, energy and food field,” he stated, adding that all supposed Russian ploys are “too simple and predictable.” Earlier on Saturday, Russia's Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev signaled that Moscow is ready, with Türkiye’s help, to send the world’s poorest countries up to 500,000 tons of grain within the next four next months. He noted that considering this year's harvest, Russia “is fully ready to replace Ukrainian grain” and arrange deliveries to “all interested countries"" at a reasonable price. “The grain deal not only did not solve the problems of countries in need, but even aggravated them in a sense. We can see where the ships from Ukraine were heading – Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. For some cargoes, the share of EU countries ranges from 60 to 100%. These are not the states that are experiencing a real food problem,” the minister said. Russia earlier warned that it could quit the grain deal if an agreement to ease restrictions on its food and fertilizer exports were not implemented. Moreover, following the blast on the strategic Crimean Bridge, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that if turns out that Ukraine – the country that Moscow accused of carrying out the attack – used grain corridors to transport explosives, “it would put the very existence of these corridors in question”. The breakthrough deal between Moscow and Kiev was reached in Istanbul in July with mediation by the UN and Türkiye. It aimed to unlock agricultural exports via the Black Sea from Russia and Ukraine – two of the world’s leading grain exporters – which had ground to halt due to the conflict between the two nations.",2.0053169221637255,1.7507551225870392,0.25456179957668623,7
2022-10-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/565582-russia-ukraine-pow-swap/,Moscow and Kiev reveal details of new prisoner swap,"Moscow and Kiev have conducted a prisoner swap in which 50 Russian troops were released, the Russian Defense Ministry announced on Saturday. The returned personnel will be airlifted to the Russian capital for medical treatment, the ministry said in a statement, adding that “their lives had been in danger during captivity.” The acting head of Russia’s Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, wrote on his Telegram channel that the exchange was conducted on a ‘50-for-50’ basis. “We are mostly handing over Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel,” Pushilin said. “Fifty of our fighters are being freed, including seven people from the Donetsk People’s Republic and two from the Lugansk People’s Republic. We are waiting for guys to return home,” he wrote. Andrey Yermak, the head of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s office, wrote on Telegram that 52 Ukrainians were released. He said that among them are 12 national guardsmen, 18 navy personnel, eight border guards, nine members of the volunteer Territorial Defense Force, three soldiers, and two civilians. “We will not stop and continue to implement the president’s task of bringing all Ukrainians home,” Yermak stated. Prisoner swaps have been occurring despite the absence of a ceasefire and months without meaningful peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Last week, Moscow freed 108 Ukrainian female soldiers in exchange for 110 Russians, many of whom were civilian sailors. Another major swap took place last month, when 55 Russian and Donbass fighters were released, as well as Ukrainian opposition leader Viktor Medvedchuk, who was charged with treason in Kiev. At the same time, more than 215 soldiers were handed over to Ukraine, according to President Vladimir Zelensky. They included more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, whose ranks include fighters with openly nationalist and neo-Nazi views.",4.892565623604851,5.556399653144351,-0.6638340295395002,5
2022-10-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/565581-ukrainian-drone-uk-crimea/,Russian military reveals details of Ukrainian drone attack in Crimea,"The unsuccessful Ukrainian attack on the port city of Sevastopol in Crimea early on Saturday involved nine aerial and seven naval drones, Russia’s defense ministry has said. The “terrorist attack,” which targeted the vessels of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and civilian ships docked in the city began around 4.20am local time, the ministry said in a statement on Saturday. It added that the Russian Navy ships had been involved in providing security for the “grain corridor,” which was set up to allow exports of Ukrainian food products from the Black Sea ports in line with a deal reached between Moscow and Kiev with UN and Turkish mediation in the summer. All of the incoming drones were shot down by Russian warships and naval aviation in the bay of Sevastopol, the ministry said. According to the statement, the attack resulted in minor damage to the trawler vessel ‘Ivan Golubets’ and to the net boom barrier in the bay. “The preparation of this terrorist act and training of the military personnel of the Ukrainian 73rd Special Center for Maritime Operations had been carried out under the supervision of the British experts, based in the city of Ochakov in Ukraine’s Nikolaev Region,” the ministry said. Information obtained by the Russian military suggests that the same unit of the Royal Navy took part in planning, supplying and carrying out the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines in the Baltic Sea on September 26, the statement read. Earlier on Saturday, Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhayev said it was the largest Ukrainian drone attack on the city since the start of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in late February. Located in Crimea, which became part of Russia after a referendum in 2014, Sevastopol has been designated as a federal city by Moscow due to its strategic importance and status as the base of Russia’s Black Fleet. The key port has frequently been the target of drone attacks by Ukraine during the conflict. In July, six people were injured after a UAV crashed into the Black Sea Fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol. The attack took place on Russia’s Navy Day and led to the cancellation of celebrations in the city. Another UAV hit the roof of the HQ in August, but failed to cause any significant damage.",3.4405999346805975,3.028792912454866,0.4118070222257315,0
2022-10-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/565577-nord-stream-uk-attack/,British navy involved in Nord Stream 2 'terrorist attack' – Russia,"Units of the British Navy were involved in a ""terrorist attack"", which destroyed the key Nord Stream gas pipelines, the Russian Defence Ministry alleged on Saturday. Writing on its official Telegram channel, the ministry alleged that Royal Navy operatives “took part in planning, supporting and implementing” the plot to blow up the infrastructure in September. It did not provide any direct evidence to support its assertion. The accusation follows a Russian Foreign Ministry claim that NATO conducted a military exercise during the summer, close to the location where the undersea explosions occurred. The September incident put the pipelines, connecting Germany to Russia, out of commission. Western countries have blocked a transparent international investigation. The Defence Ministry further alleged that the same UK operatives trained Ukrainians involved in a drone offensive in Crimea earlier on Saturday. In late September, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova noted that this summer, NATO conducted military drills not far from Bornholm, which featured intensive use of “deep-sea equipment.’’ While the officials stopped short of naming the culprit, they were said to be “working under the assumption that Russia was behind the blasts.” Moscow has repeatedly denied that it had anything to do with the incident. Meanwhile, Sky News has cited a UK defense official as saying Nord Stream 1 and 2 could have been damaged by a remotely detonated underwater explosive device. At the time, the broadcaster said the pipelines might have been breached by mines lowered to the seabed, or explosives dropped from a boat or planted by an undersea drone.",2.757257925248165,2.5763406784338523,0.18091724681431254,0

It was the largest attack of this nature on the peninsula since the launch of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in late February, Mikhail Razvozhayev told journalists. According to preliminary data, a naval drone was also destroyed off Sevastopol’s coast, Razvozhayev added. There was no damage to civilian infrastructure as a result of the assault, he said. Air defense systems were activated in Sevastopol to repel incoming drones from around 04:30 local time, the governor wrote on Telegram. The attack continued for several hours, with “all of the UAVs being shot down,” he said. The governor urged the public against posting videos of UAVs or revealing any information related to the attacks on social media, as it could help the Ukrainian military to better understand how the defense of the city is organized. Located in Crimea, which became part of Russia after a referendum in 2014, Sevastopol has been designated a federal city by Moscow due to its strategic importance. The Black Sea port has been a frequent target of drone attacks by Ukraine in recent months. In July, six people were injured after a UAV crashed into the Black Sea Fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol. The attack took place on Russia’s Navy Day and led to the cancellation of celebrations in the city. Another UAV hit the roof of the HQ in August, but failed to cause any significant damage. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has vowed on numerous occasions that Kiev will regain control of Crimea from Russia. “We will return Crimea by any means that we consider correct, without consulting with other countries,” he said in late August. Shortly after that, Zelensky’s aide Mikhail Podoliak urged people in Crimea to “prepare a bomb shelter, stock up on a sufficient amount of water and charge power banks right now” in anticipation of “active de-occupation” efforts by Ukraine. However, Kiev’s threats weren’t followed up by action. Russia has warned that any major provocation against the peninsula will be met with a harsh response. Earlier this month it launched a series of missile strikes against Ukrainian military targets and energy infrastructure after a truck bombing, which Moscow claims was masterminded by Kiev, damaged the Crimean Bridge and killed three people.",2.4962467186507995,4.297659129940754,-1.801412411289954,0
2022-10-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/565569-ukraine-freeze-death-winter/,Ukrainians could ‘freeze to death’ this winter – Kiev mayor,"Many Ukrainians could “freeze to death” in the coming months unless the West helps them to cope with the looming crisis due to Russian airstrikes on the nation’s energy infrastructure, Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko told UK media on Friday. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, acknowledged that Ukraine will face huge challenges. “We are doing everything we can do to save the lives of our people and to protect them,” the mayor told the outlet. The official said his team has managed to procure a number of power generators while preparing 1,000 mobile heating points in Kiev in anticipation for what he called the “worst-case scenario.” Klitschko signaled that Ukraine urgently needs not only Western weapons and air defense systems, but also blankets, winter clothes and generators. “It’s a critical time for this kind of support,” he stressed. Citing “the risk of a humanitarian issue,” he also urged Ukrainians who have fled the country to stay away this winter if they can. “But our main goal is to bring our people back, the biggest value of Ukraine is our citizens and our people,” he added. The mayor’s comments echo earlier remarks made by Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk. This week, she called on Ukrainians who left after the start of Russia’s military offensive not to return home before spring, due to Moscow’s strikes on energy infrastructure. Meanwhile Yuri Vitrenko, the head of the state-owned energy giant Naftogaz, has warned fellow citizens that Ukraine is facing its harshest ever winter, while claiming that Russian airstrikes have destroyed “about 40% of the power generation plants”. Ukraine has been experiencing regular blackouts since Moscow launched massive strikes against its energy facilities, including power stations on October 10, after it accused Kiev of terrorist attacks on Russian infrastructure, including the strategic Crimean Bridge. In an attempt to avert a humanitarian disaster, the EU last week announced a new emergency shelter and winterized facilities program for Ukraine, vowing to provide additional €175 million ($174 million) in humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable parts of the population in Ukraine and neighboring Moldova. Earlier this month the US, Ukraine’s largest international backer, pledged to support Kiev with emergency assistance to the tune of $55 million. The package includes investment in heating infrastructure, procurement of generators and other means of keeping Ukrainians warm.",2.266413105655556,2.2208852237626373,0.045527881892918565,7
2022-10-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/565518-live-in-anticipation-of-war/,"'We lived in dread of war, they told us we'd be dead in less than 30 minutes': How the world survived the Cuban Missile Crisis","In 1961, the US deployed Jupiter medium-range ballistic missiles in Türkiye, weapons that could quickly – and with relative ease – reach cities in the western part of the USSR, including its capital, Moscow. In February of the following year, the KGB reported to the Soviet leadership that the Americans were planning an operation to overthrow Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba. In response to these unfriendly actions by Washington, Moscow decided to station regular military units, as well as a number of nuclear missiles, on Cuban territory. By October, the confrontation had escalated to the point at which the US was preparing a major invasion of the ""island of freedom"". These events came to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, a series of dangerous incidents that nearly put the world on the verge of a third world war – one that would almost inevitably have ended in a thermonuclear Armageddon. 1962 was the year when the Cold War reached its pinnacle. Today, exactly 60 years later, we revisit the testimonies of both participants and witnesses of the crisis in order to refresh our memory and re-learn the lessons of one of the most intense and unsettling periods of the 20th century. On March 13, 1962, US Defense Secretary Robert McNamara presented the Operation Northwoods plan to President John F. Kennedy. Its key objective was to overthrow the Fidel Castro government by invading Cuba. But the main goal of the campaign, however, was to discredit the Havana government in the eyes of Americans. The scheme was developed in secret by top officials, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Lyman Lemnitzer. Kennedy didn’t approve the proposed draft, and Lemnitzer was soon fired. But the Americans continued to develop Cuban false-flag operations. Later, Nikita Khrushchev told Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko, We need to deploy a number of nuclear missiles to Cuba. That is the only thing that can save the country…” Fidel Castro had requested this on several occasions. The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union supported Khrushchev’s initiative, with only one voice against it, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR Anastas Mikoyan. Later, the Armenian politician played an important role in managing the crisis between Moscow and Washington. On May 28, a Soviet delegation set off for Havana to hold talks with Fidel and Raul Castro and explain Moscow’s proposals. The Cuban politicians took one day to think about the plan and then agreed to the proposed missile deployment. Cuba was supposed to get two types of ballistic missiles: 24 R-12 missiles (2,000km radius) and 16 R-14 missiles (4,000km radius). The blast yield of those rockets was up to 1.0 megaton. The plan was to move them from Ukraine and the European part of Russia. By June, Operation Anadyr was ready for implementation. The ships carrying the cargo were to head off to Cuba. But, in order to mislead the Americans, the ships’ staff were instructed that they were going to Chukotka, and they even received fur coats and skis. The US was supposed to think that the USSR was preparing for some action in the north of the country. A total of 85 ships were selected to carry the troops, and even the captains didn’t know what their final destination was or what type of cargo they were going to transport. The first vessels arrived in Cuba in early August and, on September 8, the first “shipment” was unloaded, with the second one coming in on September 16. But the operation led by Marshal of the Soviet Union Ivan Bagramyan had one significant flaw – while the Soviets got away with delivering the missiles to Cuba, hiding them on an island that was under constant surveillance from American U-2 reconnaissance jets proved to be a much harder task. Despite that, all 40 missiles and supporting equipment were delivered to Cuba by mid-October 1962. Around 40,000 Soviet troops were stationed on the island. On October 16, Kennedy established a crisis response team that included top officials. Some of them proposed to attack Soviet missiles in Cuba, but the team ended up choosing a different strategy. On October 20, Washington ordered a naval blockade of Cuba. What’s interesting about it is that a blockade itself is considered aggressive. Article 4 of the UN General Assembly Resolution, where the term “aggression” is defined, states that “the blockade of the ports or coasts of a state by the armed forces of another state” – even without formal declaration of war – is still considered an act of aggression. So, in order to avoid violating the UN regulations, the US used the term “quarantine.” The goal of which was to block any further military deliveries to Cuba. According to intelligence provided by a GRU agent in Washington, the US was also beefing up its Guantanamo base (it was a key element of the Operation Northwoods as well), and began to work on increasing the combat readiness of some units. American U-2 jets began patrolling Cuban airspace more often – six times a day as opposed to twice a month. The USSR considered Washington’s actions “unprecedented and aggressive” and raised the level of alert for its troops. On October 24, Khrushchev addressed Kennedy and wrote, We will be forced on our part to take the measures we deem necessary and sufficient to defend our rights.” The confrontation peaked. It became obvious that the USSR and US had raised the stakes to the highest level, and the world could soon face the first direct armed conflict between two nuclear states. These days, witness accounts can help us to better understand the general mood at the time. “There was a lot less agitation here than in the United States. We knew all too well that America is a civilized nation and won’t start a nuclear war that would for sure decimate its own population. In their turn, the Americans considered us a rogue state of some sort. McNamara himself confessed to me afterwards that at the end of the day on the 27th he thought, “Will I see the sunrise tomorrow?” So basically they were shaken more than we were. They were also better informed. The mass media set the alarm bells ringing, and people were stocking bomb shelters,” recalls Russian political analyst and journalist Fyodor Burlatsky. However, what Burlatsky says rather refers to the mood among the country’s political elite. It wasn’t the same for the ordinary citizens involved in the Cuban missile crisis. “We lived expecting the war to break out any minute and thinking that military engagement was pretty much unavoidable. But we were ready for it. Our superiors instructed us that in any case we had 30 minutes tops before they take us out after the first strike is launched. But it was enough for our regiment to launch three or four nuclear missiles targeting Florida, USA, so that state would have been taken out within the first 20 minutes. The other Frontline Combat Rocket (FRK) regiment was supposed to strike the American base in Guantanamo,” Soviet Lieutenant Alexander Gorensky, who served in Cuba at the time, said in his interview to Rodina magazine. Ordinary citizens in the United States were expecting the worst, too. Marta Maria Darby, who was living with her family in Miami, shared her memories on air speaking to National Public Radio: “I remember when the announcement happened and my family reacted with: ‘The world is going to end, and it had something to do with Cuba.’ I was seven years old at the time, and it was quite an impression. We sat and thought: ‘Where would they strike first?’ We’ve had this – it was a sort of surreal conversation. I was very afraid. And then the adults in the house started wondering, ‘Well, maybe they'll hit New York first.’ And so I didn’t sleep for days. It was quite frightening.” Maria Salgado, who also was a minor at the time, living in Cuba, had to say the following: “I remember family members from out of town coming in and everyone being in our same hometown because, you know, the world was going to end. So you wanted to be near your family, near your loved ones.” The USSR communicated both through the official and non-official channels that it was not seeking to escalate the situation. Mikoyan confirmed this in his memoirs: “We don’t want to send our missiles anywhere, we stand for peace and threaten no one. And in order to send the missiles, we don’t even need any submarines in Cuba. We have enough long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles on the Soviet territory. It’s in the interests [of the United States] to increase the global tensions instead of relieving them in order to make the ordinary Americans who are far from the politics predisposed against Cuba and the Soviet Union.” Junior Sergeant Felix Sukhanovsky recounted in his interview to Rodina: “We didn’t feel the entire tension associated with the situation, although we did understand that a launch of a single R-12 missile will unleash a hell on Earth. Each megaton of TNT is like 50 Hiroshima bombs packed into one. The Cubans, excited by this power, would tell us, ‘Comrade, comrade, push, push, launch the missile! Let’s give hell to these Americans!’ They were really upset that we wouldn’t use our heavy weapons against the US. But we had no order to do so. We were on standby waiting for it.” In the meantime, as reporter Michael D. Mosettig recalls on the pages of the PBS NewsHour, panic started to spread in the capital city of the United States: “As that week spun on, seemingly in increasing danger, there was some talk of a few people here moving their families out of Washington. I knew no one who did, and the thought never crossed my mind, if only for the prosaic reasons that I had to go to work and school. Ever since the Soviets exploded their first atomic bomb in 1949, being a nuclear target was part of the subconscious price that we and our families paid to work and live in the nation’s capital.” On October 25, 1962, US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson addressed the UN Security Council, confronting the Soviet representative, Valerian Zorin, on whether the Soviets had been honest with regard to the presence of missiles in Cuba. Their dialogue included the following exchange: AMBASSADOR STEVENSON: “Do you, Ambassador Zorin, deny that the USSR has placed and is placing medium- and intermediate-range missiles on sites in Cuba? Yes or no?” AMBASSADOR ZORIN: “I am not in an American courtroom, sir, and therefore I do not wish to answer a question that is put to me in the fashion in which a prosecutor does.” Meanwhile, the US Strategic Air Command was ordered to DEFCON-2 by President Kennedy for the first time in the country’s history. The Soviet spy network was sending back home disturbing secret intelligence about the US Armed Forces being ready to invade Cuba before October 29. The diplomatic collapse seemed almost inevitable. On October 26, the agent of the Soviet political intelligence Aleхander Fomin (real name Aleхander Feklisov) invited the ABC News correspondent John Scali, who had close ties to the Kennedy family, for dinner at Occidental for a second time (the first meeting was unsuccessful). President Kennedy knew Scali was going to meet Fomin and asked him to deliver a message: There’s no time to waste. Kremlin must urgently announce it is ready to unconditionally remove its missiles from Cuba.” Feklisov described that meeting in his book ‘Spy’s Confession’, which was later published by his daughter. “Pentagon assured the president it can put an end to Fidel Castro’s regime and Soviet missiles in 48 hours,” Scali said. “Cuban invasion would free Khrushchev’s hands. The Soviet Union could strike where it would hurt Washington the most.” As the memoirs suggest, Scali assumed it could be west Berlin and Fomin agreed this wasn’t off the table. Scali immediately relayed that to the White House and, three hours later, Kennedy asked him to offer Fomin an alternative solution to the crisis. A new meeting was arranged. “He got straight to the point. He said the ‘supreme authority’ endorsed him to propose the following solution to the Cuban crisis: The USSR dismantles and removes from Cuba its missile launchers under the UN inspection; the US lifts the blockade off the island and publicly pledges not to invade it.” The Soviet embassy in the US refused to cable this proposal to Moscow, since “The Foreign Ministry did not authorize it to hold such talks,” so Fomin signed the message himself and told the cipher officer to send it. October 27 was later called Black Saturday. A US U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was shot down over Cuba, risking an uncontrolled escalation. Moscow received a cable from its military attache saying the US could invade Cuba within the next five to seven days. Khrushchev sent Kennedy a letter offering to remove any Soviet weapons from Cuba, which the US “regarded as offensive,” in exchange for the US doing the same in Türkiye. The Executive Committee called by Kennedy decided on the same day against Türkiye being mentioned on the official track. In his meeting with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Kennedy said there were no obstacles to fulfilling this demand but the US wasn’t going to publicly mention the missiles in Türkiye. There were certain issues connected with this as it was NATO’s decision to deploy those weapons. Still, the US expressed its readiness to “find a solution.” The next day, on October 28, the situation was critical. The US Navy held military exercises in Florida. Moscow sent a cable to the US in the afternoon: “The dismantling of the missile bases in Cuba under the international supervision is absolutely possible and would be covered in detail in the First Secretary Khrushchev’s address.” Moscow agreed to keep the issue of removing the American missiles from Türkiye under the radar. The message was forwarded to President Kennedy on October 29 and, on October 30, he agreed to shut down the US military bases in Türkiye under a pretext entirely unrelated to the events in Cuba. Nuclear disaster was thus averted. It might be hard to believe at first, but the Cuban Missile Crisis in fact helped to strengthen international stability. Both the Soviet and American governments recognized the need for arms control and for working on mutual trust. That crisis marked the turning point in the Cold War. An antiwar movement started off in the West. However, today, 60 years later, it feels like the world has forgotten the lessons.",2.781856602266668,2.463741432840641,0.31811516942602713,8
2022-10-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/565564-us-nuclear-antonov-ukraine/,Russian ambassador tells US to bring its nukes home,"The US should bring its foreign-based nuclear weapons back to American territory and stop training troops from non-nuclear countries to use the arms, Russia’s ambassador to Washington said on Saturday. Anatoly Antonov was speaking in response to an article published by Politico on Wednesday, claiming the US was planning to speed up the deployment of B61-12 nuclear bombs to NATO bases in Europe. According to diplomatic cables seen by the outlet, the upgraded, more accurate bombs will arrive on the continent as soon as December, instead of spring 2023 as previously planned. The $10 billion B61-12 life extension program is expected to replace several earlier versions of the weapon, including about 100 bombs at air bases in Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Türkiye. In a message released by the Russian embassy, Antonov said officials in Washington call B61-12 munitions “tactical” and “speculate that the Russian arsenal of the same class is several times larger than that of the US. However, they fail to mention the fact that all our tactical nuclear weapons are stockpiled in centralized storage facilities on Russian territory and cannot pose a threat to the US.” “The US bombs, on the other hand, are deployed in European countries with a short flight time to Russian borders. Therefore, despite their limited yield, B61-12 play a strategic role,” he added. The ambassador also rejected claims by the US and NATO that Washington's regular nuclear warfare training exercises with the involvement of non-nuclear countries are not directed against Russia. “The question arises: against what other country the alliance, whose Strategic Concept calls Russia ‘the most significant and direct threat,’ trains to use nuclear weapons?” he asked. The world is currently going through a period of “tension and heightened risks” due to the conflict in Ukraine, and nuclear powers such as the US and Russia “bear a special responsibility for preventing escalation,” Antonov insisted. “With this in mind, I once again urge Washington to return all of its nuclear weapons deployed abroad to the national territory and eliminate foreign infrastructure for their storage and maintenance. As well as to abandon the practice of training military personnel from non-nuclear states to use such weapons as part of the so-called nuclear-sharing missions that contradict the fundamental principles of the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons),” he said. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed “some senior officials in NATO states” for suggesting that deploying nuclear weapons against Russia was justified. He warned that Moscow was ready to “use all means” to defend itself in case of such an attack. His words were interpreted by the US and its allies as a “veiled threat” by the Kremlin to use atomic weapons during Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. Numerous Russian officials have since insisted that the country was not threatening anybody with atomic weapons and pointed to Russia’s military doctrine, which states that such weapons can only be used if weapons of mass destruction are being deployed against the state, or it is faced with an existential threat from conventional warfare.",1.9504896637051132,2.4612305053350894,-0.5107408416299761,8
2022-10-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/565553-russians-antidepressant-sedative-usage-increase/,Use of psychiatric drugs soars in Russia,"Russians are spending significantly more money on psychiatric drugs this year over last, according to data published by the Center for the Development of Advanced Technologies (CRPT) and reported by TASS on Friday. The increase in consumption correlates with a surge in anxiety, with nearly two in three Russians reporting last month that they had been experiencing such feelings. Spending on antidepressants is up 70% for the first nine months of 2022 for a total of 5 billion rubles going toward purchasing the drugs, CRPT data show. This translates to a 48% increase in yearly consumption, with 8.4 million packs bought in the first nine months of 2022. Domestic production of antidepressants has increased 24% since last year to keep up with demand, while imports have jumped 42%. Russian spending on sedatives is also up, climbing 56% over last year, with 13.9 billion rubles spent in total, according to CRPT. That equates to a 44% uptick in consumption, for a total of 108 million packages of sedatives purchased from January through September. Domestic production increased 21% to meet the increased demand, though imports actually declined by 12%. This surge in pill-popping is unsurprising, given that nearly two-thirds – 63% – of respondents to a survey conducted last week by the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM) said the prevailing mood among their relatives, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances was “anxious.” The same organization found last month that a record 70% of Russians reported anxiety in their surroundings amid the announcement of “partial mobilization” to fight in Ukraine. Russians are not the only ones taking more antidepressants than ever. An estimated one in six Americans take the drugs, and the US saw a jump of 21% in antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and sleeping pill prescriptions in the first two months of the Covid-19 pandemic, with no indication that those patients have stopped taking the drugs since. Among OECD countries, Iceland is the biggest pill popper, with an average of 16 daily antidepressant doses consumed per 100 inhabitants as of last year.",3.0382300215568097,2.8327643029791125,0.20546571857769713,7
2022-10-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/565549-duma-lgbt-propaganda-amendments/,Russian MP proposes criminal penalties for LGBT ‘propaganda’,"Amendments to the bill banning “LGBT propaganda” in Russia could introduce tougher penalties beyond fines and deportation and expand it to cover theaters and large entertainment venues, a lawmaker said on Friday. “We have absolutely no coverage of theatrical activities, and here we will think about entertainment and mass events, we will think about this topic for the second reading, we are preparing amendments,” Nina Ostanina, the head of the State Duma committee on family issues, told Ria Novosti. “It is not enough to be limited only to administrative fines. We once again insist on the introduction of amendments to the Criminal Code and we will talk about criminal punishment in the second reading,” she said. The first draft of the bill, originally proposed by media regulator Roskomnadzor and endorsed by the Duma unanimously on Thursday, bans the spread of ‘LGBT propaganda’ in the media, online, in books, films, ‘audio-visual services’ and advertisements. It envisions fines ranging from up to 400,000 rubles ($6,500) for individuals and up to five million rubles ($81,500) for legal entities, and expulsion from Russia for foreign violators. The bill also calls for hefty fines for those promoting and “justifying” pedophilia as well as information that could encourage underage Russians to change their sex. Cosponsored by 390 out of 450 members of the State Duma, it is widely regarded as a “sequel” to the 2013 law that banned the spread of ‘LGBT propaganda’ to minors. “We should do our best to protect our children, those who want to lead a normal life,” State Duma chair Vyacheslav Volodin said on Thursday. “Everything else is sin, sodomy, darkness.” Introducing criminal penalties in the amendments might be a step too far, according to Alexander Khinshtein, the chair of the Duma’s committee on information policy. The current bill introduced administrative penalties only, he told TASS on Friday, adding that using it to make changes to the criminal code was “impossible on formal grounds.” Debate on introducing criminal liability is already underway, Khinshtein said, but the main goal at the moment is to focus on the preventive measures envisioned by the current initiative, in order “to make these disgusting phenomena impossible.” Khinshtein clarified earlier that the proposed bill does not ban LGBT identity as such, however. Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he was fine with the West promoting values “like dozens of genders and gay pride parades” at home, but not in his country. “If Western elites believe that they can incorporate into the minds of their people, their societies things that I personally find somewhat weird but which are apparently in fashion,” Putin said, “so be it. Let them do whatever they want.”",2.4385231614468634,2.6804594576862564,-0.24193629623939295,3

A trilateral summit involving the countries will be held in the Russian city of Sochi next week, the Kremlin announced. Pashinyan said in a tweet that Yerevan was prepared to confirm its stance during the negotiations in Sochi on Monday. The upcoming talks will focus on fostering stability and security in the Transcaucasus. Russian President Vladimir Putin, his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev, and the Armenian PM will also discuss the implementation of trilateral agreements signed earlier, in 2020 and 2021. The Kremlin has confirmed that the summit was initiated by Moscow. “Honestly, I want [the peace agreement] to be signed by the end of the year,” Pashinyan claimed, as cited by Russian news agency TASS, adding that the government would do everything it can for this plan to be “realistic.” Earlier on Friday, speaking at the extraordinary session of the Collective Security Treaty Organization via video link, Putin stated that Russia “cannot stand aside from problems” and tensions between Yerevan and Baku. Moscow is always ready to support their “peaceful settlement.” Armenia and Azerbaijan have historically been at odds over numerous issues, with the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, de jure Azerbaijan, populated by ethnic Armenians, being the key one. In 2020, the two nations fought a 44-day war over the territory, which ended with a Russian-brokered truce, ceding to Baku some areas previously controlled by Armenian-backed troops and the deployment of Russian peacekeepers to observe the agreement. Tensions on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border escalated again in September this year, when dozens of people, both civilian and military personnel, were reportedly killed, with the parties of the conflict blaming the violence on each other.",2.9005900179722635,2.829058903861756,0.0715311141105075,8

Citing sources “close to” Russia’s Interior Ministry and claiming to have knowledge on the ongoing investigation, the news outlet said there are currently “no complaints” against Sobchak and that she has “nothing to do” with the extortion probe. Several media outlets reported on Wednesday that the journalist was a person of interest in an extortion scheme after the commercial manager of her ‘Ostorozhno Media’ (Beware Media) group, Kirill Sukhanov, was arrested. Former Russian Tatler editor-in-chief Arian Romanovsky was also arrested for allegedly demanding some 11 million rubles ($178,000) from Sergey Chemezov, the head of the Russian state-controlled technology conglomerate Rostec. Sobchak has denied any connection to the extortion scheme, which, according to prosecutors who spoke with TASS, involved demanding money in exchange for guarantees that Sukhanov and Romanovsky’s Telegram channel ‘Tushite Svet’ (‘Lights out’), would not receive critical coverage. The two men now face up to 15 years in prison. As the news of the arrests broke, it was also revealed that authorities had conducted a search of Sobchak’s private villa outside Moscow on Wednesday. The journalist herself fled the country the day before, apparently going through Belarus and into Lithuania. Sobchak has stated on social media that she believes the cases against the two men to be part of a pressure campaign against Russian journalists and an attack on “the last free newsroom” in Russia. Ksenia Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, who served as mayor of St. Petersburg in the 1990s and is considered President Vladimir Putin’s political mentor. She made a successful media career in Russia and became a recognized figure in the liberal opposition.

Musk allegedly closed the $44 billion deal to purchase the social network platform late on Thursday after several months of negotiations. Some media outlets claimed he had already fired some of Twitter’s top executives. “The bird is freed,” the SpaceX and Tesla CEO tweeted in celebration of the deal. Medvedev posted a tweet on Friday reading “Good luck Elon Musk in overcoming political bias and ideological dictatorship on Twitter,” pointing out what he considered to be the problems that plagued the social media platform under its previous leadership. The former president also advised the tech entrepreneur to “quit that Starlink in Ukraine business.” Operated by Musk’s SpaceX company, Starlink’s satellite service has been the main communications tool for Ukrainian forces amid the conflict with Russia. Earlier this week, top Russian diplomat Konstantin Vorontsov said that the use of civilian satellites for military purposes was an “extremely dangerous” trend and warned that, as such, the spacecraft could be “considered a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike.” Musk has not yet responded to Medvedev’s message, although the two of them recently had a memorable exchange on Twitter. Last week, the billionaire tried questioning Medvedev, who is now the deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, about the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine. The former president dodged the question, instead inviting Musk to visit Moscow on Victory Day on May 9. In early October, Medvedev reacted to Musk’s peace plan for Ukraine, which infuriated many in Kiev, by joking that the billionaire was actually a Russian “shadowy agent” who had blown his cover but still deserved a promotion in rank.",3.2300171928780044,3.551278336590468,-0.3212611437124635,5

The draft was announced in September amid Moscow’s ongoing military operation in Ukraine. “The dispatch of citizens conscripted for mobilization was completed today,” Shoigu told Putin. “Citizen notification has been discontinued. The task set by you – 300,000 people – has been fulfilled. “No additional tasks are planned. Military commissariats within the framework of the special military operation will continue to replenish the troops only by accepting volunteers and candidates for military service under the contract,” he said. “13,000 citizens, without waiting for summonses, expressed a desire to fulfill their duty and were sent to join the troops as volunteers,” the minister added. Shoigu noted that more than 1,300 representatives of executive authorities at various levels, as well as more than 27,000 entrepreneurs, were drafted into the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. According to the defense minister, 82,000 mobilized troops were sent to the conflict zone. Another 218,000 draftees are getting ready for combat duty at training centers and at training grounds. The average age of the reservists called up as part of the mobilization was 35, he revealed. Shoigu also acknowledged problems with the equipment for conscripts, however, explaining that these were experienced only at the initial stage and have already been resolved. Putin, in turn, noted that difficulties were inevitable, since mobilization had not occurred for a long time. Partial mobilization in Russia was announced on September 21. In the disclosed part of the presidential decree, no data was provided on how many people were planned to be drafted. Shoigu said that 300,000 would be conscripted.

2022-10-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/565520-uss-governor-us-italy/,Russian court orders arrest of governor's son detained in EU,"A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of the son of Alexander Uss, the governor of the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk. According to court files, the ruling was made in absentia, and Artem Uss was placed on a wanted list. The younger man was detained in Italy last week at the request of the US for alleged involvement in helping Moscow evade Western sanctions. Artem Uss was charged with large-scale money laundering as part of an organized criminal group. The maximum penalty for such an offense is seven years in prison. Uss has also been added to the database of wanted people on the Russian interior ministry’s website. Moscow can now demand his extradition from Italy as the 40-year-old had refused to be transferred to the US. US authorities earlier announced that charges had been brought against Uss and four other Russian nationals. It’s claimed they were part of a group that purchased “advanced semiconductors and microprocessors used in fighter aircraft, missile systems, smart munitions, radar, and satellites” and then sold them to sanctioned Russian entities via a German-based shell company. According to the US, the equipment had made it into the hands of the Russian defense industry and was allegedly later found in Russian hardware that had been abandoned in Ukraine. Uss and his associates have also been accused of smuggling hundreds of millions of barrels of sanctioned oil from Venezuela to customers in China and Russia, including to an aluminum tycoon blacklisted by Washington. Reacting to his son’s arrest and the charges, governor Alexander Uss said that “political overtones are obvious in these accusations.” He pointed out that the goods were freely bought and sold all over the world, and the US had problems with it “simply because it is being done for the benefit of Russia.”",2.9988943835631967,3.4960360526992877,-0.49714166913609104,5
2022-10-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/565523-timofey-bordachev-western-hegemony/,"Timofey Bordachev: Western hegemony is coming to an end, and the world is about to enter a very dangerous period","The most dramatic and unique aspect of the current state of affairs in international politics is that we cannot count on the ability of a single state, or a group of sufficiently powerful countries, to play a leadership role in the future. This means it is difficult for us to imagine who will be able to force states to comply with the rules of conduct in their foreign policy, and how such strictures can even be enforced. Indeed, the question of why individuals, or in this case countries, should abide by regulations is the most fundamental one in political philosophy. And despite all the imperfections of the power method, humanity has not yet invented any other way of achieving such goals, even in minimal amounts, other than by force. Over the last 500 years, the rules of international communication have been created within the narrow community of Western countries, first in Europe, before in the 20th century the US joined in, providing the power needed to enforce the system. At first, this was done through the balance of power of leading European states, joined by Russia in 1762. After the international order that had emerged in the mid-17th century came under attack from revolutionary France, control of the rules became a matter for a small group of major empires. They, led by Russia and Britain, defeated Napoleon and in 1815 created an order which had at its heart a general agreement that mutiny in international affairs was unacceptable. By the end of the nineteenth century, politics had become global, but the European powers, including Russia, could still control the rest through brute force and their colossal military-industrial superiority. The dramatic events of 1914-1945 brought the US to the forefront of global politics, as the leader of the Western community on a global scale. International institutions, starting with the United Nations, were established with the primary objective of preserving the monopoly position of the West. This, however, required the emergence of formal institutions of justice in the form of international law, or the participation in the highest UN body, the Security Council, of the Soviet Union and China, which were inherently hostile to US and Western European interests. The institutional form of Western power dominance has become overbearing and the main question now is whether it can be preserved. Therefore, the collapse of US and Western European power positions in international politics entails not just a change of leadership, but a revision of the existing institutions and rules at the global level. In other words, the entire formal international order that has emerged after World War II (and in reality over the last few centuries) will cease to exist. It was based on a special system of rights and privileges for a limited group of great powers, and later the illusion of fairness of which was created by international institutions led by the UN. It was this system that played the role of the main legitimizing principle of the existing world order, although in practice it was often replaced by the West's ability to exert a decisive influence on world affairs. Thus, the collapse of international political institutions will very probably prove to be a consequence of the disappearance of their power base, whose presence has been unchallenged for several centuries. We are now witnessing the destruction of both the formal and the real basis of the international order. In all likelihood, this process can no longer be stopped. The coming period will be a time of defining the new global power base, and it is difficult to say yet which players, and to what extent, will become part of it. What is important is that the top states of the present time – the US, Russia, China and India – are not close to each other, especially in terms of values and understanding of the basic principles of international rules. The greatest problem so far is the behaviour of the US and certain Western European countries, which, for internal reasons, are pursuing an aggressive policy towards the outside world. These states have embarked on a very troubling path of qualitative changes in the basic things that make up the social, gender and, consequently, political structures of society. For most other civilizations, this path is a challenge and will be rejected. We also do not know the extent to which the internal development of the West depends on the spread of its ideals, as it did in previous periods. In the event that the trends emerging in the West will, like revolutionary France, the Bolshevik regime or Nazi Germany, demand not just recognition from others, but expansion globally, the future will become very worrying. We can already see that the conflict between the values favored by the West and the foundations of domestic legitimacy in a number of countries, is becoming a ground for aggravated political relations. It would, however, be a mistake to hope that the other great and middle powers confronting the West are completely united in their understanding of the foundations of justice at the domestic level. Even if Russia, India, China or Brazil now demonstrate a common understanding of the basic principles of a “proper” world order, this does not mean that they have the same vision of a better domestic order. This is all the more true of the states of the Islamic world and other major developing countries. Their conservative values are often in conflict with those of the West, but this does not mean that they can create unity between themselves. In other words, the new international order will, for the first time, be without a reliable link with the domestic ambitions of the leading powers, and this is indeed a qualitative change compared to all the historical eras we discussed. Such a phenomenon seems very important because we have no experience of understanding how relations between states will develop under such conditions. Brute force could become the only relatively tangible basis to assert the order, but this may not be enough to make the conditions imposed by it sustainable, even in the short term. Another unique feature of today's revolutionary situation is that the revision of the international order is not being carried out by one or a few powers – it has now become the business of the world’s majority. The countries that make up about 85% of the world's population are in one way or another no longer prepared to live with conditions created without their direct involvement. That said, their resistance is often expressed without direct intention and depends on the power capabilities of the particular power. What from the point of view of Russia or Iran looks like lack of resolve in dealing with the US may seem like a great challenge for Kazakhstan or another young sovereign country – after all, their entire socio-economic system was created to exploit a liberal world order. The fragile states of Africa, or the former Soviet space, are far less capable of behaving consistently than the prosperous monarchies of the Persian Gulf. China, though now the second most powerful economic power, is also aware of its weaknesses. But all this does not change the most important thing - even if the destruction of the existing status quo takes the form of soft sabotage rather than decisive military action, it does not simply reflect a general discontent with Western authoritarianism, but creates a new order, and the basic features of this are as yet undetermined. In the coming years, most countries in the world will seek to make the most of the weakening of the power base of international politics in their self-interest. So far, these actions constitute a constructive conflict, since they objectively undermine a system based on fantastic injustice. However, as time goes on the US-EU bloc will weaken and lock itself away, and Russia or China will never be strong enough to take their place. And in the perspective of the next 10 to 15 years, the international community will face the problem of replacing the power monopoly of the West with new universal instruments of coercion, the nature and content of which are still unknown to us.",3.5024210989389215,2.767402170331022,0.7350189286078996,6
2022-10-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/565521-patrushev-apology-hasidic-jews/,Russian security chief apologizes for aide’s Jewish ‘cult’ comment,"The secretary of the Russia's national security council, Nikolay Patrushev, has issued an apology and distanced the council from “untruthful remarks” about a Jewish group made by one of his aides in a recent opinion piece. The religious community was outraged by claims that members of the Chabad-Lubavitch group considered the rest of humanity inferior to themselves. The accusation, made by aide Aleksey Pavlov, is his personal viewpoint and does not in any way reflect the position of the Russian government, Patrushev stressed in a statement to the Argumenty i Fakty (AiF) newspaper, on Thursday. “Relevant action has been taken regarding the author,” he added. The top official was referring to an opinion piece by his assistant, printed in the paper on Tuesday. He argued that Ukraine was being deliberately dragged towards various forms of paganism or cultism masquerading as mainstream religions, accusing some senior Ukrainian public figures of directing the process. Among the targets of his verbal attack was Chabad-Lubavitch, a variant of Hasidic Judaism that originated over two centuries ago in what is now Vitebsk Region in Belarus, but was largely pushed out of the Soviet Union during the Bolshevik crackdown on religious practices. Pavlov called the movement a “sect,” which in Russian has a pejorative meaning similar to the word “cult” in English, and claimed that its “main principle is the superiority of its members over all other nations and peoples.” The characterization was strongly rejected by Russia’s chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, whose rebuke was published by AiF on Wednesday. “It should be enough to say that 90% of rabbis working in Russian Jewish communities are part of Chabad, and I am one of them,” he wrote. The movement rejects any form of idolatry, contrary to “Mr. Pavlov’s fantasies” and advocates respect for all monotheistic religions, all peoples, and every individual since we are “all in essence G-d’s children,” he added. Lazar said he would have ignored Pavlov’s words as “vulgar anti-Semitic delirium” if he didn’t hold a high position in the Russian security council. He called for a “swift and unequivocal reaction” to it.",2.5653166634447553,3.231794402068286,-0.6664777386235308,5
2022-10-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/565499-grain-deal-abuse-smuggling/,Russia reports ‘abuse’ of Ukraine grain corridor,"The deal which Russia signed with Türkiye and the UN to allow the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea is being abused, including by smugglers, the Russian Foreign Ministry has said. Russian experts involved in checking ships sailing under the July agreement are being pressured by an “artificial” crowding of vessels in the port of Istanbul, the ministry said in a statement on Friday. The goal, it believes, is to push them into less rigorous checks of cargos. Since the route was launched, “over 70 ships were detained. Some of them were banned for the systematic violation of the rules of navigation in the maritime corridor and attempts to smuggle items in specially designed secret compartments,” the statement noted. Moscow said such “abuse” of the deal cannot be ignored, “especially amid the ongoing investigation into the way explosives were delivered for the October 8 terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge.” Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) accused Ukrainian military intelligence of masterminding the bombing of the bridge, which claimed three lives, including that of the driver of the truck carrying the bomb. The explosives, it claimed, originated in the port city of Odessa and traveled through Bulgaria, Georgia and Armenia before reaching its target destination. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this month that investigators were not fully certain that the bomb hadn’t been smuggled in a grain ship. If the suspicion is confirmed, “we will shut it down, and that would be the end of it,” he warned. The ministry statement reiterated other shortfalls it sees in the grain deal. It cited an apparent failure to deliver food to poor nations and what Moscow sees as the UN’s inability to keep its end of the bargain and facilitate supplies of Russian food and fertilizer to international markets. The US and the EU have not resolved issues with “bank transfers, insurance, chartering of ships and port access” that hinder Russian exports, the statement said. In fact, they are “punishing African, Asian, and Latin American nations” by denying them Russian products. The restrictions apply not only to commercial trade but also to humanitarian efforts, the ministry added. Russia simply cannot deliver 300,000 tons of fertilizers to intended recipients under the UN World Food Program, it explained. Latvia, Estonia, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where the products are currently stored, simply would not allow their shipment, according to the statement.",2.6743024185817714,2.488237682570535,0.1860647360112364,7
2022-10-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/565488-ukraine-nuclear-blackmail-money/,Ukraine may use 'nuclear blackmail' to get more money from West – Moscow,"Ukraine is trying to extract more financial and military aid from the US and other Western countries by using “nuclear blackmail,” possibly including the deployment of a dirty bomb against its own people to escalate the crisis in Eastern Europe, Russia’s Foreign Ministry suggested on Thursday. “Maybe one reason Kiev uses nuclear blackmail is to extort more Western financial aid, including the large amounts of money that settle into their own bank accounts, and military assistance to protect themselves, rather than the people of Ukraine,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters in Moscow. Zakharova noted that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky urged NATO earlier this month to undertake a pre-emptive nuclear strike against Russia. Zelensky insisted that his insinuations about preemptive NATO strikes on Russia had been mistranslated, and he really meant “preventive kicks.” “He was willing to start a nuclear confrontation,” Zakharova insisted. “Now the president of Ukraine is holding out his hand for nuclear arms. Luckily, he doesn’t have them.” While Ukraine doesn’t have nuclear warheads, Moscow has accused Zelensky’s government of building a “dirty bomb” and plotting to use it in a false flag attack that would be blamed on Russia to provoke increased Western involvement in the conflict. Such a device could be used to disperse radioactive material across a targeted area. Ukraine and its supporters have dismissed Russia’s claims as “absurd.” “The Kiev regime is showing its sponsors… that if they do not continue to provide and increase their help, it will move on to Plan B,” Zakharova said. “We urge the West to use its influence with its Ukrainian underlings and tell them to turn back from this dangerous and reckless idea and all actions stemming from nuclear blackmail. It could have irreversible consequences, including possible mass loss of innocent civilian lives.” The US and its allies have already provided an estimated $42.3 billion in military aid to Ukraine, including $28.3 billion from Washington alone. EU leaders have suggested that billions of dollars in funding should be provided for decades to aid Ukraine’s recovery, at least partly by liquidating frozen Russian assets. “Ukrainian officials stopped hiding their desire to scrounge money a long time ago, and only welcome these offers,” Zakharova said. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused Ukraine’s leaders of letting their country be used as a testing ground for Western defense contractors, knowing that their own citizens will suffer the consequences. “Even the most terrible sadists and child-killers of the past never suggested testing weapons on their citizens who were defending their own country,” she said.",2.945327485268006,2.69844121669692,0.2468862685710862,7
2022-10-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/565487-putin-xi-ukraine-warning/,Putin says he didn’t warn China before Ukraine offensive,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has revealed that he did not give advance notice of the military operation in Ukraine to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. There was no need, Putin said on Thursday at the Valdai Discussion Club meeting, adding that Russia and China are both sovereign nations and that Beijing has a clear understanding of the situation in Ukraine. “No,” Putin said, when moderator Fyodor Lukyanov asked if he’d told Xi about the military operation, which started on February 24, when the two leaders met 20 days prior. Nor was Xi resentful or offended by that, the Russian president explained. “The Chinese leader is not the type of person to take offense at anything,” Putin said, describing Xi as a “world-caliber” statesman. As for the advance warning, the Russian president said, “we don’t have such a need. We make sovereign decisions, both Russia and the People’s Republic of China.” The government in Beijing knows what Moscow thinks of NATO’s desire to move its infrastructure to Russia’s borders, Putin said, adding that China is also aware of the causes and consequences of the US-backed coup in Kiev in 2014, and what has been happening in the Donbass ever since. “The Chinese leadership stands for pragmatic, balanced solutions to the crisis in Ukraine by peaceful means, and we respect this position,” Putin told Lukyanov. In the joint communique after the meeting in Beijing, the two presidents said China supported Russia’s proposal for security guarantees in Europe and called on NATO to “abandon the ideological approaches of the Cold War, to respect the sovereignty, security and interests of other states, the diversity of their civilizational and cultural and historical ways.” After the hostilities in Ukraine escalated, China declined to follow the US and its allies in imposing sanctions against Russia and called on Moscow and Kiev to achieve peace through negotiations. Beijing reacted to US threats of “significant consequences” if China provided military or other assistance to Russia by saying it opposed “any form of unilateral sanctions that have no basis in international law.” The Valdai Discussion Club is an annual international event, conceived in 2004 as a platform for floating ideas that Russia considers important to discuss with other global players.",2.0162971801237775,1.352073564995454,0.6642236151283234,8
2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565476-putin-valdai-club-takeaways/,‘No one can sit out the coming storm’: Putin’s milestone Valdai speech,"The world is entering a decade of tumult as the pursuit of a more just world order clashes with the arbitrary hegemony of the collective West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday, addressing the annual meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club. Putin’s speech ranged from biodiversity to “cancel culture,” the nature of what the West has to offer and Russia’s response, followed by hours of answering audience questions. Here are six key points from his opening remarks. The West stokes conflict to preserve hegemony From inciting conflict in Ukraine and provocations around Taiwan to destabilizing the world food and energy markets, the US and its allies have been escalating tensions around the globe in recent years and especially in recent months, Putin said. “Ruling the world is what the so-called West has staked in this game, which is certainly dangerous, bloody and – I would say – dirty. It denies the sovereignty of countries and peoples, their identity and uniqueness, and disregards any interests of other states,” the Russian president explained. In their so-called “rules-based world order,” only those making the “rules” have any agency, while everyone else must simply obey. However, the West has “no constructive ideas and positive development, they simply have nothing to offer the world except the preservation of their dominance.” Rules for thee but not for me The West insists its culture and worldview should be universal, Putin said. While not saying it outright, they behave as if these values must be unconditionally accepted by everyone else. Yet when some other countries, notably China, began benefiting from globalization, the West “immediately changed or completely canceled” many of the rules it long insisted were set in stone and sacred, Putin said, with free trade, economic openness, fair competition and even property rights “suddenly forgotten at once, completely.” “As soon as something becomes profitable for themselves, they change the rules immediately, on the go, in the course of the game.” “Cancel culture” and canceling culture Believing themselves infallible, the rulers of the West desire to destroy – or “cancel” – those they dislike. Where Nazis burned books, the Western “guardians of liberalism and progress” now ban Dostoevsky and Tchaikovsky, Putin said. Liberal democracy has transformed into something unrecognizable, declaring any alternative viewpoint as propaganda or a threat, he added. The so-called “cancel culture” destroys anything that is alive and creative, preventing any freedom of thought in culture, economics or politics alike. “History, of course, will put everything in its place,” Putin said, adding that the the self-conceit of those who seek to cancel them is off the charts, “but no one will even remember their names in a few years, while Dostoevsky and Tchaikovsky and Pushkin will endure.” Russia does not seek domination Russia is an “independent, original civilization” and “has never considered itself an enemy of the West,” Putin said. Since antiquity, it has had ties with the West of traditional Christian and Muslim values, freedom, patriotism, and a rich culture. There is another West, however – “an aggressive, cosmopolitan, neocolonialist, acting as a tool of neoliberal elites,” Putin said, “whose dictates Russia will never accept.” Even so, Russia is not throwing a gauntlet to the elites of that West, but “simply defends its right to exist and develop freely. At the same time, we ourselves are not seeking to become some kind of new hegemon,” Putin said. Western hegemony is ending “We are standing at a historic milestone, ahead of what is probably the most dangerous, unpredictable and at the same time important decade since the end of World War II. The West is not able to single-handedly manage humanity, but is desperately trying to do it, and most of the peoples of the world no longer want to put up with it,” Putin said. Conflicts arising from this tumult are threatening the entire humanity, and constructively resolving them is the principal challenge ahead, according to the Russian leader. No one can sit out the coming storm, which has acquired a global character, Putin said. Humanity has two choices, “either to continue to accumulate a burden of problems that will inevitably crush us all, or to try together to find solutions, albeit imperfect, but working, capable of making our world safer and more stable.” What multipolar world should look like In a truly democratic multipolar world, any society, culture and civilization should have the right to choose its own path and socio-political system. If the US and Europe have that right, so should everyone else. Russia also has it, “and no one will ever be able to dictate to our people what kind of society we should build and on what principles.” The biggest threat to the political, economic, and ideological monopoly of the West is that alternative social models may arise in the world – and would be more effective and more attractive. “Above all, we believe that the new world order should be based on law and justice, be free, authentic and fair,” the Russian president said. “The future world order is being formed before our eyes. And in this world order, we must listen to everyone, take into account every point of view, every nation, society, culture, every system of worldviews, ideas and religious beliefs, without imposing a single truth on anyone, and only on this basis, understanding our responsibility for the fate of our peoples and the planet, to build a symphony of human civilization.”",1.8931112159008803,2.209128124941405,-0.3160169090405247,6
2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565483-ukraine-increases-military-budget/,Ukraine adds billions to its military budget,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has introduced several amendments to the country’s 2022 budget, which raises the maximum limit on state internal borrowing and national debt and offers a significant boost to the nation’s defense expenses. The new budget was published on the Ukrainian parliament’s (Rada) website on Thursday and states that a total of 386.9 billion Ukrainian hryvnas ($10.5 billion) would be allocated to the country’s national security and defense sectors. The bulk of the funds, some $9.9 billion, will go to the Ministry of Defense, while the rest will be split up between the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Security Service, Main Intelligence Directorate, Foreign Intelligence Service and others. It’s noted that the government has already started work on implementing budgetary procedures to ensure the use of these additional funds for the country’s defense and national security sectors. The announcement comes after Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak announced earlier this month that Ukraine had already spent its entire yearly budget amid the ongoing military conflict with Russia, while presidential aide Alexander Rodnyansky stated that Ukraine now needs between four and five billion dollars a month to keep its budget afloat. In an article published by German media group Funke on Tuesday, Rodnyansky stated that Kiev expects the EU to cover roughly half of that sum – some $2 billion per month. He also insisted Ukraine needed to get additional aid such as “thermal clothing, emergency power and diesel generators” after Russia carried out a series of attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. “We believe that Germany could take on about $500 million a month,” Rodnyansky told Funke, stressing that it would be especially necessary next year. “The state has to function, pensions have to be paid.” Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal has put the total cost of repairing the country’s lost infrastructure and modernizing areas unaffected by the conflict at around $750 billion. The World Bank and the US have stated they believe the price to rebuild Ukraine was significantly lower, at around $350 billion, according to Funke.",3.3544354756154435,3.144407298850262,0.21002817676518148,7
2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565477-putin-nuclear-war-heaven/,Putin reacts to question about nuclear apocalypse,"Russian President Vladimir Putin jokingly became “lost in thought” when asked to follow up on comments he made in 2018 about Russians being the victims of aggression who would go to heaven in the event of a nuclear apocalypse. During Thursday’s Valdai Discussion Club event in Moscow, moderator Fyodor Lukyanov told the Russian president that “we grew a bit worried remembering your comments made here four years ago when you said that we would all go to heaven.” “We’re not in a hurry to get there, are we?,” Lukyanov asked. Putin stayed silent for a couple of seconds, as some audience members laughed. The moderator broke the silence by stating, “Now that you are lost in thought it’s getting alarming.” The president laughed and said, “I intentionally got lost in thought to alarm you,” adding that “the effect has been achieved.” In 2018, the Russian leader was asked about the likelihood of a nuclear war. He responded by saying that Moscow, in accordance with its doctrine back then, could not launch a preemptive nuclear strike and could only conduct a counter attack. Russia would launch its nuclear warheads only after confirming that a potential aggressor had launched ones targeting Russian territory, the president explained. Nevertheless, he noted that the aggressors should know that retaliation was inevitable and that they would be destroyed. “And we, as the victims of aggression, as martyrs, will go to heaven while they will simply die,” he said, adding that “they won’t even have time to repent.” In late February, Putin issued an order to increase the readiness level of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces shortly after Moscow launched its military offensive against Ukraine. This Wednesday, the president personally oversaw military drills conducted by the Russian Defense Ministry enacting a retaliatory nuclear strike. Meanwhile, Russia has recently warned that Ukraine is preparing to set off a ‘dirty bomb’ to frame Moscow and has called on the likes of the US, the UK and other nations to investigate these concerns. Ukraine has rejected these allegations and instead claims that Russia is planning to conduct a tactical nuclear strike, which the Kremlin has also denied.",2.3538539818497237,2.1210501025065804,0.23280387934314328,8
2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565473-putin-dirty-bomb-details/,Russia comments on Ukrainian ‘dirty bomb’ allegations,"Russia is aware of the approximate location of where Ukraine is making a ‘dirty bomb,’ President Vladimir Putin has stated, adding that Kiev is now doing everything it can to cover its tracks. A ‘dirty bomb’ is a conventional munition with radioactive elements. Putin’s comments came during a Valdai Discussion Club meeting outside Moscow on Thursday. The Russian president also noted that Ukraine could load nuclear fuel into the Tochka-U missile system in order to produce the explosive. Moscow supports the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) upcoming inspection of two Ukrainian sites in order to gather information about the country’s ‘dirty bomb’ plans, Putin stated. Earlier this week, the organization issued a statement that “the IAEA is preparing to visit the locations in the coming days. The purpose of the safeguards visits is to detect any possible undeclared nuclear activities and material.” In recent days, Russia has been contacting other countries to bring attention to the issue of the Ukrainian ‘dirty bomb’. “I instructed [Russian Defense Minister Sergey] Shoigu to call all of his counterparts and inform them on this [Kiev’s ‘dirty bomb’ plan],” the president said. Shoigu warned the US, British, French, Turkish, Indian, and Chinese defense ministers about the possible provocation. On Monday, the top diplomats of the US, UK, and France issued a joint statement rejecting Moscow’s claims as “transparently false allegations.” Their Ukrainian counterpart, Dmitry Kuleba, also denied the accusations and blamed Moscow for waging a disinformation campaign that “might be aimed at creating a pretext for a false flag operation.” In a letter on Tuesday to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, stressed that Moscow would consider the use of a ‘dirty bomb’ by Kiev “an act of nuclear terrorism.” On the same day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the attitude of Western nations to Russia’s warning on the Ukrainian ‘dirty bomb’ intentions is “unacceptable given the seriousness of the danger that we are talking about.”",3.4802911329252164,4.037181151430897,-0.5568900185056802,8
2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565466-putin-values-tens-genders/,Putin reveals his thoughts on gender theory,"All cultures in the world should be respected, including those that other nations may find weird, like the gender-obsessed culture seen in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. “Respecting the peculiarities of peoples and civilizations is in everyone’s interest. Actually, it is in the interest of the West too. As it loses superiority, it is quickly becoming a minority” culture-wise, the Russian president assessed during a speech on Thursday. That said, Western culture should be respected just like any other, Putin said. If Western elites believe that they can incorporate into the minds of their people, their societies things that I personally find somewhat weird, and which are apparently in fashion, like dozens of genders, and gay pride parades, so be it. Let them do whatever they want. But the West has no right to impose their cultural preferences on other nations and societies, he said, adding that Russia does not lecture others on how they should live, and does not want to be lectured either. Putin declared that his country has chosen to maintain “traditional values,” and went on to explain what he means by the term – not a universal set of rules, but many creeds that different societies created for themselves. “Their difference from the so-called neoliberal values is that in every case they are unique, because they stem from the traditions of a particular society, its culture, and historic experience,” the president stated. That is why you cannot force them on somebody. You should simply respect them, cherish what each nation picked for itself over centuries. The approach, Putin believes, is shared by most of humanity, unlike what the Western nations promote. The remarks were part of a keynote speech that Putin delivered at the Valdai Discussion Club, an international event hosted by Russia, where senior Russian officials voice ideas about global issues for other nations to discuss. In his address, Putin warned that the US and its allies are hurting themselves by trying to force other nations to be more like themselves. Political and cultural diversity is key in solving problems that humanity faces as a whole, he argued.",2.6619687472998708,1.925242075776259,0.7367266715236118,6
2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565472-russia-enemy-west-putin/,Russia is not an enemy of the West – Putin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin declared on Thursday that Russia is an “independent” civilization that does not consider itself an enemy of the West. Instead, he is concerned about the “aggressive” and “neo-colonial” liberal elite in charge of the bloc. “In the current conditions of a tough conflict, I will say some things directly,” Putin told a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club. “Russia, being an independent, original civilization, has never considered and does not consider itself an enemy of the West.” Hatred for American, British, French or German people “are the same form of racism as Russophobia and anti-Semitism,” he added. Putin went on to describe the West as two entities. On one hand, the traditional, primarily Christian West “is close to us in some ways,” he said, noting that “we have in many respects common and ancient roots.” “But there is another West – aggressive, cosmopolitan, neo-colonial, acting as an instrument of neo-liberal ideas. It is precisely with the dictates of this West that Russia, of course, will never put up with,” he continued. While Putin undoubtedly sees the conflict in Ukraine as an existential struggle against the West – describing his forces as fighting the “entire Western military machine” and blaming the derailment of peace talks and sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines on the “Anglo-Saxons,” he has drawn a distinction between Western elites and Western society before. Speaking at a ceremony following the accession of four formerly Ukrainian regions into the Russian Federation last month, Putin declared that “the Western elites target all societies, including the citizens of Western countries themselves.” While the West expands primarily to secure its “mercantile interest,” he stated at Thursday’s meeting, it also pushes its cultural exports on an unreceptive world. “If Western elites believe they can launch new trends like dozens of genders and gay parades, they have the right to do so,” he said. “But they don’t have the right to demand that others follow the same direction.” Putin also condemned the “pure Satanism” of Western liberal culture in his speech last month, noting that “many like-minded people in Europe and the United States” feel the same way. The Valdai Discussion Club is an annual international event in Russia conceived as a platform for floating ideas that the host nation considers important to discuss with other global players.

Russian statehood emerged in the territories of present-day Ukraine in the 9th century and that language differences only “emerged in the 14th and 15th century due to Polish meddling,” he added. Asked by the moderator if the current fighting in Ukraine amounts to civil war, Putin responded “Sort of, yes.” “We found ourselves in separate states for a series of reasons,” the Russian president explained, saying that the Soviet Union’s creators “decided to appease the nationalist tendencies of Bolsheviks native to Ukraine, and gifted them Russian ancestral lands without asking the people who lived there.” In this way, the Ukrainian Soviet Republic was granted all of the historical Little Russia, the entire Black Sea coast, and Donbass, Putin said. The Russian president was speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club, an annual international event in Russia conceived in 2004 as a platform for floating ideas that the host nation considers important to discuss with other global players. Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February, after NATO refused to rule out Kiev’s eventual accession to the bloc, which Moscow called an unacceptable threat to its national security.

2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565464-ukrainian-military-reinforces-belarus-border/,Ukraine says it ‘reinforced’ border with Belarus,"Kiev has amassed troops on its northern border with Belarus, a top Ukrainian military commander has revealed. Brigadier General Alexei Gromov acknowledged, however, that as of yet there is no sign of an enemy strike force ready for an offensive in the neighboring country. Speaking at a media briefing on Thursday, Gromov, the deputy commander of the Main Operations Department of Ukraine’s General Staff, said: “At present, we don’t see the actual formation of an offensive enemy group” in Belarus. He went on to warn, however, that “there are threats and they will remain.” He assured Ukrainians that the country’s military is keeping a close watch on the neighboring state and “has reinforced” its presence on the northern border. Gromov’s statement comes after Kiev and Minsk have each accused the other in recent weeks of plotting a military provocation on the border. Ukrainian officials have claimed, among other things, that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had launched a secret mobilization in his country. Speaking to journalists last Friday, however, the Belarusian leader denied those allegations, insisting that Belarus will not be involved in a military conflict unless other nations encroach on its territory. “We’re not going to go anywhere today. No war at present. We don’t need it,” Belarus’ state media outlet Belta quoted Lukashenko as saying. Earlier this month, the Belarusian president announced the deployment of a joint Russian-Belarusian contingent in the country. He cited “heightened tensions” on the country’s borders as the reason for the move at the time. Last Monday, the authorities in Minsk revealed that several thousand Russian military personnel along with 170 tanks, up to 200 armored vehicles, and up to 100 artillery guns would arrive in the country as part of the mission. Valery Revenko, an aide to the Belarusian defense minister, attributed the creation of the allied force to the “deployment of NATO forces near [their] borders amid a lack of dialogue.”",2.525125389957164,2.3480705725202475,0.17705481743691642,8
2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565465-putin-valdai-west-culture/,The US has nothing left to offer the world – Putin,"The US no longer has a model which is inspiring to the rest of the world and instead is maintaining its global dominance by throwing its weight around, Russian President Vladimir Putin asserted on Thursday. He added that Washington elites were now even bullying supposed allies who dissent from their neoliberal worldview. The Russian leader voiced his opinion that ""liberal democracy"" has changed beyond recognition and has transformed from a vehicle to promote freedom of speech and expression, to demanding the ‘cancelation’ of anyone with a different perspective. He was making his regular annual appearance at the Valdai Discussion Club, which was held in Moscow rather than Sochi, this year. ""They [American leaders] now have no creative ideas to promote positive development,"" Putin argued. ""They simply have nothing to offer the world, beyond maintaining their dominance."" Putin also noted that the US-led West has continued its policy of escalating tensions across the globe, and is trying to subjugate the world under its “rules-based order.” He added that it remains unclear who invented these rules, what they are based on, or what exactly they even are. The only thing that is understood, according to the president, is that the concept is meant to allow those who hold global power to live “without any rules at all,” and allow them to get away with doing whatever they want. “The West in recent years and especially in recent months has taken a number of steps towards escalation. They always play for escalation; there is nothing new here. This includes the incitement of war in Ukraine, provocations regarding Taiwan, and the destabilization of the world food and energy markets,” he said. Humanity now basically has two paths it can pursue, Putin stated. It can either be fractured and keep accumulating problems that will eventually bury it, or try to find “not ideal, but working” solutions to common issues. The president went on to stress the importance of preserving cultural diversity in the world, stating that the West is trying to flatten everything out to be identical and is blocking the “free creative development” of other civilizations and imposing its own style of development. “Simplification and the erasure of any and all differences have become almost the essence of the modern West. What is behind this simplification? First of all, this is the disappearance of the creative potential of the West itself,” Putin said. Meanwhile, Russian culture has become a target of “cancel culture,” or “the cancelation of culture,” according to the president, who noted that even during the Cold War, neither the US nor the USSR wished to deny the culture and achievements of the other side. “Book burnings was something that the Nazis resorted to during their time. Now, the works of Dostoyevsky and Tchaikovsky are being banned by the creators of this liberal society,” Putin said, adding that this “cancelation of culture” mows down everything living and creative. Nevertheless, he believes that “history will put everything in its place,” and the names Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky, and Pushkin will continue to live on, unlike the names of those who today try to dismiss the achievements of Russia’s greatest thinkers, and believe they have the right to dispose of the world’s cultures as they see fit.",1.784671609463418,2.3401931911372134,-0.5555215816737953,8
2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565444-russia-parliament-lgbt-propaganda-bill/,Russian MPs back full ban on ‘LGBT propaganda’,"Russia’s State Duma, the lower house of parliament, has given preliminary approval to a bill aimed at countering ‘LGBT propaganda.’ If passed, the law would introduce hefty fines for disseminating such material or justifying pedophilia. On Thursday, members of the Duma unanimously backed the bill, which is widely seen as a follow-up to a law passed in 2013, which prohibits the spread of ‘LGBT propaganda’ among those under 18. The new law would apply to the media, internet, literature, ‘audio-visual services,’ films, and advertisements. Breaching the new regulations would cost up to 400,000 rubles ($6,500) for individuals and up to 5 million rubles ($81,500) for legal entities. On top of that, foreign offenders would be expelled from Russia. Separate sections of the bill call for hefty fines for those promoting and “justifying” pedophilia as well as disseminating information that could encourage underage Russians to change their sex. Commenting on the proposed law, Vyacheslav Volodin, the chair of the State Duma, said that “there is still work to be done before the second hearing,” suggesting that the penalties may be even higher. “We should do our best to protect our children, those who want to lead a normal life,” he argued. Alexander Khinshtein, the chair of the Duma’s committee on information policy, clarified that the lawmakers were not seeking to outlaw LGBT, but rather “make sure there is no propaganda.” According to Khinshtein, the proposed legislation is further proof of Russia’s “civilizational confrontation with the West.” The lawmaker concluded that the new rules are needed to protect Russia’s health and demography.",2.5014594593342814,2.3014763507667877,0.19998310856749368,3

She entered the EU country as an Israeli citizen. The reality TV host and former presidential candidate left Russia and fled to Lithuania amid an extortion investigation against an employee of hers. Sobchak herself has also been named a suspect, RT reported, citing a source. Using her Israeli passport, Sobchak can legally stay in the EU for up to 90 days, Landsbergis explained. “There has never been a clear legal basis [to not let her in the country],” the foreign minister stressed. “But this does not mean that it cannot arise,” he added, noting that if such a basis does arise, a person can be put on the blacklist even after crossing the border. Such decisions are based on whether one’s “presence poses a threat to national security,” Landsbergis clarified, as cited by Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT. The Baltic state earlier imposed tough restrictions on Russian travelers, banning entry except for diplomatic or family reasons, and several others. Sobchak left Russia in the wake of the arrest on Wednesday of the commercial manager of her ‘Ostorozhno Media’ (Beware Media) group, Kirill Sukhanov. Sukhanov and Arian Romanovsky, the former editor-in-chief of Tatler Russia magazine, have been accused of extorting money from Sergey Chemezov, the head of Russian state-controlled technology conglomerate Rostec, the Russian news agency TASS reported, citing case files. According to TASS, prosecutors claim the two suspects had demanded money in exchange for guaranteeing that Chemezov would not receive critical coverage on the Telegram channel ‘Tushite svet’ (‘Lights out’) under their control, which specializes in celebrity gossip. Sobchak, who is reportedly a person of interest in the same investigation, categorically denied any involvement. On Thursday, she stated that she had never written messages on, or had any control over, any of the Telegram channels mentioned in the court papers. She previously expressed support for her employee and called the case against him an attack on “the last free newsroom” in Russia. The journalist had not informed the country’s law enforcement agencies on her second citizenship, sources told TASS. Ksenia Sobchak is the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, who served as the mayor of St. Petersburg in the 1990s and is considered President Vladimir Putin’s political mentor. She made a successful media career in Russia and became a recognizable figure in the liberal opposition.

2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565452-ukraine-us-cluster-munitions/,Kiev asks for cluster munitions – media,"Ukrainian officials have been pressuring the US to supply controversial cluster munitions to fight Russia, Foreign Policy has reported. The Pentagon sits on a stockpile of weaponry that many other nations have banned, but is barred from exporting them by law. “We are requesting new rounds all the time that have longer range and more explosiveness,” a Ukrainian military official was quoted by the magazine as saying on the condition of anonymity. “We need them to destroy Russian fortifications on our territory.” The outlet reports that Kiev submitted initial requests a month ago, due to the wear and tear of its own Soviet-made artillery and a need to further switch to NATO rounds. The report said Ukraine asked for DPICMs, or dual-purpose improved conventional munitions, which come in various NATO calibers and contain different kinds of submunitions tailored for anti-personnel and anti-armor roles – hence “dual-purpose.” Like most other types of cluster munitions, they are controversial because their use can leave behind unexploded submunitions that pose a threat to civilians. The 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), which most EU members signed, bans these types of weapons, but neither Ukraine nor the US (nor Russia) are signatories. Washington reversed its pledge not to use cluster munitions in 2017, but retains a ban on exporting them, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). While the Pentagon has a large number of DPICMs in its stockpile, Foreign Policy reports that Russia hawks on Capitol Hill are frustrated by Washington’s inability to send cluster rounds to Ukraine. “These cluster munitions were literally designed specifically with Soviet advantages in artillery tubes in mind,” a congressional aide familiar with the request was quoted as saying. “The Ukrainians are saying, ‘You have these weapons purpose-built for the type of threat we’re facing — why can’t we have them’?” There were multiple reports of Kiev’s use of Soviet cluster weapons in residential areas, both before and after Moscow sent its troops into the country. Most notably in March, when a Tochka-U missile with a cluster payload killed more than 20 people and injured dozens of others in Donetsk. Kiev denied responsibility for the attack. HRW said in May it could not verify the claims.",2.695334793865468,2.3191449559246977,0.3761898379407702,9

Humanity basically now has two paths it can pursue, Putin stated. It can either be fractured and keep accumulating problems that will eventually bury it, or try to find “may be not ideal, but working” solutions to common issues. The Russian leader said he believes in common sense and is convinced that sooner or later “new centers of power in the multipolar world and the West will have to start talking as equals about our common future.” He was speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club meeting outside Moscow, in conversation with Russian foreign policy expert Fyodor Lyukyanov. The West and its allies are playing a “dirty game,” the prize for which is global dominance, Putin explained. However, the US and its allies are not safe from the consequences of their own actions, he added. “Power over the world is what the West has put at stake in the game it plays. This game is certainly dangerous, bloody and I would call it dirty.” He offered his view that Western nations deny others on the global scene the right to any kind of independence, be it political, economical or cultural. Last December, Russia’s proposals to address its concerns about national security were “tossed aside” by Washington, he noted. “But in the modern world, sitting aside is hardly an option. He who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind, as the proverb says,” he added, pointing out that the ongoing global crisis affects everyone and all aspects of life. The president noted that while the disruption of the ecological balance threatens biodiversity, diversity of political thought, social norms, and culture is as important as genetic diversity. Western nations, which want to impose their values and vision as universal, are robbing everyone, including themselves, Putin reasoned. “First of all, this eradicates the creative potential of the West itself,” he warned. “There is a mercantile interest here too” the Russian leader added, explaining that a homogenous society makes selling things simpler. Our adversaries, as I would call them, are trying to expand markets for their products. It’s ultimately as primitive as that. He cited the famous 1978 ‘Harvard Speech’ by the Soviet-era dissident writer and philosopher Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who said that the West was suffering from “a blindness of superiority.” Solzhenitsyn believed that liberal democracies considered their system to be superior and believed that all nations strived to become like them, fighting against the will of “evil rulers”, natural hardships or lack of education. Putin described the phenomenon that Solzhenitsyn referred to as “racist and neocolonial” in nature. It has assumed “ugly forms” since the period of unipolar domination of the US in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, he added. He warned that anyone who perceives themselves as “flawless” would be tempted to utterly destroy everyone else, to “cancel them.” Even at the peak of the Cold War, neither the Soviet bloc nor the West had such a dismissive attitude toward its adversaries, Putin said. The Valdai Discussion Club is an annual international event in Russia conceived as a platform for floating ideas that the host nation considers important to discuss with other global players. The forum was created in 2004. This year’s meeting comes amid unprecedented tensions between the West and Russia over the crisis in Ukraine.

2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565446-signal-putin-zelensky-peskov/,Kremlin clarifies reports on Putin's ‘message’ to Zelensky,"Russian President Vladimir Putin didn’t ask the visiting head of Guinea-Bissau, Umaro Sissoco Embalo, to relay any special message to his Ukrainian counterpart, Vladimir Zelensky, the Kremlin has insisted. During Embalo’s visit to Moscow on Tuesday, Putin briefed him about how Russian-Ukrainian peace talks had collapsed after Kiev pulled out of them, spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists on Thursday. Among other things, the Russian leader reiterated that Moscow was ready for negotiations, provided that Kiev changes its stance on the issue. “Our colleague from the African state said he would have contacts [with Zelensky] and that he would relay Putin’s position to the Ukrainian side,” Peskov explained. “There was no specific message” involved. Embalo met with Zelensky in Kiev on Wednesday and mentioned his talks with Putin during a joint press conference. The host described the words of his guest as “a signal from the Russian side” but dismissed the notion as mere rhetoric aimed at “nations that have not yet cut political ties” with Moscow. “For a dialogue to happen one nation has to respect another nation, respect its territorial integrity, sovereignty and borders,” he added. The position outlined by Peskov was voiced publicly by numerous other Russian officials, including the president. Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council last month banned any talks with Russia as long as Putin remains in power, a motion that Zelensky signed into law. The Ukrainian president said that his country’s sole goal in the conflict was to defeat Russia on the battlefield and capture all territories that Kiev claims under its sovereignty. Peace talks can happen only after this objective is reached, he asserted. Zelensky is counting on the help of the US and its allies in supplying arms, intelligence and money to Ukraine for as long as it needs the support.",1.944046829640302,1.702474784609569,0.24157204503073304,8
2022-10-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/565432-commercial-satellites-target-ukraine/,Russia makes veiled threat against Musk’s Starlink satellites,"Western nations have been using formally civilian space assets to conduct military action against Moscow in Ukraine, a Russian diplomat has said, warning that the country may consider these types of satellites to be legitimate military targets. Speaking at a space event at the UN on Wednesday, Russian representative Konstantin Vorontsov expressed concern about the “extremely dangerous” trend that “came to the forefront during the conflict in Ukraine.” The US and its allies have been using “elements of the civilian space infrastructure, including commercial, for military purposes.” “These nations apparently do not quite realize that such activity essentially constitutes an involvement in military action through a proxy. Quasi-civilian infrastructure may be considered a legitimate target for a retaliatory strike,” he warned. Vorontsov, who serves as deputy head of the non-proliferation department in the Russian Foreign Ministry, said this path of escalation could become disastrous for all nations relying on space technology in their lives. He urged international discussion of the situation to prevent a “full-scale arms race in space.” The US has been supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia with arms supplies and other forms of military aid, such as intelligence, while claiming not to be directly involved in the conflict. General John Raymond, the head of US space operations, said in July that “commercial space has been very important in providing capabilities that have been helpful to Ukraine.” One well-known case is the supply of Starlink ground equipment to Ukraine. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has provided access to satellite broadband internet service to Kiev’s troops. Senior figures in Washington praised Musk for this. Last month, Eric Schmidt, a former Google executive who has close ties to the US national security apparatus, called the man “a genuine hero” for giving Starlink to Ukraine. US media revealed that SpaceX had been asking the Pentagon to foot the bill for services rendered to Ukraine. Musk eventually caved in to pressure and promised that Kiev will continue receiving free internet from his company. He previously estimated that $80 million in equipment and services had been provided to Ukraine, and predicted it would top $100 million by the end of 2022.",1.7774242007743193,2.1585049204407905,-0.38108071966647117,7

Embalo made this revelation at a joint press conference with Zelensky in Kiev, one day after his meeting with Putin. “My dear brother, yesterday I was in Russia with President [Vladimir] Putin, who asked me to give you a message, to talk to you, considering that a direct dialogue is very important for our future joint actions,” Embalo said. A video of the press conference was published on Zelensky’s Telegram channel, with Embalo’s remarks translated into Ukrainian. The president of Guinea-Bissau also revealed that he saw himself as the “bearer of certain impulses” by contributing to the restoration of relations between Russia and Ukraine. Before his meeting with Zelensky, Embalo told journalists that he found Putin “to be very open to negotiating with President Zelensky” and that he was looking forward “to conveying this goodwill” to the Ukrainian leader. Zelensky, responding at the press conference to Embalo’s remarks, said that in order to build bridges between countries, “one should not blow up the infrastructure.” Zelensky was apparently referring to the strikes on Ukraine’s power stations launched by Russia on October 10 in what Moscow described as retaliation for Kiev’s “terrorist attack” on the Crimean Bridge. The Ukrainian leader also said that any conversation involves respect of one country for another one, starting from respecting “its territorial integrity, sovereignty, and borders.” Earlier this month, Putin cited Ukraine’s refusal to talk as the reason behind the absence of negotiations between the two countries. He also noted that during Türkiye-mediated talks in late March, Russia and Ukraine reached a preliminary agreement, but as soon as Russian troops were pulled back from Kiev, “the leadership in Kiev lost all desire to have talks.” Putin’s remarks came soon after Zelensky signed a decree forbidding any negotiations with him and declaring Ukraine will only talk to Russia when it has a different president. The Ukrainian leader has repeatedly stated that his only goal in the conflict is to defeat Russia on the battlefield and to retake control of all of the territories that Kiev believes to be under its sovereignty.",2.0785229659597655,2.562000400410468,-0.4834774344507027,8
2022-10-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/565401-azov-street-kiev-name/,Kiev street renamed to honor neo-Nazis,"A street in Kiev previously named in honor of Soviet Marshal Rodion Malinovsky was officially renamed on Wednesday to celebrate the “heroes” of the notorious Azov Battalion, many of whose members openly proclaim neo-Nazi ideology. Malinovsky, a Ukrainian by origin, liberated much of southern Ukraine, including his home city of Odessa, from the Nazis in 1943-1944. Twice a Hero of the Soviet Union, the marshal served for ten years as the country’s minister of defense. Remarkably, the ceremony to rename the street that used to bear his name took place exactly 65 years after he was appointed to the ministerial post on October 26, 1957. According to the Azov Battalion website, the renaming ceremony was attended by representatives of the Kiev City Council and the Obolon District administration. Also in attendance were members of the battalion itself. Its founder and first commander, Andrey Biletsky, nicknamed the ‘White Ruler’ by fellow Neo-Nazis, explained that the new name of the street, ‘Heroes of the Azov Regiment’, is “primarily about those who will not return” and those “who are in captivity.” The official renaming of the street took place about two months after the mayor of the Ukrainian capital, Vitaly Klitschko, announced a decision by the Kiev City Council to rename 95 streets in the city. He described the move as “an important step towards reducing the deceitful manipulations and influence of the Russian aggressor on the interpretation of our history.” Klitschko also revealed that the new name of Marshal Malinovsky Street would honor the Azov Battalion. The Azov Battalion was assembled in 2014 as a volunteer unit that mainly comprised far-right activists willing to fight against the self-proclaimed republics in the Donbass region. Several months later, it was officially incorporated into Ukraine’s National Guard by order of then-President Pyotr Poroshenko. When the Russian offensive started in late February, the Azov Battalion, which had received Western training, was considered one of the most capable formations under Kiev’s command. The neo-Nazi fighters were tasked with keeping Mariupol, a strategic port on the Azov Sea, under Kiev’s control, but ultimately failed to do so. Many of them were killed, while the rest, including the commanders, surrendered to Russian forces in May after being holed up at the Azovstal steel plant for weeks. During the siege, Moscow accused the Azov of keeping civilians hostage in the facility and using them as human shields.",3.273330464809875,2.8694213713491794,0.4039090934606957,5

The Russian leader called on the participants of the meeting to bolster cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts and noted that there were “serious challenges” posed by the emerging black arms markets in Ukraine. Putin claimed that “cross-border criminal groups” were actively involved in smuggling weapons to other regions and that it wasn’t just small firearms. “There is a persistent risk of criminals getting hold of more powerful weapons, including portable air defense systems and precision weapons.” The president’s statement comes after Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, warned last month that corrupt Ukrainian officials had established channels to deliver Western-supplied weapons onto the global black market. Meanwhile, the West’s top military officials have admitted that it is nearly impossible to effectively track where the billions of dollars worth of arms delivered to Ukraine actually end up. Pentagon Inspector General Sean O’Donnell told Bloomberg in August that there was almost no fidelity as the Ukrainians still used paper “hand receipts” to trace supplied weapons. CBS News also reported that some 70% of weapons supplied to Ukraine never make it to the front lines as they have to pass through a network of “power lords, oligarchs and political players.” “There is really no information as to where they’re going at all,” Donatella Rovera, a senior crisis adviser with Amnesty international told the outlet, adding that it was “really worrying” that the countries supplying these weapons do not find it necessary to put in place robust oversight mechanisms. CBS was later pressured, however, to pull the documentary and amend the story after the channel was accused of spreading “Russian propaganda.” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhail Podoliak has insisted there is “no proof” that weapons entering the country were unaccounted for. Ukraine has insisted that an uninterrupted flow of Western weapons is the key to the country’s survival on the battlefield.

Meanwhile, her house near Moscow has been searched amid an ongoing criminal investigation, RT’s sources have disclosed. Sobchak is believed to have fled the country the day before, traveling to Lithuania through Belarus, according to law enforcement officials, who claimed they had an order for her arrest. The news comes the day after police arrested the commercial director of Sobchak’s 'Ostorozhno Media' (Beware Media) group, Kirill Sukhanov. His detention was reportedly related to an investigation dealing with extortion. On Wednesday, the authorities also detained the former editor-in-chief of Tatler Russia magazine, Arian Romanovsky. He has been charged with large-scale extortion, which also carries a maximum prison sentence of up to 15 years. Law enforcement officials noted that the search conducted at Sobchak’s villa outside Moscow on Wednesday was also part of the investigation, and that she is a suspect in the criminal case and has also been charged with large-scale extortion. Sobchak herself has yet to confirm or deny having fled Russia, although she did acknowledge the arrest of Sukhanov, claiming it was part of a pressure campaign against Russian journalists. According to sources cited by RIA News agency, the investigation is part of a crackdown by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on owners and administrators of Telegram channels that have reportedly published fake information about business leaders and high-ranking officials, and have demanded money for deleting such posts. Ksenia Sobchak is the daughter of the late St. Petersburg mayor Anatoly Sobchak, who was considered to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s political mentor.

Dmitry Lubinets, who holds the post of commissioner for human rights in Ukraine’s parliament, accused the Russian Red Cross of backing the partial mobilization, which was announced by President Vladimir Putin last month. By providing assistance to the mobilization efforts, the organization “supports a bloody war” in Ukraine, he added. As a result, Lubinets claimed that the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross, should expel their Russian branch and strip it of its signature emblem. The official went on to stress that “social protection of the families of military personnel who went to war in a foreign independent and sovereign country cannot be humane,” adding that this would only “increase the number of civilians who will be tortured and killed in Ukraine.” His comments come a day after the Ukrainian Red Cross accused its Russian counterpart of “repeatedly violating the principle of neutrality” by helping Moscow’s military personnel. It urged its international partners to “take strict measures” to stop such actions. In early October, the Russian Red Cross announced “centralized fundraising” to provide humanitarian aid to the families of Russian service members, including those who had been mobilized. In a statement, Pavel Savchuk, the organization’s chair, noted that “the families of the mobilized citizens are now facing a number of difficulties,” given that many worry about their loved ones who are now involved in the conflict. Some people may also be in need of financial or humanitarian aid, he added. “Therefore, it is very important to support them now,” he stressed. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is a global humanitarian organization of 80 million people that helps those facing disaster, conflict and health and social problems.

Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu described the aim of the exercises as testing “Russia’s strategic offensive forces’ readiness to conduct a massive nuclear strike in response to an enemy nuclear strike.” According to the Kremlin, land, sea, and aviation deterrence forces took part in the maneuvers. Targets located on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia’s Far East were obliterated by the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile, fired from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Arkhangelsk Region, and the Sineva ballistic missile, launched from the Barents Sea. Tu-95 strategic bombers also took part in the exercises. President Putin ordered the readiness level of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces to be increased in late February, days after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. In recent weeks, the US and several other Western powers have claimed that Moscow is planning to conduct a tactical nuclear strike in Ukraine – which the Kremlin has vehemently denied.

They are believed to be more infectious than the dominant strains in the country, but the health authorities do not expect a significant surge in cases. BQ.1 and its closely related descendant BQ.1.1 are both sub-liniages of the Omicron variant of the SARS CoV-2 virus. The former branched from the BA.5 sub-variant and both are currently spreading in the US and Europe. Some people have dubbed them Typhon and Cerberus, respectively. According to Popova, the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants have remained dominant in Russia. The newly discovered strains are more infectious, according to studies, but display similar symptoms and are comparable in terms of the protection offered by vaccination, she said. “At this point, our scientists do not predict any rapid disruptive increase in the number of cases,” the official said. “We are not planning to introduce any restrictions because we have no reasons to do so.” She predicted there would certainly be a seasonal increase in respiratory infections in Russia, but that the situation would remain manageable for the health authorities.

There is a large number of foreigners there, in the thousands,” Evgeny Balitsky, the acting governor of Zaporozhye Region, told Russian TV on Wednesday. He said this information comes from people living in the Ukrainian-controlled provincial capital who talk to relatives and friends on the Russian side of the frontline. People see military preparations with their own eyes and hear people talking in Polish, German, and English in the streets, he explained. Russia incorporated the region as part of its territory this month, after residents in the eastern part voted in a referendum to split with Ukraine and join Russia. The city of Zaporozhye, which is located in the northwest, has remained under Kiev’s control. The Ukrainian government called the vote a “sham” and pledged to retake all territories that it claims as its own. The comparison to Mariupol refers to the Black Sea port city which was fully captured by Russia in May after the last Ukrainian troops surrendered. The fighters, many of them members of the neo-Nazi Azov regiment, spent weeks defending the Azovstal steelworks, a huge Soviet-built factory with a massive underground area designed to serve as a bunker during times of war. According to Balitsky, the AvtoZAZ automobile plant in the south of Zaporozhye is being prepared to be used the same way Azovstal was in Mariupol. The Russian official also cited reports that the foreigners in Zaporozhye were acting “very brash” with the local population. “They simply take over places they want and turn them into military outposts,” he claimed. The mercenaries, he added, were mostly “soldiers of fortune” and thrill-seekers. “They came to hunt, to loot, to act here in our lands with total impunity,” the official said, adding that there have been reports of foreigners harassing locals. He blamed Washington and Kiev for this, saying neither of them care about the people in the city and are fine with the troops acting as occupiers rather than defenders.",3.0747294051193763,4.119617317836618,-1.044887912717242,2

The comments came in an interview with Politico published on Tuesday. The testing ground idea was previously expressed by Reznikov’s deputy, Vladimir Gavrilov, who claimed that some American defense contractors were fielding their prototypes in Ukraine. Kiev expects military aid from NATO members to continue flowing into the country for years and wants to benefit more from it, Reznikov said. For example, Ukraine could start joint ventures with Poland, the UK, or Germany to produce weapons. “We have to develop a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) industry not only for aerial drones but also on land and in the sea because it’s the future” of warfare, he noted. He was also skeptical about restrictions under which Ukraine’s supporters are shipping arms to Kiev. As the conflict with Russia unfolded, the US and its allies have repeatedly reconsidered previous decisions not to send heavier weapons, the defense minister pointed out. “I’m really optimistic that Abrams tanks are possible in the future and I am sure that fighter jets like F-16s, F-15s, or Gripen from Sweden will also be possible,” he said. Washington was initially reluctant to provide lethal aid to Ukraine out of concern that Russia would consider it an escalation but gradually reconsidered and supplied increasingly sophisticated weapons, which Reznikov sees as a favorable trend. Western officials cited logistical issues with training Ukrainian pilots and maintenance of the fighter jets among the reasons why Ukraine can’t get F-16s or F-15s. But according to media reports, Kiev may get them in the long run. Reznikov said European NATO allies were looking to the US in their aid decisions, so it was up to Washington to up the ante. “After the first Abrams [arrives] I’m sure we will have Leopards, Marders, and other types of heavy armored vehicles like tanks,” he told the news outlet. Among the weapons the US most recently designated for Ukraine are the NASAMS air defense systems.

In an interview with Polskie radio, he expressed concern over a possible repeat of the 2021 migrant crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border. He cited a “hybrid war” allegedly unleashed by Minsk and Moscow as the reason for his concern, as well as the opening of Kaliningrad’s skies for flights “from Turkey, Syria and Belarus.” “We will have to strengthen our forces on this section of the border and also consider building similar border fortifications to those we now have on the Polish-Belarusian section,” the official said. Sobolewski revealed that he views last year’s crisis on the Belarusian border, as well as potential future crisis on the border with Kaliningrad, as part of a “hybrid war,” involving migrants allegedly launched by Russia and Belarus. Poland must do everything it can to prevent Moscow and Minsk from succeeding, he said. In a later comment for Reuters, Sobolewski predicted that migrants might start trying to cross from Kaliningrad into Poland in the very near future. “After what we had to deal with, and are still dealing with on the Polish-Belarus border, and considering the opening of the skies above the Kaliningrad region for airplanes from Turkey, Syria and Belarus, it could be in the coming weeks,” Sobolewski said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the idea of building a wall on the Polish side of the border, said that “Russia cannot and is not going to interfere with such decisions.” “History every time proves the silliness of decisions to build walls, because over the years or decades, all walls fall,” he said. The migrant crisis on the border between Belarus and Poland began in June last year, when Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said his government would no longer help the EU stop illegal immigration since his country does not have the budget to do so due to the bloc’s own sanctions. Brussels and Polish authorities accused him of “weaponizing” migrants by flying them into his country and transporting them to the border, allegedly as part of a “hybrid war” against the West. Minsk has denied the accusations. The crisis prompted Finland's parliament to approve new security measures along the country’s border with Russia. Earlier this month, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said she believed there was “wide support” among lawmakers for the construction of a border fence.",2.765429479635775,2.0189621705244805,0.7464673091112943,8

According to the official, Kiev expects the EU to cover roughly half of that sum. “We believe that Germany could take on about $500 million a month,” Rodnyansky said, adding that it would be especially necessary in 2023. “The state has to function, pensions have to be paid.” Kiev also hopes to get around $2 billion per month from the EU as a whole, the German outlet added. It is unclear if this sum would balloon further in the future, since Ukraine expects its inflation to reach 24.5% in 2022, according to the nation’s central bank. The presidential aide accused Russia of opening “an economic front in the war” by targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Moscow has already succeeded in “choking off Ukrainian electricity exports,” he said, adding that Ukrainians would face “a very big crisis” this winter and would urgently need “thermal clothing, emergency power and diesel generators” among other goods. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck already called for an “urgent winter aid” package for Ukraine, which would include power generators, transformers and network repair equipment. Germany itself is facing an acute energy crunch and is attempting to limit consumption amid high gas and energy prices caused partly by the EU’s drive to reduce its dependency on Russian energy imports. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal also put the total cost of Ukraine’s infrastructure recovery at around $750 billion on Monday. According to Funke, this sum includes the costs of developing and modernizing areas that have not been affected by Kiev’s conflict with Russia. The World Bank and the US believe the real cost of rebuilding Ukraine is half as high and amounts to around $350 billion, the media group reported. On Monday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the German-Ukrainian Economic Forum, which is currently being held in Berlin, that his government wants Ukraine to become a full EU member and should plan its rebuilding efforts “with the goal of Ukraine as a member of the EU in mind.” Ukraine’s transport and logistics infrastructure should be rebuilt in a way that would allow it to be quickly connected to that of the bloc, he added.",2.4506392109852224,2.0106663263102758,0.43997288467494666,7
2022-10-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/565338-exposure-ukraine-dirty-bomb/,Exposure of ‘dirty bomb’ plans caused panic in Kiev – Russia,"Kiev might be shelving its alleged ‘dirty bomb’ program after Russia exposed it, Moscow’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, claimed on Tuesday. He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection. Over the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a ‘dirty bomb’, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material. Ukraine has categorically denied Moscow’s claims. “If you read the Ukrainian Telegram channels, you would see that there is a lot of fuss in the Ukrainian ruling circles now because of the campaign that we have started to launch, and there are many signs that they are trying to sort of wind down this program,” Polyansky said, as quoted by RIA Novosti. In his opinion, Ukraine has enough time to scale back the ‘dirty bomb’ plans before the upcoming visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors. “They can come, but I am telling you that a ‘dirty bomb’ is not a very complex device,” Polyansky explained, adding that there is no guarantee that Kiev will not resume its alleged activity after the inspectors depart. At the same time, the official claimed that the danger of Kiev using a ‘dirty bomb’ remains “very high,” and that Ukraine “has the opportunity” and “has every reason to use it.” Earlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Russian mission’s head, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow would consider the use of a 'dirty bomb' by Ukraine “an act of nuclear terrorism.” Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba earlier called the Russian allegations “as absurd as they are dangerous.” He also noted that “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.” On Tuesday, the minister revealed that Ukraine had invited IAEA inspectors to come and to “prove that Ukraine has neither any dirty bombs nor plans to develop them.” “Good cooperation with IAEA and partners allows us to foil Russia’s ‘dirty bomb’ disinfo campaign,” Kuleba said. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, commenting on the matter, said that “all parties should avoid any actions that could lead to miscalculation and escalation of what’s already a devastating conflict.” Meanwhile, the Pentagon claimed that Russia’s allegations against Ukraine were “transparently false.” NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies “reject the allegation” and believe that Russia “must not use it as a pretext” for further escalation.",3.350977496436454,2.7338365331548986,0.6171409632815554,9
2022-10-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/565326-vereschuk-ukraine-refugees-return/,Ukrainians abroad told not to return home this winter,"Ukrainians who have fled the country amid Russia’s military offensive should not return home before spring, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said on Tuesday. Staying away would protect them from unnecessary risk and help the country “survive” its deepening energy crisis, she added. Speaking on national TV on Tuesday, Vereshchuk claimed Russia was losing on the battlefield and had therefore turned to “terrorizing the civilian population” by targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure. “I will ask you not to return, we need to survive the winter. Unfortunately, the power grids will not survive, you see what Russia is doing. You don’t need to do this. If you have the opportunity to stay, it’s better to spend the winter abroad,” Vereshchuk said. She said she would like to see everyone return in the spring to rebuild Ukrainian cities and villages together. “Our children must live and study here, but for now let’s hold back, because we understand that the situation will worsen, and we have to survive the winter. We will survive the winter, and then we will think about everything else,” she added. According to a poll published by the Kiev-based Razumkov center in late August, more than 90% of Ukrainian refugees plan to return home at some point. More than 88% of those intending to return plan to live in the same region where they lived prior to the beginning of the Russian attack on February 24. Ukraine has been experiencing regular blackouts since Moscow launched massive strikes against its critical infrastructure, including power stations on October 10, accusing Kiev of terrorist attacks on Russian infrastructure. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has since asked his compatriots to ease pressure on the struggling energy system by limiting electricity use between 5pm and 11pm. On Monday, the head of the state-owned energy giant Naftogaz, Yuri Vitrenko, said that Ukraine was facing “the worst winter in history,” marked by “constant power outages.” He explained that recent Russian airstrikes have also hit oil refineries and destroyed “about 40% of the power generation plants.” On the same day, the Ukrainian online retailer Rozetka revealed that the last two weeks had seen a sharp increase in demand for “goods needed in the event of an energy crisis,” such as potbelly stoves, power banks, candles and gas burners.",2.373585492816262,2.6093185095422635,-0.23573301672600167,7
2022-10-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/565319-russia-ukraine-bomb-claim/,West’s reaction to ‘dirty bomb’ claims ‘unacceptable’ – Kremlin,"The West is wrong to ignore Russia’s warning that Ukraine plans to detonate a so-called dirty bomb, a conventional munition with radioactive elements, the Kremlin has said. Russia has been insisting that Kiev wants to use a weapon of mass destruction to frame Moscow. However, the US and other Western countries have dismissed the claim. “This attitude, far from being serious, is unacceptable given the seriousness of the danger that we are talking about,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday. “Once again, we are emphasizing the grave danger that stems from the implementation of the plans the Ukrainians have,” he said. Russia has requested to convene the UN Security Council to discuss Kiev’s alleged plans. Moscow previously briefed the council members and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the matter. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu relayed Moscow’s concerns to his British, French, and Turkish counterparts on Sunday, and also spoke over the phone to US Secretary of State Lloyd Austin. The next day, Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s top general, raised the issue during phone calls with US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley and with his British counterpart, Admiral Tony Radakin. Ukraine has rejected the allegation, with Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba saying that Russia’s claims “are as absurd, as they are dangerous.” The minister insisted that Ukraine does not have such a bomb, nor does it intend to make one. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin dismissed Russia’s allegations against Ukraine again on Monday, saying that they are “false.”",3.117811060026695,2.6184594638232705,0.4993515962034243,8
2022-10-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/565307-motor-sich-prisoner-swap/,‘Hero of Ukraine’ could be swapped with Russia – Zelensky aide,"The head of a prestigious Ukrainian manufacturer of aircraft engines, Motor Sich, could be used in a prisoner swap with Russia, an aide to President Vladimir Zelensky told local media. Vyacheslav Boguslaev was accused of treason and arrested for allegedly selling products to Moscow. A court in Kiev ordered the pretrial detention of Boguslaev, 83, on Monday, after the domestic security agency (SBU) claimed that the man had been secretly selling spare parts and engines to Russian helicopter producers. Commenting on the news on the same day, Zelensky aide Mikhail Podoliak suggested that the man could be swapped for troops captured by Russian forces. “We will use any opportunity, any individual… to get our guys back,” he said, describing Boguslaev as a “fake” Ukrainian national, unlike the soldiers he could be swapped for. The Kremlin responded to the idea on Tuesday, expressing skepticism about its source. The Russian presidential office is not dealing with prisoner exchanges, “and as far as we know, neither is Mr. Podoliak,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. In the interview, Podoliak hailed the arrest of Boguslaev, stating that Zelensky’s office had an “absolutely positive reaction” to it. He expressed hope that more prosecutions like this will follow. “We have plenty of subjects like that one. For 30 years, they have been building careers, including by serving Russian political and economic interests,” he said. “Here, they were honored with titles like Hero of Ukraine, and had patrons on different levels.” In addition to being at the helm of Motor Sich since 1991, Boguslaev is a veteran politician. He served as an MP for several terms and held various advisory positions under former Ukrainian presidents, from Leonid Kravchuk to Viktor Yanukovich. In 2000, he was awarded ‘Hero of Ukraine’ for his accomplishments – one of many honors he has received. Podoliak called Boguslaev a “red director,” a term used for former Soviet officials who privatized factories that they controlled in the wake of the collapse of the USSR. Last year, Zelensky ordered the nationalization of Motor Sich amid a row with investors from China over ownership of the company. According to the presidential aide, “a third of the public, or rather the political class” in Ukraine is “oriented towards Russia” in some way. “The era of post-Soviet icons is over. I really hope that in addition to Boguslaev, other ‘red directors’, who have not picked a side” will be held accountable, he said, arguing that the conflict against Russia has made this possible. “I believe a final solution regarding them needs to be taken.” Ukrainian prosecutors have charged Boguslaev with treason, a felony that could result in a sentence of at least ten years in prison. The first hearing against him was held behind closed doors. Another Motor Sich official, export department head Oleg Dzyuba, was also arrested.",3.3980135767378123,2.9844411815917518,0.4135723951460606,5
2022-10-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/565149-end-of-russian-civil-war/,The Russian Civil War ended 100 years ago: Here's how Western powers played a significant part in the outcome,"One hundred years ago, on October 25, 1922, the Russian Civil War drew to a close. It was on that day that the Provisional Priamurye Government in the Russian Far East, the last anti-Bolshevik Russian state enclave, ceased to exist. The remnants of the White movement left Vladivostok. By that time, the territory of the former Russian Empire was almost entirely controlled by the Bolsheviks, although islands of resistance continued popping up sporadically in various parts of the country for several more years. The Russian Civil War wasn't similar to other such conflicts that most people know. Unlike the American Civil War fought between the Northern and Southern states or the Spanish Civil War between the Francoist forces and the Republicans, the fighting in Russia was not simply a standoff between two uncompromising sides. The opponents of the Bolsheviks, which were collectively known as the ‘Whites’, were unable to present a united front against the ‘Reds’ due to discord within their own ranks. Moreover, separatists who were active on the periphery and generally leaned towards the Communists often intervened in the confrontation between the main warring groups and factions, which were the Bolsheviks, Monarchists, Februarists, Mensheviks, Socialists, Anarchists and other scattered forces adhering to various ideologies. The theater of the Russian Civil War looked very much like a blood-covered patchwork quilt on fire, with short-lived state entities appearing now and then across the vast expanse of the country. It was an ‘all-against-all’ kind of warfare, with numerous coalitions and alliances formed and then disbanded time and again. As this was happening, however, the Bolsheviks claimed more and more Russian territory. And the Allied interventions – coming from states that had previously been friendly with the Russian Empire and were even supposed to help it crush the Bolshevik regime – took place right in the middle of all that bloody chaos. But instead of supporting Tsarist Russia, their course of action ended up serving the Bolsheviks’ goals. RT looks back at how the global community exploited the country's weakness and, instead of trying to disrupt the formation of a state that would later evolve into one of its bitterest enemies, on the ruins of imperial Russia, did its best to facilitate the process. It’s probably no coincidence that the official start date of the Russian Civil War is identified by many historians as the revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion – on May 17, 1918 – even though by that time hostilities had already been going in the south for a few months. The Czechoslovak Legion was a volunteer armed force with the Russian Imperial Army composed predominantly of Czechs and Slovaks fighting on the side of the Entente powers during World War I. In the fall of 1917, the Russian Provisional Government granted the group permission to increase its force by enlisting Czech and Slovak prisoners of war and deserters from the Austro-Hungarian Army, many of whom wished to fight the Austro-Hungarian Empire for the independence of their homelands and gladly joined the Russians. The decision backfired after the October Revolution ended the Provisional Government and the Bolsheviks moved to sign a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers, thus effectively undoing a lot of the Russian Empire’s achievements of the previous decades. The Czechs hurried to denounce the new revolution and declare their support for the deposed government. Thus, formally, the Czechs turned against the Bolsheviks, but it became clear over the course of the conflict that they were primarily fighting for themselves rather than for any other cause. First, the Czechoslovak Legion was swiftly reassigned to the command of Paris and effectively became a part of the French army. Second, one of the founders and leaders of the Legion, Tomas Masaryk, who was also the future first president of Czechoslovakia, was actively involved in negotiations with all parties to the Russian Civil War. He abstained from siding with the White movement, tried to forge a relationship with the Bolsheviks and even allowed Communist propaganda in the Legion’s units. The Legion, which was stationed at the time on the territory of modern Ukraine, was eager to leave Russia for France, but that plan was foiled by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ceded a large chunk of the Russian Empire’s western lands, including Crimea and present-day Ukraine, to Germany. The Czechoslovak Legion had to retreat eastward in a hurry. Masaryk decided that the Legion should travel to the Pacific port of Vladivostok and even negotiated a deal with the Bolshevik authorities. Tensions continued to mount, however, as each side distrusted the other, and ultimately the Legion had to fight its way to the Pacific along the Trans-Siberian Railway, refusing to surrender its weapons to the Reds or to deal with them in any way – until they had no choice. The Czechoslovaks easily foiled all attempts to disarm them and kept capturing towns along their route. Everywhere they went, Whites from the Siberian regions joined them. Also, they were able to seize the Russian Empire’s gold reserve. However, there were fewer and fewer battles for the Legion to take part in. By autumn, the war with Germany was over and the Czechs had won their independence – an event that, paradoxically, depleted their morale: the soldiers could think of nothing else but returning to their homeland. In 1919, they hardly did any fighting at all – instead, they went on a looting spree. As they were in control of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the Czechs would routinely stop trains, rob everyone on board and 'empty' the train cars of refugees. This eventually earned them their nickname, ‘Czechosobaks’ (which in Russian literally means ‘Czechoslovak dogs’). One of the victims of the Czechs’ tyranny on the railroad was the White movement's most prominent figure, Alexander Kolchak, who had been named supreme ruler of Russia not long before. His train was repeatedly stopped by the Czechs in late 1919, until it ended up in the town of Nizhneudinsk. At that time, in the neighboring city of Irkutsk, a leftist group that included Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks established a political group called the Political Center, which demanded that Kolchak hand over power to Anton Denikin. Kolchak was then promised safe passage, but his personal guards were to be replaced by Czechoslovaks. Admiral Kolchak accepted these conditions, but that did not save him from eventually being executed. On January 15, 1920, the Czechoslovaks turned Kolchak over to the Political Center, and the Socialist-Revolutionaries threw him into prison. After an attempt by White forces loyal to Kolchak to recapture the former supreme ruler in Irkutsk, the interventionists behind the Czechs announced that they were prepared to fire upon the Whites to prevent Kolchak from escaping. To prove that their intentions were serious, the former Entente allies disarmed several units of the White Guardsmen. As early as January 21, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks surrendered power in Irkutsk to the Bolsheviks. The latter interrogated the admiral and sentenced him to execution by firing squad. The handing over of Kolchak to the Bolsheviks was, in a way, the foreign legion's 'payment' for a chance to safely leave Russia. With the prisoner in their custody, the Bolsheviks promptly began negotiations with the Czechoslovaks. The two sides exchanged detainees and the Central Europeans promised to return the gold reserves to the Soviets as soon the last foreign soldier left Irkutsk. In September 1920, the last servicemen of the Czechoslovak corps left Vladivostok aboard the US Army Transport ship Heffron. But that was not the end of the Czechs' involvement in the Russian Civil War. The need to evacuate the legion was used to justify the Western intervention after Germany’s ultimate defeat. However, foreign troops had been on Russian territory several months before the end of World War I. Ostensibly, their presence was the result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, although in actuality Russia’s ‘allies’ from the Entente had agreed on the occupation zones of the Russian Empire well before it was signed. The Bolsheviks’ peace treaty with Germany was just the catalyst to force the Allied powers to act more resolutely. There was an attempt to justify the intervention by the need to establish an anti-German front in Russia with or without the cooperation of the Soviet government. The Allies were afraid that the Germans, who had landed in Finland, might be able to capture Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, Russia’s main northern ports, which also held military supplies. The British reached out to the Bolsheviks and offered to land in Murmansk and take the city before the Germans could do so. In spite of the peace treaty, the Reds were indeed afraid of possible German advances, so they took London's offer while trying to maintain secrecy and shifting the responsibility to the local authorities. After direct threats from Germany, the Bolsheviks realized they had made a mistake, but it was too late to try to push the Brits out. In the spring of 1918, 1,500 British troops were stationed in Russia’s north. The subsequent landing of 9,000 more servicemen in Arkhangelsk was not coordinated with the Bolsheviks at all. Apart from the British, soldiers from other countries, including Italians, Serbs, and Americans, were involved in the operation. The Red Army was helpless to thwart the landing and simply withdrew from the city before the Allied forces arrived. Enemies of the Bolshevik government led by Captain 2nd Rank Chaplin tried to exploit the situation, but, much to their disappointment, the British had their own plans for Arkhangelsk. They installed a leftist government headed by Nikolai Tchaikovsky, an English socialist with a long track record of socialist agitation. The local officers were not pleased by such a turn of events, so they orchestrated a coup in September 1918 and arrested the leftwing politicians. The British intervened by freeing all of those who were jailed and removing the conspirators from Arkhangelsk. Anti-Bolshevik forces in the sparsely populated northern regions lacked resources and struggled to feed their armies so, consequently, they had to depend on the interventionists, who had no intention of helping the Whites topple the Reds. Foreign troops spent the whole of 1918 stationed in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk without making any serious attempts at major inroads beyond pushing a few kilometers inside Russian territory. After the end of World War I, even the Allied powers themselves had trouble figuring out what they were still doing in Russia, given that they were not actively fighting the Bolsheviks and lacked the power to do so. By 1919, the Red Army had become a formidable force that a few thousand foreign soldiers were no match for. Ultimately, in September of that year, the Allied powers simply boarded their ships and left the region. The intervention was much more active in the eastern part of Russia, through which the country’s main transport artery, the Trans-Siberian Railway, passed. The Americans landed an expeditionary force dubbed ‘Siberia’ consisting of about 8,000 troops in Vladivostok in August of 1918. They immediately declared that they were completely neutral and gave assurances that they would not interfere in Russia’s internal affairs or provide support to either the Whites or Reds. While the British in the north were still engaging in political intrigues, the Americans claimed to be simply guarding the railway. Perhaps the American mission would have been less upsetting for the locals had it not been headed by General William Graves, for whom the word ‘monarchist’ was a terrible curse word. Having no understanding of the local situation at all, he thought the Bolsheviks were something akin to America’s Founding Fathers and that they were fighting for freedom against tyranny, while he considered all Whites to be monarchists. As a result, Graves sympathized with the Bolsheviks and put spokes in the wheels of the Whites. His relations with the latter's officers, who could see the American general’s actual deeds, were very strained. For example, in the fall of 1919, he blocked a shipment of weapons bought by Whites on the grounds that they allegedly wanted to attack him. The manager of affairs in the Kolchak government, Georgy Gens, observed: “In the Far East, the American expeditionary forces behaved in such a way that anti-Bolshevik circles became convinced that the United States did not want to see the triumph, but rather the defeat of the anti-Bolshevik government. They expressed sympathy for the partisans, as if encouraging them to take further action.” In his opinion, “It was clear that the United States did not realize what the Bolsheviks were, and that the American general, Graves, was acting according to certain instructions.” Another White leader, Ataman Grigory Semenov, recalled: “Almost all the weapons and uniforms coming from America were transferred from Irkutsk to the Red partisans, and General Graves, an ardent opponent of the Omsk government, knew about this. The conduct of the Americans in Siberia was so hideous from a moral point of view and just in terms of basic decency that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Omsk government, Sukin, being a great Americanophile, could barely hush up the scandal that had begun to erupt.” The Canadians also took a symbolic part in the intervention in Siberia. As subjects of the British crown, they sent a small expeditionary force, which mainly carried out police service in Vladivostok. It stayed in Russia for only six months before returning home in the spring of 1919. The only participant in the intervention that approached the issue in a serious way was Japan. According to various estimates, its army in the Russian Far East was 30,000-70,000-strong. In terms of numbers, the Japanese forces significantly outnumbered all of the other Allied contingents combined. In addition, the Japanese were the most adamant in insisting on the intervention – and they were also the last to leave. They were the only Allied country to take active part in actually fighting the local partisans themselves. However, Tokyo clearly hoped to snatch some of Russia’s territory, or at least create a pro-Japanese buffer state in the Far East. For this reason, the allies had to constantly pull Tokyo back and tame its ambitions. The Japanese placed their hopes in Ataman Semenov, who could only be classified as ‘White’ because his detachments were fighting the Bolsheviks. Unlike the Whites in the north and Siberia, who had to buy weapons and ammunition from the Allies (often even defective ones), Semenov received weapons from the Japanese in large quantities for nothing. Unlike the rest of the Allied forces, which were either engaged in protecting the Trans-Siberian Railway or sitting in port cities without sticking their noses out, the Japanese occupied a significant chunk of the eastern territories, holding all of the larger cities east of Chita by the fall of 1918. With the military support of the Japanese, Semenov’s detachment managed to capture the area of Transbaikalia. At the same time, the Japanese clearly did not seek to unite with the White forces in order to defeat the Bolsheviks. While they supported Semenov, they were extremely hostile to Kolchak. This animosity also manifested itself in their relations with the Russian commanders. One witness to the Civil War in Siberia, the Latvian writer Arved Shvabe, noted: “Sometimes, the Japanese approved territorial uprisings directed against Kolchak in order to weaken his position.” By the beginning of 1920, all of the Allied expeditionary forces had withdrawn from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Only the Japanese remained, hoping they could still get something for their trouble. In order to rid themselves of the Japanese, the Bolsheviks turned to a diplomatic trick. A significant part of the region was proclaimed to be a completely independent state called the Far Eastern Republic (FER), which was not designated as a socialist state. In fact, Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks worked side by side with the Bolsheviks in local government there. So, it turned out the Japanese were no longer occupying Russian land but rather an independent and neutral Far Eastern Republic, which, de jure, was not even a Soviet state. This made it twice as hard for the Japanese to justify their presence there, as they were under a lot of pressure from their allies, especially the Americans. Under diplomatic pressure, the Japanese recognized the FER and left its territory. At this point, Vladivostok and the north of Sakhalin were the last places still occupied by the Japanese, who were already in diplomatic isolation. In 1922, Tokyo began to evacuate its troops from Vladivostok. Two weeks later, the Far Eastern Republic announced its accession to the RSFSR. Having fulfilled its mission, there was no further reason for its existence. *** The intervention had ended with the White movement harmed while the Reds were assisted. The Bolsheviks instantly turned into defenders of the Revolution and patriots fighting imperialists (though there were practically none to fight). This greatly facilitated propaganda against the Whites, who were forced to tolerate allies who had been harming Russia. The interventionists had never set out to overthrow the Bolsheviks and did not fight the Reds. The military contingents these ‘allies’ sent to Russia were miniscule. According to the most optimistic estimates, the number of interventionists, not counting the Japanese, did not exceed 30,000 troops. Against the 5-million-strong Bolshevik army, this was less than a drop in the bucket.",3.481509474232064,4.4177150394804485,-0.9362055652483847,4

He added that there were no military targets in the vicinity. The car bombing rocked the building of the channel ZaTV, injuring employees and other civilians and damaging the building itself, according to the official. Zaporozhye was officially declared part of Russia in early October, along with Kherson Region and the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, after voters in those regions overwhelmingly supported the move in public referendums. Malkevich said that the explosive device had a yield equivalent to 1.5-2kg of TNT. Footage from the blast scene shows both the interior and exterior of the building having been devastated, with windows shattered. The local authorities have said the incident is being investigated as a terrorist attack. Later, the city’s administration clarified that all of the victims had only minor injuries, with one being taken to the hospital. Vladimir Rogov, a senior official with the Zaporozhye Region's administration, stated that ZaTV would continue its operations despite the blast.

Vyacheslav Boguslaev, who holds the title of Hero of Ukraine for his accomplishments, called his arrest a misunderstanding. Boguslaev and Oleg Dzyuba, who heads the firm’s export department, had their cases heard on Monday behind closed doors. Ukraine’s domestic security agency the SBU detained Boguslaev on Sunday, claiming they had evidence that he sold military products to Russia. If found guilty, he and Dzyuba may face up to 12 years in jail. In the case of Boguslaev, 83, it could mean an effective life sentence. The SBU released, what it claimed to be, recordings of conversations between Boguslaev and Russian officials, in which they appeared to discuss the purchase of helicopter engines and their supply through intermediaries. His lawyer, Ruslan Volynets, who briefly spoke to the press after the court hearing, claimed that the tapes were not part of the prosecution’s case against his client. After the court ordered his pre-trial detention for 60 days, Boguslaev told journalists that he was satisfied with the decision. “Those misunderstandings that our actions had caused have been cleared,” he said without offering further explanation. The SBU allege that Motor Sich continued dealing with Russia even after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. In May, Russian forces attacked the firm’s premises in Zaporozhye. In the records released by the SBU, a voice purportedly to be that of Boguslaev can be heard saying that he and his people “hold absolutely no grudge” for the incident. Boguslaev has been the head of Motor Sich since 1991, when it stopped being part of the Soviet Union’s defense industry. Russia remained its primary customer for decades. After an armed coup in Ukraine in 2014 soured relations between Moscow and Kiev, Russian helicopter manufacturers said they could no longer rely on Ukraine to supply key components and would create alternative domestic suppliers. Rostec, Russia’s technology conglomerate that includes various defense producers, stated, after news of Boguslaev’s detention, that it no longer used Ukrainian helicopter engines.",2.798647228032075,3.0510561660826334,-0.25240893805055853,5

The trip comes after Ukrainian officials disinvited him from visiting in April. “My message to the Ukrainians is that we are not only standing by your side. We will continue to support Ukraine, economically, politically and also militarily,” President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said after arriving on Tuesday. “It was important to me, especially now in this phase of air attacks with drones, cruise missiles and rockets, to send a message of solidarity to the Ukrainians,” he added. Steinmeier planned to visit Kiev last Thursday, but the trip was canceled on short notice due to the intensification of Russian attacks on the capital. After the conflict began in February, many European leaders made trips to Ukraine, meeting with President Vladimir Zelensky and touring the cities devastated by the fighting. Steinmeier’s potential visit, however, caused controversy in April when the Ukrainian authorities disinvited him, reportedly citing his “close ties to Russia.” Steinmeier said at the time that he had planned to travel to Kiev, but “apparently wasn’t wanted” there. The visit comes after Ukraine renewed its requests for Western air defense systems in the wake of Russian strikes on Kiev and other major cities. Speaking to German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Saturday, Prime Minister Denis Shmigal said Ukraine urgently needs mobile power generators and warming stations to get through the winter. He also urged the EU to streamline financial aid. Russia has repeatedly struck Ukrainian thermal power plants and power lines this month. President Vladimir Putin stated that the strikes were ramped up in retaliation against “terrorist attacks” on Russian soil, including the truck bombing that damaged the strategic bridge which connects the Crimean Peninsula with the Russian mainland.",1.9718895173132545,2.0162170436696054,-0.044327526356350955,0
2022-10-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/565275-armenia-azerbaijan-summit-russia/,Putin invites leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan for talks,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited Azerbaijani and Armenian leaders Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan to Russia to discuss regional matters in the wake of recent tensions between Yerevan and Baku. According to Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who confirmed the news on Monday, Moscow is concerned about the “alarming trends” in the region, “where the West is clearly trying to transfer the confrontational schemes tested in Ukraine.” “Russian President [Vladimir] Putin invited the President of Azerbaijan [Ilham] Aliyev and Prime Minister of Armenia [Nikol] Pashinyan to Russia for the next trilateral summit, where it is planned to discuss a whole range of trilateral and bilateral issues,” Zakharova said in a statement. Commenting on the process of bringing the decades-long conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan to an end, the spokeswoman accused the West of pursuing a “tactless and aggressive” approach. “The true goals of Washington and Brussels are by no means the search for a compromise or balanced solutions, but self-promotion and squeezing Russia out of the South Caucasus,” Zakharova claimed. The same approach, she added, can be seen in apparent “attempts by external forces to sow enmity between Moscow and Yerevan” and in their efforts “to discredit Russia’s policy in the region.” The attempts by these “external forces” to ensure the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers from Nagorno-Karabakh – a region that is at the center of the dispute between Yerevan and Baku – “are precisely aimed at destabilizing the South Caucasus,” Zakharova said. Earlier this month, Putin proposed to hold a trilateral summit “anywhere and at any time: in Sochi, in St. Petersburg, in Moscow.” On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Interfax that preparations for the summit were ongoing, with its date and location to be revealed in due course. According to the Vedomosti newspaper, citing its own diplomatic source, the meeting might take place at the end of October, most likely in Sochi on Russia's Black Sea coast. The last trilateral summit between Russia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan took place in November last year, also in Sochi. Pashinyan and Aliyev held two meetings earlier this month in Prague with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and French leader Emmanuel Macron respectively. Armenia and Azerbaijan have historically been at odds with one another over a number of issues, most prominently, the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 2020, the two nations fought a 44-day war over the territory, which ended with a Russian-brokered truce, ceding to Baku some areas previously controlled by Armenian-backed troops and the deployment of Russian peacekeepers to observe the agreement. Tensions on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border escalated again in September this year, when dozens of people, both civilian and military personnel, were reportedly killed, with both sides blaming the violence on each other.",2.775295041550652,3.3459683089667354,-0.5706732674160833,8

Russia’s top General, Valery Gerasimov, raised his country's concerns in a phone call with US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, and with his British counterpart, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin. The Pentagon only mentioned that the two generals discussed “several security-related issues of concern” without providing any further details. It was the first such conversation between Gerasimov and Milley since May. The British Defence Ministry said the phone call between Radakin and Gerasimov took place “at the request of the Russian Ministry of Defense,” adding that the UK “rejected Russia’s allegations that Ukraine is planning actions to escalate the conflict.” Radakin also “restated the UK’s enduring support for Ukraine,” the ministry’s statement added. London also agreed it was important to keep communication channels with Moscow open to “manage the risk of miscalculation and to facilitate de-escalation.” The developments came a day after Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu raised similar concerns in phone calls with the defense chiefs of the US, UK, and France. Moscow has been warning Western nations about Kiev’s alleged plans to use a “dirty bomb” to frame Russia for quite some time. The West, however, has remained largely dismissive of such warnings. Earlier on Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Kiev wants to frame Moscow as a “nuclear terrorist” by accusing it of using weapons of mass destruction and thus potentially launching a “powerful anti-Russia campaign.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also stated that the West’s disbelief in this scenario does not make the threat any less pressing. Kiev has denied Moscow’s allegations. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky also said that the only side capable of launching an attack using nukes is Russia itself. Meanwhile, the UN called on all sides of the conflict to show restraint. Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told a briefing on Monday that all parties should “avoid” any actions that could lead to miscalculation or further escalation of the already devastating conflict.",2.6405599684807513,2.6734023352945377,-0.032842366813786494,8

The official, who was relieved of his duties on Monday, was previously responsible for transport security. His dismissal could be linked to the truck explosion on the Crimean Bridge, earlier this month, Moscow business daily RBK reported. According to a brief decree published by the government, Sukhanov was dismissed “at his own request.” Russian officials have not yet officially commented on the move. However, RBK reports that the deputy minister was slated for discharge after the Crimean Bridge blast, which took place on October 8. Sukhanov assumed his post in 2017. One of his most important duties was overseeing the work of a federal agency responsible for the security of the strategically important link, among other transport facilities. The Crimean Bridge was hit by a massive explosion on October 8, which severely damaged its road traffic section and killed three civilians, as well as set a passing freight train on fire. Several top Ukrainian officials openly celebrated the attack, but stopped short of claiming responsibility for it. Moscow has blamed Kiev for the incident, branding the explosion a “terrorist attack.” Russian law enforcement officials claim to have established how the bomb, which was disguised as construction materials, made it to the bridge from the Ukrainian port city of Odessa via multiple transit countries. Moscow has also identified 12 individuals as suspected accomplices in the plot and arrested eight of them, the Federal Security Service (FSB) said.

We expect constant power outages and problems with heating,” Vitrenko stated, adding that Moscow has also hit refineries. Ukraine is preparing for winter blackouts, the Naftogaz boss said, admitting that “it is impossible to 100% prevent problems” and the country therefore needs help from its backers. In an interview with The Guardian in late August, long before Russia launched its offensive against Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Vitrenko admitted that without Western financial support, Ukraine would “lack gas” and, consequently, might see its power system going down. In September, the Naftogaz boss urged Ukrainians to stock up on blankets and warm clothes, noting that this year’s heating season will start later and end earlier, while winter temperatures in apartments will be set at 17-18 degrees Celsius (62-64 degrees Fahrenheit), four degrees below the standard temperature. The ongoing shelling of Ukrainian infrastructure by Moscow prompted Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky last week to ask his compatriots to ease pressure on the struggling energy system by limiting their use of electricity between 5pm and 11pm. On Sunday, he also asked the local authorities “to consume electricity very consciously” and emphasized that “this is not the right time for bright shop windows and signs.” Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a shift in the military offensive in Ukraine on October 10, with Moscow’s forces launching massive long-range missile strikes on Ukrainian military, communication, and energy facilities. He accused Kiev of masterminding several “terrorist attacks” on Russian infrastructure, including the Crimean Bridge bombing attack.",1.9309738000336496,3.6071000886699136,-1.676126288636264,7

Medvedev, who is currently the deputy head of the Russian Security Council, posted a video on Telegram showing him touring the production halls of the plant together with a delegation of government officials. The video also featured dozens of modern T-72B3 and T-90M battle tanks under construction at the facility, including ones that appeared to be in the final assembly stage. The official said he has repeatedly seen claims by Western analysts “that Russia will soon run out of military equipment and weapons.” “Don’t hold your breath,” he wrote. “The production of weapons and special equipment is increasing multifold in all directions: from tanks and guns to high-precision missiles and drones. Wait!” Medvedev added. Last week, President Vladimir Putin established a special Coordination Council tasked with meeting the demands of the Russian military operation in Ukraine. The council is expected to streamline the efforts of the federal and regional authorities to provide troops with equipment and military hardware, as well as logistical support. The president is expected to join a meeting of the council on Tuesday via video link. Russia is currently locked in a prolonged conflict with Ukraine, which largely relies on military aid from the US and its allies in Europe and elsewhere. In mid-September, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg admitted to CNN that the bloc’s members had significantly depleted their own weapons stockpiles by supplying arms to Ukraine and called for a boost to arms production.

Kasparov had claimed that fighting Moscow is worth the risk of nuclear war. Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Kasparov condemned “people sitting in the comfort of their mansions in Silicon Valley telling Ukraine how to conduct [its] own affairs,” clarifying a moment later that he was referring to “many” people, “starting with Elon Musk.” Kasparov, who left Russia almost a decade ago, told the US broadcaster that calls for a negotiated settlement to the Ukraine conflict are “moral idiocy.” Acknowledging that “yes, there is a potential threat of nuclear war,” Kasparov argued that the West should nevertheless refuse to accept any peace deal between Moscow and Kiev. While it’s true that Kasparov is almost as good at playing chess as my iPhone, he is otherwise an idiot Posting on Twitter shortly after the interview, Musk was dismissive of Kasparov’s argument. “While it’s true that Kasparov is almost as good at playing chess as my iPhone,” the billionaire wrote, “he is otherwise an idiot.” “I don’t even own a house, let alone a ‘mansion’, you douche,” he added. Musk and Kasparov have sparred before. The former world chess champion accused Musk of spreading “Kremlin propaganda” earlier this month, after the Tesla tycoon suggested that Ukraine abandon its claim to the Russian territory of Crimea in exchange for peace with Moscow. Under Musk’s plan, referendums would be held again in four territories that recently voted to join Russia, this time with UN supervision. At the time, Musk reminded Kasparov that SpaceX had donated Starlink internet terminals worth $80 million to Ukraine, asking Kasparov what he had done “besides tweet.” Musk would later threaten to pull Ukraine’s Starlink access unless the US government picked up the tab, before backtracking and agreeing to continue providing the service for free.",3.923804200079616,3.098819798226224,0.8249844018533921,5

They should build shelters nearby. A dug trench is an elementary shelter,” Mikhail Gorbunov, the chair of the region’s Security Council, reportedly explained on Monday. He was speaking during an administration meeting and, according to TASS, offered some ideas for making such improvised shelters that would be suited for the job. Kursk Region has enough proper shelters to keep up to 1.5 million people safe, Gorbunov stated. He instructed the local authorities to make sure the shelters are stockpiled with food, water, lamps, and other essential items. This was particularly important for the parts of the region that are close to the border with Ukraine, the official noted. Meanwhile, Kursk Region Governor Roman Starovoyt urged regional officials to follow his lead in receiving some training to learn what they should do in case of an attack. “My colleagues and I have had courses for tactical action, including tactical medicine. We finished them on Saturday,” he told other officials. According to Starovoyt, the entire regional government participated and local authorities should do the same. Kursk Region borders Ukraine to the west and southwest. A number of areas close to the border have been subjected to attacks from the Ukrainian side, some of them resulting in deaths.

The statement came after the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Kiev wanted to resort to weapons of mass destruction in order to frame Russia. A so-called dirty bomb is usually understood to be a conventional munition containing radioactive material. “Their distrust of the information that has been relayed by the Russian side does not mean that the threat of the use of such a ‘dirty bomb’ ceases to exist. The threat is evident,” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters on Monday. Peskov added that Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu had recently informed several foreign governments about the matter, but it is ultimately “their business, whether to believe it or not.” Shoigu warned his British, French, and Turkish counterparts on Sunday about “a potential Ukrainian provocation” involving a dirty bomb. He also spoke over the phone with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday that Moscow’s allegations are “not empty words.” He claimed that reports about a radioactive weapon have been verified, and Russia will bring its concerns before the UN. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the commander of Russia’s radiological, chemical, and biological protection troops, claimed at a briefing the same day that Ukraine plans to detonate a dirty bomb or a low-yield nuclear bomb in order to frame Russia. He added that Kiev is “at the final stage” of making a dirty bomb. Kirillov also stated that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky’s office had contacts with British authorities “on the issue of potentially acquiring the technology for nuclear weapons.” Ukraine has three operational nuclear power plants, but no atomic weapons or programs to acquire them. Zelensky rejected Moscow’s claims and accused Russia of threatening the world with nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said reports about a dirty bomb are part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Kuleba added on Monday that he had spoken to Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and invited him to dispatch inspectors to Ukrainian nuclear sites. “He agreed. Unlike Russia, Ukraine has always been and remains transparent. We have nothing to hide,” Kuleba tweeted. In early September, Grossi led an international team of experts who visited the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, Europe’s largest, which sits on the frontline between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Kiev and Moscow have accused each other of shelling the facility. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who spoke to Kuleba over the phone on Monday, dismissed Russia’s allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb as false.",3.1674474095415865,2.078972926218633,1.0884744833229534,9
2022-10-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/565246-israel-refuses-ukraine-weapons/,Israel rejects Ukrainian weapons request,"Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz refused a request for weapons from his Ukrainian counterpart, Alexey Reznikov, during a phone call on Monday. Despite its official aversion to arming Ukraine, Israel has reportedly offered Kiev military intelligence and certain weapons on the private market. Gantz told Reznikov that Israel supports Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, but would not supply arms due to “operative restrictions,” the Times of Israel reported. The restrictions in question likely refer to Israel’s air sorties in Syria, which depend on communication with Russia, which controls much of the country’s airspace. The Israeli minister said that his country would continue to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine, as well as protective equipment such as helmets and body armor. Several planned calls between Gantz and Reznikov were canceled over the past week, with Kiev scrapping a conversation scheduled for last Thursday after Gantz definitively stated that Israel would not supply any weapons to Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have called on Israel to donate air defense systems for several months, but these calls intensified after Russia began pounding Ukraine’s power infrastructure with autonomous ‘kamikaze’ drones. With Ukraine’s NATO-supplied defenses unable to stop the attacks, the Foreign Ministry in Kiev sent a letter to West Jerusalem last week urging the Jewish state to “immediately” deliver air defense systems – including Iron Dome missile batteries – to Kiev. Despite its refusal to directly ship weapons to Ukraine, the Israeli government is reportedly turning a blind eye to its defense contractors circumventing this policy. One Israeli firm is supplying anti-drone systems to Poland, with Warsaw then shipping them on to Kiev, Hebrew news site Zman Yisrael reported last month. The company “pretends not to be aware” that its products are being moved on into Ukraine, the report alleged. Israel has also “provided intelligence useful for targeting” Russia’s drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday, citing an unnamed Ukrainian official.

Speaking at a press briefing, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, who heads Russia’s Nuclear Biological and Chemical Defense Troops, said that Moscow had learned about Kiev’s plans to mount a false flag attack using “a dirty bomb” or a low-yield nuclear warhead. Kiev’s goal, he said, would be to accuse Moscow of using weapons of mass destruction in a ploy to “launch a powerful anti-Russia campaign.” Against this backdrop, Kirillov indicated that the Russian Defense Ministry had taken measures “to counter possible Ukrainian provocations,” adding that Moscow’s forces are ready to perform tasks under conditions of radioactive contamination. According to the general, Kiev’s potential false-flag attack could be disguised as a botched detonation of a Russian low-yield nuclear warhead. The presence of radioactive materials would quickly be detected by other European countries, which would allow the West to pin the blame on Russia, he added. Kirillov reminded everyone that this type of scheme had already been deployed by the West in Syria, when the White Helmets, a volunteer organization operating in opposition-controlled areas, filmed “propaganda videos” that accused pro-government forces of using chemical weapons. Syria has repeatedly denied this allegation. The general stated that the US used that as a pretext to conduct a massive missile strike on the Syrian Shayrat airbase in 2017 in a blatant violation of international law. Kirillov noted that such a scenario was “highly likely” to happen in Ukraine if Kiev deployed a “dirty bomb.” Kiev's plans to set up a provocation were first reported by RIA Novosti on Sunday, which, citing “sources in different countries including Ukraine” alleged that two Ukrainian institutions had already been tasked with manufacturing a “dirty bomb,” with the work now at “the final stages.” The news agency also stated that the administration of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky was engaged in behind-the-scenes talks with British officials in a bid to secure the transfer of nuclear arms components to Kiev. Following the report, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu warned Türkiye, the US, the UK, and France about the possible provocation. However, the latter three countries refuted what they called “blatantly false allegations,” adding that this “should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation.” Zelensky also denied any plans to stage a ‘dirty bomb’ attack, claiming that the only “entity” capable of using nukes at present is Russia itself.",2.611405943467183,2.5125462287459714,0.09885971472121158,9

Any breaches would flood a massive region, including the site of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, a senior official in Russia’s Zaporozhye region has warned. “I cannot rule out that they will try to combine two scenarios. First, they could blow up Dnieproges, and later the Kakhovka hydropower plant,” Vladimir Rogov told TASS on Monday. Dnieproges, or the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant, is located in the Kiev-controlled city of Zaporozhye, upstream from Energodar, which hosts the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). If the dam were breached, the city and the nuclear facility would be flooded, Rogov explained. The Kakhovskaya hydroelectric dam is further downstream in Kherson Region but is crucial for the NPP to feed its cooling systems. The hydropower plant has been the focus of mutual accusations by Moscow and Kiev officials. Last week Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky claimed that Russian forces had planted explosives and were preparing to blow it up and urged an international monitoring mission to visit the facility. Russian officials accused Ukrainian troops of deliberately targeting the dam. Further down the Dnieper is the city of Kherson, which would be flooded, if the Kakhovskaya barrier was breached. The city is located on the Western bank of the river and may come under intensive Ukrainian fire as Kiev seeks to capture it from Russia, according to regional officials. The mayor of Novaya Kakhovka, site of the hydropower plant, reported on Monday that at least three Ukrainian shells had hit the dam overnight. “The situation is quite tense,” Vladimir Leontyev told TASS. “The number of rocket strikes is increasing” Plant operators are reducing the water level in the reservoir held by the dam to reduce potential damage to communities downstream, the mayor added. Vassily Nebenzia, Moscow’s representative to the UN, warned last week that thousands of civilians could be killed, if Ukraine were to destroy the Kakhovskaya dam, and urged other members of the UN Security Council to prevent that from happening. Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions were declared part of Russia together with the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk earlier this month after voters in those territories overwhelmingly supported the move in referendums.

The comment also follows recent reports that the European Union was considering funding Ukraine’s access to Starlink. Musk tweeted on Monday that he had spoken with Ukrainian Digital Transformation Minister Mikhail Fedorov. “Before DoD even came back with an answer, I told Fedorov that SpaceX would not turn off Starlink even if DoD refused to provide funding,” Musk wrote. Fedorov thanked the billionaire for his support. “Before all the talks about funding, you confirmed to me that in any case, you will ensure the work of Starlink in Ukraine. This was critically important for Ukraine,” he wrote. Musk replied: “You’re most welcome.” Musk’s company has donated around 25,000 Starlink terminals to Ukraine since Russia launched its military operation in February. They are being used by Ukrainian troops on the battlefield. CNN reported last month that SpaceX had warned the Pentagon that it may stop funding the service unless the US government covers some of the costs. However, Musk later said that, despite “losing money,” he will continue to fund Starlink in Ukraine for free. He stated that the operation has already cost $80 million and the expenses will top $100 million by the end of the year. Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov told Politico magazine this month that Kiev will “not have a problem” with keeping Starlink online and Fedorov has been communicating closely with Musk. Musk, who offered support to Ukraine early in the conflict, has recently faced criticism from Kiev and the Western media for suggesting that Ukraine might have to recognize Crimea as Russian territory and possibly make other concessions in order to reach a peace deal with Moscow. He argued that it is paramount to prevent the fighting from escalating into a larger conflict that could potentially involve nuclear weapons.",3.2380858624651587,3.1002321647487974,0.13785369771636136,5

On its official Telegram channel, the RIC said on Monday that it has been ordered to write up a report on “the situation that arose on the air of the television channel” after a user on social media requested that Bastrykin check Krasovsky’s series of “harsh statements.” The comments in question were made in the latest episode of Krasovksy’s program ‘Antonimy’ (Antonyms), where he interviewed science-fiction writer Sergey Lukyanenko. The author said that when he was in a hospital in Western Ukraine back in 1980 he heard children saying that “Ukraine is occupied by Muscovites,” and that their lives were worse because of it. In response, Krasovsky said that “it is necessary to straight-up drown these children,” and that as soon as a child says that “Muscovites have occupied [Ukraine]” it should be immediately thrown into a river with a turbulent current. After Lukyanenko objected, Krasovsky doubled down and insisted that such children should be “beaten into the hut and burned.” The author called the host’s remarks “extremist.” On Sunday night, RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan condemned the journalist’s comments as “wild and disgusting” and announced the immediate suspension of his contract with the channel. “Neither I, nor the rest of the RT staff can allow even the thought that one of us is capable of sharing such nonsense,” Simonyan said. Krasovsky has since come out with an apology to all those “stunned” by his statements, writing on his Telegram channel that he is “embarrassed” that he “didn’t see that line. About children.” He explained that “this kind of thing happens: You sit on the air and you get carried away. And you can’t stop,” adding that he apologizes to everyone to whom this seemed “wild, unthinkable and insurmountable.”",3.6480641000535123,3.615856620010512,0.03220748004300056,4

The effect of these measures, however, has yet to manifest itself, so since early autumn, the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) have had the initiative on almost the entire front, except in the area of Artyomovsk (Bakhmut) in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), where the Wagner Group’s forces have continued their leisurely offensive. As we anticipated, in the north of the front, at the junction of Kharkov Region and the DPR, the enemy built upon its September success, and by the start of October, had taken the strategically important town of Krasny Liman, which had fallen under Russian control back in May. Although the Ukrainian army’s offensive stalled and the Russians managed to counterattack and liberate several settlements afterwards, the event was symbolic. For the first time, not just a major city, but a Russian city was surrendered to the enemy – on the very day after the four new regions were incorporated into our country. On the Kherson front, after a month of bloody failures, Kiev’s forces eventually unlocked the Russian defenses. The direction of the main strike shifted to the northeast, where a strike was launched on October 2-4 along the Dnieper riverbank, forcing Russian troops to retreat 20-30km to the Dudchany-Davydov Brod line. Again, the same tactics used in Kharkov worked: Taking advantage of the numerical edge and the fact that Moscow did not have a solid front but rather a number of garrisons on the line. The Ukrainians broke through to the rear, flooded the area, and forced a Russian retreat. For the Ukrainians, this style of attack is a double-edged sword: If successful, it means a very quick breakthrough; but if unsuccessful, it leads to very heavy losses. Since then, the front has been stabilized, but the position of the Russians here remains vulnerable. All supplies for the group, and the regional center, depend on road transport via the Kakhovskaya Dam, which has been subjected to missile attacks by Kiev on more than one occasion. Temporary military bridges have been erected to replace the broken passes over the sluice, which itself has been backfilled to allow passage, but this does not fully solve the supply problem. At dawn on October 8, there was a high-profile attack on the Crimean Bridge – a truck bomb was detonated, collapsing one of the two roads, and a parallel train carrying oil products caught fire, damaging one of the railway lines. The surviving lanes were restored to road traffic on the same day, while the rest required major repairs. With this act of sabotage, as well as his calls for a preemptive nuclear strike, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky gave his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, an excuse to up the ante. Russia responded by launching massive strikes on Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure. This was the first time since the beginning of the military operation that systematic work of this nature was seen. According to various estimates, in less than two weeks of daily attacks, Ukraine’s power grid deteriorated by 10-30%. A strict regime of light saving was introduced across the country, as water supplies, street lighting, and electric transport were cut off to varying degrees. So far, only thermal power plants, their electrical substations, and power grid control rooms have been attacked. Hydropower plants, for example, much less nuclear power plants, have not been targeted. In addition to Kalibr cruise missiles, Geran-2 kamikaze drones have been widely used in the strikes. They are equipped with a simple piston engine (for which they are nicknamed ‘mopeds’) and use a satellite guidance system. Because of their mass application and the lack of a jet stream at which anti-aircraft missile heads can be aimed, Ukrainian air defense is powerless against the Gerans: it is more often possible to shoot down a drone with small arms as it approaches its target, which, in turn, leads to explosives-laden drones dropping on civilian objects, residential buildings and so on in dense urban areas. Ukraine has responded by stepping up the shelling of Belgorod Region, also targeting electrical substations. This has caused power outages in Belgorod, which, however, cannot be compared to the blackouts in Ukraine. In addition, Kiev has started targeting power centers in the new Russian regions – in recent days, facilities in Donetsk and Energodar have been hit. Western reactions to Moscow’s latest actions have been surprisingly sluggish. In response to the acceptance of new regions into Russia, the partial mobilization, and strikes on the energy sector, Washington only promised to strengthen Ukraine’s air defenses to combat the Kalibrs and Gerans. Accelerated accession to NATO was not offered, nor was a sharp increase in arms deliveries. Thus, it is clear that the West intends to continue fighting by proxy – at least as long as the offensive potential of the AFU remains. *** So what’s next? It appears that Kiev is preparing a major offensive on Kherson with the aim of taking both the city itself and the entire right bank part of the region. General Surovikin has openly admitted the gravity of the situation, not ruling out “difficult decisions.” In recent days, Russia has been conducting a hasty evacuation of the right bank, and it appears that the main battle of the autumn is about to begin here. In addition, we should expect an attack by the AFU in the north, in Svatovo and Rubezhnoye-Severodonetsk. A large Ukrainian grouping has also assembled in the area, and the Russian Armed Forces are actively setting up defensive lines. Another area under threat is Energodar and the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. New attempts at landing via the Kakhovka Reservoir and an overland strike via Vasilievka along the southern bank of the Dnieper can be expected here, but the latter does not appear to be realistic at the moment. Ukraine needs to hurry. Time is working against it. As mobilized troops from Russia arrive at the front, the AFU’s advantage in numbers will come to an end and the tactic of breaking through with light units will no longer work. In addition, in November, the last of the green grass will vanish, snow will fall, and the troops will become more vulnerable from the air. Russia will apparently continue its strikes on infrastructure while reinforcing the front. The immediate task is to repel an offensive by the AFU, inflicting maximum defensive damage. A joint Russian-Belarusian grouping in Belarus has also been announced. It can hardly be expected to launch an offensive from the north, but instead, its aim is probably to draw in as many Ukrainian forces as possible from the front to cover the border. Kiev seems to be well aware of the limits of its capabilities, as in recent days, there have been reports of new waves of mobilization in Ukraine. Whether Russia will have to respond in the same manner, or whether the first autumn draft will be enough, we will see in the coming months.",2.868206595479504,2.9864510473233534,-0.11824445184384924,0
2022-10-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/565229-naryshkin-nuclear-crisis-kennedy/,Russian security chief concerned about Western rhetoric on nuclear weapons,"The fact that discussions about the possible use of nuclear weapons have become part of Western rhetoric is worrisome, Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), has said. Contrary to claims by Western leaders, Russia is “absolutely” not threatening to deploy nuclear weapons, the senior official explained. But Kiev has openly claimed that it wants to become a nuclear power, an outcome that Naryshkin called on the world to prevent. The Russian intelligence chief was referring to a speech that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky delivered during the Munich Security Conference in February. The Ukrainian leader lamented that Kiev had given up nuclear weapons stationed there during the Soviet era and said that his country could break its promise to stay a non-nuclear state. Naryshkin was speaking on Monday in his capacity as head of the Russian Historical Society at the opening of an exhibition marking the 60th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The current stand-off between Russia and the US over Ukraine has been compared by many to the events that happened six decades ago. “The American elites today believe that they can maintain the aggression against our nation for as long as they want, fulling military action with thousands of lives of Ukrainian citizens and mercenaries,” the official remarked, drawing a parallel to how the Cuban Missile Crisis started. The stand-off back then was triggered by the US decision to deploy missiles to Turkey, threatening the Soviet Union, he explained. When Moscow reciprocated, “the reaction of the US political elites, who had convinced themselves of being exceptional, was painful, nervous and acute,” he noted. The administration of President John F. Kennedy recognized that there were red lines that neither the US nor the USSR should cross, Naryshkin said. There were people in the US government who “thought rationally, were able to calculate the consequences of their actions, and kept their word.” It’s not clear that the same approach can be found in the Joe Biden administration, Naryshkin stated. “Today, we will not be able to find a politician in a Western nation of the same magnitude as Kennedy,” he added. The Russian official also suggested a way to discourage nuclear powers from deploying their arsenals for goals other than deterrence. He told the audience that holding the US accountable for the 1945 nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would have had a cold shower effect.",2.6173085436503767,2.9947306114979435,-0.3774220678475668,8
2022-10-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/565228-irkutsk-fighter-jet-crash/,Possible reasons for Russian fighter jet crash named,"Technical problems or pilot error are currently viewed as the most likely reasons for the Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jet crash in the Siberian city of Irkutsk on Sunday, Russia’s Investigative Committee has said. Both pilots were killed as the plane flew into a two-story home, leading to a huge fire. “The probe is considering two main versions of events: Failure of aviation equipment and pilot error,” the Investigative Committee announced on Telegram on Monday. The committee said it has questioned the staff of an Irkutsk-based aircraft manufacturer which owned the jet. Investigators have also seized fuel samples and oxygen supply equipment, and additional checks are being carried out at the crash site, it added. The ill-fated Su-30 was carrying out a test flight when it nosedived into a two-story building in Irkutsk, also damaging another nearby home. A major fire of around 120 square meters broke out after the collision; firefighters needed several hours to extinguish it. Around 150 homes in the area were also left without electricity for hours. The two pilots did not eject from the aircraft and died in the crash. There were no casualties on the ground as the owners of house were not at home at the time of the incident. They were designated as victims in the criminal case launched by the Investigative Committee over the incident. Irkutsk Region Governor Igor Kobzev said the property owners will receive compensation from the state. A special inquiry will determine if they will be able to rebuild on the same spot or will have to look for a new place of residence, he said on Monday. The governor also ordered the consumer watchdog to take air samples in the area due to the potential for environmental damage from the fuel that spilled from the aircraft. One source told RT that the plane had been circling above Irkutsk for around 20 minutes before going down. When the Su-30 was approached by another jet, it became clear that both pilots inside the cabin were unconscious, he said. Last Monday, a Su-34 fighter-bomber crashed in a residential area in the city of Yeysk in Russia’s southern Krasnodar Region, leaving 15 people, including three children, dead.",3.413497830327525,4.281085710135546,-0.867587879808021,0

Writing on his Telegram channel, Volodin compared Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to Osama Bin Laden, the leader of the Islamist group behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US in 2001. “Washington released information 20 years ago that Al-Qaeda terrorists led by Bin Laden got access to radioactive materials and were planning to make a ‘dirty bomb,’” he said. “The threat of using such a bomb in the US and Europe had existed until Bin Laden was killed in 2011.” The methods of nuclear terrorism have not changed: Those used by Osama Bin Laden are now used by Zelensky. Volodin claimed that Kiev had instructed its nuclear scientists to make a ‘dirty bomb’, while its forces shell the critical infrastructure of the Zaporozhye and Kursk nuclear power plants. “Through financial and military aid to Zelensky’s regime, the US president and the heads of European countries are becoming the sponsors and accomplices in nuclear terrorism,” Volodin wrote. The comments came after Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu warned his British and French counterparts on Sunday about “a potential Ukrainian provocation” involving a ‘dirty bomb’. Zelensky dismissed the allegations and accused Moscow of threatening the world with nuclear weapons. “If Russia alleges that Ukraine is preparing something, it means only one thing: that Russia itself is preparing it,” Zelensky said on Sunday. Moscow and Kiev have accused each other of shelling the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, which was seized by Russian troops after Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring country.

2022-10-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/565218-iaea-zaporozhye-plant-zone/,Demilitarized zone around Zaporozhye NPP impossible – senior diplomat,"Russia has ruled out complete demilitarization of the area around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), but would support some kind of arrangement to ensure its safety, a senior Russian diplomat has said. “An agreement about demilitarization is impossible in principle. We cannot keep the station safe without guarding it,” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told the newspaper Izvestia on the sidelines of an international seminar on the prevention of nuclear war in Moscow. “A zone of protection is a different idea, and its parameters are being discussed,” he noted, referring to Russian contacts with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in remarks published on Monday. Moscow is engaged with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and has observers from the UN nuclear watchdog stationed at the facility, Ryabkov said, adding that Russia has “nothing to hide.” The Zaporozhye NPP has been under Russian control since the early stages of the military operation in Ukraine. Kiev and Moscow accused each other of shelling the station on multiple occasions. Ukraine also claimed that Russia deployed heavy weapons at the site and used them to attack Ukrainian troops. Russia took over formal responsibility for the station earlier this month, after Zaporozhye Region voted in a referendum to split with Kiev and become part of Russia. The IAEA, however, still refers to the largest nuclear power plant in Europe as Ukrainian. The agency stressed “the need to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the facility, following frequent shelling at or near the plant in recent months,” in its latest briefing on the situation. Both Russia and Ukraine expressed discontent with the IAEA’s refusal to say who is responsible for the shelling of the plant. Speaking to Argentinian media last week, Grossi said his goal was to identify “the lowest common denominator” between the two nations and to ensure the physical safety of the nuclear site. He chose to ignore the mutual accusations, as taking “a militant or critical position” would have been detrimental to that goal, he explained in an interview with La Nacion newspaper.",2.9615109982140297,4.0492367595100545,-1.0877257612960247,9

Kiev’s top draft officer told local media on Monday that his agency will continue raids to hand enlistment notices to eligible citizens. Speaking to Ukraine’s TSN news outlet, Colonel Yuri Maksimov, who heads Kiev City Recruitment and Social Support Center, claimed that while Ukraine has reached “the highest stage of mobilization,” its military still needs to bring its personnel up to full strength. “All men under the age of 60 who are liable for military service should expect to be served with draft papers,” he said, reminding that those who attempt to dodge conscription may face up to five years in prison. The draft officer projected that mobilization would extend into the next year. “While we are at war, we must ensure that we have personnel not only for defense but also for the offensive to liberate our territories,” he said. Maksimov also insisted that the nation’s legislation implies that the draft papers could be handed to Ukrainians in any location. “There are no prohibitions on where the military summons can be served,” he stressed. In late September, Mikhail Podoliak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, said that Kiev would not announce an additional military mobilization for now, given that Ukraine had already “created reserves through the territorial defense system.” After Russia launched its military campaign against Ukraine in late February, both nations called up new troops to boost their militaries. However, while Moscow embarked on a partial mobilization in September with plans to enroll a total of 300,000 reservists, Kiev ordered general mobilization immediately after large-scale hostilities broke out. In May, Alexey Reznikov, the Ukrainian defense minister, said that the military plans to call up one million people. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has on numerous occasions noted that Kiev’s forces are suffering heavy losses. In late September, he claimed that Ukraine loses about 50 service members every day. The same month, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced that while Russia had lost 6,000 troops since the beginning of the offensive, Ukraine had lost about 61,000.",3.052410914795346,2.7797198655224498,0.27269104927289645,2

Men who refuse to relocate have the option to enroll in territorial defense forces, a statement added on Monday. The city, which is located on the western bank of the Dnieper River, has been moving residents eastwards to other parts of Kherson Region and other Russian provinces over the looming threat of Ukrainian military action. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the region’s government, said in a Monday morning update that people “are gradually leaving the city to let the military do their job.” The official reported an overnight attempt to break through Russian defenses near the Ingulets River, a Dnieper tributary. He also claimed that an entire Ukrainian reconnaissance and sabotage team had been captured. Kherson Region joined Russia earlier this month, after people there voted in a referendum, and overwhelmingly supported the move. Kiev refused to recognize the outcome, calling it a “sham,” and pledged to recapture the territory. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky claimed last week that Russia was going to blow up the dam at the Kakhovskaya hydropower plant which is upstream from Kherson, causing the city and other settlements to be flooded. However Russian officials said Ukrainian forces sought to destroy the dam with artillery fire to disrupt life in the provincial capital and military logistics.

2022-10-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/565207-rt-suspends-host/,RT suspends host after ‘disgusting’ remarks about Ukrainian children,"RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan has condemned comments from Russian-language broadcast host Anton Krasovsky suggesting Ukrainian children should be “drowned,” and suspended his contract. Krasovsky made the remarks during an episode of his program in which science fiction writer Sergey Lukyanenko was a guest. The latter said that back in 1980, in a hospital in the Uzhgorod region in Western Ukraine, local children told him that “Ukraine is occupied by Muscovites,” and if this were not the case, their lives would be better. Krasovsky responded to this by saying: “It is necessary to straight-up drown these children. A kid said that ‘Muscovites have occupied’ – you immediately throw them into a river with a turbulent current.” When Lukyanenko objected, Krasovsky added that children could still be “beaten into the hut and burned.” On Sunday night Simonyan published a statement on her Telegram channel, calling Krasovsky’s words “wild and disgusting.” “Perhaps Anton will explain what temporary insanity caused it and how it came out of his mouth. It is hard to believe that Krasovsky sincerely believed that children should be drowned,” she wrote. Simonyan said she is suspending his contract with the broadcaster, “because neither I nor the rest of the RT staff can allow even the thought that one of us is capable of sharing such nonsense.” “For the children of Ukraine, as well as the children of Donbass, and all other children, I wish that all this ends as soon as possible, and they can live and study in peace again – in the language they consider native.” Krasovsky first came to international prominence, in the early 2010s, as an LGBT rights activist. During a TV show in 2013, he ‘came out’ live on air, while expressing opposition to Russia’s so-called ‘gay propaganda’ law. He blasted both President Vladimir Putin and his predecessor, Dmitry Medvedev, and was lauded by Western media. That led to the journalist writing for The Guardian and featuring in other American and British outlets. Since 2021 Krasovsky, who is HIV positive, has presented a program on RT Russian called ‘Антонимы’ (Antonyms).",3.462888111281765,3.938037274348342,-0.47514916306657673,4
2022-10-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/565204-kiev-denies-dirty-bomb/,Kiev denies Moscow’s ‘dirty bomb’ allegations,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has denied Moscow’s allegations that Kiev is preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a “dirty bomb,” and has pointed the finger at Russia instead. Zelensky was commenting on what he called “a phone carousel” by the Russian Defense Minister: on Sunday, Sergey Shoigu shared with his French, Turkish and British colleagues his concern over “possible provocations by Ukraine using a ‘dirty bomb.’” Russian state news agency RIA Novosti earlier reported that the goal of such a provocation would be to accuse Moscow of using weapons of mass destruction in a ploy to “launch a powerful anti-Russia campaign”. In a video address on social media, Zelensky claimed that “wherever Russia has brought death and degradation,” Ukraine is “returning a normal life.” “And there’s only one subject who can use nuclear weapons in our part of Europe, and this subject is the one who ordered comrade Shoigu to call somewhere,” the Ukrainian leader said. So-called “dirty bombs” use conventional explosives along with radioactive material. While it could not rival a nuclear warhead in terms of power, such a device could disperse a radiation cloud around a radius of several kilometers from its explosion. Zelensky expressed confidence that “everyone understands” who is “the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war” and called on the world to react “in the toughest possible way” when it comes to “another escalating step” by Russia. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba also commented on Moscow’s allegations, saying that “Russian lies” about a “dirty bomb” “are as absurd as they are dangerous.” “Firstly, Ukraine is a committed NPT (non-proliferation treaty) member: we neither have any ‘dirty bombs’ nor plan to acquire any. Secondly, Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves,” the minister said. According to the British Defense Ministry’s readout of the conversation between its head, Ben Wallace, and his Russian counterpart Shoigu, the Russian minister “alleged that Ukraine was planning actions facilitated by Western countries, including the UK, to escalate the conflict in Ukraine.” Wallace “refuted these claims” and warned Shoigu that “such allegations should not be used as a pretext for greater escalation,” the ministry said. A statement on Defence Secretary Ben Wallace's call with Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu: pic.twitter.com/BbQ9muxKeC Earlier, in an interview with Deutsche Welle, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that any use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine will lead to “severe consequences” for Moscow, but refused to reveal details on these. At the same time, he said that the risk of such a Russian attack remains low. Numerous Russian officials have been insisting that the country wasn’t threatening anybody with nukes and have pointed to Russia’s military doctrine, which states that nuclear weapons may only be used if such arms or other weapons of mass destruction are being deployed against the state, or if it is faced with an existential threat from conventional arms.",2.513771296279945,3.934349507000384,-1.4205782107204392,8

The Ukrainian government, however, has repeatedly ruled out any compromise with Moscow. Speaking at a peace conference organized by a Catholic charity in Rome, Macron said that while “calls for peace might seem…like a betrayal” of Ukraine, the “international community” will one day support a negotiated settlement between Kiev and Moscow, the Associated Press reported. However, peace cannot be “captured by Russian power,” Macron added. “We want the Ukrainian people to decide at a certain point…the moment and the terms of peace.” The French president has expressed this same sentiment already, declaring earlier this summer that “Ukraine will decide when the conditions are met to build peace.” The leaders of the US, UK, and NATO have issued similarly-worded statements while continuing to bankroll and arm Ukraine’s military, and France, along with the other members of the G7, has pledged to maintain this support for “as long as it takes.” Ukraine’s terms, however, will likely preclude any settlement in the near future. President Vladimir Zelensky has pledged not to negotiate with Russia as long as Vladimr Putin remains in power, signing a decree earlier this month forbidding talks with the Russian president. Zelensky has also promised to seize the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye, which acceded to membership of the Russian Federation following referendums last month. Additionally, the Ukrainian leader has vowed to capture Crimea, which joined Russia following a referendum in 2014. Not only would an assault on these territories present a formidable military challenge for Zelensky’s forces, a full-scale attack on Russian land would invite Moscow to retaliate with “all the means available” to it, Putin cautioned in a recent speech. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was more blunt when he warned Kiev in July that an attack on Crimea would trigger “Judgement Day” for Kiev. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has warned the UK, France, and other Western powers that it believes Ukraine is preparing to detonate a so-called “dirty bomb” in a bid to frame Russia and escalate the conflict to the point of NATO intervention. While British Defense Minister Ben Wallace refuted these claims and intimated that London’s support for Ukraine would continue, he said after the call that the UK “stands ready” to “de-escalate this conflict.”",2.467673268517381,4.272693367562407,-1.8050200990450258,8

Kirill Stremousov wrote on Telegram that the tragedy happened at about 2 pm local time. “An improvised explosive device, attached to a pole and detonated remotely, killed a civilian in the city of Kherson.

His nation would still need “pipeline gas” from Russia, the official believes. “When the war is over, we should use gas from Russia again,” Kretschmer told the German tabloid Bild’s weekend edition when asked what he would say to people demanding the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline be commissioned. Nord Stream 2 was one of the two pipelines designed to deliver natural gas from Russia to Germany via a route along the bed of the Baltic Sea. The project was shelved in late February as Germany halted its certification process when Russia recognized the two Donbass republics as independent. Kretschmer believes Germany would need the Russian gas pipeline infrastructure to be fully restored if it seeks to ensure sufficient energy supply. He was asked if he believes the two Nord Stream pipelines damaged in an alleged act of sabotage in late September would be repaired. “We will need pipeline gas and that is only possible with functioning pipelines,” he told Bild. Russia should not be the only energy supplier for Germany in the future, the prime minister said, adding that Berlin should also secure long-term gas contracts with the US, Qatar and other Arab nations, as well as “develop our own gas [fields] in the North Sea.” His words came amid an acute energy crunch in Germany as the EU has been striving to wean itself off Russian energy supplies. Brussels’ sanctions policy against Moscow has so far brought more ill than good to Germany, Kretschmer believes. An economic “tsunami is building up now,” the state leader warned. According to him, entrepreneurs in Saxony face a “dramatic” struggle “for survival” and many of them “are about to give up” in a matter of “weeks, not months.” Kretschmer also said that the federal government relief measures had not yet been properly implemented, while Berlin’s energy saving tips only “get people annoyed.” The prime minister also called for a speedy diplomatic solution to the ongoing conflict, adding that the EU should team up with the US, China, India and Japan to stop the war. At the same time, he said there was “not a single reason why Ukraine should give up even one square meter of its territory.” Russia must also compensate for all the damage the conflict dealt to Ukraine, he added. Four former Ukrainian regions – the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye regions – were officially declared part of Russia in early October, after voters in those territories overwhelmingly supported the move in referendums.

Russia’s statement came after EU’s main decision-making body, the European Council, condemned Moscow on Friday for “indiscriminate” missile and drone attacks on civilian targets in Kiev and elsewhere in Ukraine, adding that there was “growing evidence” of war crimes against Ukrainians. In a response released on Saturday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova rebuffed the accusations as “the height of hypocrisy.” The European Union has lost the moral right to speak about war crimes because, for eight years, it has turned a blind eye to the killing of civilians, women and children during the shelling of the Donbass by the regime in Kiev. Zakharova further accused the European bloc of “covering up Kiev’s criminal actions.” She argued that, instead of seeking a peaceful solution, the EU has been “senselessly investing significant sums into prolonging the fighting.” The spokeswoman also claimed that Ukrainian soldiers who receive Western training and weapons are targeting civilians. Russia stepped up strikes on Ukraine this month, hitting many thermal power plants and power lines across the country, among other targets. President Vladimir Putin said the intensification was a retaliation against “terrorist attacks” on Russian soil, including a truck bombing that had recently damaged a strategic bridge connecting the Crimean Peninsula with Russia proper. Kiev has not confirmed its involvement in the bridge attack, but several top officials and government agencies openly celebrated the bombing.

Another video emerged on social media shortly afterwards, showing the incident from a different angle, from which the plane can be seen nosediving and exploding upon impact. Home to over 600,000 people, Irkutsk lies about 500 kilometers north of the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, and was known as a place of exile in Tsarist Russia. It is close to Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater lake. Irkutsk Region Governor Igor Kobzev wrote on his Telegram channel that fire crews and other first responders were working at the crash site.",3.3725520792757346,2.655034722853793,0.7175173564219417,0

2022-10-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/565180-irkutsk-plane-building-crash/,Two dead as fighter jet crashes into house in Siberia,"Russia's Emergencies Ministry reported on Sunday that two pilots died when a Su-30 fighter jet crashed into a two-story house in the southern Siberian city of Irkutsk. Local Governor Igor Kobzev said there were no other casualties. A ministry statement explained that the aircraft was conducting a test flight when it crashed. Irkutsk is a major centre for Russia's avitation industry, and a production hub for Sukhoi military planes. The plane nosedived into a two-story building, causing a blaze which spanned some 200 square meters, the governor wrote on Telegram. Around 150 homes in the area have been left without electricity due to damaged power lines, with repairs currently underway, Kobzev said. The governor also promised that the owners of the affected buildings will receive compensation from the government. The Emergencies Ministry said firefighters, who swiftly arrived on site, were able to promptly localize and extinguish the blaze. The Investigative Committee has clarified that the Su-30 was on a test flight, with no ammunition on board. An informed source told RT that the plane had been circling around Irkutsk for around 20 minutes before going down. Another fighter jet had been sent up to figure out what the problem was. When it approached the Su-30 it became clear that both pilots were unconscious, the source said. “The situation couldn’t be fixed and the plane crashed into a residential area,” he added. The incident saw one home completely destroyed and another partially damaged, according to the source. It is the second such incident in Russia this week, following a disaster in Krasnodar Region on Monday, which left 15 people dead and 26 injured.",2.3998594490876584,4.4953011963542275,-2.095441747266569,0
2022-10-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/565176-russia-iss-agreement-extension/,Russia explains why it wants to extend ISS participation,"Moscow is likely to agree to extend the International Space Station (ISS) agreement until 2028, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov said on Sunday. In the meantime, according to the official, Russia intends to focus on launching its own space facility. Speaking to reporters at Vostochny spaceport in Russia’s Far East, Manturov, who also holds the post of trade minister, signaled that Moscow believes “it is possible to extend the ISS operations while the Russian orbital station is being deployed in the minimal configuration.” He said this meant the current agreement could be extended until 2028. The extension would be negotiated with the national space agencies and governments that participate in the international project. In total, 14 countries are involved in the ISS, including Russia, the US, Japan, Canada, and a number of European nations. The operations of the space station are regulated by the 1998 ISS Intergovernmental Agreement, which provides for the use of the facility until the end of 2024. However, Manturov noted that NASA had shifted its official retirement date to 2030 and had asked its partners, including Russian space agency Roscosmos, to continue cooperation until then. In late July, Roscosmos chief Yury Borisov said Russia would withdraw from the ISS after 2024, adding that Moscow intended to fulfill its obligations to its foreign partners. He noted at the time that the decision had nothing to do with geopolitics, including the Ukraine conflict. Later, Sergey Krikalev, the executive director for manned space programs at Roscosmos, clarified that the timing of withdrawal depended on the technical state of the ISS, and could come at any time after 2024. While making plans to withdraw from the ISS, Russia also intends to assemble its own space facility dubbed the Russian Orbital Service Station (ROSS). According to Vladimir Solovyov, a former Soviet cosmonaut and chief designer for spacecraft manufacturer RSC Energia, the construction of a new facility will not start before 2028, while its first module could be launched between 2027 and 2028. The project will be built on the Science Power Module 1, which was originally designed for the ISS, but is now being repurposed, Solovyov said at the time.",4.168835789954704,2.0679486986115125,2.1008870913431914,6
2022-10-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/565173-ukraine-money-wages-pension/,Ukraine issues pensions warning to EU,"Ukraine may not have the money to pay wages and pensions unless the European Union speeds up its financial aid, the country’s prime minister has warned. He said Brussels should act quickly to transfer all of the €9 billion ($8.8 billion) that was pledged to Kiev in May. “The most important thing for us is that it comes as soon as possible,” Denis Shmigal told German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Saturday. “We need it so that our financial system can survive. Whether it will come in the form of a loan or a grant is less important.” Shmigal warned that “in an extremely negative scenario,” Ukraine could end up “not paying wages and not paying pensions.” The premie minister accused Russia of attempting to create “a humanitarian catastrophe” in Ukraine that could “trigger a new migration tsunami.” He called for the seizure of Russian assets that were frozen after Moscow launched its military operation in February, so the funds can be used for Ukraine’s recovery. The damage from eight months of warfare amounts to “more than $750 billion,” the official claimed. He said Ukraine will need more than 10,000 mobile power generators and warming centers during the winter. Alexander Kharchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s energy minister, said this week that around 40% of the country’s energy infrastructure sites have been “seriously damaged” by recent waves of Russian strikes. Kiev began receiving German IRIS-T air defense missile systems this month. However, the country now urgently needs more ammunition and anti-drone jammers in order to counter aerial attacks, Shmigal said. Russia has stepped up its missile and kamikaze drone attacks on Kiev and other major Ukrainian cities this month, repeatedly hitting thermal power plants and power lines, among other targets. President Vladimir Putin said the intensification of the strikes was a retaliation against “terrorist attacks” on Russian soil, including a truck bombing that damaged a strategic bridge, connecting the Crimean Peninsula with Russia proper.",2.4170591422578207,2.4572067702920073,-0.04014762803418659,7
2022-10-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/565120-bloody-musical-how-russia-survived/,Twenty years on from the Moscow theater siege: How a horror terrorist attack was a landmark moment in post-Soviet Russia,"Back in 2002, Russia was conducting a painful counter-terrorism operation in Chechnya. Despite all the problems inherited from the Soviet Army, the country's soldiers of that time were efficient in open battles. However, they were now mired in slow, seemingly endless counter-guerrilla operations in a republic covered with mountains and forests. Ambushes, bombings, and raids came one after another in an endless carousel of attacks. Explosions could constantly be heard thundering in southern Russia, as homemade bombs set off in crowded places sometimes claimed dozens of lives at a time. To make matters worse, the Islamists had now move onto suicide bombing. The apogee of these methods was the hostage-taking that occurred exactly 20 years ago in the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow. After more than a hundred people ultimately perished in the ‘Nord-Ost’ attack, any notion of dealing with the terrorists through negotiation was completely ruled out, and society braced itself for an uncompromising struggle. The Caucasian terrorist underground quickly adopted the suicide tactics used in the Middle East. In Chechnya it was mostly girls who were sent to their deaths. The candidates were groomed, as they usually are in totalitarian religious sects: the girl becomes inspired by the idea that she is a ‘chosen one’ who will soon ascend to heaven to find bliss in the company of men who have also died in the name of faith. The terrorists enlisted mostly poorly educated girls from mountain villages who had grown up in a rigidly patriarchal society. Many of these suffered from serious mental health issues, and recruits were also generally doped up with tranquilizers. The preparation of a suicide bomber sometimes included sexual violence – according to the rigid concepts at play, a woman had no future in this life and she could only seek happiness in the next world. After entering this system, instances in which the drafted suicide bombers survived were extremely rare. In fact, you could count them on your fingers. Chechnya’s most authoritative and odious militant leader, Shamil Basayev, created a special group called Riyad-us Saliheen to organize terrorist attacks, and suicide bombings in particular. It was made up of a small, permanent core of groomers, but ordinary participants were rapidly squandered, disappearing in the flames of explosions. Despite all this violent creativity, the terrorists’ situation was difficult. They were gradually losing the guerrilla war, as their ranks were reduced and small detachments disintegrated completely. The only way they could win was to commit terrorist acts to psychologically break the authorities and induce Moscow to negotiate with their leaders. Two people played a key role in this new campaign. Basayev was a recognized terrorist leader who’d organized the Chechen militants’ largest successful mass hostage-taking in Budyonnovsk in 1995. At that time, Russia met their demands, which allowed the militants to save their movement from collapse. Now, Basayev’s evil genius was needed to plan an even more grandiose attack. Another important figure was Aslan Maskhadov, who was considered to be a ‘moderate’ commander. He was needed so that Russia would have someone acceptable to negotiate a ceasefire with. Without Maskhadov, Basayev was just a bloody, senseless thug. Conversely, without Basayev, Maskhadov was a powerless king without a kingdom, who would be unable to force negotiations on Moscow. Basayev organized a large detachment for terrorist attacks. It included 44 people, including 22 suicide bombers. The group was headed by Movsar Barayev, the nephew of Arbi Barayev, a top field commander and pathological sadist, who had organized training for suicide bombers in Chechnya along with Basayev and even sent his own relative, Khava, on a suicide mission as one of the first ‘martyrs.’ Arbi had already been killed during a special operation conducted by Russia, and now his nephew was planning to surpass his uncle. However, though Movsar Barayev had ambition, he lacked charisma and intelligence. He intended to emerge as an authoritative commander, but Basayev put him at the head of the squad precisely because he considered him to be an expendable youngster. The rest of the squad consisted of the same kind of people. Half were female suicide bombers, and most of the men were 20-23 years old. There were only a few real fanatics who knew they were going to perish and were prepared to die for the cause. One of these was Ruslan Elmurzaev, who was supposed to look after Movsar Barayev. The contingent’s weapons were mainly Kalashnikov assault rifles and grenades, while the suicide bombers’ tools were the explosives attached to their bodies, as well as pistols. On the evening of October 23, 2002, Moscow journalist Alexandra Koroleva was attending a musical called Nord-Ost at the Moscow Theater on Dubrovka, a show based on a Soviet adventure novel. Luckily, as it turned out, she was feeling ill and had to leave after the first act. The lobby was full of people and the atmosphere was festive and relaxed, but a nasty autumn rain was pouring down outside. Alexandra arrived home chilled, poured herself a cup of tea, turned on the radio, and learned that she’d cheated death by about ten minutes – the theater had been seized by heavily armed terrorists. A large theater was a good target for the militants. A closed room without windows in which hundreds of people were gathered was an ideal venue from the assailants’ point of view. Barayev’s agents in Moscow had inspected several buildings. They had initially planned to seize the Bolshoi Theater, but this was rejected as it was too well guarded. But they liked the Theater Center on Dubrovka, as Nord-Ost had become a hot ticket in Moscow and there were always a lot of people at the performances. The militants came to the capital in small groups and settled in safe houses, while their weapons were delivered separately. The leaders attended the show several times to study the building and assess the security (which was nearly non-existent). On the evening of October 23, the terrorists drove up to the theater in minibuses when the second act was just beginning. At first, the audience mistook the people in camouflage for an element in the show. But then the actors were thrown off the stage and several bursts of gunfire raked the ceiling, among screams of ‘This is a seizure!’ The clueless spectators were beaten with machine-gun butts, while the few guards, armed only with gas pistols, were easily neutralized. The terrorists carried out their plan smoothly and efficiently. Twenty-two female terrorists spread out throughout the hall, each with a belt laden with bombs consisting of plastic explosives, nails, screws, and ball bearings. The belts were activated manually – to do this, you had to insert a battery and close the terminals. Two bombs made from powerful artillery shells were also placed in the hall – one in the center, and the other on the balcony. Several smaller bombs were planted around the hall as well. The blast zones of the various devices overlapped, so that a single explosion would hit everyone in the hall, while bringing down the theater’s high ceiling at the same time. The 916 people inside were now in the hands of the terrorists. In the confusion of the first few minutes, many were able to call home and contact their families. One man, who happened to be an FSB operative, managed to hold on to his phone and exchanged text messages with his comrades outside the theater for quite a while. He was later found dead. A woman from the audience recalled phoning her husband and struggling to explain what was happening – it just felt surreal, too absurd to be true. While the experience was traumatic for everyone, it was especially horrifying for a lone Chechen woman in the audience: she was scared of being identified and executed for the ‘betrayal’ of having come to the same theater as the Russians. The Dubrovka Theater is a large building with a complicated interior layout. Because of that, many were able to evade the terrorists roaming through the long corridors and escape. Several theater employees reached one of the windows, tied their clothes together to form a rope and climbed down; one of them fell down but survived, with just a broken leg. Seven theater technicians locked themselves in the shop area. Operatives of an EMERCOM team that arrived on the scene risked their lives to quickly and quietly saw through window bars and get them out. A few more were rescued from the second floor using a ladder brought to the back of the building. One employee found a small utility room, locked herself in there, turned off the lights, and sat inside for the next three days, quiet as a mouse – one can only imagine what she went through. In the first few chaotic hours, before the terrorists could take control of the entire building and before a police cordon could be set up outside, many were able to escape, but this was also when some of the first tragedies occurred. Colonel Konstantin Vasilyev entered the building on his own: he believed he would be able to save at least some people by offering himself as a valuable hostage in exchange for women and children. He was shot by the terrorists. A young woman named Olga Romanova followed an equally noble impulse, but suffered the same fate – after learning about the hostage situation, she went inside the theater and started to publicly shame Barayev and his men. Such a genuine outburst might have worked in a novel, but not in reality. The terrorists simply murdered her. There was one hostage in the main hall whose presence was, ironically, a stroke of luck for many. Georgy Vasiliev was one of the authors of the musical. He had a chance to escape but, feeling a personal responsibility for the events, chose not to. This proved to be a right decision. Vasiliev later recalled: “Almost immediately, we had serious problems. For example, the terrorists suddenly noticed that there was thick smoke coming out of the big, heavy objects they’d used to barricade the stage doors with, and they didn’t know what these were. These were fog machines. The terrorists had no choice but to turn to the hostages and ask if anyone knew what to do with these. Fortunately, I was there and knew what to do. In fact, I think my being there helped avoid many dangerous situations. What happened next proved it was possible to get some concessions out of the militants. The optical filters started to smoke and catch fire. The computer used to control the lights wasn’t responding and the filters were not designed for such a long exposure to powerful stage lights. There was a smell of burning plastic, people were frightened. The terrorists tried to act cool at first, but I explained to them what a terrifying trap we would all be in should a fire break out in the theater. I told them they would not even have time to make their political demands and would be dead in a matter of minutes, along with everyone else. Intimidated by this scenario, they agreed to give me some radios, so I was able to get in touch with my people inside the theater, and for a while I even managed to stay in contact with those outside. For example, I got in touch with our technical director Andrei Yalovich, who was outside of the building. He did a lot to help free the hostages. I could talk about these episodes for a very long time - those three days were full of situations like this.” Meanwhile, Barayev began his bloody performance in collaboration with others outside the theater. The terrorist ideologue Movladi Udugov was immediately interviewed by the BBC. He talked about the good intentions of the terrorists, who wanted to stop the war. They understood the importance of media engagement. Controlled phone calls of hostages were organized in attempts to reach out to journalists and organize demonstrations in support of their demands to end hostilities and withdraw troops from Chechnya. Popular singer Iosif Kobzon was the first to talk to the terrorists. In the theater, the performer-turned-politician was accompanied by Sunday Times correspondent Mark Franchetti. Basayev threatened to blow the building with hostages inside if his demands weren’t met within a week. Kobzon talked to the group’s leaders and negotiated the first favor – he took with him a woman with two children and another baby she passed as her own, deceiving the terrorists. During an interview, Barayev blurted out that the attack was a joint operation of Basayev and Maskhadov. Later he talked about this in detail, leaving no room for ambiguity. This wasn’t exactly pleasant for Maskhadov who had an image in the West as a ‘reasonable’ leader. The slip up, however, was quickly forgotten beneath the torrent of unfolding events. The government tried to engage as many VIPs as they could in the negotiations. At different times, a few other politicians, including opposition members, entered the concert hall after Kobzon, children’s doctor Leonid Roshal and the Jordanian doctor Anwar Al-Said. Roshal was in jeopardy when he was talking to terrorists. Two girls asked for permission to go to toilet and escaped through a window. A brief gunfight erupted, during which a major of the Alfa unit had to leave cover to draw enemy fire. He was wounded but managed to wound a terrorist in return, covering the escape. Barayev was furious and threatened to shoot the doctor, but grew softer when Roshal bandaged the wounded fighter, and let the doctor treat other hostages. And not a moment too soon – many were in critical condition. At the same time, the authorities were planning an assault. The opportunity for negotiations was exhausted and any continuation of the siege likely meant death for the hostages. The FSB was also concerned the terrorists may have lost their nerve, as the siege was taxing for them as well. Special counter-terrorist units Alfa and Vympel, formed back in Soviet times, had to lead the charge. Security forces found a theater of a similar design to use as a training ground before the assault. The positions of the terrorists inside the building were scouted quite well; while tunnels under the theater were analyzed. . For the hostages, things were very hard right from the start. The terrorists did not allow them to be fed and gave them very little water. People were dehydrated. And sitting in a chair without standing up for a long period of time was an intense physical stress. A particularly macabre element of the siege was the idea to use the orchestra pit as the toilet. Obviously, it was extremely degrading, especially for women, who had to use it while being watched by the terrorists, who were all men. But with nearly a thousand people in the hall, the pit quickly turned into a stinking cesspool, poisoning the air in the closed space. At some point, it almost led to a fire. It happened after Vasiliev suggested putting some lamps on music stands to light the way so that people could at least avoid stepping in the fecal matter. One of the power extension cords short-circuited, and the music sheets and cables caught fire. Head of the electrical department Alexander Fedyakin, who was among the hostages, saved the day by quickly putting the fire out with a fire extinguisher he grabbed off the wall. The terrorists cranked up the atmosphere of hellish surrealism by praying on stage, putting on religious songs and firing in the air. A hostage recalled that songs in Arabic and in Chechen felt better than those sung in Russian: if you understood the lyrics – urging to cleanse Jerusalem from infidels, for example – everything started feeling too surreal. The hostages were on the brink of collapse. Over three days, they had about 400 milliliters of water each, and the miasma from the orchestra pit caused heavy physical suffering, even for those who were a dozen rows away. In the early hours of October 26, one of the hostages lost it completely. He ran through the hall. The terrorists opened fire and another hostage was killed. At that moment, the officers of the Alpha and Vympel groups were already on their way to the auditorium. 180 officers took part in the operation. The terrorists were unable to control the entire perimeter of the building due to its considerable length. Besides, the female suicide bombers were confined to the audience hall where they stayed all the time, and the remaining 22 men were a small force. This allowed the special operations forces to advance unnoticed. The first group of Alpha fighters entered the building through a gay bar adjacent to the theater. Once inside, they regrouped in preparation for the assault. Another unit entered the building from the basement, guided by local urban explorers. And it was then that a decision was made that, to this day, is deemed to be the most controversial part of the assault plan. The manner in which mines and explosive devices had been placed throughout the auditorium made the option of a successful storming operation seemingly impossible. Therefore, it was decided to use a fentanyl-based soporific gas. This plan offered hope that the terrorists would not have time to blow up the building. However, it also meant imminent death for some of the hostages kept there. The effect of soporific gas on people can be very different, not to mention the additional dimension of the hostages’ mental and emotional exhaustion. Those who planned the assault operation believed this was the only way to go – the terrorists had to be put to sleep or weakened, at least some of them, otherwise the building would be blown up, claiming the lives of everyone locked inside. The gas was pumped into the theater’s ventilation system. One of the assault groups intentionally revealed itself at the building’s façade to divert the terrorists’ attention from the hostages. After that, the situation developed rapidly. The male terrorists rushed to the façade from the audience hall. Another assault group stormed in from the basement. They were supposed to deal with the female bombers, which was the riskiest part of the whole operation. Some of these had already dozed off, others were confused and disoriented by the gas, just like most of the hostages. The Alpha officers had to act fast, as the bombers were seated side by side with the hostages. For the bombs to go off, they just needed to insert batteries into their suicide belts and join the wires. And some of the terrorists had already put the batteries in. However, the Alpha fighters were fast and efficient, and none of the terrorists in the auditorium managed to open fire or detonate the bombs. Later, there were accusations against the special operations group that they should have taken the terrorists alive. However, it would have been deadly dangerous to move what amounted to ‘live bombs,’ therefore all the suicide bombers were killed on the spot, including those who were already asleep. At the same time, a brief but intense fight unfolded outside the auditorium. The terrorists who had rushed to the building façade, where a feigned attack was staged, were killed by sniper fire. Movsar Barayev tried to shoot back from the room where he had spoken in front of the cameras, and was finally killed by a hand grenade one of the officers hurled into the room. To the deep distress and anguish of the entire country, the outcome of the rescue operation proved to be less satisfactory than the military operation carried out at the Dubrovka Theater. Much has been written about how paramedics had allegedly not been warned about what type of gas was used and what the hostages were suffering from. In reality, things were more complicated. There was poor coordination between the special forces, first responders, and doctors, which resulted in a brief moment of chaos and mix-ups during the evacuation. As a result, some hostages did not receive an antidote, while others were unlucky enough to get two doses, which could have been lethal. On top of that, many people were so dehydrated and had suffered so much during the siege that they died even if aid was administered correctly. And ambulances were too slow to arrive. Previous terrorist attacks had shown that radio conversations could tip the criminals off that the building was going to be stormed, so, this time, paramedics were only told at the last moment to get to the Dubrovka Theater. As a result, even though no hostages were killed during the assault, many died in the aftermath. The total death toll, including the hostages killed by the terrorists prior to the operation, rose to 130, with most deaths resulting from gas poisoning exacerbated by stress, dehydration, preexisting conditions, and days of extreme physical discomfort. Almost immediately, observes pointed out that better coordination and more streamlined evacuation efforts would have saved many more lives. In his address to the nation dedicated to the Dubrovka Theater tragedy, President Vladimir Putin was frank: We were not able to save everyone. Forgive us. For Russians, the hostage crisis was in many ways a revelation about the country and its people. Admittedly, there were many hard questions and unflattering answers about the management of the rescue operation. Yet there was also the other side of the coin. The terrorist gang was wiped out completely, and the worst-case scenario was averted, although there was a time when the building was just seconds away from total destruction. People in the theater and society at large showed a lot of courage, stamina, and selflessness. Theater employees, who had never volunteered to be heroes, provided vital support to the hostages. Almost all politicians and public figures who participated in the negotiations did an exemplary job, even though they had different, oftentimes diametrically opposed, views and agendas. Granted, there were exceptions, and many were later angry with the journalists who showed Alfa commandoes on live television at the very start of the assault – a broadcast the terrorists might have been watching, too. Other media figures, however, helped by participating in negotiations and helping get food and water to the hostages, who were also very supportive, helping each other get through those three days of hell. The terrorist attack failed to force the federal government to negotiate with terrorists in the Caucasus. The Dubrovka hostage crisis laid bare many of Russia’s weaknesses and was a devastating tragedy. However, it was also a time when the government and the public showed a level of courage and mutual support which broke new ground in the post-Soviet period.",3.608454961451948,3.7022663202449246,-0.09381135879297675,1
2022-10-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/565164-hero-ukraine-detained-treason/,'Hero of Ukraine' detained on treason charges – media,"An 83-year old businessman and former lawmaker with a Hero of Ukraine title has been detained on treason charges in the Kiev-controlled part of Zaporozhye Region, local media said, citing sources in Ukrainian law enforcement. Vyacheslav Boguslayev, board chairman of the Zaporozhye-based aircraft engine manufacturer Motor Sich, is facing a life sentence, local website Zabor said. On Saturday, according to Zabor's sources, the Ukrainian security forces took Boguslaev under escort to Kiev. The property of the businessman who, as the site claims, “has long been known for clearly pro-Russian views,” was searched. Ukrainian media have confirmed the information, citing their own sources. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Main Council of the Zaporozhye Region's Russian administration, took to Telegram to comment on Boguslaev’s reported detention by the Ukrainian Security Service, saying: “Ukraine devours its heroes.” He also published two photos of what he claims to be Boguslaev’s detention. Boguslaev received the title of Hero of Ukraine in 2000 “for outstanding services to the Ukrainian state in the development of domestic engineering.” The engineer and businessman has more than a dozen other awards, including the Russian Order of Friendship, given to him in 2004 for his contribution to “strengthening Russian-Ukrainian cooperation.” Since the launch of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, Kiev has imposed drastic measures against people it considers to be “collaborators” – those who harbor pro-Russian views or help Moscow’s forces in any way.",3.458264327958992,3.242497437555141,0.215766890403851,5
2022-10-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/565165-zelensky-world-strike-russia-ukraine/,Zelensky calls for 'world' to 'strike' Kremlin,"The world should make it clear to Russia that it would have to face an immediate military response if it decides to use nuclear arms against Kiev, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky told the broadcasters CBC and CTV in an interview this week. The Ukrainian leader accused Russia of using “terrorist” blackmail tactics, and said Moscow only understands the language of force. Zelensky accused Moscow of repeatedly threatening to strike “decision-making centers” in Ukraine, including with nuclear arms, and said the world should respond if such a strike does take place. “It does not matter if Ukraine is a NATO member or a non-NATO nation,” he said, adding that no one should be allowed to “blackmail [other nations] like a terrorist.” According to the Ukrainian president, the world should tell the Russians: “If you strike Bankova Street [the Ukrainian President’s Office], there will be a strike at where you are.” If Moscow does strike Kiev, there should be “a strike at the decision-making centers” in Russia the next “second,” regardless of the results of the Russian attack, he added. Such a stance would not be blackmail, but a form of self-defense that would supposedly prevent those issuing threats from following through on their plans, Zelensky argued. “One can talk about humanism for a long time,” the Ukrainian president told journalists, adding that his nation lives in a situation where it has a “neighbor that does not understand anything but force.” The Ukrainian president also blamed the Russian public for what is happening in Ukraine. “The society of the Russian Federation must know that they attack our [Ukrainian] society,” he said, adding that Russians “support a terrorist authority.” If the Russian people “do not exert pressure” on President Vladimir Putin, “the world will isolate itself from you,” Zelensky warned, adding that nobody is willing to talk to Russia as it only speaks “the language of threats.” The Ukrainian president also said that the world must itself decide who to talk to in Russia since “they are terrorists now. All of them.” It is not the first time the Ukrainian leader has made such appeals. Earlier, he called on NATO to carry out preventive strikes on Russia to deter the use of nuclear weapons. At that time, his words sparked an angry reaction from Moscow, which accused Zelensky of trying to spark a third world war. The Ukrainian president then walked back his statement, claiming it was mistranslated and that he really meant to say preemptive sanctions, not “preemptive strikes.” Back in September, Putin said Russia would defend its territory using all means available and would do “everything to ensure the security of its people.” At the same time, he also said Moscow was ready for talks with Kiev and called on Ukraine to “to cease all hostilities” and return to the negotiating table. He made his remarks at a ceremony for the signing of treaties on the inclusion of the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics (LPR and DPR), as well as the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, which declared independence from Ukraine, into Russia. Moscow then said that the status of the four regions, which formally joined Russia a week later, is not to be negotiated as part of any potential talks with Ukraine.",3.7957149847221885,2.783383914139592,1.0123310705825963,8
2022-10-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/565159-ozhelskiy-son-fridman-sanctions/,Sanctioned son of Russian tycoon records ‘I’m a Ukrainian’ video appeal,"Alexander Ozhelskiy, the son of Russian business tycoon Mikhail Fridman, has called on Ukraine to lift “unfair” sanctions against him. In a YouTube video address, recorded in English, the 22-year-old accused “f****** bureaucrats” of ignoring his pro-Kiev stance. “I can't believe that my position regarding the war wasn't even taken into consideration. And I can't believe that the sole reason for these sanctions is my relation to another person,” Ozhelskiy said. He emphasized that he is “appalled and offended” by the Ukrainian authorities’ October 20 decision to include him in their list of 256 sanctioned Russian businessmen and their relatives. Ozhelskiy explained that he has been opposing the Russian military operation in Ukraine “since day one,” left Russia immediately after its launch on February 24 and has no plans to return. “I left a lot, I left my friends, I left my business and I left it because I value my freedom more,” the businessman explained, revealing that he is now based in Dubai and lives in an Airbnb apartment, rather than in a “f****** mansion.” Ozhelskiy said that in the past he had participated in “pro-Ukrainian protests” in London and in some demonstartions in Russia and that he doesn’t understand why “a bunch of f****** bureaucrats” is ignoring those facts. “I think that this decision should be overturned,” he said. Fridman’s son emphasized that he considers himself Ukrainian and “can't believe” that he cannot visit his relatives in the country anymore. Ozhelskiy is the only son of Lviv-born Fridman. In May, he, along with his four sisters, featured on the Forbes’ list of the richest heirs of Russian billionaires, with his inheritance share estimated at $2,6 billion. Fridman, however, made it clear several years ago that he was going to leave almost all of his wealth to the charity rather than to his children. In March, the $13-billion worth magnate said that the sanctions imposed against him and against other Russian businessmen by the Western countries are “unfair” and “useless.” He also described an assumption that being close to the Kremlin is paramount to make billions in Russia, as a “very typical and inappropriate” myth.",3.4942617473567203,3.460630511012802,0.0336312363439184,5

The body, Rossotrudnichestvo, has opened “heating points”, which provide those in need with an opportunity to get out of the cold while enjoying tea or watching a movie. “Little by little, [the people] are coming. In Finland, Luxembourg, they were already warming up yesterday. The film program is up to February,” a spokesperson told the Russian media on Saturday. As the energy crisis continues in the European Union, exacerbated by anti-Russia sanctions and a sharp decrease in Russian energy supplies, Rossotrudnichestvo said on Friday. It added that “human warmth from Russia” and its “traditional hospitality” is what “freezing European families” need. While the agency emphasized that its Russian houses “are outside of politics,” the head of the agency, Evgeny Primakov, made it clear who he believes is responsible for the unfolding crisis. “Europeans, do not freeze because of your stupid and evil leaders! If your children are wrapped in jackets at home and you have started to save heavily on electricity because Ursula [von der Leyen], Olaf [Scholz] and Emmanuel [Macron] gave away your money for weapons for the Ukrainian Nazis, come and warm up in our cultural centers in your capitals,” he wrote on Telegram. Apart from having tea and enjoying movies and cartoons, visitors to the Russian houses will also be able to recharge their phones and get involved in “a lot of interesting things going on,” Primakov said. Following the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the EU authorities pledged to end their dependence on Russian energy supplies as quickly as possible. President Vladimir Putin likened the bloc’s attempts to cut itself off from Russian fossil fuels to economic “suicide.”",2.8403684000558944,3.37756519632726,-0.5371967962713655,7
2022-10-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/565157-kherson-residents-urge-leave-shelling/,Residents urged to leave Russian city 'immediately',"All residents of Kherson should leave the city straight away and relocate to safe areas, the authorities of the new Russian region said in a statement on Saturday, citing a threat of “massive” Ukrainian shelling. “Civilians living in Kherson and all the civilian administration departments and ministries should move to the left bank of the Dnepr River today,” the statement published on Telegram reads. The authorities called on the people to move south of the city, deeper into the territory of the region and away from the frontlines located north of the city of Kherson. The administration also cited a “tense situation at the frontlines” and an “increased threat of massive shelling of the city,” as well as potential “terrorist attacks” as the reasons for the mandated “immediate” relocation. The city’s residents started leaving Kherson several days ago. On October 18, acting Kherson governor Vladimir Saldo warned that Ukraine was “amassing forces” for an alleged “large-scale offensive” in the region. At that time, he announced evacuation of civilians from certain communities on the right bank of the Dniepr River. Saldo also warned that some areas in the region, including in Kherson city, could be “flooded” if the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric dam on the Dniepr River is destroyed. On Friday, Russia called on the UN Security Council to prevent Ukraine from destroying the dam. The Ukrainian forces were firing over 100 missiles daily, targeting the hydroelectric power plant in particular, Moscow’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the UNSC briefing. “Thousands of civilians may be killed, and thousands of homes damaged,” if the dam is destroyed, he warned. Ukrainian forces have also been shelling the Dniepr River crossings amid the continued relocation. On Friday, one such attack killed four people and left 13 injured, according to local authorities. Kherson Region was officially declared part of Russia in early October, together with Zaporozhye Region and the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, after voters in those territories overwhelmingly supported the move in referendums. Kiev and the Western nations declared the votes a “sham” and continue to view the territories as part of Ukraine.",4.1015564213890014,2.7615589712664166,1.3399974501225849,9

Earlier in the day, Gladkov reported that eleven people had been injured in the shelling, four of them seriously wounded. According to Russia’s Investigative Committee, one of those killed was a minor. Later, Andrey Ikonnikov, the region’s health minister, clarified the report, saying that the attack had hit a total of 14 people. “Two of them, unfortunately, died before the arrival of an ambulance,” he noted, adding that the fatalities include an unnamed man and a 14-year-old. The governor said that the Ukrainian strikes also resulted in a blackout which affected almost 15,000 local residents, adding that it would take several hours to restore power supply. Gladkov also noted that unspecified “civilian facilities were damaged,” adding that all the victims are being cared for by medical services. After Russia started its military operation in Ukraine in late February, Kiev’s forces have repeatedly shelled and launched drones against civilian and military targets in Belgorod Region. On Friday, a Ukrainian strike destroyed a school, a kindergarten and several private houses in the area. On Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin imposed martial law in four former Ukrainian territories while introducing a “medium action level” in a number of parts of Western Russia, including Belgorod Region.

2022-10-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/565140-russia-un-kakhovskaya-dam-disaster/,Russia urges UN to prevent Ukraine’s ‘terrible provocation’,"Russia has formally asked the United Nations Security Council to prevent Ukraine from destroying the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric dam in Kherson Region. Such a disaster could result in the deaths of thousands of civilians, Moscow’s ambassador to the UN warned on Friday. Speaking at a Security Council briefing, Vassily Nebenzia noted that as the West chooses to ignore “any criminal acts” committed by Ukraine, the country has been “consistently conducting strikes on civilian infrastructure in its former territories”, including the town of Novaya Kakhovka in Kherson Region, which was recently incorporated into Russia. According to the envoy, most of the missiles are being launched from US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). “Ukrainian forces are aiming at the Kakhovskaya dam in order to break it, causing the water level to rise and the adjacent areas to flood,” the diplomat said. Should this happen, Nebenzia warned, “thousands of civilians may be killed, and thousands of homes damaged.” The envoy said Russia has distributed a letter to Security Council members, calling on the UN leadership to prevent “this terrible provocation."" The Ukrainian military frequently shells settlements and civilian infrastructure in the Kherson Region. Aside from the Kakhovskaya plant, Kiev has been targeting the Antonovsky Bridge and a pontoon crossing over the Dnepr River in the city of Kherson, in a bid to disrupt Russian logistics in the area. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin imposed martial law in Kherson Region, as well as three other former Ukrainian territories, amid reports that Kiev’s forces were preparing a large-scale offensive against the area's capital city. A day earlier, local authorities announced the relocation of civilians from the province. Kiev’s forces have also repeatedly targeted Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, which is located in the neighboring region, with Russian authorities warning that the attacks could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the Chernobyl incident.",3.0811962983177383,2.905297226003966,0.17589907231377255,9
2022-10-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/565142-putin-scholz-ukraine-threat/,Putin threat reports are false – Scholz,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to escalate the conflict in Ukraine. When asked about the issue during an interview with Die Welt newspaper on Saturday, Scholz said the media had been too loose in its interpretation of official reports from Berlin on its discussions with Moscow. “For good reasons, I don’t speak about the negotiations that I have with the Russian president. But here’s what I can say: The reports that I read about the alleged threats during these negotiations are false,” the chancellor said. The Russian and German leaders last talked on the phone in mid-September. According to Berlin, Scholz urged Putin to find a diplomatic solution for the conflict in Ukraine based on a ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Russian troops during their 90-minute conversation. He also “emphasized that any further Russian annexation steps would not go unanswered and would not be recognized under any circumstances.” According to the Kremlin, Putin told Scholz about the incessant shelling of cities in Donbass by Ukraine, which had led to civilian deaths and the destruction of infrastructure. The Russian leader called it a “gross violation of humanitarian law” by Kiev. A few weeks after that, referendums on joining Russia were held in Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, and in the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, with the territories being officially incorporated into the Russian state in early October. Earlier this week, Scholz told Deutschlandfunk outlet that the tone of his conversations with Putin “is always friendly, even if we have very different views on the matter.” “I think it’s important that we have this conversation,” the chancellor said, but added that one shouldn’t “harbor any illusions” about those contacts bringing swift results.",2.42608999932814,1.9712737851120572,0.45481621421608276,8
2022-10-22,https://www.rt.com/news/565041-heroic-hasbullah-how-russian-internet/,Heroic Hasbulla: How a Russian internet sensation landed a UFC contract and earned worldwide fame,"Dagestani social media star Hasbulla Magomedov has struck a five-year deal with the UFC. It was officially confirmed the other day by the organization’s boss, Dana White: “Yes, we did sign Hasbulla. What he’s going to end up doing remains to be seen.” He also teased on Twitter that Hasbulla would easily take on former two-weight world champion Conor McGregor: “He [Conor] shouldn’t f*ck around because he will get his ass whooped if he runs into him [Hasbulla] on the streets.” The statement was White’s reaction to Hasbulla’s recent altercation with McGregor, who tweeted earlier: “I would love to boot that little g*mp Hasbulla over a goal post. How much to get him on the volley?” Although Conor later deleted the tweet, Hasbulla had a chance to respond: “Hey uncle Dana White and UFC please make it happen. Let me eat this chicken Conor McGregor. I am hungry, I will smash him with my mountain spirit. My brother Khabib Nurmagomedov smashed him and all his team, now is my time to rise!” Magomedov has never lost a fight – though, to be fair, he hasn’t had any, yet. He is no ordinary UFC fighter: his weight (less than 20 kilograms/44 pounds) is about the third of the lightest UFC weight class, and his height is no more than 93 cm (3 ft). Although Magomedov is unlikely to fight in the octagon, his uniform and merchandise are already available on the UFC website. How was this small guy from Dagestan, who does not even speak English, able to reach stardom? Little is known about Hasbulla’s childhood years. His exact date of birth is unknown, but he is believed to be about 20 years old. Born in Dagestan, Hasbulla was affected by an unknown disorder that halted his physical development at the age of five. According to Hasbulla himself, he was shown to multiple doctors, but not one was able to make a clear diagnosis. Despite his childlike appearance, mentally he matches his actual age. Hasbulla always asks to be called by his full name, without diminutive suffixes. Hasbulla first gained popularity by posting a TikTok video of himself eating strawberries and commenting on it: Strawberries are the bomb, honestly! The video first went viral in Dagestan, then took the rest of Russia by storm. In the TikTok clips that followed, Magomedov kept eating things on camera and making funny remarks about the process. Strawberries were followed by other fruits and vegetables: watermelon, cucumber, and raspberries. Ever since his childhood, however, Magomedov’s real passion has been martial arts. There are several videos of him fighting with children – though much younger than Hasbulla, they were in his weight class. When his TikTok videos made it to the English-language part of the web, Hasbulla came to be known as ‘Mini Khabib’, in reference to Khabib Nurmagomedov, Dagestan’s most popular UFC fighter. Hasbulla feels this connection to Khabib is important to him: He has even called himself “the second eagle of Dagestan after Khabib Nurmagomedov” and stressed that he trains in the same gym as the former UFC champion. Hasbulla has no trainer and there are no videos of his professional bouts to assess his fighting skills. The popular Chechen MMA blogger Askhab Tamayev said in his video about Magomedov’s training that he saw the young man winning against “two other guys who were pretty good.” He didn’t show the recording, claiming “YouTube will probably block it.” Later in his blog, he mentioned a few times that he could not upload Hasbulla’s fights on the platform because of the man’s unconventional appearance, inviting his viewers to subscribe to his Instagram account instead. In one of Tamayev’s videos, Hasbulla declared he was ready to fight anyone in his weight class if the money was right. At the time, he was ready to fight for around $1,500. The Tajik singer Abdu Rozik accepted his challenge. Abdu Rozik is a year younger than Hasbulla and shares his disorder. His parents sent him to school when he was only 12 years old out of fear a car could hit him or grazing cattle attack him on his way to school. Organizing the fight between Hasbulla and Abdu Rozik was Askhab Tamayev, who had prior experience in organizing amateur MMA fights. By then, he’d already had a few video collaborations with Hasbulla, paying him around $300 for each. Initially, the prize was set at around $15,000, but after seeing the attention the event drew, each fighter was promised a fixed sum a few times larger than that. Hasbulla’s true fame came after his press conference with Abdu Rozik in May 2021. As of today, the video has around 17.5 million views, which is half a million more than the Connor–Khabib conference achieved over four years. The popularity of the video benefited all parties. For Hasbulla, he enjoyed more invitations to Tamayev’s blog, this time for around $8,000 per video. The rivalry of the pair made waves well beyond Russia’s borders, eventually reaching Dana White, the UFC President. At some point, he even proposed organizing the fight under the auspices of the UFC. Tamayev said the conference was taking place the day before the fight, but even though six months have passed since then, the fight still hasn’t happened. Hasbulla has repeatedly stated he is ready to fight at any time, but his opponent is chickening out. Abdu Rozik has been saying the same about Hasbulla, comparing him to Conor McGregor, who is famous for his trash talk. Another reason the eagerly-anticipated fight may have been called off might be Hasbulla’s falling out with Ashab. Little is known about the conflict for certain, although Tamaev has alluded to the corrupting influence of money and fame on Magomedov. Prior to his press conference with Abdu Rozik, Hasbulla had agreed to fight him for 100,000 rubles ($1,620). He later hiked that sum to 20 million (about $325,000). Hasbulla openly admitted he was only going to fight Abdu Rozik for money. As his popularity grew, so did his financial appetite. Still, in spite of his apparent success, Hasbulla’s parents disapprove of his choices and say Muslims shouldn’t fight each other, with or without getting paid. Ashab Tamaev’s YouTube channel launched Hasbulla’s personal brand, turning him from a little-known TikTok personality into a Russia-wide phenomenon. The rest was Magomedov’s own work. Even though the fight fell through, it generated a lot of hype. Hasbulla’s clash with Abdu Rozik was covered by major media outlets, with journalists and experts debating, among other things, the ethical aspects of the situation. Ulyana Podpalnaya, the head of the Russian Dwarf Athletic Association, denounced the fight, calling it a “show meant for laughter,” evidently alluding to the historical practice of using dwarves and other smaller people as jesters in the courts of aristocrats. “This is not even an exhibition fight. They are paid a lot of money to do a show, so that people can have a laugh. There is nothing serious about this, this is not a sport. I’d say it’s unethical, it’s wrong. An event like that does not attract attention to dwarf athletics,” she said. Hasbulla was not the first blogger with a growth hormone deficiency. Abdu Rozik created his Instagram account about six months earlier. Their standoff has contributed to the visibility of other people with similar conditions. Erali, an Uzbek blogger, has challenged both Hasbulla and Abdu Rozik, saying he can take them on. In his recorded address, he said he wanted to “raise Uzbekistan’s standing” and give both his opponents “an Uzbek chapalak” [slap on the face]. He did get to meet Hasbulla and Abdu Rozik and had a mock fight with the latter wearing full-sized boxing gloves. His fight with Hasbulla, however, was genuine and was quickly broken up. Since the amount of Instagram followers he has is only a fraction of those of Hasbulla and Abdu Rozik, Erali has failed to catch up to his older colleagues so far. Moreover, the Uzbek blogger has complained about his compatriots siding with his Dagestani opponent. “I need your support, and you’re telling me Hasbik will beat me up and win. Such words make my blood boil. I promise you I will defeat him!” he said. Hasbulla’s popularity climbed along with the NFT market. The OpenSea platform has generated the Crypto Hasbulla collection – a set of the blogger’s images in which he is pictured as various celebrities and fictional characters. Each portrait is hand drawn, and there is a limited number of them – 10,000 pieces. Hasbulla has been promoting his tokens, selling the equivalent of $2 million as of April 2022. His customers have formed a community, and members get a chance to meet the blogger during his travels around the world. In September, he toured Australia, and his plan for 2023 is to visit the US, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, the UK, Europe and other countries. The creators of Crypto Hasbulla have said this is the first time a celebrity has built an offline community through blockchain and NFT technology. Hasbulla is a devout Muslim. He studies the Koran and regularly conducts a Mecca pilgrimage. But his religious background doesn’t get in the way of his cultural connection with his fans in the West. He is active in his social media accounts and open to working with bloggers from different countries. Hasbulla’s childlike face has charmed many. He doesn’t look threatening to a Western audience, unlike Khabib, for example. Nevertheless, Hasbulla has often been criticized for his discriminating views. In December 2021, he threatened the girl who posted a picture of his twin sister, and demanded an apology from her. When responding to TikTok bloggers in his stories, he defended domestic abuse, saying that “women are dangerous” and physical violence is justified. Magomedov’s account was blocked the next day. Then owners of the clinic where the blogger’s sister was filmed posted their apology. Despite his non-threatening appearance, Hasbulla looked quite scary when he told his haters that they should expect a visit from some “brothers” – his fighter friends. Hasbulla knows Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya – he was the one who settled the conflict between Tamayev and Hasbulla, siding with Magomedov. Hasbulla has been able to scale his popularity. When asked about future plans in a recent interview, he said he wanted to start his own business and help the needy from the profits. Hasbulla also claimed he wanted to head Dagestan’s police someday and run his “motorcade all over the place.” According to Magomedov, after he gets the job, he will “raise hell in the city” and organize a parade for his haters. He would also lower the speed limit for residential areas and increase it on highways, let people drive without license plates, and remove all traffic cameras along with the “rats who take pictures of violations and send them to cops.” Hasbulla’s plans may seem funny, but as Khabib Nurmagomedov has shown, a public figure can easily enter the political scene if they’re backed by social capital. Khabib has made many statements throughout his career on Dagestan’s social problems and put his status to good use by getting involved in the life of the region, especially its cultural aspects. He voiced his support of the hate campaign targeting the Black Star record label performers, whose songs, according to the mixed martial artist, go against the teachings of Islam. Nurmagomedov said that “every scumbag will answer for their words,” because the men of Dagestan are responsible for the ethical purity of the region and won’t tolerate some “conceited fags with dubious ambitions.” The MMA champion also urged the Dagestani government to check the ‘Hunting For Men’ play for compliance with the law, as he strongly feels it is offensive to the people of Dagestan. Following his public remarks on the subject, the actors performing in the play received threats and were forced to apologize. Just like Khabib, Hasbulla has used his social media stories to address the people of Dagestan on many occasions. On New Year’s Eve, he posted a photograph of a crowded square in Dagestan with the caption, “Come to the mosque at least like that. Crazy imam.” He also posted a photo of a flock of sheep on a pasture, alluding to a similarity between the animals and the festive crowd. Hasbulla has recently started giving interviews to English-language outlets. But since his English skills are almost nonexistent, he usually asks his ‘brothers’ to interpret for him. And even with their help, the language barrier prevents him from giving anything other than one-word answers to even the most basic questions. Hasbulla is very cautious in his political comments. But, unlike his older friend Khabib, he did offer his opinion on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. On the day that the special military operation kicked off, he posted a photo of himself on a tank in his Instagram stories, accompanied by a caption apparently addressed to Ukrainians – “Take care, I’m coming for you.” Putin, what a lion you are,” he added. When asked about his own peace-keeping potential, he usually says, “I wish for all this to end and for us to live in peace and friendship, but we have other people dealing with this, let them sort it all out.”",3.710416177724504,3.5641683422773704,0.1462478354471335,1

Completely normal practice. He himself likes to try some new models and they repeatedly present themselves to him,” he told Russian journalists on Friday. On Thursday, Putin journeyed to training grounds in the western Ryazan Region to witness the preparation of mobilized troops first hand along with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu. They were shown standard equipment issued to the draftees, including uniforms, helmets, and body armor, as well as the army-issued autumn and winter boots. Putin also met some of the conscripts and visited a shooting range at the training grounds, where he took a few shots with a Dragunov (SVD) sniper rifle. In late September, Putin ordered partial mobilization in Russia in order to bolster the ongoing military operation in Ukraine that began on February 24. Moscow is seeking to draft 300,000 people.

2022-10-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/565118-ukrainian-official-russian-language-eradication/,Russian should become extinct in Ukraine – security chief,"The Russian language should be eradicated in Ukraine as it is allegedly being used as a tool by Moscow to wield influence on Ukrainians, one of the country’s key security officials has claimed. The Russian language is nothing but an “element of enemy propaganda and brainwashing of our people,” Alexey Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said on the ‘Big Lviv Talks’ show on Friday. The official also spoke in favor of Ukrainians learning English instead. According to Danilov, the very idea that Ukrainians have to understand the Russian tongue is a “dangerous narrative.” “Look, we don’t want anything from them [Russians]. Why don’t they leave us alone? Let them go to their swamps and croak in the Russian language,” he stated. The senior official went on to criticize pundits and experts who speak Russian while appearing on Ukrainian TV. According to the 2001 census, approximately 14.3 million Ukrainians (29% of the population) speak Russian as their first language. Some other estimates put that number even higher. The language is particularly widespread in the eastern and southern regions of the country. Ever since the Maidan coup back in 2014, Moscow has been consistently accusing the Ukrainian government of systematically discriminating against Russian-speakers. The perceived violations of the linguistic minority’s rights were also cited by the secessionist movements in the Donetsk and Lugansk Regions, parts of which went on to become the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, respectively. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently cautioned his country against taking cues from those who engage in ‘cancel culture’. Speaking at a media conference in Astana, Kazakhstan, he noted that around three million Ukrainians permanently reside in Russia. “How can we prohibit their language and culture? We don’t have anything of the kind on our minds,” Putin added. Commenting on reports about a man who had been fined in Moscow for listening to Ukrainian music in his car, the president said that attempts to ban the Ukrainian language in Russia were “illegal in themselves.”",3.3812829976318914,2.76513825546541,0.6161447421664814,3
2022-10-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/565110-lukashenko-belarus-wont-attack-anyone/,Belarus doesn't want war – Lukashenko,"There won’t be a war involving Belarus unless other nations want to fight against it, the country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, told journalists on Friday. The remarks came amid allegations that Belarusian troops could join Russia in its military campaign in Ukraine. “Don’t pay attention to this howling,” the country’s state media outlet Belta quoted Lukashenko as saying during a visit to a military training ground in Belarus’ westernmost Brest region. “We’re not going to go anywhere today. No war at present. We don’t need it,” he added. He also urged his compatriots to “calm down” and carry on with their usual activities “unless we want war.” The Belarusian head of state also played down the likelihood of World War III breaking out in the near future, as such a conflict would most likely mean the “annihilation of all and everyone.” However, he also warned that the world had come “closer than ever before.” Last Friday, Lukashenko announced the deployment of a joint Russian-Belarusian contingent in the country. He cited “heightened tensions” on the country’s borders as the reason for the move, adding that his troops would comprise the core of the group. On Monday, Valery Revenko, an aide to the Belarusian defense minister, revealed on Twitter that several thousand Russian military personnel along with 170 tanks, up to 200 armored vehicles, and up to 100 artillery guns would be deployed to the country. The official explained that the creation of the allied force had come in response to the “deployment of NATO forces near [their] borders amid a lack of dialogue.” Earlier this month, the country’s government accused Kiev of planning and preparing an attack which would entail the “seizure of certain areas of the Belarusian territory.” Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky vehemently rejected Minsk’s claims, alleging that it was in fact Belarus that might attack Ukraine. Zelensky also called on the G7 countries to send “international observers” to the border between the two nations to prevent any provocation.",2.4383374714892474,2.526512013998712,-0.08817454250946444,8
2022-10-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/565113-ukraine-air-defense-missiles/,Ukraine running out of anti-aircraft missiles – WaPo,"Ukraine’s anti-aircraft defenses have been strained by the increase in cruise missile and kamikaze-drone attacks by Russia, according to a Washington Post report published Friday. The country is now reportedly at risk of running out of surface-to-air missiles completely. Older anti-aircraft systems, inherited by the county after the collapse of the Soviet Union, remain the backbone of its aerial defenses. The decades-old systems are very effective against the incoming Russian projectiles, Vladimir Klimin, deputy commander of a battalion working with S-300 surface-to-air missile systems in the Kiev region, told the newspaper. While he claimed that his unit had never missed a target during the conflict, he admitted that Ukraine simply does not have enough anti-aircraft systems to cover the entirety of its vast territory. “There are some Russians who are not stupid and know how to think,” Klimin stated. “And so they’re trying to get around our air defense systems by using the landscape or intelligence about where we’re located. They’re trying to beat us, too. But if the system sees the target and locks in on it, then it will shoot it down.” Now, however, Kiev is at risk of running out of munitions even for the systems it has in its inventory. Denis Smazhny, responsible for training Ukraine’s antiaircraft missile forces, and currently abroad learning how to operate the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), warned of the shortfall. “We need to replace our old systems because they will simply not be able to cope with these threats soon,” Smazhny told the newspaper. “And we are running out of missiles.” Moscow has ramped up its aerial bombing campaign against Ukraine, targeting its critical infrastructure with cruise missiles and drones. The strikes came in the aftermath of the Crimean Bridge bombing, squarely blamed by Russia on Ukraine and branded a “terrorist act.” While top Ukrainian officials initially cheered the blast, that heavily damaged the road traffic part of the transport artery, Kiev has ultimately denied any involvement. The ramp-up in aerial bombings garnered widespread condemnation in the West, with several countries promising to deliver the sophisticated anti-aircraft defenses long-sought by Kiev. The US has pledged to send in short- to medium-range NASAMS, while the UK promised to supply Ukraine with dozens of Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM). Germany green-lighted delivery of its cutting-edge IRIS-T systems, with the first unit having already arrived in the country last week and three more expected to be delivered next year.",2.1252751539693833,2.3650459877997556,-0.23977083383037234,0

The attack was deliberately aimed at civilian infrastructure, the official added. Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on his Telegram channel: “thank God, there are no victims or wounded,” explaining that residents of the targeted area had been evacuated the day before. Gladkov said local authorities continue to go from house to house in the village, trying to convince people to leave for their own safety. Later in the day, the governor gave details of another attack on an industrial complex in the same district, directly hit by a Ukrainian shell, causing a major fire. According to preliminary data, at least one woman was injured in the incident. “The medical team is already taking her to the hospital. All emergency services are on site. More details will come later,” he wrote. The day before, Gladkov claimed that a nine-year-old boy had lost his hands after finding something resembling a Ukrainian drone lying on the street. The device, which had allegedly been used by Kiev’s forces to attack the region, detonated in the boy’s hands, the official claimed. Belgorod Region has come under regular shelling and drone attacks from Ukrainian forces since Russia launched its military campaign against Kiev in late February. Last week, an electrical substation in the city was hit, leading to blackouts in some districts. An oil depot, a border checkpoint, a customs office and an ammo depot were also struck. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a “medium action level” in several parts of Russia, including Belgorod and Crimea, giving local authorities emergency powers to ensure security and react rapidly to any emergencies.",2.7694175028738535,3.1978353743712975,-0.42841787149744404,0

Moscow’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, said on Wednesday that Russia may have to “reassess [its] cooperation” with the United Nations Secretariat if it decides to take part in such investigations. His warning came in response to accusations that Iran has been supplying Moscow with UAVs in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which implements the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Polyansky insisted that the controversy around the UAVs had nothing to do with the nuclear deal and stressed that the UN Secretariat did not even have the authority to investigate anything related to UNSC Resolution 2231. “We hope that the secretariat and the secretary general will not violate the decisions of the UN Security Council and will not go beyond their technical mandate and refrain from participating in any illegal investigation,” Polyansky told reporters following a closed-door Security Council meeting. “Otherwise, we will have to re-evaluate our cooperation with them, which is not in anyone’s interests,” he added, noting that Russia would prefer not to do this, but could be left with no other choice. The US, Britain, EU, and Ukraine claim that they have evidence that Tehran has delivered a significant number of Shahed-136 drones to Russia, with Kiev putting the number at some 2,300 units. Both Russia and Iran, however, have repeatedly denied these accusations. Moscow insists that all the weapons it is using in Ukraine originate from its own stockpiles and that the drones used to carry out the recent attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure were Russian-made Geran-2 (Geranium-2) UAVs. Tehran, meanwhile, has rejected the West’s accusations as “unfounded and unsubstantiated claims,” stating that it supports a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev.",1.986966793744346,2.4246999818893817,-0.4377331881450357,8

The four-minute clip, which was uploaded on the Facebook page of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Friday, started with the reminder about the longstanding “friendship and good neighborly relations” between Kiev and Minsk. However, it concluded with a warning of retaliation in the event of Belarus taking part in the military operation that Russia has been carrying out in Ukraine. According to the video, the Belarusian authorities had been preparing to do just that, and had already started “secretly” recruiting troops for the mission. “If the army of Belarus supports the Russian aggression – we will respond as harshly as we respond to all occupants on the territory of Ukraine, with the use of our whole arsenal of weapons,” the Ukrainian military warned. This retaliation will include “striking military facilities on the territory of your country,” it added, addressing the Belarusian people. The video-message, which was recorded in Russian, urged “all of the citizens of Belarus not to follow the orders of your leadership about joining the war against Ukraine.” On Thursday, the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ General Staff claimed that “the threat of the Russian Armed Forces resuming their offensive on the northern front has been growing.” Russia already advanced on the Ukrainian capital Kiev from Belarusian territory in late February, when the conflict had just started. However, this time the focus of the Russian offensive could be switched towards the western part of the Ukraine-Belarus border in an attempt to cut delivery routes of foreign weapons to the government of Vladimir Zelensky, the General Staff suggested. Russian troops began arriving in Belarus last week in order to become part of the joint defense force recently announced by Moscow and Minsk. The Belarusian authorities said that they’ve agreed to host more Russian soldiers on their territory due to increased aggression from Kiev and Western nations. It is planned that Russia will deploy 9,000 troops, some 170 tanks and up to 100 artillery pieces to Belarus, Valery Revenko, an aide to the Belarusian defense minister, announced on Monday.

Two relatives of the journalists were killed, another one is in a critical condition,” Aleksandr Malkevich told the broadcaster Rossiya 24. Earlier, the deputy head of the Kherson Region administration, Kirill Stremousov, said the strike had killed four civilians. A further 13 were wounded, according to the local health service. Stremousov claimed that the Ukrainian military targeted “the journalists deliberately, to eliminate those who are covering the situation in Kherson Region.” Multiple journalists with the local Tavria broadcaster were caught in the strike, including the channel’s director, Oleg Klokov, who was killed, according to Stremousov. Other reporters working with the channel, Konstantin Mochar and Vlada Lugovskaya, as well as Tavria cameraman Ruslan Voskresensky, suffered injuries.

Ukrainian “nationalists” have targeted relocating civilians with HIMARS “cluster munitions” to try and inflict heavier casualties on them, the Committee said in a statement, condemning the “blatant cynicism of the Kiev regime.” According to local emergency services, the attack was carried out with the use of US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers. The Ukrainian troops fired at least 12 missiles at the river crossing near the Antonovsky Bridge, which had been damaged in previous repeated strikes, with 11 of the munitions intercepted by anti-aircraft defenses.

According to the short readout, the two top officials “discussed issues of international security, including the situation in Ukraine” over the phone. The last phone call between Shoigu and Austin was reported in May, with both sides giving away few details about it. It was the first direct conversation between the officials since Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February. Sources cited by Reuters revealed at the time that the call lasted for about an hour and failed to solve any specific matter. The exchange was initiated by Washington, Russian media reported. The Pentagon confirmed the contact with the Russian defense minister on Friday, stating that its chief had “emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication” amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Bilateral contacts between Russian and American officials have been on the decline for years and have become very rare since the Ukraine crisis, according to both governments. Washington claims that Moscow’s military campaign was unprovoked and has pledged to help Kiev “for as long as it takes” to defeat the Russian troops. The administration of US President Joe Biden has declared Russia’s strategic defeat as a foreign policy goal. Russia accused the US of escalating tensions over Ukraine to a point at which it had no option but military action. According to Moscow, NATO was conducting a clandestine expansion into Ukraine, compromising Russian national security, and repeatedly refused to address Moscow’s concerns. The US has imposed numerous economic sanctions on Russia. It also has been arming and funding the Ukrainian government.

The now-deleted meme, reading “Better call Boris,” quickly drew flak, however, with some Britons even crying “meddling.” The former premier has been named by the pollster YouGov as one of the favorites in the race for 10 Downing Street after his successor, Liz Truss resigned on Thursday. The post featured the main character of AMC’s TV drama Better Call Saul holding a cut-out of Johnson with an inscription “Better Call Boris” next to it. Appearing on the Ukrainian government’s official account on Thursday, the message quickly attracted international attention, and a fair share of criticism, before being deleted the same day. Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at the University of Essex, tweeted: “Have you considered not commenting on other countries’ political processes – with a view to not alienating your broad base of support, and because you simply don’t understand what’s going on there?” Another social media user wrote: “Very inappropriate to meddle in a country’s internal affairs in this way.” “Better call Boris what?! This tweet has to be a bad joke and not sure what intention of it is,” one more netizen chimed in. Others pointed out Ukrainian officials’ odd choice of the character to base their meme on, as the protagonist Saul Goodman is portrayed in the series as an unethical attorney. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was “rather surprised” by the tweet, adding, however, that this will not affect his party’s unwavering support of Ukraine in the face of Russia’s military offensive. Boris Johnson, who was forced to step down in early September following a series of scandals, had developed a close rapport with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky during his time in office. He was one of the most vocal supporters of Kiev. Johnson’s successor, Liz Truss, survived only six weeks in power, and had to resign on Thursday amid mounting pressure from fellow Conservatives.

The official referred to remarks made by President Vladimir Putin last week, in which he said that the enrolment of military reservists would be completed in “approximately” two weeks. Peskov declined to offer any further information, stating: “There is no timeline that would be more accurate.” “Some regions have already completed the process at their level, in some regions partial mobilization continues,” he said. Putin ordered the partial mobilization of troops in Russia on September 21. The Defense Ministry said at the time that it planned to boost the strength of the standing army by some 300,000 people. On October 4, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu reported surpassing the 200,000 benchmark in the enrolment process. The Russian president announced an end to the mobilization within weeks during a press conference in Astana, Kazakhstan last Friday. Peskov also commented on claims that some of the mobilized personnel had been sent to the frontline without proper training and some had lost their lives. “We don’t have any details, but we have all seen those reports.

According to the Telegram channel Mash, the trainer was among those recruited as part of the partial mobilization announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin last month. Romanov reportedly underwent a week-long training course before being deployed at the Zaporozhye nuclear power station, which has repeatedly been targeted by Ukrainian shelling and drone strikes over the past few months. Kiev also tried sending sabotage teams to gain control of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, but those attacks have been repelled. The 47-year-old coach was injured after his unit came under Ukrainian fire with the use of US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, Mash claimed. No further details as to the exact location have been revealed. Romanov has been hospitalized with shrapnel wounds to his back and other body parts, but his life is currently not in danger, the head of his sports club, based in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, told the RBK media outlet. Galstyan has also confirmed that his coach was injured by Ukrainian forces. “The main thing is that he’s alive. He’s now undergoing treatment at the hospital. Yes, he was taking part in the military operation and suffered shrapnel wounds,” the Olympic champion told the Russian channel MatchTV.

The attack came while civilians were being moved from the right bank of the Dnepr River, following an order issued earlier this week. Kherson Region Governor Vladimir Saldo said the relocation order was in response to an increase in Ukrainian strikes on the city and concerns that the area could be flooded if Kiev’s troops destroy the dam at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station. “I know of four people being killed. One woman and three men,” the deputy head of the local administration, Kirill Stremousov, said during an appearance on the Soloviev Live program on Friday. Ukraine targeted a crossing, which has been only used by civilians, using fragmenting shells to increase the number of casualties, he added.

Earlier this year, the Western-backed activist was found guilty of donation embezzlement and contempt of court, and was sentenced to nine years behind bars plus a hefty fine. On Thursday, Navalny's team posted a message on his Instagram account, which claimed he had “received an official notification” that a new criminal probe had been launched into his alleged illegal activities while in custody. These include the “promotion of terrorism” and extremism, funding of extremist activities as well as the “exoneration of Nazism.” The opposition activist pointed out that he has been incarcerated ever since he returned to Russia from Germany in January 2021, after being treated there for an alleged poisoning. “Few criminals have pulled off as much while at large as I have while behind bars,” Navalny quipped ironically. According to the politician, he is suspected of leading a criminal group represented by his close associates, who have all fled Russia. Navalny claimed that some of the charges brought against him stem from remarks made by his associate Leonid Volkov in videos posted on the ‘Popular politics’ YouTube channel. “The lawyers estimated that, considering the prison terms envisaged under these paragraphs, [I could get] some 30 years [behind bars],” Navalny concluded. Upon his return to Russia, the Kremlin critic was immediately placed in custody, with the authorities replacing his suspended sentence with a real one. Navalny had previously been found guilty of defrauding the Russian subsidiary of the French cosmetics manufacturer Yves Rocher out of millions of rubles. The public figure, along with his brother who was a co-defendant, dismissed the case as fabricated and politically motivated. A new court case, launched soon after Navalny’s return, revolved around an episode in which he had supposedly slandered a WWII veteran, as well as contempt of court and, most crucially, around a scheme whereby the activist had allegedly appropriated for personal use donations he had received from his supporters for his presidential campaign. Navalny was found guilty on all counts, and has dismissed the convictions and even the accusations as absurd. The Kremlin critic has been repeatedly placed in solitary confinement in recent months over his continued political activism, he claims. The prison administration, in turn, accuses him of systematically violating order inside the penitentiary facility. Back in June 2021, a court in Moscow declared Navalny’s political movement an extremist organization and banned its activities in Russia.",2.8774964921664536,3.7958466837912335,-0.9183501916247798,5

Asked to comment on the “spectacular attack” on the bridge, as the broadcaster put it, Zelensky said Kiev was not involved. “We definitely did not order that, as far as I know,” he told the reporters. The bridge was hit by a massive explosion on October 8, which severely damaged its road traffic section and killed three civilians, as well as setting a passing freight train on fire. Several top Ukrainian officials openly celebrated the attack, while the country’s postal service issued a stamp commemorating the blast, just hours after it happened. Moscow has directly blamed Kiev for the incident, branding the explosion a “terrorist attack.” Russian law enforcement claims to have established how the bomb, which was disguised as construction materials, made it to the bridge from the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, via multiple transit countries. Russian investigators believe the plot was hatched by Ukrainian military intelligence. Moscow has identified 12 individuals as suspected accomplices in the plot and has arrested eight of them, the FSB said. The list of people in custody includes five Russians and three foreign nationals, who hold passports of Ukraine and Armenia. A spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence told the media that the FSB was a “fake structure,” and that the report was unworthy of comment.

The move comes after Zelensky signed another decree earlier this month, approving a decision by the NSDC to declare it “impossible” to hold any negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

2022-10-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/565028-uk-spy-plane-missile/,UK claims Russia fired missile near its spy plane,"A Russian Su-27 fighter jet fired a missile near a British Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance plane over international waters in the Black Sea, Defense Minister Ben Wallace told the UK's Parliament on Thursday. According to Wallace, the incident was accidental and Moscow blamed it on a technical malfunction. He added that London had accepted this explanation. The run-in between the spy plane and the fighter jet occurred on September 29. Following the incident, London temporarily suspended patrols and expressed concerns to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, Wallace noted. “A reply by the Russian Minister of Defense on the 10th of October, stated that they have conducted an investigation into the circumstances of the incident and stated it was a technical malfunction of the Su-27 fighter,” he revealed, adding that Moscow “acknowledged that the incident took place in international airspace.” British spy planes are now flying with fighter jet escorts to provide them with better security, the minister noted. So far, Russia has remained silent on the alleged run-in and has not produced any public statements on the incident. In 2021, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, the number of reconnaissance flights staged by NATO in the Black Sea Region increased by more than 60% compared to 2020. The latest encounter involving British aircraft took place last August when a MiG-31BM interceptor chased an RC-135 surveillance plane from Russian airspace over the Barents Sea near the city of Murmansk.",3.108490058311897,4.209792708761976,-1.1013026504500796,0
2022-10-20,https://www.rt.com/news/565046-neanderthals-russia-genes-family/,Neanderthals found in Russia were family – study,"A study of fossilized remains of Neanderthals found in two locations in Russia has confirmed that around 54,000 years ago they lived as large family units. Two individuals were revealed to be a father and his teenage daughter, while two others were second-degree relatives. The research was detailed in a paper published in the journal Nature on Wednesday by an international group of scientists. They said it was the first time that familial relations between Neanderthals had been documented. The team sequenced DNA from remains found in two locations in Russia’s Altai region. The fossils were discovered during excavations in the mid-1980s in Okladnikov Cave and after 2007 in Chagyrskaya Cave respectively. The latter site has produced over 80 Neanderthal fossils so far, the largest collection of its kind in the world. Researchers extracted genetic material from the teeth and bones of what they later discovered to be the remains of 13 individuals: 11 from Chagyrskaya Cave and two from Okladnikov. The scientist were interested in the makeup of mitochondrial DNA – the type of genes that are found in cellular structures called mitochondria rather than their nuclei and are passed down the maternal line – as well as the Y-chromosomes that sons inherit from their fathers. Not just the two pairs of close relatives were linked genetically. The remains from Chagyrskaya Cave also shared DNA variants that usually change in just a few generations, confirming that they lived at about the same time. The evidence indicates that the Neanderthals were living in family groups of up to 20 people, based on the low genetic diversity. It was far lower than in modern humans and more consistent with endangered humanoid species, such as present-day mountain gorillas. But they were not fully isolated, judging by the relatively high level of mitochondrial genetic diversity. It suggests that female migration was the primary link between separate Neanderthal communities, the paper concluded.",5.410466543334606,2.961436408974436,2.44903013436017,6
2022-10-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/565029-ukraine-aid-us-mccarthy/,Top Ukrainian official ‘shocked’ by US aid comments,"A claim by House minority leader Kevin McCarthy that Republicans could curb US support for Ukraine if they win the midterm elections on November 8 has caught Kiev by surprise, David Arakhamia, who heads President Vladimir Zelensky’s party in parliament, has revealed. Earlier this week, McCarthy said that while still being “important,” helping Ukraine in its conflict against Russia couldn’t remain the dominating issue on the agenda in Washington anymore. “I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just won’t do it,” he told Punchbowl News. According to a report by Axios on Wednesday, such a sentiment is shared by many other GOP lawmakers. “We were shocked to hear these comments of Mr McCarthy, honestly,” Arakhamia said in an interview with the Financial Times on Wednesday. According to Arakhamia, the congressman’s comments contradicted what was said during their face-to-face meeting, which took place in Washington in June. “Just a few weeks ago, our delegation visited the US and had a meeting with Mr McCarthy. We were assured that bipartisan support of Ukraine in its war with Russia will remain a top priority even if they win in the elections,” the Kiev official insisted. Arakhamia’s words also appeared to contradict a report by Politico on Wednesday, which cited unnamed White House aides, claiming the Ukrainian government understood that things could change if the Republicans take control of at least one chamber of Congress after the midterms. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko told the Financial Times that the country was still counting on “continued bipartisan support” from the US. When asked about McCarthy's remarks, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre gave assurances that the Biden administration would “continue to work with Congress, as we have these past several months, on these efforts and support Ukraine as long as it takes.” The US has been Ukraine’s strongest backer since the outbreak of its conflict with Russia in late February, providing Kiev with weapons, funds and intelligence. Washington has already supplied $16.8 billion in military aid to Zelensky’s government, including sophisticated hardware such as HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, M777 howitzers, and combat drones. Moscow has criticized those deliveries, saying they only prolong the fighting and increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.",2.8974476688178585,2.206344188499348,0.6911034803185103,8
2022-10-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/565024-medvedev-truss-nobel-prize/,Russian ex-president dunks on ‘frantic’ Truss,"Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has joined the chorus of critics of British Prime Minister Liz Truss and the effect that her proposed policies have already had on the state of the country’s economy. The “frantic” prime minister “deserves the Nobel Prize in economics for the fastest-ever ruining of national finances,” the Russian official joked on social media on Thursday. The remark came as part of a commentary on what Medvedev sees as the poor qualifications of modern European leaders for governance. The Truss government came under fire after a proposed radical neoliberal policy change penned by former chancellor of the exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng sent the British financial market into disarray, causing a sharp devaluation of the national currency. Kwarteng was fired and replaced last Friday by Jeremy Hunt, who made a U-turn on the idea of reducing taxes to kickstart the economy, while also ramping up government spending to alleviate the impact of the global energy crisis. As her approval ratings plunged, some Tory MPs urged Truss to resign. She refused to do so, telling the BBC this week that she would “stick around.” “We simply cannot afford to spend our time talking about the Conservative Party, rather than what we need to deliver,” she explained. The disarray in the Truss cabinet was escalated further by the resignation of Home Secretary Suella Braverman on Wednesday, and a reported clash between the prime minister and Chief Whip Wendy Morton and her deputy Craig Whittaker. A senior Conservative MP was quoted by The Telegraph musing that Truss had “hours, not days” left. If forced to leave office, she would become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, breaking the record of George Canning. His sole term in office in 1827 lasted just 119 days and was cut short by his death. Truss took the helm of the British government on September 6.",2.3425243743419712,2.671236392984066,-0.32871201864209487,5
2022-10-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/564966-russia-opens-cultural-front/,Rhymes from the frontlines: How the Ukraine conflict has inspired a new wave of patriotic poetry in Russia,"While the international media focuses on the battlefield, Russia’s military operation in Ukraine is having a broader effect domestically. Another ""front"" has opened in the cultural sphere, and this will have long term consequences. Poets, artists, and singers from all walks of life have embraced the realities of the conflict. An interesting factor has been how artistic techniques that the ‘liberal intellectuals’ once viewed as their own are now being adopted by patriotic voices: from high literary genres to satire and short poignant poems. We are witnessing a return of World War II agitprop-style verses and a resurgence of long narrative poems and epics to Russian poetry tradition. And it’s not just Russians who are charging to the cultural frontline, but Ukrainians, too – both those who reject Moscow and also others who support Russia and are willing to speak up in defense of their convictions. Historically, the Russian poetic tradition provided a rich commentary on war. Alexander Pushkin, a contemporary of Napoleon and a witness to his aggression against the country, sang the praises of rifles and bayonets and celebrated the military genius of Russia’s general staff. Writer and poet Mikhail Lermontov, who served as lieutenant in the Imperial Russian Armed Forces, wrote about the glorious battles of the past and his own experiences in combat. Sergei Yesenin, Nikolai Gumilyov and futurist Velimir Khlebnikov all fought in World War I, later turning the dirt and dust of trench warfare into brilliant verses and poems. Throughout World War II, poetry served as a means of sustaining morale. A single poem could lift the spirits more than all the propaganda posters and leaflets combined. In fact, one frontline soldier said he believed that Konstantin Simonov’s composition “Kill Him!” was worthy of the Hero of the Soviet Union medal, for it alone had taken out more Nazis than the world’s deadliest sniper. Gradually, the galvanizing power of early Soviet poetry started to wane – until, at some point, creative writing became one of the major tools of dissidents and protesters. This transition is often associated with the rise of ‘Russian rock.’ Its lyrics are much more noteworthy than its music – in many cases, they were written by professional poets and mostly reflected protest sentiment. The band Kino captured hearts and minds with its hit song ‘We want change! and the rock band Nautilus Pompilius mocked the idea of being ‘Chained by one chain’ in its own critique of the Soviet system. This new song tradition, along with its rebellious nature, carried over from the Soviet Union to the Russian Federation. Spoiled by high art, people soaked in postmodern literature and music inspired by Western culture. Examples of this can be found in the poems of self-exiled writer Viktor Shenderovich or the Citizen Poet project that mocked domestic life and politics from an opposition activist’s point of view. The same is true of the music, although ‘Russian rock’ ended up replaced by ‘Russian rap.’ In many ways, it occupied the same niche of critique and satire, and was characterized by a strong liberal bias. This state of affairs remained relatively unchanged for over 30 years – until the fighting broke out, this spring. I kissed his cold dead lips,I put a ring on his stiff finger.I thought, I won’t be long, my dear,And the war in the meantime continued. These lines are from a recently published poem called ‘Call Sign: Paganel’ by Anna Dolgaryova who dedicated it to her fiance, an artillery captain who died in combat in the Lugansk People’s Republic in 2015. Anna spent many years living in Ukraine. She worked in Kiev, but Euromaidan pushed her out: first, she left the capital for Donbass, then moved to Russia. There, her writing got noticed. Many of Anna’s poems are about the events of 2014 in Donbass known as the “Russian Spring,” and many of them are poems of choice at festivals both in Russia and former Ukrainian territories liberated by Russia. As a poet, Dolgaryova explores both how a conflict affects love and relationships and the daily life of people in war zones, in particular the people of Donbass: A war has come to the city.Bombs fall on the city.A water pipe burst in the city,and the water spills, a long muddy stream,mixing with human blood as it flows. She also dedicates many of her poems to Russian soldiers and officers: I see them crossing the Smorodina River,The Donets River, the River Styx,Fighting for my bygone Soviet homeland,For freedom for you and me. To a certain extent Anna’s writing is a revision of feminist poetry with a heavy emphasis on the themes of war and patriotism. Russia has seen quite a number of new authors of fiction and poetry working in this genre, although most of them are believed by critics to rely heavily on the Western literary tradition. What makes Dolgaryova’s writing stand out is how seamlessly she manages to conflate feminist poetry and a genre that has traditionally been on the opposite side of the spectrum, i.e., war poetry. Another poet writing about the military operation is Igor Karaulov. Unlike many others, he has been an acclaimed writer for quite a while and belongs to a different generation (Karaulov was born in 1966). Many of his works have received favorable reviews from liberal critics and literary celebrities. Until February 24, 2022, Karaulov produced mainly post-modernist poetry rich in metaphors and abstract symbolism; however, after the launch of the military offensive he started to use his art to express his civic position on the ongoing events both at home and abroad. For example, he wrote a poignant epigram about the US House Speaker’s visit to Taiwan: The world derailed as Pelosi deplaned.There’s no leaving Taiwan in any manner.Pray for our sins, oh Pope of Rome,And hold on tight to your Vatican banner. Alexander Pelevin (not to be confused with Russian popular fiction writer Victor Pelevin) also completed his evolution from postmodernism to patriotism in poetry. His novel ‘Pokrov-17’, which mixes prose and poetry, is also remarkable for mixing genres and realities and was recently awarded the Nation’s Literary Bestseller prize. Following the start of the special military operation, Alexander Pelevin’s poetry became even more popular with readers than his fiction. He didn’t fail to respond to the wave of voluntary emigration provoked by the conflict and presented an alternative to the position of people who chose to flee their homeland: I'm sorry I won't leave. I'm sorry I'm so bad.I'd rather be terrible and dark in my terrible and dark land. He also dedicates his poems to Russian soldiers: Good people need poetry, but they need UAVs even more,As well as meds, armor, sights, all-weather raincoats, binoculars, flashlights. Maria Vatutina, an acclaimed poet, playwright, and journalist, is among those who not only monitor current affairs but also produce a timely response to them: The world is changing faster than ever. In the meantime, however,True heroes are being taken out by the filth of the worldFrom behind the corner in a cowardly plot. Many popular performers chose to leave the country in response to the military offensive, including top rappers Oxxxymiron, Noize Mc and Face. There is, however, no united opposition formed by any artists, nor are there any powerful hits that might enjoy the same level of impact on society that Kino’s single ‘We want change!’ had back in the 1990s. In the meantime, patriotic rap songs are on the rise. For example, rapper Rich recently released his new track ‘Dirty work’ dedicated to the soldiers who protect our homeland and ensure that people in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan and other cities and towns of Russia can live a peaceful life. Four letters L on the shoulder (a reference to the swastika sign on some Ukrainian military insignia – RT)The peace-mongers’ feet are getting colder,Iskander missiles will fly, huge as a boulder,Targets hit by the Grads will smolder. Chorus: These guys do your dirty workThere’s no rest for them, no single perk,They are under fire, and the enemies lurk,This planet feeds on blood descending into murk. Akim Apachev is a new name on the poetry scene that immediately attracted much attention. He is a former Ukrainian citizen and a resident of Mariupol. He is also the author of the single ‘Summer and Crossbows’ about Russia’s military operation in Syria that went viral on TikTok. The lyrics mention Ilyushin planes and PMC Wagner, among other things. The track became very popular with teenagers; it was a song of choice in Moscow’s bars and clubs, even as far as they were from the war zone in Syria. As the heavy fighting over his hometown ended, Apachev did something very brave and exciting. He recorded a track in collaboration with Darya Frey called ‘A Duck is Swimming’, which is a direct reference to a Ukrainian folk song. This piece is important as it celebrates the liberation of a Ukrainian city from the grasp of the Kiev regime and is performed in Ukrainian. The chorus goes like this: A duck is swimming, girls are dancing,At Azovstal demons are buried,In a steppe, a house is on fire,Our Lady gives birth to the baby. The Azovstal factory was the last line of defense for Ukrainian nationalist fighters. Members of the Ukrainian army’s Azov Battalion were hiding for a long time on the grounds of this plant before surrendering to the Russian army. The following line is of special significance: “This is my home, my Crimea, my land, and I will also take my Ukrainian language with me.” The divide between the Russians and the Ukrainians that exists in the Western mindset is challenged here. The Mariupol-born artist says in Ukrainian: “This are my home and my language; I don’t support the Kiev regime.” These are the first lines written by a Ukrainian artist who believes the special military operation is justified and is ready to fight alongside Russia for peace for all – a Ukrainian who has a right to his homeland, his culture, his vision of a future for his country and who is ready to give his life for it. A well-known producer from Kiev and a Ukrainian national Yuri Bardash is worth a special mention. He stayed out of politics for quite a while until he recorded his track ‘Poziciya’ (the title refers to the author’s political position) last summer slamming the Ukrainian regime. His hometown of Alchevsk is now under the control of the Lugansk People’s Republic. In his song, Bardash declares: Question: What has the East to do with Bandera? This is not our hero, not our faith We have Stakhanov and AlchevskyHeroes of Labor, super experts. And he continues to tell Boris Johnson and Joe Biden to “go to hell.” Bardash had to move to Moscow because of his political views and now his former Ukrainian fans wish him dead. The story of Yuri Bardash sets a unique precedent: he’s the first well-known Ukrainian figure who spoke up for Russia openly. He wasn’t afraid to say what many wouldn’t dare out of fear of persecution by the SBU (the Security Service of Ukraine). *** On the whole, there are two things to be said about the output inspired by the military operation. First, it is taking over a niche previously occupied by other popular forms and genres and ranges from feminist poetry to salty epigrams. Another thing worth mentioning is that this kind of work is written both by the authors who stay true to the Russian literary tradition with a clear preference for epic narratives and those who re-invent the traditions originating in the West, such as feminist poetry or free verse. It is likely that all this is just the beginning.",2.9183439593002114,2.4803557836438457,0.4379881756563657,3
2022-10-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/564997-railways-boss-son-drones/,Son of ex-Russian Railways boss detained over drone launch,"A Norwegian court placed 47-year-old Andrey Yakunin in custody for two weeks on Tuesday over allegations that he illegally flew a drone from his luxury yacht. The suspect, who heads the investment company VIYM, is the eldest son of Vladimir Yakunin, the former boss of state-owned Russian Railways. The alleged drone incident occurred off of the Svalbard archipelago, also known as Spitsbergen. Norwegian police asked the court to detain the offender, citing fears that he might evade investigators and flee the country. During the hearings, Yakunin insisted he was a British citizen and pointed out that he is a permanent resident of Italy. “The man has Russian and British citizenship and is charged with violating the Sanction Act §4 for flying a drone in Norwegian territory at Svalbard,” police prosecutor Anja Mikkelsen Indbjor told local media. The luxury boat has been sailing around Svalbard and along the Norwegian coast for several months starting this summer. Despite Yakunin’s insistence on being treated exclusively as a British citizen, the police noted having recovered his Russian passport aboard the vessel. “The police arrested the man on October 17 in Hammerfest and have seized drones and electronic devices that now are being analyzed,” she added. “The content from the drone is of great importance for the case.” Yakunin’s defense insisted the drone affair was a pure accident and the defendant was not aware that such activities were somehow regulated. “He admitted flying a drone, but had no reason to believe this was illegal. He is a British citizen,” Yakunin’s lawyer Jens Bernhard Herstad said. “The court order will be appealed.” Yakunin is the seventh Russian national to end up in legal trouble for flying drones in Norway, according to media reports. Before the suspect’s name was officially confirmed, local media described him only as the son of a “close ally” of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier this year, Vladimir Yakunin challenged such a definition when he was targeted by Western sanctions over the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. After being slapped by UK sanctions back in April, Yakunin said London had demonstrated “astounding incompetence” in compiling the sanctions lists and had erroneously described him as the head of Russian Railways. “I’ve been retired from this position for seven years now, and I am not engaged in any other state or commercial activity. Anyone with internet access can easily find this information,” the former top executive said.",2.804992764399132,3.3045863835972997,-0.4995936191981678,5
2022-10-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/564666-galicia-from-love-to-hate/,Ukraine's most nationalist region was once a hotbed of pro-Russian sentiment – how and why did it change?,"Today, Western Ukraine is considered to be the epicenter of Ukrainian nationalism. Walking around Lviv, right now, you'll barely hear a word of Russian spoken, and it would be shocking to encounter someone expressing sympathy with Moscow. However, it hasn’t always been like this. In the middle of the 19th century, the cultural heart of the region – Galicia – was considered more loyal to Saint Petersburg than almost anywhere else in Europe. The Galician elites were oriented towards Russia, and Russophilia was the most popular political trend among the local population. So how did Galicia go from being a pro-Russian province on the outskirts of the Austrian Empire to the world’s capital of Russophobia? “In the last decade of the 19th century, despite all its own difficulties in terms of national and economic life, Galicia became the center of the Ukrainian movement. In Russia’s Ukrainian lands, it played the role of a cultural arsenal with respect to Russia’s Ukrainian lands, where the means to bring about a cultural and socio-political revival of the Ukrainian people were created and improved,” Mikhail Grushevsky, a historian who was one of the first ideologists of Ukrainian nationalism, wrote in an article entitled Ukrainian Piedmont, back in 1906. Today, it is difficult to dispute his assertions. During the 20th century, western Ukraine, which Galicia is part of, was the main center of Ukrainian identity and the engine driving Ukrainization in the rest of the country’s regions. But the history of the Galician lands does not begin at the end of the 19th century. It has roots in the deep past, tracing back to the very origins of Russia. Initially, Galicia was part of the lands of Ancient Rus, which stretched from the southeastern cities of modern Poland to the Finnish lakes in the north. After the Mongol-Tatar invasion, most of the Russian principalities were weakened and the Galician-Volyn Principality was divided between Poland and Lithuania. At the same time, according to Polish sources, Galicia continued to be called Chervonoy Rus (that is, Red), and the local population called themselves Rusyns. After the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia came under the rule of Austria. Vienna needed to build an administrative system for the region, most of which was inhabited by Slavs. To do this, the Austrian authorities skillfully played on the incongruities between the Catholic Polish population (mainly townspeople and nobles) and the Orthodox peasantry. Seeing the latter as possible agents of Russian influence, a campaign was launched to Polonize them. The effect, however, turned out to be exactly the opposite. Galician Russophilism was born amidst the Polonization drive in the first half to the middle of the 19th century, when Poles played the dominant role in the cultural and social life of the region. The local Rusyn population gave up hope of finding a way to integrate into the Austrian Empire without losing their traditions and culture, so they began to look for new meaning in the East. Moreover, in the period between the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) and the Crimean War (1853-1856), Russia really was the hegemon of continental Europe. Austria itself called on Russian troops to help suppress a Hungarian uprising. For the Rusyns, the power of the neighboring empire was obvious, and they perceived Russia as a place where they could occupy a privileged position as part of the national majority, and not be second-class subjects. The government in St. Petersburg quickly saw prospects in the nascent Russophile movement. Russian historians began to come to Galicia and pan-Slavic literature was distributed throughout the region. The most significant role in this was played by the historian and writer Mikhail Pogodin. During his trips to Galicia, he won over several prominent figures in the Rusyn intelligentsia, primarily the historian Denis Zubritsky, who eventually became an ardent supporter of pan-Slavism and Russian autocracy. Soon, a whole ‘Pogodin colony’ appeared in Lviv, which eventually joined Yakov Golovatsky, the first head of the Department of Russian Literature at Lviv University. The Russophile idea quickly won over the hearts and minds of Galician intellectuals. Of course, the growth of the pro-Russian movement provoked a response from the Austrian authorities. They decided to continue Polonization by replacing the Cyrillic alphabet in Russian schools with the Latin one. As a result, this ‘Alphabet War’ only strengthened the positions of Russophiles among the Russian intelligentsia. Moreover, the Austrian authorities continued to rely on the Catholic Polish nobility to manage the region, which further alienated the Rusyns from Vienna. Meanwhile, the Russian Empire only increased its soft support for Russophiles through its embassy. Mikhail Rayevsky, who worked there as a priest, regularly provided money, textbooks, and copies of pan-Slavic pamphlets to Rusyn activists. By 1866, the Russophile movement had finally formulated its platform. Its manifesto was an article entitled A Look into the Future, which was written by a Greek Catholic priest named Ivan Naumovich and published in the Lviv newspaper Slovo. Naumovich argued that Galicia could only be protected from Polonization by recognizing that the Rusyns’ identity belonged with the Russian Empire. “From an ethnographic, historical, linguistic, literary, and ritual point of view, Galician Rus, Ugric Rus, Kievan Rus, Moscow Rus, Tobolsk Rus – this is one and the same Rus. We did not become Rusyn in 1848, we are real Russians,” he wrote. However, most Russophiles did not equate Rusyns and Russians at that time. Although they held up the Great Russian culture of the Russian Empire as a role model, they considered themselves to be a separate part of a common ‘Russian’ people. According to the historical view of the Galician Russophiles, the center of Russian statehood and culture shifted from Kiev to Moscow after the Mongol invasion, and due to historical circumstances, the Galician lands were torn away from the center of Russian life, and thus stagnated for a long time. Faith and language were the pillars of the Russophile worldview. They were ardent adherents of the Eastern, Greek rite, and therefore advocated for purifying the Greek Catholic Church of Latinisms, and sometimes directly agitated for converting to Orthodoxy. In regards to language, Russophiles championed maintaining ties with the Church Slavonic language and preserving literary Russian without departing into local dialects. At the same time, despite the fact that Galician Russophiles focused on the Russian Empire in the cultural sphere, this did not manifest in the political sphere. In general, the Russophile movement remained loyal to the Austrian authorities. In his article, Naumovich didn’t forget to add one important proviso – that the Galicians “have always been and will remain unshakably loyal to our august Austrian monarch and the most illustrious Habsburg dynasty.” From 1860 to 1880, Russophiles played a dominant role in Galicia’s non-Polish population. They controlled the region’s leading Rusyn institutions: the Stauropegion Institute, the People’s House in Lviv, and the Galician-Russian Matica. The Russian Rada, founded in 1870, became the political center of the movement. In 1874, Naumovich organized the Mikhail Kachkovsky Society, which was engaged in educating the “Russian people in Austria” and soon opened branches throughout Galicia. The Russophiles soon had competition. The Austrian government realized the futility of trying to Polonize the Galician Rusyns and began to patronize the faction of their intelligentsia that called Rusyns Ukrainians and considered them a separate people, unconnected with Russians, whose future lay with Vienna, not Saint Petersburg. The authorities actively patronized the ‘Narodovite’ movement that emerged among Ukrainian students and the progressive intelligentsia. Its proponents defended the idea that Galicia’s Rusyn population had its own national identity, holding that they were different from both Russians and Poles. Moreover, these Narodovites advocated for unity among the Ukrainians under both Austrian and Russian rule. In the future, they argued, this would allow them to be used in the foreign policy of the Viennese court in the same way the Russian Empire used the Russophiles of Galicia. However, despite the patronage of the Austrian authorities, Narodovite ideas did not gain traction among the Russian population for a long time. The situation began to change with the deterioration of Russian-Austrian relations in the early 1880s. In Vienna, the perception finally emerged that Russophiles were a ‘fifth column’ engaged in pro-Russian propaganda on the Austrian empire’s lands. The first high-profile trial took place in 1882 after the population of the Galician village of Gnilichki converted from Greek Catholicism to Orthodoxy. The authorities held that this was the first step in preparing pro-Russian separatist demonstrations in Galicia. The authorities claimed that Russophile activists had been behind the conversion and put them on trial for treason. The defendants were Olga Grabar; her father Adolf Dobryansky, a leader of Transcarpathian Russophiles, who moved to Lviv in 1881; the aforementioned Naumovich; the editors of a number of pro-Russian newspapers; as well as other prominent figures of the movement. In general, the case failed. The prosecution’s arguments did not convince the jury. Four of the accused received short prison sentences. Naumovich received the harshest punishment, sentenced to eight months. The rest, including Grabar and Dobryansky, were acquitted. However, adept coverage of the trial in the pro-government press allowed the Austrian authorities to score political points and undermine the Russophiles’ position in society. The media focused on the defendants’ connections with the Russian authorities, while the accused failed to speak convincingly at the trial. The leniency of the punishment appeared to be more connected with the liberal leanings of the local court than an actual absence of guilt. However, it was not immediately possible to reduce the influence of Russophiles in Galicia, and they were a serious political force in the region for a long time. The Russophiles were even able to pull the Narodovites into a joint confrontation with the Poles, despite the fact that both movements mercilessly criticized each other in the press. In 1883 and 1889, Russophiles and Narodovites conducted joint campaigns during the elections for the Galician Sejm. However, attempts to reach mutual understanding eventually failed due to clever manipulation by the authorities. In the 1890s, most of the Narodovites came to an agreement with the Poles through mediation by the Austrian government. The Ukrainians were promised concessions in the socio-political and cultural spheres in exchange for their refusal to cooperate with Russophiles. In 1891, phonetic spelling was officially introduced in local records and documents, which later formed the basis for the literary norms of the Ukrainian language. Meanwhile, a split was brewing among Russophiles. The movement’s older generation spoke in favor of holding to the previous course, while the younger generation called for aligning with the Russian Empire not only culturally, but also politically. The new generation of Russophiles no longer saw the Rusyn of Galicia as just an ethnic group within the Russian people, but as an integral part of it. They also criticized the older generation’s loyalty to the Habsburg Empire, which was typical of the movement’s founding fathers. Their stated goal was to first achieve national and cultural unity among all three branches of the Russian people, and later bring about political unity with Russia. At first, the conflict between the older and the younger generation took the form of internal discussions but did not lead to a rift in the movement. In 1900, the Russian People’s Party was created, whose leadership included both Russophiles loyal to Austria and those fully oriented towards Russia. Its platform contained a vague formula for national identity, which held that the Galician-Russian population was part of the “Little Russian Tribe, belonging to the triune of Russian people.” However, on October 14, 1908, Mikhail Korol, the leader of Russophiles loyal to Vienna, declared in the Galician Sejm that, despite the cultural unity of the all-Russian space, he also recognized the national identity of the Little Russians, and he himself had never been and never would be Russian. He also noted that he was “disgusted with people who served a foreign state for Russian rubles.” The new generation of Russophiles, led by Vladimir Dudykevich, in turn, affirmed “the national, tribal, and cultural unity of the Galician Rusyns with the Russians.” As to language, he held that the Ukrainian language “does not exist, has never existed, and will never exist, and there is only one Russian language created by the genius of the Russian people.” An organizational split in the Russophile movement occurred in February of 1909, when the Petersburg-oriented part of the movement took control of the leadership of the Russian People’s Party. Austrian loyalists responded by creating their own organization – the conservative Galician-Russian Rada. In fact, the pro-Russian position turned out to be much closer to that of the Galician population. The future minister of the West Ukrainian People’s Republic and an activist in the Galician Ukrainian movement Longin Tsegelsky wrote that after 1908, about 90 percent of the Russophile movement proved to be pro-Russian, with only ten percent loyal to the Habsburg authorities. Pro-Russian Russophiles were stronger in the cities, while pro-Austrian ones held sway in the countryside. In the last years before the First World War, pro-Russian Russophiles carried out violent activities and their rhetoric towards the Ukrainian movement of Galicia became more derogatory. Their press wrote that “in order to please the Germans and Poles, ‘mazepintsy’ have created a Ukraine-bastardy in Russia,” and branded the Ukrainian language “artificial jargon created according to the recipe of Grushevsky.” This prompted the pro-Austrian-minded part of the Russophile movement to depart from their previous positions and make peace with the Ukrainian nationalists. Persecution by the Ukrainian authorities also began. The final split took place during the First World War, when the Ukrainian movement was on the verge of a rapid rise. Meanwhile, the pro-Russian Rusyns, who had been expecting a long-awaited reunification with the rest of the Russian people since the beginning of the conflict, instead met with repressive measures from the Austrian government, which led not only to the destruction of the Galicia’s Russophile movement, but also the nearly complete disappearance of Galician Rusyns.",3.0990378237489655,4.096795776333986,-0.9977579525850202,4
2022-10-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/564976-putin-ukraine-campaign-orders/,Putin announces new security measures in Russia,"Russia has introduced emergency measures due to the continued threat posed by Ukraine and the need for a more efficient response to it, President Vladimir Putin announced on Wednesday. Speaking at a meeting of the National Security Council, Putin said he had signed several documents detailing the policy changes. He also reiterated accusations against Kiev, stating that it uses “terrorist methods” against Russia. Ukrainian forces “sabotage crucial infrastructure and stage assassinations of local officials. Just like their ideological forefathers – [Stepan Bandera’s] Hitler collaborators – they try to create a criminal underworld, send sabotage teams on our soil,” Putin explained. He claimed that Russian law enforcement officials have prevented several planned attacks on “mass gatherings, transport and energy facilities,” including a nuclear power plant. Martial law in four regions Among other things, Putin has imposed martial law in four new Russian federal subjects: the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and the Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions. Their citizens voted in last month’s referendums to break away from Kiev and join Russia. Ukraine has rejected the validity of the votes. The four provinces already had martial law in place when Russia accepted their bids, Putin said. The decree, which he expects parliament to ratify swiftly, will give the legal basis under Russian law for what is de facto happening on the ground, Putin added. Alert regimes In a separate decree, Putin ordered a “medium action level” in several other parts of western Russia. Those include the Crimean Republic, the city of Sevastopol, as well as Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov Regions. The special regime gives regional officials additional authority to ensure security and react rapidly to any emergencies. Other Russian regions were put on “elevated” and “basic” levels, depending on their proximity to Ukraine. The administrations of the four regions under martial law will have a “maximum” level of additional authority. The governors of different parts of Russia face different challenges and need different powers to deal with them, Putin told the security council. Government coordination The president instructed the Russian federal government to form a special coordination center for various aspects of the Ukraine crisis, from repairing weapon systems for the military to providing medical treatment to injured people and repairing damage sustained by towns and cities during hostilities. Putin also ordered federal officials responsible for coordinating with regional authorities to be provided with Moscow’s assistance in handling their new tasks and powers. Support of mobilized reservists Another set of instructions told the Defense Ministry to ensure that people enrolled in active military service under partial mobilization are paid their due. The document set a minimum monthly wage of 195,000 rubles (over $3,000) for every person and told the Finance Ministry to allocate money for the compensations. Putin said he was reacting to reports of cases of wages not being paid on time and stressed the importance of providing the military what it needed to do its job properly. “This includes barracks and places of deployment, living conditions, uniforms and equipment, food, medical treatment. We have every opportunity to solve all emerging issues in a way worthy of our nation,” the president insisted.",3.2166291617298555,1.8977752175161524,1.318853944213703,2

He issued the clarification shortly after President Vladimir Putin introduced martial law in the four former Ukrainian regions which recently joined Russia. When asked by news outlet RIA Novosti on Wednesday whether the government would close the borders, Peskov said “No, [we are] not planning to.” Earlier in the day, at a meeting of Russia’s Security Council, Putin announced the decision to impose martial law in the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions starting midnight on Thursday. In late September, the pro-Russian administrations in the four regions held referendums on joining Russia. An overwhelming majority in each region voted in favor of the move. According to Putin, his decision would not change much for these regions, as martial law had already been in place when they merged with Russia. The document signed on Wednesday merely provides the legal basis for martial law, now under Russian sovereignty, the president said. He also introduced a state of ‘mid-level response’ in a number of other regions adjacent to Ukraine, including the Crimean Republic, the city of Sevastopol, as well as Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk, and Rostov Regions. The local authorities have been given additional powers to ensure security. That same day, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament unanimously approved the imposition of martial law in parts of the country.",3.8089907031970225,2.66352210389183,1.1454685993051923,2

The Russian authorities have begun relocating residents eastward across the Dnieper River. Kherson, the capital of a formerly Ukrainian region that joined Russia following a referendum in September, is located on the western bank of the Dnieper River, which exposes it to possible Ukrainian attacks. On Wednesday, the deputy head of the local administration, Kirill Stremousov, reported an escalation of hostilities involving up to two Ukrainian infantry battalions. “After preliminary bombardment by the artillery, the group went on the offensive. There is a large number of enemy middle-range drones and reconnaissance Bayraktar drones keeping out of the reach of air defenses,” he announced in a statement on social media. “At this point of time, all attacks have been fended off. We are holding the defense line,” the official added. The regional and city authorities had earlier offered assurances that Russia had no intention of allowing Ukraine to capture Kherson. At the same time, Russian officials warned that the Ukrainian move posed an imminent threat to the people residing in the city. On Tuesday, the head of the region, Vladimir Saldo, announced that the civilian population of Kherson would be relocated to the other side of the Dnieper. He warned that Ukraine could destroy a dam at the Kakhovka hydropower plant upstream, which would make crossing the river much more difficult for some time. In his latest comments he estimated that over 5,000 civilians had been moved out of Kherson in less than two days. Some of those who are relocating will be temporarily sheltered in the eastern part of the region, while others will be housed elsewhere in Russia, Saldo clarified on Wednesday. Seaside hotels and other seasonal facilities are currently available, he noted. The regional administration is also moving out of Kherson and will be based on the left side of the Dnieper, the official added. In an interview on the Rossiya 24 TV channel on Tuesday, the recently appointed overall commander of operations in Ukraine, Russian Army General Sergey Surovikin, described the situation near Kherson as “tense” and warned that the military may have to make “difficult decisions.” Most of Kherson Region was captured by Russian forces in the early weeks of its military campaign. Its people voted last month to break away from Kiev and join Russia, a request that Moscow granted. Kiev considers the territory to be temporarily occupied and has pledged to use military force to bring it back under its control.",3.4762132074576044,2.96142045256314,0.5147927548944646,2

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the decision on Wednesday. The Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, already had martial law in place when they became parts of Russia, Putin explained. So, the decision provides the legal basis for it to remain in place under Russian sovereignty, he said during a meeting of the National Security Council. The document signed by Putin introduces martial law starting midnight on Thursday. It also orders various parts of the Russian government to submit corresponding action plans within three days.

This is a special regime that gives officials additional authority to ensure security and rapid reaction to any emergencies. People in the four former Ukrainian regions voted in referendums last month to ask Moscow to accept them as part of Russia. Kiev rejected the votes as illegitimate and pledged to use military force to seize the regions. Earlier on Wednesday, officials in Kherson Region reported that Ukrainian troops appeared to be deploying for a large-scale offensive against the capital, Kherson.

2022-10-19,https://www.rt.com/news/564960-bill-ackman-ukraine-peace/,US billionaire proposes peace plan for Ukraine and Russia,"Ukraine should recognize Crimea as part of Russia and renounce its bid to join NATO for the sake of peace, US billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has said. As with SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk before him, Ackman was immediately criticized online for suggesting that Kiev should be ready to make concessions in order to end the hostilities. “Crimea was part of Russia until 1954 and is largely comprised of ethnic Russians, which was apparently why the world did little when Russia annexed it back in 2014,” Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, tweeted on Monday. He added that the borders should return to where they were prior to February 24, when Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring country and before four former Ukrainian regions voted to join Russia. He added that the West should then help Kiev with its recovery, while the country should stay outside NATO. “Thousands of lives will be saved and resources can be invested to rebuild [Ukraine] rather than in a war that will only lead to more destruction and death,” the billionaire wrote. “If there is a viable path to peace, we should pursue it. Each day the conflict continues, the risk to the world rises.” After receiving criticism online, Ackman clarified his stance on Tuesday. “Yesterday, I suggested that a reasonable peace settlement might be a return to the borders as of [February 24], a Marshall Plan to rebuild [Ukraine], and [Ukraine’s] decision to not join NATO. Then the knives came out. I was accused of being an appeaser and worse,” he wrote. I ask: is [Ukraine] better off in a continued prolonged war that leads to 1,000s more [Ukrainian] deaths and the leveling of the country or does some kind of negotiated settlement make sense? … I am by no means an expert. It just saddens me to see death and destruction with no apparent end date or opportunity for resolution. “In a negotiated settlement, both parties must concede something or there is no opportunity for resolution. What is the least that both parties can concede that is acceptable for both? What am I missing in my analysis? What better ideas do you have?” Ackman argued. Ackman’s comments came as more public figures in the West have been making suggestions for a possible peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Venture capitalist and tech entrepreneur David Sacks tweeted on Sunday that the US should propose a ceasefire based on the February 23 lines and guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO. Musk offered his own vision of a peace settlement this month, which includes Ukraine recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Kiev and Western officials quickly blasted Musk for what they considered to be a plan that heavily favors Moscow.",2.0628030035048632,2.9532825356045436,-0.8904795320996803,8
2022-10-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/564952-zelensky-fires-ambassador-kazakhstan/,Zelensky fires ambassador after ‘kill Russians’ remarks,"A Ukrainian diplomat who made the case for killing “as many Russians as possible” in an interview has been fired from the position of ambassador to Kazakhstan. President Vladimir Zelensky ordered the dismissal of Pyotr Vrublevsky on Tuesday, according to a decree published on his website. He did not immediately appoint a replacement. Vrublevsky stirred controversy in August when he gave an interview to a Kazakh video blogger. When asked about the situation in Ukraine at the time, he said: “What can I say? … We are trying to kill as many [Russians] as possible. The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to. That’s it.” The remarks angered officials in Kazakhstan, which has a large ethnic Russian minority. Critics accused the Ukrainian envoy of inciting hatred in the country. He reportedly apologized for his words after being summoned to the Foreign Ministry, and later went on vacation. Earlier this month, Moscow expressed concern about Vrublevsky’s presence in Kazakhstan. The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that the man continued serving as the head of the Ukrainian Embassy in Astana, and noted that this went against assurances made by Kazakhstan that the diplomat would be ousted. Kazakhstan said Vrublevsky would leave as soon as his replacement is sent, and denied that it was engaging with him in his official capacity. Astana declined to expel the man. It may take months for Kiev to replace the diplomat, as the recent example of the former Ukrainian ambassador to Berlin shows. Andrey Melnik became notorious for using abrasive language when speaking about German officials and other public figures. Zelensky recalled Melnik in July, a week after the diplomat falsely claimed in an interview that Ukrainian nationalist forces were not involved in the ethnic cleansing of Jews and Poles during World War II. He remained in the position until last Friday, his last day in charge of the embassy in Berlin. He left “with head held high,” Melnik said in his parting remarks.",3.4576766488968067,3.6719030471511322,-0.21422639825432555,3

Ukrainian commandos used around 30 speed boats overnight to cross the Dnieper River, targeting the city of Energodar, Vladimir Rogov claimed. “After artillery shelling of the city, they attempted to land, including to capture the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. The fighting continued for several hours, at least three or three and a half. The assault was fended off,” he said. Earlier in the day the city administration reported Ukrainian artillery attacks on several key facilities in Energodar, including the city administration building, an access road, and a transformer station crucial for its power supply. The latter was disabled, causing a blackout, the head of the city administration, Aleksandr Volga, said. Later in the day, the Russian Defense Ministry stated that the number of troops involved in the Ukrainian operation comprised up to two companies and that a total of 37 boats of various types were used. The military claimed that Kiev lost over 90 soldiers and 14 boats in the botched operation, while its remaining forces were dispersed by Russian artillery fire. Energodar is located in Zaporozhye Region, one of four former Ukrainian regions that voted to become part of Russia last month. Energodar has been under Russian control since March. The Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, the largest facility of its kind in Europe, is located on the shore of the Dnepr just outside the city. The site was the focus of a diplomatic spat between Russia and Ukraine, with both sides accusing each other of attacking it and risking a nuclear disaster. Kiev also claimed that Russia was stationing heavy weapons at the facility, which Moscow denies. Russia formally included the plant in its civilian atomic energy infrastructure earlier this month. The provincial capital, the city of Zaporozhye, remains under Ukrainian control and served as the staging ground for the amphibious operation, according to Rogov.",5.052911445475879,2.7462474627112248,2.3066639827646545,9

There’s no work there ever since Europe decided to close itself off from us. “Countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, on the contrary, need additional attention,” Lavrov continued, promising that countries which are “ready to work on equal terms” will be rewarded with “promising joint projects.” The US and many European nations have made life difficult, even dangerous, for Russian diplomats.

The move comes amid speculation surrounding a new Ukrainian offensive and warnings about possible attempts by Kiev to destroy the dam of a local hydroelectric power plant, he explained. “There is an immediate danger of flooding in the territories due to the planned destruction of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric dam and release of water from a cascade of power plants upstream of the Dnepr River,” Saldo said. The decision comes as the Russian military is reinforcing its positions in the region, Saldo explained. The relocation will help avoid mass civilian casualties from the ongoing hostilities and enable “the Russian troops to perform their duties in defending Kherson Region.” This decision has been prompted by the creation of large-scale defensive fortifications so that any attack may be repelled. Where the military operates, there is no place for civilians. Let the Russian Army carry out its task. The civilian population will be now withdrawn to the left bank of Dnieper in “an organized, step-by-step fashion, and accommodated for free,” Saldo explained. Residents of Kherson Region who are willing to move to somewhere else in Russia will be provided with real estate certificates, in accordance with guidelines announced earlier in the day by the Russian government, the governor added. The announcement comes as Russian Army General Sergey Surovikin, the recently-appointed commander of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, made his first public remarks since assuming his role in early October. Speaking to the Rossiya-24 broadcaster, the general admitted that the situation around Kherson was “tense” and “difficult decisions” may have to be made. Kherson Region has been under the control of the Russian military since March.

Kiev has repeatedly pressed West Jerusalem for arms. “Our support for Ukraine does not include weapons systems and weaponry – and there is no change to that position,” Saar told Israeli broadcaster Army Radio on Tuesday, Haaretz reported. Shai announced on Sunday that “the time has come for Ukraine to receive military aid” from Israel, claiming that Iran is supplying Russia with ballistic missiles. Iran insists that this claim is “baseless,” and that it has not armed either side of the conflict. The minister’s statement sparked anger in Moscow, with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warning that Israeli military aid to Ukraine would “destroy all diplomatic relations” between the two countries. It also set off a wave of disavowal in West Jerusalem, with government sources telling the Times of Israel on Monday that Israel does not plan on arming Ukraine. Shai’s comments do not reflect government policy, the sources added. Israel also rejected a request from Ukraine on Monday to hold a phone call between its defense minister, Benny Gantz, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Alexey Reznikov. Kiev, however, is undeterred. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said on Tuesday that his government would send an official note to Israel requesting air defense weapons. Ukraine has called on Israel to donate these systems for months, with President Vladimir Zelensky telling French reporters last month that he was “shocked” at the Jewish State’s refusal, and alleging that the Israeli government is under the “influence of Russia.” While Israel has condemned Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, it depends on diplomatic contact with Moscow, particularly as Israeli jets often conduct airstrikes in Syria, where Russia controls the airspace.

Describing the situation as particularly “tense” around the city of Kherson in his statement to the broadcaster Rossiya-24, he added that the military may be forced to make “difficult decisions.” “The NATO command of the armed forces of Ukraine has long been demanding offensive operations in the Kherson direction from the Kiev regime, regardless of any casualties – both in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and among the civilian population,” Surovikin stated. The Russian military is aware of Kiev’s plans to use “prohibited” means of waging war in the Kherson area, Surovikin added. Namely, Ukraine is preparing a massive strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, located on the Dnieper River, as well as launching massive rocket and artillery attacks on Kherson itself. “These actions can lead to the destruction of the infrastructure of this large industrial center and massive casualties among the civilian population,” Surovikin said. In the ongoing effort to dislodge the Russian military from its positions, Kiev is pouring its reserves en masse into the frontline, the general said. The vast majority of those reserves are “territorial defense units, who have not been properly trained,” Surovikin added. Such troops have low morale, thus they are propped up by “barrier squads” composed of hardline nationalists “who shoot anyone trying to leave the battlefield,” he claimed. The enemy’s daily losses amount to hundreds of casualties. We have a different strategy. <...> We are not aiming at fast-paced offensives, we spare every soldier and methodically grind the enemy’s attacking forces. This not only minimizes our own losses, but also significantly reduces the amount of victims among the civilian population. “The enemy is the criminal regime that pushes Ukrainian citizens towards death. We are one people with Ukrainians and only wish for Ukraine to be a state independent from the West and NATO and friendly towards Russia,” Surovikin said. Surovikin assumed overall command of Russian troops participating in the military operation earlier in October. The general has significant combat experience, ranging from hostilities in Chechnya to the operation in Syria, for which he was awarded the title of Hero of Russia back in 2017. According to media reports, Surovikin was given the nickname ‘General Armageddon’ by his colleagues over his hardline and unorthodox approach to warfare. His elevation into the new role has coincided with Russia ramping-up aerial bombings across Ukraine, with cruise missiles and suicide drones attacking crucial infrastructure sites in the country.",2.63787045422069,2.5050958211893275,0.1327746330313624,0
2022-10-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/564912-ukrainian-war-crimes-report/,Report on alleged Ukrainian war crimes presented to UN,"A commission set up by the UN human rights watchdog, the OHCHR, has documented at least two war crimes committed by the Ukrainian military amid the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. The preliminary, unedited version of the document, compiled by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, was submitted to the General Assembly on Tuesday. According to the report, the commission has “documented two cases in which Ukrainian armed forces shot, wounded, and tortured captured Russian armed forces soldiers, which are war crimes.” Both instances, which occurred early in the conflict and came to light after the Ukrainian fighters themselves posted footage of their war crimes online, received wide media coverage at the time. The first incident acknowledged by the UN’s commission occurred in late March in the village of Malaya Rogan in Kharkov Region. “Ukrainian armed forces soldiers deliberately shot three captured Russian armed forces soldiers in the legs at close range and beat one of them with a rifle butt, while interrogating them,” the report reads. Footage of the incident, however, suggests that over a dozen Russian POWs were subjected to such treatment, with some of them apparently dying during the Ukrainian ‘interrogation.’ Another documented incident occurred in the village of Dmitrovka, outside Kiev “around 29 March,” amid the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area. “A Ukrainian armed forces soldier shot three times at close range, and wounded, an already wounded Russian armed forces soldier. A video shows other motionless Russian armed forces soldiers nearby, including one with hands tied behind his back and an apparent wound to his head, suggesting that he had likely been executed,” the commission noted. While acknowledging Ukrainian wrongdoings, the report, however, unequivocally states that “Russian armed forces are responsible for the vast majority of the violations identified.” While the instances of mistreatment of Russian POWs at the hands of Ukrainian fighters are backed by hard evidence, such as videos, the alleged violations committed by Russian forces mostly rely on the accounts of witnesses. Among other things, the report reiterates the allegations of widespread sexual violence by the Russian military, claiming that the purported “victims range from four to over 80 years old.” The claims resemble those made by the ousted Ukrainian human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denisova, who had extensively disseminated wild stories about alleged widespread sexual violence. The ombudsman was removed in late May over what was deemed a failure to perform her duties. In particular, she was slammed for “inexplicably focusing” on spreading unverified and unsubstantiated information. According to Ukrainian media reports, most of the rape claims made by Denisova turned to be fake, with local prosecutors finding no evidence to back them.",2.5923009362142264,2.001221194831111,0.5910797413831155,5
2022-10-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/564914-ukraine-rolling-blackouts-warning/,Ukrainians warned of tough times ahead,"Kiev has warned Ukrainians of tough times ahead as rolling power outages and a lack of water and energy for heating are expected across the country, following Russia’s missile attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure. President Vladimir Zelensky’s deputy chief-of-staff, Kirill Timoshenko, announced on Tuesday that “the situation across the country is critical.” “Each region depends on the other. That is why we should prepare for a loss of electricity, water and heat,” he said. If Russia’s strikes continue, Timoshenko urged people to prepare for rolling blackouts and to try to preserve energy. His comments come after Moscow’s forces targeted large energy supply facilities in Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk, and Zhitomir on Tuesday morning. The executive director of Ukrainian energy company DTEK, Dmitry Sakharuk, said that Russian forces hit two thermal power plants, which sustained significant damage. “Facilities which are critical for the functioning of our stations have been destroyed. Without them, they cannot work normally,” he said, adding that it’s not likely that these facilities will be restored quickly. Sakharuk also suggested that the destruction of DTEK’s energy facilities is one of the primary objectives of Russia’s massive missile strikes, which started on October 10 and have been targeting energy, military, and communications infrastructure across Ukraine. “What is happening now is what [Russian President Vladimir] Putin spoke of. That we have 29 facilities and we want to finish them all off. That is what is happening,” he said, referring to a press conference last week in which Putin said there was no further need for massive military strikes as “only seven of some 29 targets designated by Russia’s Defense Ministry” were left standing. Putin added that these facilities were being “finished off gradually.” On Tuesday morning, Zelensky tweeted that after one week of Russian airstrikes, around 30% of the power plants in Ukraine have been destroyed, which has led to massive blackouts across the country. He added that there is now “no space left for negotiations” with Moscow.",2.3163022092047063,2.428163848491397,-0.1118616392866909,0
2022-10-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/564910-estonia-russia-terrorist-regime/,EU country brands Russia a ‘terrorist regime’,"The Estonian parliament voted on Tuesday to label Russia a “terrorist regime,” condemning its “aggression” against Ukraine and calling for Kremlin officials to face an international tribunal. The statement mirrors a similar declaration by EU bureaucrats last week. The statement was adopted by 88 votes in the country’s 101-seat parliament. In April, the legislature already accused Russia of “war crimes and genocide,” citing “atrocities” that Moscow has dismissed as “provocations” and which reports suggest may have been the work of Ukrainian security forces. Tuesday’s declaration repeated the accusations of “genocide,” calling for Russian officials to be punished by an international tribunal. It also demands further EU sanctions on Moscow and NATO military aid for Ukraine. It labels Russia’s recent military mobilization “a crime against peace,” and calls for the country to be removed from the UN Security Council, a move that would be legally impossible to implement. The declaration came after a similar resolution was adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) last Thursday. Russia left the European NGO in March, calling it a “convenient platform for NATO’s information and political campaigns.” Legislatures in Latvia and Lithuania have also passed similar motions. While Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has called on the collective West to declare Russia a “state sponsor of terror,” only a handful of countries have heeded his call, and their actions have been limited to symbolic gestures. Those with the power to enforce actual anti-terror sanctions against other states, like the US, have refused to take this step. US President Joe Biden simply answered “no” when asked last month if he would apply the label to Russia, with the White House adding afterwards that it would not be ""the most effective or strongest path forward,” and would cause legal difficulties for organizations working to export Russian and Ukrainian grain from Ukraine’s ports. However, the European Parliament will vote in November on “recognising Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism,” the European Conservatives and Reformists bloc announced on Twitter on Monday.",2.7125612145310307,2.2793619000810494,0.4331993144499813,8

Russian hardware is being used. You know it well. All further questions can be addressed to the Defense Ministry,” Peskov said on Tuesday. American and Ukrainian officials have claimed on many occasions that Russia received various unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) from Iran and was using them in the conflict with Ukraine. On Monday, multiple drones were spotted flying over the Ukrainian capital Kiev, with troops desperately trying to shoot them down with small arms, according to videos from the scene. At least one “kamikaze drone” was reportedly hit and crashed into an apartment block, setting off a deadly explosion. A soldier interviewed by Ukrainian television claimed that he was among those who managed to divert the aircraft off its course with gunfire, adding that he later helped rescue people from under the rubble at the crash site. The mayor of Kiev, Vitaly Klitschko, said that Russia attacked the city with 28 drones on Monday morning and that the Ukrainian military managed to intercept “most” of them. He reported a total of five explosions, including the one at the residential building. Other drones apparently reached their intended targets, including energy infrastructure facilities. The drones, designated Geran-2 in Russia, are allegedly a localized version of the Iranian-made Shahed-136. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky claimed last week that Russia had acquired as many as 2,400 Shahed UAVs, as he asked G7 members to provide more air defense systems. Last month Ukraine cut diplomatic ties with Iran over the alleged supply of weapons to Russia. Neither Moscow nor Tehran confirmed the purported purchase. Kiev reportedly urged Israel to ramp up intelligence-sharing in response to Moscow’s alleged deal with Iran. Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Nachman Shai said last Sunday that he supported taking Kiev’s side because of the claimed Iranian involvement.",2.097883278484017,3.055456146847599,-0.9575728683635818,0

The book includes an introduction by Zelensky in which he explains what he has learned about himself and Ukrainians since the launch of the Russian military operation in late February. “If you want to understand who we are, where we are from, what we want and where we are going, you need to learn more about who we are. This book will help you do just that,” the Ukrainian leader said in a statement released by Crown and quoted by the media. The book, which also features a preface by Arkady Ostrovsky, the Economist’s editor for Russia and Eastern Europe, will be released in the UK, US, Germany, Spain, and Portugal, according to The Guardian. All of the proceeds from the book will go to United24, a platform set up by Zelensky to raise charitable funds for his country.

According to RIA Novosti, the Tagansky Magistrate’s Court in Moscow hit the online platform, a subsidiary of tech company Amazon, with two fines, each equivalent to four million rubles, in two separate cases. The first was for disseminating “misleading information about nuclear war, mobilization, and the special military operation in Ukraine.” According to the court, all the claims were made during a stream that featured a prominent Ukrainian journalist Dmitry Gordon. Meanwhile, the second fine was imposed on Twitch due to its failure to delete footage with a Ukrainian military expert and an interview with Alexey Arestovich, a top aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who it said was spreading falsehoods about the Russian army. This is not the first time Russia’s judiciary has imposed fines on Twitch for failing to delete information about Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine. Three previous penalties amounted to four, three and two million rubles, respectively. In recent months, the Russian authorities have imposed various restrictions and fines on a number of Western platforms for not complying with local legislation. These measures have included bans on Facebook and Instagram, which allowed online hate speech against Russian nationals, and a fine on American search giant Google for its failure to delete prohibited information about the Ukraine conflict. In early March, Russia adopted a law that allows substantial fines to be imposed on persons and entities for discrediting the Russian army or calling for sanctions against the country.

Pashinsky thought he was speaking to former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. During the call he apparently admitted that “there is more PR and corruption in Bayraktar than combat use,” according to a video published by the duo on their Telegram channel which appears to have been recorded sometime earlier this month. The politician, who heads the Association of Defense Enterprises of Ukraine, went on to say that the Turkish drones, which Western and Ukrainian media have hailed as a game changer on the battlefield in the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, are “first and foremost a PR project.” “I was personally against it, because they are extremely vulnerable to air defense systems,” Pashinsky said, adding that Ukraine had a lot of Bayraktars before fighting broke out and that “they were all shot down within a week.” He further explained that the drone is “not a self-sufficient weapon” it cannot work by itself as it “gets shot down by air defense systems in a flash and has no combat effectiveness at all.” The official noted, however, that they can be used in tandem with anti-radar missiles which have been supplied to Kiev by the US and that “if not for the HIMARS and HARM systems, there would be no more Bayraktars in Ukraine.” Ukraine previously announced it intends to carry on with its plan to open a Bayraktar manufacturing facility in collaboration with the Ankara-based producer Baykar. That’s after Türkiye gave several drones to Kiev earlier this year. In another excerpt from Pashinsky’s interview with Vovan and Lexus published last week, but apparently recorded before October 8, the official also admitted that Kiev coordinates its military operations with Washington and stated that “as soon as you tell me that the US approves the destruction of the Crimean Bridge, things can move forward,” adding that “I only need a verbal confirmation.”",1.7367805401047671,3.5283247123497277,-1.7915441722449605,9

The devastation has caused “massive blackouts across the country,” he added in a tweet posted on Tuesday morning. He concluded that there is “no space left for negotiations” with the government of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Putin announced the shift in the military operation in Ukraine on Monday of last week, just after Russian forces launched massive long-range missile strikes across Ukraine. He accused Kiev of masterminding several “terrorist attacks” targeting key Russian infrastructure over the past several months, including the Crimean Bridge bombing attack. The Russian president said Kiev’s tactics justified a response in kind, as he confirmed that Moscow now considers Ukrainian energy infrastructure to be a legitimate target for military attacks. Days earlier, a massive explosion on the bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland claimed three civilian lives and caused significant damage to the road traffic section of the bridge. Moscow claimed that Ukraine was behind it, while some officials in Kiev celebrated the incident. Russian law enforcement has since claimed that it established how the bomb, which was disguised as construction material, made its way from Odessa, Ukraine, to Russia through a number of transit nations. Investigators claim Ukrainian military intelligence was behind the plot. In the first two days of Russia’s missile strikes, around 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure was destroyed, the country’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, told CNN last week.

2022-10-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/564863-russian-ukraine-prisoner-exchange-sailors/,Russian military confirms major prisoner exchange with Ukraine,"A total of 110 Russians have returned home from Ukraine as part of a major prisoner exchange with Kiev, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday. The group included 72 civilian sailors who had been held in Ukraine since February 2022, it added. In exchange, Moscow released 108 female soldiers to Ukraine. Two women slated for the exchange turned down the offer and said they would like to stay in Russia, the ministry said. All of the Russians who returned home would receive all the necessary medical and psychological assistance, it added. Kiev also confirmed what it called “another large-scale” exchange. Earlier on Monday, the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, announced the swap on social media. The exchange would have involved some 30 soldiers from various parts of Russia, including the DPR and the neighboring Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), along with the civilian sailors, he said at that time. Kiev detained dozens of Russian civilians who had been in boats that stopped at Ukrainian ports in late February, when Moscow launched its military operation. Some of them were freed after Russian troops captured the port city of Mariupol, but many others remained in Ukrainian custody. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, Russian Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova was directly involved in facilitating the exchange. Last week, she said that 65 sailors could be set free soon, and that talks over their release were in the final stage. Last Thursday, the two sides exchanged 20 Russian soldiers for an equal number of Ukrainian troops, according to officials from both nations. Moscow and Kiev have repeatedly swapped prisoners since the start of the conflict between the two neighbors in late February. The last major exchange took place in late September, when 55 Russian soldiers, including those from Donbass, were freed. Kiev also released Ukrainian opposition leader Viktor Medvedchuk as part of the swap. The Ukrainian authorities charged Medvedchuk with treason last year and banned his party, Opposition Platform – For Life, after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. According to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, 215 Ukrainian soldiers were returned to their home country in the swap. Those included more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, within the ranks of which fighters openly embrace neo-Nazi views.",2.924359626834975,3.2503989846339354,-0.3260393577989604,5
2022-10-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/564526-bolton-russia-regime-change/,John Bolton’s Russia regime-change fantasy has little basis in reality,"John Bolton, the former National Security Advisor for President Donald Trump, recently published an article titled ‘Putin must go: Now is the time for regime change in Russia.’ One must keep in mind that these words come from a man who famously commented, while speaking in February 1994 at an event in New York called the ‘Global Structures Convocation,’ that the “Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories. If it lost ten stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.” Bolton lambasts the fact that, according to the White House, President Joe Biden wasn’t really serious about regime change in Russia when, during remarks made in Poland last March, he blurted out “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.” As I’ve said before, I believe Biden was, in fact, dead serious about his desire for regime change in Russia, and that it has been, and continues to be, the unstated policy of the United States to remove Vladimir Putin from office. And Washington is actively implementing policies designed to achieve that very result. What separates Bolton from the Biden White House is the honesty that is produced by being outside the halls of power, as Bolton is today, where your words no longer resonate with relevance. Bolton is free to give voice to that which the Biden administration only whispers about in the dark recesses of the White House situation room. How else would one describe the goals and objectives of a policy build on the massive sanctioning of the Russian people – designed to destroy their quality of life and means of support – in an effort to generate a level of domestic political unrest sufficient to fomenting a modern day ‘Moscow Maidan,’ reminiscent of the February 2014 events in Kiev that resulted in the ouster of former Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovich? Bolton himself alludes to this possibility in his article. “There is no long-term prospect for peace and security in Europe without regime change in Russia,” he writes. “Russians are already discussing it; quietly, for obvious reasons.” The notion that Putin is vulnerable to being ousted by a popular uprising flies in the face of reality, given Russian opinion polling. Even from western-linked sources. Fact-based analysis, however, is not something Bolton is known for. One need only run down the litany of regurgitated points he cites to hammer his idea home – Russian casualties, economic ‘pain’ brought on by sanctions, ‘rising’ political opposition, young men 'fleeing' the country, the rhetorical ‘brandishing’ of nuclear weapons by Moscow, and, to top it off, he alleges Russian sabotage of the NordStream pipelines. Bolton’s mission is not to tell the truth about Russia but rather to shape perception for the purpose of manufacturing a false narrative. The perception of the existence of a viable domestic political opposition is essential to the regime-change fantasy being promulgated by Bolton. “Carefully assisting Russian dissidents to pursue regime change might just be the answer,” Bolton opines, responding to the question of how to bring about an end to the Ukraine conflict. Regime change, Bolton notes, “must involve far more than simply replacing Putin,” adding that “[among Putin’s] inner circle, several potential successors would be worse.” The problem, Bolton states, “is not one man, but the collective leadership constructed over the last two decades. No civilian governmental structure exists to effect change, not even a Politburo like the one that retired Nikita Khrushchev after the Cuban missile crisis. The whole regime must go.” How to accomplish such a massive undertaking? Here Bolton seems to have been an avid reader of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the exiled oligarch-turned-political activist, who in his new book The Russia Conundrum writes extensively about the so-called “Men of Power,” or Siloviki. “The key,” Bolton states, “is for Russians themselves to exacerbate divisions among those with real authority, the siloviki, the ‘men of power.’ Disagreements and animosities already exist, as in all authoritarian regimes, exploitable as dissidents set their minds to it.” By using the siloviki to shatter regime coherence and solidarity, Bolton declares, “change is possible.” What “change” does Bolton propose? A military coup, of course, conducted not “from the top flag officers and officials, who are too personally invested in the Putin regime,” but rather “from the colonels and one-star generals, and their civilian-agency equivalents” who are, in Bolton’s view, “the most-likely co-conspirators to take matters into their own hands. These are the decision-makers whom the dissidents must identify, persuade and support to facilitate regime change.” Fortunately for Putin, Bolton isn’t very good at carrying out regime-change operations, although he has publicly bragged about his role in implementing them as official US government policy. Coups, Bolton told CNN’s Jake Tapper during an interview in July 2022, “take a lot of work.” Bolton bragged about his status as “somebody who has helped plan coups d’etat.” By way of example, Bolton referred to efforts undertaken by the Trump administration to support Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido in his effort to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro. “Not that we had all that much to do with it, but I saw what it took for an opposition to try to overturn an illegally elected president,” Bolton bragged, before adding, “and they failed.” It speaks volumes about the mental state of an individual who, uninvited, seeks to impose himself on one of the most important issues of our time–the geopolitical struggle between the collective West and Russia over the future European security framework–by promulgating a template of regime change in Russia drawn from the disastrous example of a failed US-backed coup in Venezuela. The good news is that any such effort undertaken by the US government in Russia is guaranteed to suffer the same fate as the Bolton-inspired coup in Venezuela—abject failure. The bad news is that the world has to suffer through the incoherent ramblings of a neoconservative warmonger who had been put out to pasture but, because of the vacuum of coherence that is US policy on Russia, saw an opportunity to reinject his flawed thinking into the cacophony of opinions that comprises what passes for informed foreign-policy discussion in America today.",3.668605475449822,4.116407364134439,-0.4478018886846167,8
2022-10-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/564850-ukraine-crowdfund-drone-defense/,Ukrainians crowdfund mysterious anti-drone weapon,"A Ukrainian blogger has crowdfunded more than $4 million to purchase a drone defense system for Kiev’s military. However, it is unclear what kind of system exists to counteract the UAVs currently targeting Ukrainian infrastructure. Igor Lachenkov, who describes himself on social media as a “Ukrainian influencer,” told Radio NV on Friday that he had launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise 100 million Ukrainian hryvnia ($2.7 million) to purchase a radar-based “interceptor” to counter the explosives-laden drones targeting critical infrastructure across Ukraine in recent weeks. The drones, denoted by their distinctive delta-wing silhouette and low-altitude flight, are believed to be Russian-modified versions of the Iranian-made Shahed-136, an autonomous ‘kamikaze’ drone. Despite video footage showing similar devices destroying targets in Ukraine, neither Moscow nor Tehran has officially confirmed the use of these drones, and Iran maintains that it has not sent weapons to any party in the conflict. By Saturday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fedorov announced on Telegram that the crowdfunding initiative had raised 150 million hryvnia ($4.08 million). However, Lachenkov told Radio NV that he “cannot announce the name of the system until we buy it” for security reasons, referring to the radar-based platform only as a “Shahed Hunter.” The blogger explained that the system supposedly “intercepts” an incoming drone and raises it to a height where surface-to-air or shoulder-fired missiles can shoot it down. It is also unclear what kind of device can override a Shahed’s guidance system, which relies on an inertial system of motion sensors and gyroscopes to guide itself to a target. Ukrainian sources have alleged that Russia upgraded the Shahed to utilize satellite guidance, which can theoretically be jammed from the ground. The US military has no effective method of defending against drones like the Shahed-136 at present. As of earlier this month, the US has supplied Ukraine with an unknown number of “counter-unmanned aerial systems.”",2.708295950445399,3.221359835152808,-0.5130638847074089,0

2022-10-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/564854-elon-musk-russia-crimea/,Musk claims Russia would use nukes to defend Crimea,"SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk argued on Monday that Russia views Crimea as an integral part of its territory, and that Ukrainian or Western attempts to seize the peninsula could end in nuclear war. While Musk has previously backtracked on pulling his technological support for Ukraine, he has courted controversy for insisting that Crimea is Russia. “If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter,” Musk wrote on Twitter. “We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way, so what more do they have left to lose?” he asked, in response to a commenter asking him whether he reckoned the Ukraine conflict could devolve into a nuclear war. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has repeatedly stated that he intends to seize control of Crimea, along with the four former regions of Ukraine that recently voted to join the Russian Federation. Crimea overwhelmingly voted to rejoin Russia in 2014, and therefore falls under the protection of Moscow’s nuclear arsenal. If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter.We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way, so what more do they have left to lose? If we nuke Russia back, they will nuke us and then we have WW3. As President Vladimir Putin has stated, Russia’s nuclear doctrine allows the state to defend itself with “all available means” if its existence is threatened. “Whether one likes it or not, Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia,” Musk continued. “Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia, as it is their southern navy base. From their standpoint losing Crimea is like [the] USA losing Hawaii & Pearl Harbor.” Crimea was formally a part of Russia from 1783 until it was gifted to the Ukrainian SSR by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1954. Musk claimed earlier this month that Khrushchev’s decision was a “mistake,” and suggested that Ukraine abandon its claim to the peninsula as part of a future peace deal with Russia. Musk’s peace plan was condemned by Ukrainian officials and their supporters online, with Ukraine’s former ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik, telling the billionaire to “f**k off.” Musk then said that he would take Melnik’s advice and stop providing free Starlink internet access to Ukraine, which he said would cost SpaceX $400 million to run throughout 2023. Around the same time that he was reportedly placed on a notorious Kiev-backed ‘kill list’, Musk abruptly U-turned on his plan to cut Ukraine off, announcing “to hell with it… we’ll just keep funding [the] Ukraine government for free.”",3.7487347967447735,3.7692207516508796,-0.020485954906106052,5

Kiev detained dozens of Russian civilians who had been in boats that stopped at Ukrainian ports in late February, when Moscow launched its military operation. Some of them were freed after Russian troops captured the port city of Mariupol, but many others remained in Ukrainian custody. Last week, Russian Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova reported that 65 sailors could be set free soon, and that talks over their release were in the final stage. The reported swap is the latest in a series between the two neighboring states. The previous exchange took place last Thursday and involved 20 Russian soldiers and an equal number of Ukrainian troops, according to officials from both nations.",3.8664878157641374,3.1384324715851095,0.7280553441790278,2

Writing on his Telegram channel, Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, denounced Israel’s potential decision to deliver arms to Ukraine as “extremely reckless,” adding that “it would destroy all interstate relations between our countries.” “That’s not to mention that Bandera scum were and remain Nazis,” he stressed, referring to Ukrainians who have a soft spot for Stepan Bandera – a controversial Ukrainian national hero who collaborated with the Nazi regime during World War II. Medvedev went on say that if Israel were to give arms to such people, it could go as far as to declare Bandera and Roman Shukhevych, another notorious Ukrainian Nazi collaborator, their national heroes. The ex-president’s comments came after Shai voiced support for propping up Kiev’s military. In a tweet on Sunday, the official, citing deliveries of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia – an allegation Tehran has denied – claimed there was “no longer any doubt where Israel should stand in this bloody conflict.” “The time has come for Ukraine to receive military aid as well, just as the USA and NATO countries provide,” he stated. Since Russia sent troops into the neighboring state in late February, Israel has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine and condemned Moscow’s actions. However, it has never imposed sanctions on Russia and has supported Kiev only with non-lethal aid. Meanwhile, Ukraine has asked Israel for its Iron Dome missile defense system, with Tel Aviv refusing to indulge the request so far. It argued that the technology that defends the small state of Israel would not work on a territory as large as Ukraine’s. Such a response did not sit well with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who claimed in late September that he was “in shock” due to this stance. According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, there are about 1.3 million Russian-speaking Israeli citizens, or 15% of its total population, and Russia is home to one of the world’s largest Jewish communities.",3.36631840861223,2.738768020046499,0.627550388565731,5

The troops will be hosted as part of a recently created joint military force. Earlier in the day, the Defense Ministry reported that Revenko had briefed 19 military diplomats on how the new joint force would operate. The official, who heads the foreign affairs department in the ministry, stated on Twitter that he had given the same details about the Russian forces to the foreign representatives. Minsk decided to bolster its security by hosting Russian troops after its attempts to de-escalate border tensions were rejected, Revenko claimed to have told the military attaches. Russia and Belarus perceive as threats the “deployment of NATO forces near [their] borders amid a lack of dialogue, increased NATO training with a focus on offensive action, [and] the encouragement of Belarussian radical elements to topple the legitimate government of Belarus,” he said. Belarus is a long-time ally of Russia, with the two together forming what is called the Union State. The new defense force, the creation of which Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko announced last week, will operate under its auspices. Minsk cited increased aggression from Kiev and Western nations as the reason for agreeing to have more Russian troops on its soil. The first trains with Russian soldiers and military vehicles started arriving in Belarus on Saturday, according to the Defense Ministry in Minsk. On Sunday, Russian warplanes started redeploying to the country, the ministry told local media. Belarus has allowed Russia to use its territory to launch offensives against Ukraine, but said it did not contribute its own troops to the operation. Hostilities in the neighboring nation escalated as Western nations poured arms and resources to prop up the Ukrainian military. Belarus claims that the threat posed to its safety by both Kiev and NATO members such as Poland has grown. Last Friday, Belarussian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei reported that his nation had put its troops and special services on high alert due to what he described as a terrorist threat.

The proposal was made during a parliamentary hearing on initiatives aimed at containing the promotion of “non-traditional sexual relations” and pedophilia. Gay “propaganda” is currently only prohibited in Russia when directed at children. Andrey Lipov, the head of Roskomnadzor, told MPs on Monday that many 18+ materials, including books, contain content depicting “non-traditional” relations and still “remain accessible to minors.” In order to “protect society” from the promotion of “non-traditional sexual relations and other sexual deviations, including pedophilia, sexual violence and others,” Lipov said it was “necessary to introduce a ban on the promotion of these deviations among people of any age, not only among children.” He added that a total ban on LGBT+ propaganda would provide Roskomnadzor with sufficient legal grounds to protect “spiritual and moral sovereignty.” The watchdog’s head revealed that to date Roskomnadzor has blocked and removed more than 7,200 materials featuring non-traditional relations, calling each piece of material “a bomb.” His stance was supported by the General Prosecutor’s office. The head of its department for the rights of minors, Irina Rebrina, voiced support for the new legislation, saying that “the emotional development of a new generation of Russians” is a matter of concern. The State Duma chairman, Vyacheslav Volodin, said the bill could be approved in the first reading early next week. Expressing hope that the final bill would be ready for presidential approval in November, Volodin claimed that the proposed legislation serves as a means to protect Russians “from the darkness that is spreading more and more in the world.” Besides banning propaganda of LGBT and pedophilia, the proposals currently being considered by lawmakers include outlawing “demonstrations of LGBT people, as well as information encouraging gender reassignment among teenagers,” and even the dissemination of information “promoting the denial of family values.” The Duma’s information committee also suggested some alterations to several existing bills and to the Code of Administrative Offenses. In particular, it seeks to set the maximum fine for promoting pedophilia at 10 million rubles ($162,000).",4.359699650458063,3.052473168784211,1.3072264816738524,3

Attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure were intensified last week. “All planned targets have been hit,” the ministry outlined in a statement. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal wrote on his Telegram channel that Russian drones had damaged energy sites in Kiev, while critical infrastructure in the eastern Dnepropetrovsk Region and the northern Sumy Region had also been targeted. “Hundreds of residential areas have lost power as a result of the attack,” the prime minister wrote. “Officials are working to restore electricity supply.” Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko, meanwhile, said that a Russian drone had hit an apartment block, killing three people, including a pregnant woman. He added that three people were hospitalized.

The Rubezh-2022 drills are aimed at bolstering readiness in case of cross-border incursions by militia forces, officials say. The Rapid Response Force for the Central Asian Region of the CSTO will be training for swift deployment and action in a mountainous area of the host nation, the commander of the group’s joint military staff said. The mission, as described by Russian Col. Gen. Anatoly Sidorov, includes defeating a simulated attack by militias and securing a breached national border. Lt. Gen. Emomali Soborzoda, who heads the General Staff of Tajikistan, noted that Dushanbe has been concerned by “negative trends” in terms of security for all members of the CSTO. His country perceives particular risks from Afghanistan, which it borders in the south, he added. The exercise involves around 1,000 troops and about 300 military vehicles, including warplanes, helicopters, and drones, according to the organization’s statement. Participating troops started arriving in Tajikistan last week and are scheduled to train until Friday. The six-strong collective defense organization recently experienced some bumps in its operations. In September, member states Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan engaged in border clashes, with at least one soldier reported killed. The neighbors have a long history of sporadic flare-ups along sections of their border, which measures hundreds of kilometers, and which they are yet to formally ratify. A separate surge in violence last month involved another CSTO member, Armenia, which engaged in hostilities with regional rival Azerbaijan. Dozens were reported dead over several days of artillery shelling and cross-border raids on both sides. The Armenian leadership asked the CSTO to send troops under the mutual defense provisions. The organization urged for diplomacy and deployed monitors to Armenia in response. The CSTO consists of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan.

Brussels is sending up to 40 observers “to build confidence” after recent hostilities, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs announced, according to a statement released on Monday by the European Council. “This is another proof of the EU’s full commitment to contributing to the ultimate goal of achieving sustainable peace in the South Caucasus,” he added. The monitors will be stationed in Armenia and stay there for up to two months, the Council said. Some of them may be pulled out of Georgia, where they are deployed on a similar observation mission. The EU pledged to make sure that its capacity in Georgia “is not impacted” by the relocation. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locking horns for decades over a number of issues, most prominently, the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which claims to be an independent state. In 2020, the two nations fought a 44-day war over the territory, which ended with a Russian-brokered truce and the ceding to Baku of some areas previously controlled by Nagorno-Karabakh troops. Last month, dozens of people, both civilian and military personnel, were reportedly killed on both sides. Yerevan and Baku accused each other of triggering the escalation in violence. The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russia-led defense alliance that counts Armenia as a member, sent an observer mission to the area in the wake of the clashes. Yerevan has long been Moscow’s ally, but during the latest round of hostilities with Azerbaijan, senior Armenian officials complained about a lack of military intervention on its side. President Nikol Pashinyan noted that the CSTO should be worried about “losing Armenia,” according to local media. Officials in the US and the EU have been offering their assistance to Armenia. During her trip to Yerevan last month, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed that Armenians “were disappointed they got fact-finders and not protection” from Moscow, suggesting Washington may be a better guarantor of security for the nation.

Nevertheless, the targets for partial mobilization have been met thanks first and foremost to the responsibility, honor, and patriotism of Muscovites,” Sobyanin said on his official blog.

To come back with a victory. To defend the safety and independence of our nation,” he said. President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization of reservists last month, stating that extra manpower was necessary to sustain Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. The Defense Ministry said it wanted all parts of Russia to contribute a total of 300,000 people to bolster the army. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

The news comes a week after Moscow launched a significant attack on Ukraine’s critical energy and military infrastructure. “An explosion in the Shevchenko district – in the center of the capital,” Klitschko wrote on his Telegram channel at around 7am Monday morning, before reporting another blast in the same area several minutes later. A fire broke out in a non-residential building, and several residential buildings were damaged, he later added. Witnesses reportedly heard the sound of kamikaze drones in the air, according to Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister, who said that they targeted critical infrastructure in the area of the central railway station in Kiev. Several videos circulating on social media claim to show the drones in the skies of Kiev, as well as one of the impact sites. The mayor later posted a photo of what he said were parts of a drone that was destroyed. One fragment featured the word ‘Geran-2’, the name of a kamikaze drone used by Russian forces. According to some reports, the Geran-2 is a localized version of the Iranian-made Shahed-136 drone. Neither Moscow nor Tehran has confirmed the shipment of UAVs to Russia. Iran has said in the past that it is neutral with regards to the conflict. Russian strikes were also reported in other parts of the country. Valentin Reznichenko, the governor of the eastern Dnepropetrovsk Region, said that several houses were damaged when a missile hit an unspecified energy infrastructure site, causing a fire. He added that three missiles were intercepted and destroyed mid-air. According to the Ukrainian Armed Forces Southern Command, three drones struck industrial sites and a pharmaceutical warehouse in the city of Nikolaev. Dmitry Zhivitsky, the governor of the northern Sumy Region, said several people were injured after strikes on “critical infrastructure.” The reported strikes come one week after Russia launched a barrage of missiles and drones that targeted Ukrainian military facilities and infrastructure across the country over two days.

As Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky called for pre-emptive strikes on Russia, EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell declared on Thursday that Moscow’s forces would be “annihilated” if Russia struck first. Putin has not threatened Ukraine with nuclear strikes, and in his public statements has affirmed Russia’s nuclear doctrine – that Russia will defend itself with “all available means” if the existence of the Russian Federation is threatened. In a speech last month, Putin framed the conflict in Ukraine as an existential struggle between Russia and a “totalitarian” West bent on weakening and vassalizing her. In a separate statement, he described Russian forces as fighting “the entire Western military machine” in Ukraine. Broadly, Western leaders have supported the idea of the conflict ending in a negotiated settlement, but stressed that Ukraine should be allowed to dictate the terms of any peace deal. Until then, the US, G7, and EU have all vowed to arm Ukraine for “as long as it takes” for Kiev to reach its goals – which include the seizure of areas of Ukraine now incorporated into the Russian Federation.",2.998680351999208,3.664580243762564,-0.6658998917633561,8

Earlier this week, Patten accused Russia of employing a “deliberate” rape “strategy” as part of its military campaign in Ukraine. “One cannot even comment on P. Patten’s … words in a serious way,” Zakharova said, adding that the UN official’s conclusions were based on data that is difficult to verify, according to Patten herself. “Once again, what we are seeing is a classic ‘highly likely’ [story], which has this time reached the level of twisted imagination,” Zakharova said. According to her, the UN official made her conclusions based on fragmentary data provided by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine – a group created in spring 2022 on the basis of a resolution of the UN Human Rights Council. Russia has not recognized its mandate, Zakharova added. Patten’s claims resemble those made by the former Ukrainian human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denisova, Zakharova said. Denisova was fired from her position in late May after a no-confidence vote over her failure to perform duties such as organizing humanitarian corridors and prisoner exchanges amid the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Later, Ukrainian media reported that most of Denisova’s allegations regarding “sexual atrocities” committed by Russian soldiers in the country had not been confirmed by Ukrainian prosecutors. The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman’s reaction was sparked by an interview Patten gave to AFP this week, in which she claimed that sexual violence is a “deliberate tactic” and “military strategy” of Russia, aimed at dehumanizing its “victims.” She also claimed that Russian soldiers are “equipped with Viagra.” Zakharova pointed out that similar claims have been made by Western officials in the past. In 2011, the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, reportedly accused then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi of supplying his troops with Viagra to supposedly encourage mass rape during a conflict that broke out following a NATO-backed coup attempt which ended with the brutal murder of Gaddafi. US military and intelligence officials subsequently told NBC that there was no evidence that the Libyan military was being supplied with Viagra or engaging in systematic rape in “rebel areas.” “The West is using the same patterns in its hybrid war,” Zakharova said on Sunday, commenting on Patten’s statements.",2.881915050603578,2.5520505168813057,0.3298645337222723,5

Kiev accuses the blogger of committing a series of war crimes and engaging in “terrorist activity.” Strelkov, 51, whose real name is Igor Girkin, fought in the conflicts in Transnistria and Bosnia in the 1990s as a volunteer, and later in Chechnya while serving in the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia’s top domestic spy agency. He quit the FSB in 2013 and led a squad of volunteer fighters in support of the DPR a year later. In Donbass, he quickly became one of the most prominent commanders and served as the DPR’s defense minister for three months soon after the region declared its independence from Ukraine in 2014. Later, Strelkov returned to Russia and emerged as a prolific military blogger and commentator. Ukraine initially put him on a wanted list in 2020. The Dutch authorities also filed charges against him for his alleged role in the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Donbass in 2014. He denied the allegations. Strelkov stopped posting new messages to his accounts earlier last week. His wife, Miroslava Reginskaya, posted a photo on social media on Saturday of her husband in fatigues, promising that Strelkov would “make contact soon.” The blogger himself reposted her message on Sunday, without commenting. Some other Russian military bloggers then claimed Strelkov had joined one of the volunteer battalions in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev. The news of his volunteering to fight had prompted a Ukrainian activist and a former leader of the Ukrainian ultranationalist group Right Sector, Sergey Sternenko, to offer a $10,000 bounty for Strelkov’s capture. This private bounty was then quickly raised to $100,000 after several Ukrainian public figures promised to contribute their own money to Sternenko’s initiative.",3.5314735806439996,2.8920599792356576,0.639413601408342,5

The Kremlin spokesman provided no further details about Moscow’s plans and strategy in the military campaign, which has lasted for more than seven months. Earlier this week, Moscow denied rumors that the operation in Ukraine is being redesignated as a counter-terrorism campaign. Peskov also said at the time that there have been no decisions regarding the introduction of martial law in Russian regions which have been targeted by Ukrainian strikes in recent weeks. Moscow also denied that it has considered travel restrictions for men eligible for military service amid the continuing partial mobilization.

However, he noted that Washington could not be the only mediator. “We don’t trust America and you know our position… under no circumstances can we accept that America is the sole party in resolving a problem,” he told Putin on the sidelines of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia in Astana, Kazakhstan. He also commended Russia for “standing by justice and international law.” According to two Axios sources, officials in the administration of US President Joe Biden were “furious” over Abbas’ remarks and conveyed this sentiment to his advisers. The NSC spokesperson told the outlet that “we were deeply disappointed to hear President Abbas’s remarks to President Putin.” “Russia does NOT stand for justice and international law, as evidenced by the latest vote at the UN General Assembly,” the spokesperson added, referring to the recent resolution that rejected the referendums in four former Ukrainian regions that overwhelmingly voted to join Russia. The spokesperson also denounced Putin as “a far cry from the type of international partner” that can help solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as opposed to Biden, who “has demonstrated US commitment for decades to seeking creative solutions.” The spokesperson’s remarks come a week after US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Hussein Al-Sheikh, a top Palestinian official, to discuss regional stability. This meeting followed Biden’s July talks with Abbas during which he confirmed his commitment to the idea of creating an independent state of Palestine. However, he answered “not right at this moment” to the question of restarting peace talks between Israel and Palestine, to which Abbas replied that the chance for a two-state solution may be slipping away. Analysts suggest that the US leader was trying to mend ties with Palestine after his predecessor Donald Trump had pursued policies favorable to Israel. Russia and Palestine, however, have had warm relations for many years, with Abbas having visited the country more than a dozen times.",2.778346666856089,4.118863569380343,-1.340516902524254,8
2022-10-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/564754-strelkov-goes-to-frontline/,Top Russian military blogger volunteers for frontline,"A top Russian military blogger and veteran of several armed conflicts, Igor Strelkov, has reportedly gone to the frontline to fight against Kiev. A $100,000 bounty was issued for his capture in Ukraine. Strelkov’s wife, Miroslava Reginskaya, posted a photo of her husband in fatigues on social media on Saturday, several days after Strelkov, whose real name is Igor Girkin, had stopped posting new messages on his accounts. “There were questions: Where is Igor Ivanovich? Is everything okay, where did he disappear, and so on. To which I answer: Everything is great! He will make contact soon,” Reginskaya wrote. Strelkov reposted her message with the photo on Sunday, without commenting. He had said in the past that he planned to go to the frontline. Fellow military blogger and war correspondent Vladlen Tatarsky (real name: Maksim Fomin) cited his own sources as confirming that Strelkov has joined one of the volunteer battalions. Strelkov, 51, fought in the conflicts in Transnistria and Bosnia in the 1990s as a volunteer, and later in Chechnya while serving in the Federal Security Service, Russia’s top domestic spy agency. Strelkov quit the FSB in 2013 and a year later led a squad of volunteer fighters in support of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). At the time, the Donbass republic had just declared independence from Ukraine following the 2014 coup in Kiev. Strelkov quickly rose to fame as one of the most well-known Donbass commanders, and served as the DPR’s defense minister for three months. He later returned to Russia, becoming a prolific military blogger and commentator. The Ukrainian authorities put Strelkov on a wanted list in 2020 on suspicion of committing war crimes. Ukrainian activist Sergey Sternenko tweeted on Saturday that he will pay $10,000 to anyone who captures Strelkov. Sternenko is a former regional leader of Ukrainian nationalist group Right Sector, which is banned in Russia. Several Ukrainian public figures quickly promised to contribute their own money, raising the bounty to $100,000. Sternenko argued that Strelkov should be taken alive so he can be swapped for Ukrainian prisoners held by Russia, or handed over to the Netherlands in exchange for additional weapons shipments. The Dutch authorities have charged Strelkov for shooting down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Donbass in 2014. He has denied the allegations.",2.5759655465685194,3.039299938115505,-0.46333439154698564,5

Earlier, SpaceX reportedly asked the Pentagon to cover the cost of the internet service for Ukraine, which could amount to $400 million over the next year. “We’ll just keep funding Ukraine government for free,” Musk tweeted on Saturday, “even though Starlink is still losing money and other companies are getting billions of taxpayer dollars.” Earlier, he noted that his “competitors in space launch and communications,” Lockheed Martin and Boeing, together received over $60 billion in defense contracts in 2021 alone. The entrepreneur also complained in a series of tweets that keeping up “warfront” communications is difficult and expensive – adding that Russia is “actively trying to kill Starlink,” forcing the company to spend $20 million per month to safeguard the services from cyberattacks and jamming. The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we’ll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free On Thursday, CNN obtained a letter in which Musk supposedly informed the Pentagon that his company is “not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time.” SpaceX has donated around 20,000 Starlink satellite units to Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict with Russia in late February, providing internet access in chaotic battleground areas that would otherwise be cut off. Kiev has hailed the satellites as an “essential part of critical infrastructure,” while urging SpaceX to send thousands more. Musk previously stated that SpaceX will end up spending more than $100 million providing Starlink services to Ukraine by the end of the year. However, the company reportedly acknowledged that most of the units it sent to Ukraine were partially or fully funded by the American, British, and Polish governments. SpaceX also recently came under fire over alleged Starlink outages across some regions of Ukraine, described by some troops as a “catastrophic” loss of communications, according to the Financial Times. This took place following a spat between Musk and Kiev’s former ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik. The diplomat, who became well known for insulting German officials, told Musk to “f**k off” after the billionaire put forward a peace plan for Ukraine that involved Kiev committing to neutrality and dropping its claim on Crimea. Musk then said he was simply following Melnik’s advice when he decided to withdraw Starlink funding for Ukraine.",2.5793731238766204,2.848576505826678,-0.26920338195005744,5

The incident was a “terrorist act,” it added. Two suspects have been killed on the spot in retaliatory fire, the ministry explained. Officials further explained that they have been identified as “citizens of a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).” The CIS includes most former Soviet republics, except for the Baltic States, Ukraine, Georgia and Turkmenistan. The latter is an associate member of the organization. The Russian military has not provided any further details about the incident or the identities of the assailants. According to RIA Novosti, the two attackers opened fire at a group of volunteer fighters during training at a firing range. The Defense Ministry has yet to confirm this information. Saturday's news comes amid a partial mobilization in Russia, declared as the nation is locked in a protracted conflict with Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that over 200,000 reservists had been called to arms as part of the process, with most of them still undergoing training. Russian authorities have also declared last week's truck explosion on the Crimean Bridge a terrorist act. The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) accused Ukrainian military intelligence of masterminding the bombing, which killed at least four, including the truck driver, and led to a partial collapse of a highway section of the bridge. Russia has identified 12 individuals as suspected accomplices in the plot and has arrested eight of them, the FSB said. The list of people in custody includes five Russians and three foreigners, who have citizenship of Ukraine and Armenia, law enforcement said at that time.

The troll-in-chief insists he posted the controversial material “to fit in.” Kamil Dyszewski has received glowing praise in Western media for posting a crudely-edited Shiba Inu avatar to Twitter earlier this summer. The cartoon dog soon caught on, and pro-Ukrainian accounts began to display their own Shiba avatars and refer to themselves as ‘NAFO’, or the ‘North Atlantic Fellas Organization.’ Since then, the ‘Fellas’ can be found spreading Kiev’s talking points, ganging up to swarm polls and report pro-Moscow accounts, and soliciting donations for the Ukrainian military.

Thanks for your fierce fight against kremlin’s propaganda &trolls. We salute you, fellas! pic.twitter.com/AfDnXf7pfc Before his work was lauded by American weapons manufacturers and their sponsored think tanks, Dyszewski used online platforms to post racialist propaganda about Jews, dispute the Holocaust, and praise Adolf Hitler and other top Nazis. Among the posts are cartoons denying the existence of gas chambers at concentration camps and a meme describing a comparison to Hitler as “nice,” as well as additional photos of the Nazi leader and his propagandist, Joseph Goebbels. A literal, Hitler-admiring Nazi founded the NAFO propaganda operation (which is publicly supported by the US government to wage information war on Russia) https://t.co/LZnnKFShNP Questioned by some within his own ranks, Dyszewski locked his Twitter account on Saturday, but not before posting an explanation. Describing the controversial posts as “overly edgy and incredibly inappropriate ‘jokes,’” Dyszewski said that he made them “to fit in,” without explaining with whom he was attempting to fit in. He added that these posts, all made around 2020, “do not represent me as a person.” ""No no this is taken way out of context, I only said all those Nazi things in order to fit in with all the Nazis I was friends with so that those Nazis would like me.

The incident comes just a day after a missile struck a power station in the city of Belgorod, causing a major blaze at the site. “We have another shelling. One of the shells struck an oil terminal,” Gladkov wrote on his Telegram channel, adding later that the fire that followed the attack had been extinguished. No casualties have been reported. Earlier on Saturday, the governor used his Telegram channel to claim that 14 shells had been fired at a customs office in the border city of Shebekino, adding that no one was hurt. Russian officials accused Kiev of striking a power station in Belgorod on Friday, briefly disrupting electricity supply, and of shelling the top floor of a 16-story apartment block in the city on Thursday. There were no casualties. Earlier this week, Moscow fired dozens of missiles at targets in Ukraine, in response to sabotage plots by Kiev targeting crucial Russian facilities, including the Kursk nuclear power plant, the TurkStream gas pipeline and the Crimean Bridge. Kiev has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement, though some of top officials and government agencies openly celebrated the bridge bombing. On Friday, speaking at a media conference in the Kazakh capital Astana, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that “for now” there was no need for additional large-scale missile strikes on Ukrainian targets. He explained that the Russian military is pursuing other objectives. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics, which have since joined the Russian Federation, as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

This comes after Moscow and Minsk agreed earlier this week to deploy a joint force in response to NATO’s increased military activity on Belarus’ frontier. The ministry said in a statement, “the decision to create a regional grouping of troops has been taken and is being implemented solely to defend” the borders of the Union State amid the “ongoing activity in the border areas.” Founded in 1999, Union State is an organization which consists of Russia and Belarus and seeks to promote cooperation between the two countries. Russian troops have arrived in the neighboring country after President Alexander Lukashenko announced this week that Moscow and Minsk had agreed to deploy an allied force on Belarusian soil. The move, he said, came in response to increased aggression from Kiev and the West. At the time, he also explained that given the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, “some 70,000” Belarusian service members would make up the bulk of the force, adding that nevertheless there would be “more than one thousand Russian soldiers.” Amid heightened tensions with the West and Ukraine, last week Belarus also accused Kiev of “planning to conduct a strike” on the neighboring state. Ukraine vehemently denied this allegation, adding that it might be part of a Russian plan to “stage a provocation.” Before that, Lukashenko had blasted Kiev for supposed attempts to orchestrate provocations on the Belarusian border, claiming that Ukraine had amassed 15,000 troops in the area while conducting reconnaissance and setting up fire positions. Belarus, Moscow’s long-time ally, allowed Russian troops to use its territory to launch a military operation against Ukraine in late February. Minsk has rejected claims by officials in Kiev that its troops were directly engaged in action against Ukrainian forces. Lukashenko reiterated last week that his country’s role in the conflict is limited to self defense and, also, to ensure that “nobody would shoot Russians in the back” from the territory of Belarus.",3.693794193519946,2.3720381504380703,1.3217560430818756,8
2022-10-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/564712-starlink-musk-ukraine-spacex/,Russia trying to kill Starlink – Musk,"SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has blamed Russia for working to disable his Starlink satellite service, which the Ukrainian forces are heavily reliant upon in the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. “Russia is actively trying to kill Starlink,” Musk said in a tweet on Saturday. According to the tycoon, SpaceX, which operates the satellite service, has been allocating “massive resources” to protect it from jamming and cyberattacks. “Even so, Starlink may still die,” he warned. Musk had donated $80 million worth of Starlink terminals to Kiev at the beginning of the conflict in late February, with the system becoming the main communications tool for Ukraine’s forces. However, the world’s richest man had a falling out with Ukrainian officials in early October after sharing his peace plan for the conflict. According to Musk, Russia should “redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision,” while Kiev would commit to neutrality and drop its claim to Crimea. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky reacted to the idea by launching a poll on Twitter, asking followers “which Elon Musk” they “like more” – the one “who supports Ukraine” or the one “who supports Russia.” Kiev’s controversial outgoing ambassador to Germany Andrey Melnik went further, telling the tycoon to “f**k off.” The Twitter spat coincided with reports that the Ukrainian military had started to experience problems with its Starlink communications. Earlier this week, Musk said he couldn’t provide Ukraine with Starlink services for free anymore and suggested that the Pentagon should be paying for it. The US Department of Defense said on Friday that it had been discussing the issue with SpaceX. Being left without Starlink “is going to be a massive blow to Ukraine’s defense capability” because, in this case, “it wouldn’t be able to use satellite data for targeting,” Russian Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov said on Friday. SpaceX is “a private company after all, and although it did everything [provided free Starlink services to Ukraine] at the request of the Pentagon, it couldn’t go on like this forever,” Dzhabarov – who is the first deputy chair of the Russian Senate’s committee on foreign affairs – pointed out.",2.6299425875703086,2.900933116380096,-0.27099052880978736,5

Speaking at the UN General Assembly First Committee, which handles arms control and security issues, Konstantin Vorontsov, deputy head of the Russian delegation, voiced concerns about the possibility of NATO moving its nuclear infrastructure closer to the Russian border. Moscow’s envoy noted that Poland was recently considering full-format involvement in nuclear missions. “Such activities from Warsaw have been significantly beefed up. This is being taken into consideration by Belarus and Russia,” he said, adding that the allied countermeasures fully comply with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The diplomat said these steps include the transfer of Russia’s Iskander-M systems, which are armed with conventional missiles, to Belarus. Vorontsov said another measure would be to equip some Belarusian SU-25 aircraft with the means to carry nuclear weapons, but that “the transfer of technologies that would allow such weapons to be equipped, is not on the cards.” He explained that Russia plans neither “to physically equip Belarusian systems with nuclear warheads, nor transfer such warheads to Belarusian territory.” He stressed that Moscow also has no intention of establishing facilities for stockpiling nuclear weapons in Belarus. The diplomat went on to say that Russia will closely monitor NATO’s policies, particularly after Poland suggested hosting US nuclear weapons on its territory. “This will be a highly destabilizing step, that’s obvious,” Vorontsov warned. In late August, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said Minsk had finished preparing some of its military aircraft to carry nuclear weapons. He had requested Russia’s help in this regard during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin in late June, when he voiced concerns over Poland’s requests for the US to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on its soil.",4.24299292905676,2.656287015121979,1.5867059139347806,8

Asked whether NATO might send troops into Ukraine if the country was close to defeat in its conflict with Russia, Putin said this would be a “dangerous step that could lead to a global catastrophe.” “I hope that those who speak about this will have enough intelligence to prevent such a dangerous step from happening,” he said. The Russian leader also said it was necessary to understand what one means by the word “defeat” in the context of the Ukraine crisis. “Everyone can understand this differently,” he said, explaining that some may already see the fact that Crimea voted to become part of Russia in 2014 as a defeat for Ukraine. “We need to understand what is meant [by defeat],” he added. The West has funneled tens of billions of dollars in financial and military assistance to Ukraine since the conflict began in February, with the US in particular vowing to back Kiev for “as long as it takes” to defeat Moscow’s troops. At the same time, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has repeatedly said that the US-led bloc is “not a party to the conflict” in Ukraine. He admitted this week, however, that a Russian victory would be regarded as a “defeat” for the whole Western alliance and acknowledged that NATO had been providing “unprecedented support” to Kiev to avoid such a scenario. Stoltenberg's comments amounted to “an open confirmation of NATO’s participation in the war,” former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky again this week demanded tens of billions of dollars from the IMF and the World Bank and pleaded with the West for the delivery of more anti-aircraft weapons to continue its fight against Russia.

2022-10-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/564695-melnik-envoy-ukraine-leave-germany/,Notorious Ukrainian envoy leaves Germany,"Former Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnik, is leaving his host nation with “his head held high,” the diplomat has said on Twitter. The notorious envoy had a reputation for insulting German officials and politicians, as well as posting foul-mouthed tweets amid the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. “I return home with my head held high, clear conscience and the feeling that I have fulfilled my duty to Ukraine,” the outspoken diplomat wrote on his Twitter page on Friday. He also thanked his “German friends” for their “patience,” and hailed a piece by a German columnist, Thomas Schmoll, who praised him for “holding up a mirror” to the country’s politicians. Melnik assumed his position as an ambassador back in 2015. The diplomat was relatively inconspicuous before the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in late February. However, he has since attacked the German government on a number of occasions for supposedly being too slow to provide military aid to his home nation. His headline-grabbing remarks included branding German Chancellor Olaf Scholz an “offended liverwurst” over the politician’s unwillingness to visit Kiev. Scholz eventually traveled to the Ukrainian capital in mid-June. In late June, Melnik defended Stepan Bandera – a controversial Ukrainian national hero who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II – in an interview with German podcaster Tilo Jung. The ambassador claimed that Bandera was not implicated in the mass murder of Jews and Poles and instead compared him to Robin Hood. His statements raised eyebrows in Germany, Poland and Israel, prompting the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to intervene and state that Melnik’s words had reflected his personal views and not those of Kiev. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky then sacked the controversial ambassador the following month but Melnik ultimately remained in office until Friday. His dismissal did little to change his attitude, however. In August, he said on Twitter that he had uninvited Michael Kretschmer, the head of the German eastern state of Saxony, to Ukraine. The ambassador said he “canceled” his own invitation, adding that Kretschmer, who is also the deputy head of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, was “unwanted” in Ukraine. The comments came after the German official called for the conflict between Russia and Ukraine to be frozen. In September, he lashed out at the former German chancellor, Angela Merkel, by stating that she had a “borderline obsession” with Russia, which looked “almost perverse.” Merkel attracted his ire by saying Moscow still had a role to play in the European security architecture. Earlier the same month, he said Russian President Vladimir Putin supposedly “can play well” with the “German soul” and manipulate Germans through fear. Most recently, he also insulted a German regional MP, Sven Tritschler, who questioned why the ambassador’s son was studying in Germany instead of defending his home nation. On his last day at the embassy in Berlin, Melnik told the SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk, to “f**k off” after the US billionaire floated a peace plan that was met with anger by Kiev. Musk responded by saying he was “following [Melnik’s] recommendation” when he withdrew his free Starlink satellite service from Ukraine.",2.9533575388170994,3.6611969814416843,-0.7078394426245849,5
2022-10-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/564588-riots-over-mobilization-in-dagestan/,Unrest over mobilization in Dagestan: Homegrown in the majority Muslim Russian region or stoked by outside forces?,"A crowd of women, visibly enraged, encircle a policeman and confront him about the ongoing mobilization and the objectives of Russia's military operation in Ukraine. Dissatisfied with the response, they have a short discussion between them, after which they start chanting anti-war slogans. Within a few minutes, a scuffle breaks out between the police and disgruntled protesters. Hundreds of residents of Makhachkala witnessed this scene as it unfolded in the very heart of the city on September 25, just as Dagestan's capital celebrated its annual City Day. But this demonstration, which coincided with the 165th anniversary of the southern Russian city, was by no means the only anti-mobilization rally in the region. According to local journalists, smaller protests had erupted in some parts of the republic as early as September 22. Spontaneous rallies broke out near the village of Endirey in the Khasavyurt District, with local residents blocking the road. A demonstration took place in the regional center of Khasavyurt, and in Makhachkala itself civil disorder continued for two entire days. The protesters' motivations varied from town to town. In some places, like Endirey, people were outraged by the excessive number of draft notices per village. For example, in a community of 8,000 people, as many as 110 men were to be called up. In a display of indignation, people decided to block one of the republic's major transport corridors. In some areas, locals complained that the army was enlisting those who had literally just returned from regular military conscription. Most importantly, and perhaps typical of the overall mobilization effort in Russia, the republic's recruiting stations did not always adhere to official regulations and requirements. As a result, draft notices were sent to men who had not served in the army at all or had no combat experience. All demonstrations in the Republic of Dagestan were quickly suppressed by the security forces. Multiple people were arrested, with violence being used in some cases. At one point, police officers even fired warning shots into the air. Footage of the clashes spread quickly across the internet, making headlines in international media outlets. This was an unprecedented situation for a region normally loyal to the federal authorities. The most publicized developments unfolded in Makhachkala. Undeterred by the first crackdown, the protesters took to the streets on the following day. This time, the police took the initiative and mounted an even tougher response. The nature of the protest and the harsh response of the local law enforcement agencies prompted an urgent meeting of public figures and government representatives. Following the session, they moved to establish an independent public commission to monitor compliance with the presidential decree on partial mobilization. At the same time, the head of the Republic of Dagestan Sergey Melikov addressed the issue. ""If it’s a fact that people were mobilized who were not on the list – including students, fathers with multiple young children, folks who have never held a rifle in their life – it should be corrected immediately. I know that such mistakes were made at the very start of the mobilization."" Melikov criticized the staff of the recruiting stations for ""trying to draft as many people as possible instead of diligently selecting those who are actually fit to serve in the army."" He then promised to see to it personally that the situation is rectified. But that wasn't the end of the story in Dagestan. Sergey Melikov went on to direct some serious criticism to his staffers a few more times. One such occasion was filmed and posted online. The head of the republic’s fury was caused in particular by a video report that had gone viral on social media. The video in question originated from Derbent, Dagestan’s fourth largest city, whose history goes back six millennia. It showed a number of vehicles cruising the city and delivering a message via loudspeakers, calling on “all male residents to report to the local recruitment offices immediately.” Derbent’s administration tried to justify this move by saying their database lacked personal data for all residents entitled to the right to the mobilization waiver. Melikov called it “utter nonsense” as well as “fake information dissemination,” adding some swear words addressed to the organizers of this operation, a mode of speech generally unseen and unheard-of in Dagestan’s public discourse. “How was it even possible for Derbent’s recruitment authority to sanction its staffers to spread such a message? “All male residents of Derbent are to report to the local recruitment offices immediately.” What the *** is this, you idiots? Are you *** nitwits?!” Melikov was heard saying at the Regional Security Council meeting. After receiving such a brutal scolding, the chief recruitment officer apologized on camera and urged city residents “not to succumb to panic.” Prior to that, an official apology to the residents of Derbent was offered by the head of the republic himself. Only time will tell whether it will be enough to appease the people of Dagestan who have been inflamed by the sloppy actions of the local recruitment offices and administrations. The locals are convinced that it was a desire to just report the required recruitment numbers at any cost that led to the unrest. “It has always been this way, and will probably be like that forever. No one in the recruitment offices or administration does their job properly, and when they receive an order from the higher authorities, they just go on to pressure people into complying. I hope that the head of the republic and the president will fix this and punish those who are guilty [of enacting faulty mobilization practices],” Kurban, a local resident, told RT. He added that perhaps people would trust the local officials more if their own sons were among the first ones to join the action in the warzone. This opinion gets a lot of support among the local users of social media. The truth is that many officials and their family members, both from Dagestan as well from all over Russia, are already fighting in the operation. In Babayurt district, for example, an official working with the local recruitment office, Nelli Wolf, saw her son leaving for the frontlines in Ukraine. An MP of Dagestan’s parliament Rasim Gadzhigayev was among the first to join the special military operation. According to the Speaker of the Dagestani Parliament Zaur Askenderov, nine more MPs were served the summons to report for duty. In the town of Buynaksk, also in Dagestan, notices were served to all members of the city parliament. The former head of the neighboring republic of Ingushetia, Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, lost his nephew in the hostilities in Ukraine. The same is true for other Russian regions. The government of Samara Region reported recently that almost 300 officials and MPs there have been summoned to join the special military operation, among them staffers of local ministries and the governor’s administration. In Primorsky Region, according to Governor Oleg Kozhemyako, who has visited the special operation zone many times himself to support the troops, 150 of the region’s MPs and administration staffers have been summoned to join the operation. Among the new recruits who joined the troops on the ground are the children of founder of the private military company Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Republic of Crimea Sergey Aksyonov and dozens of other high-level Russian statesmen. However, this kind of information usually evades the attention of the online audience, which seems to be more likely to notice messages that assert the opposite. “What happened today in Makhachkala was a provocation by people outside Dagestan and opportunistic admins of local online communities paid by the West,” Kamil Saidov, Minister of Youth Affairs of Dagestan said. The President of Dagestan and the FSB believe that Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces (SSO) are behind these protests, which are organized through anonymous Telegram accounts. “We are quite certain that the channels which rallied people to disturb the public order in the region are under the control of the Center for Ideological and Psychological Operations of the Central Intelligence Office of the Special Operations Forces of Ukraine,” Sergey Melnikov said. Killnet hacker community members confirm this. They’ve analyzed financial transactions and circulation of information from the Dagestan Morning Telegram channel, which spearheaded the local riot. According to Killnet’s information, over five billion rubles (around $77.2 million) were pumped into the channel since March 2022. The current balance of the administration’s crypto wallet is around 8.5 million rubles (almost $130,000). The explanation for these figures, astronomical for a social media community, is simple – Dagestan Morning is just an entry point. Its message spread rapidly across other Telegram channels immediately after the first call to action was posted, just as planned. Moreover, it wasn’t only extremist Caucasian and radical Islamic communities that collaborated with Dagestan Morning. Reposting analysis has shown that messages appeared on Ukrainian Telegram channels as well: from Aleksandr Nevzorov, a Soviet and later Russian journalist and a fresh Ukrainian citizen, to Alexey Arestovich, an adviser to the President of Ukraine. But there’s more: the organizers of this informational diversion also reposted to the Belarusian Telegram network. Another argument for the contrived nature of the action is the speed and efficiency with which the anonymous admins spread their message. The first posts slamming the partial mobilization began to appear on Dagestanian channels as early as September 21, immediately after President Vladimir Putin and the Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu had addressed the nation. Simultaneously, information began to appear about the supposed plans to draft 13,000 people in the Republic. And the next day, local communities published the first calls for protest. By September 25, a critical level was achieved, which coincided with the first offline meeting. The protesters demanded the cancellation of the mobilization campaign, saying, among other things, that “too many of us have been drafted already!” –expressing the very same idea that appeared on social media earlier. The message gained traction immediately. The diagram below shows the detonation of the informational bomb, planted in advance, by Dagestan Morning at the perfect moment. The call appeared on many sleeper protest channels – online communities that stayed away from discussing public issues until September 24, posting instead Quran quotes and beautiful Dagestanian landscapes. Most likely, the Telegram channels had been bought in advance to reach the widest possible audience when the time came. Other outlets, which were created just days before the protests, got thousands of subscribers overnight, as major Dagestani channels promoted their ads. The same chart, however, shows that the media sensation was short-lived. Apparently sensing that something didn’t smell right, people started unsubscribing after September 26. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky’s address to protesting Dagestanis didn’t help either. In his typical manner of pompous gravitas, he condescendingly remarked that “they [Dagestanis] were beginning to understand [the situation].” He also promised that those residents of the republic who would take up arms against Ukraine would not make it back alive. On top of that, he urged Russian citizens to break the law. “Disobey this criminal mobilization. Run away. Or surrender to Ukrainian forces the moment you have a chance. I’m asking all our friends in the media sphere to help disseminate this appeal,” the Ukrainian president added. When it became clear that stoking unrest wouldn’t work, the administrators of Ukrainian channels inundated social media with fake posts. One of the most notable examples was a counterfeit document on “discontinuing the partial mobilization.” The idea must have been to make people angry about the mobilization, which was still ongoing in spite of the new “law,” yet it did not yield the desired result. Ukrainian special services have long been trying to destabilize Russian society and undermine the country’s leadership, mostly by targeting ethnic minorities and national republics within the country. The Ukrainian Center for Information and Psychological Operations has tried these tactics in Kabardino-Balkaria, Yakutia, Buryatia, and other regions. Experts believe there were good reasons for homing in on Dagestan this time. Talking to RT, Dmitry Zhuravlyov, director of the Institute for Regional Issues, said the republic is characterized by a high level of class inequality, and, given the traditional character of local communities, people are well aware of everyone’s sources of income. This makes ordinary citizens even more resentful towards those who cash in on their higher status. “There’s also the clan system, which you have to take into account, and which is no secret to anyone. These two factors make people anxious. They are scared for their relatives, and, at the same time, they worry that, while their loved ones are sent into the special military operation zone, the son, say, of a local deputy will stay home. Class inequality makes people resist the unknown. Officials don’t relate to people,” theexpert said. On top of that, some districts of Dagestan have long been a source of trouble. The notorious Babayurt District has been making headlines for over two decades due to ongoing land disputes between local residents and those who moved there from mountainous districts. Controversial Soviet-era economic and national policies led to fighting between ethnic groups and clans over fertile land, which is a scarce resource in Dagestan. The republic is home to over 40 ethnic groups, which are further subdivided into clans, different religious communities, and identities based on internal migration patterns between districts. The latter phenomenon somewhat resembles immigration in Germany or Israel, where each new wave of newcomers developed its own identity. All in all, there is fertile soil for stoking conflict, all you need is a good excuse. What keeps a significant proportion of Dagestanis together is horizontal connections and family and community ties, which is exactly what fueled the latest protests. Once you have all the ingredients in place, including the poor performance of local officials and military commissariats during the initial stages of the partial mobilization, the subversive work of the Ukrainian Center for Information and Psychological Operations, and the idiosyncratic nature of Dagestan’s traditional society, you end up with civil unrest at an unprecedented scale. Admittedly, Russian authorities have been faster and more efficient than usual in their response to these extraordinary protests. Russia’s rigid political system has demonstrated a flexibility which was previously unseen, except, perhaps, during the coronavirus crisis. Zur Askenderov, chairman of the People’s Assembly (the official name of Dagestan’s parliament), announced the creation of mobilization headquarters to handle mobilization-related issues quickly and to calm the public down. The republican government instructed local deputies to go to the cities and districts they represent to assist citizens who were called up for military duty. Additionally, regional hotlines were set up and a web resource was added to handle complaints. It appears that the period of local turbulence is over, although, going forward, any domestic weakness in Russia will undoubtedly be exploited by the country’s enemies on the outside, to deliver a critical blow to its social equilibrium.",2.858039613952521,3.41024690115875,-0.5522072872062291,6
2022-10-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/564688-russia-drone-production-medvedev/,Russia to crank up drone production – Medvedev,"Russia needs to ramp up the production of various types of drones after they have demonstrated their combat effectiveness in the ongoing military conflict between Moscow and Kiev, the Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev has said. Writing on his Telegram channel on Friday, Medvedev, who previously served as the country's president, said that “UAVs have proven their effectiveness in modern conflicts. Their use in the special military operation zone is an urgent need.” He went on to state that Russia has yet to establish large-scale production of various types of drones. Medvedev also said had recently visited the St. Petersburg “Special Technological Center” to conduct an inspection of the supply of ‘Orlan’ reconnaissance drones ordered by the Russian government. Russia’s use of drones as well as this week’s massive missile strikes on targets across Ukraine have prompted the Kiev government to reiterate their demands that Western countries must supply the Ukrainian military with more anti-aircraft weapons. “Our ability to close the skies is not sufficient,” President Vladimir Zelensky told the Parliament Assembly of the Council of Europe on Thursday, insisting Ukraine only has “10% of what we need” and he “would like” to receive “many times” more anti-aircraft defense systems from the West. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics, which have since become a part of Russia, as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-10-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/564692-belgorod-shelling-electricity/,Power plant attacked in Russian city near Ukrainian border,"A missile struck a power station in the Russian city of Belgorod, not far from the Ukrainian border, on Friday evening. The attack has caused a major blaze at the site. The local governor blamed Kiev, which was presumably seeking retribution for Russian strikes earlier this week. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported that the Ukrainian military struck an electrical substation. If confirmed, this will be the first blow inflicted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on an energy facility in a major Russian town since the massive Russian attack on Ukrainian cities. Photos and videos published on social media show large tongues of fire rising around the power station and clouds of thick black smoke. One video in particular showed the very moment a shell hit the facility, causing a major explosion, though the extent of the damage is not yet clear. The power station had a capacity of 110 kW, according to the Belgorod region’s governor, who added that the fire was promptly extinguished. Local emergency services are now rerouting the energy supply, Gladkov said, advising that it's expected to be restored in about four hours. Local water-supply systems have not been affected, since they used backup power sources, he added. Earlier on Friday, residents in at least one of Belgorod City's districts reported a blackout. Locals also spoke hearing powerful explosions. The incidents came a day after an apartment block in the city was hit during Ukrainian shelling. No casualties were reported. The Belgorod region has repeatedly come under shelling and drone attacks by Ukrainian forces since the outbreak of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev in late February.",4.834324188104114,4.961974303434212,-0.1276501153300975,0
2022-10-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/564687-putin-no-more-massive-strikes/,Putin rules out further major strikes on Ukraine for now,"There is currently no need for additional large-scale missile strikes on Ukrainian targets, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. During a press conference in Astana, Kazakhstan, he explained that the Russian military is now pursuing other objectives, as only seven of some 29 targets designated by Russia’s Defense Ministry were not hit in a bombardment earlier this week. “But these objects are being finished off gradually. There is no need for major strikes, at least for now,” Putin said. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s Energy Minister German Galushchenko revealed that about 30% of the country’s energy facilities were damaged in two consecutive days of Russian strikes, according to CNN. Putin said Moscow does not have the intention of destroying Ukraine as a country, and the current situation is a response to hostile actions taken by Kiev. He explained that if Ukraine had not blocked the water supply to the nearly two and a half million people living in Crimea, Russian forces would not have had to enter the country to open it back up. “If they hadn’t done this, there wouldn’t have been other counteractions,” the President noted, adding that the recent attack on the Crimea Bridge is now also forcing Moscow to “think ten times” about how important it is for Russia to establish a link with Crimea across Ukrainian territory. Asked whether or not he regretted the decision to launch a military offensive against Ukraine, Putin stressed that “everything that is happening today is unpleasant, to put it mildly.” Nonetheless, the Russian leader insisted that “all of this would have happened a little later, but only in worse conditions for us,” arguing that Moscow’s actions were timely and correct. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

Lukashenko did not reveal where exactly the troops are to be deployed. Neither did he reveal the total strength of the “allied force.” Its Belarusian “core” would include “some 70,000 soldiers,” the president said. He added, though, that one should hardly expect a large Russian contingent to be sent to serve on Belarusian soil amid a protracted conflict between Moscow and Kiev. One should not reasonably expect Moscow to send “10,000-15,000 soldiers” to Belarus, Lukashenko said, hinting that the Russian part of the allied force might be smaller. Earlier this week, he announced that an allied force could be deployed to Belarus’ western borders, citing a potential threat from NATO and Belarus’ western neighbors. At that time, he also said that the strength of the Russian military contingent in Belarus might amount to “several thousands” of soldiers. In early October, Lukashenko explained his nation’s role in Moscow’s conflict with Kiev. Minsk’s participation in the conflict is limited to self-defense and to having Russia’s back, he said at that time. On Friday, the Belarusian president also said that the nation’s troops would prevent Ukraine from any attempts to attack Russia through Belarusian territory. “If we are dragged [into the conflict], we will be able to hold out. We will defend this operations line,” Lukashenko said. The president’s words also came as Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei told Russia’s Izvestia newspaper that the nation’s security forces were put on high alert and were ready “to respond to any threats that may arise from neighboring countries.” According to Makei, “some neighboring countries were planning provocations, as far as involving the seizure of certain areas of the Belarusian territory.” Officials in Minsk had earlier accused Kiev of blowing up bridges and amassing tens of thousands of troops along the Ukraine-Belarus border. Lukashenko claimed then that Ukraine was “not just discussing but … planning” an attack on Belarusian territory. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky rejected the accusations and in turn claimed that Minsk’s statements were a cover-up for a potential offensive by Belarus. He also called on the G7 countries to send “international observers” to the border between the two nations.",2.565352208177013,2.981119654896138,-0.415767446719125,8
2022-10-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/564678-putin-threat-istanbul-grain-deal/,Putin reveals fresh threat to Istanbul grain deal,"Ukraine apparently transported the explosives used in last week’s attack on the Crimean Bridge by sea, Russian President Vladimir Putin told journalists on Friday, citing a report by the Federal Security Service (FSB). If it is proven that carriers operating in the Black Sea under the Istanbul grain deal were involved, it would have dire consequences for the agreement, he warned. Earlier this week, the FSB revealed that explosives disguised as a 22-ton shipment of plastic construction sheeting arrived at the Bulgarian Danube port of Ruse from Ukraine’s port of Odessa by sea. “It is not yet clear if grain carriers were involved,” Putin said at a press conference in the Kazakh capital of Astana. If it turns out that humanitarian corridors [used] for grain shipments to the poorest nations… are used for terrorist attacks, it would put the very existence of these corridors in question. The president admitted that Russia still does not have any solid evidence confirming that Ukraine may be using grain exports for such activities. However, he warned that the response would be swift and tough if this is the case. “There will be a simple answer: We will shut down [the grain export corridors] and there is an end to it,” Putin warned, adding that Moscow would look for rock-solid proof first. The breakthrough deal to unlock exports of Ukrainian and Russian grain was reached in Istanbul in July with mediation by the UN and Türkiye. The two countries are among the world’s leading grain exporters, but trade had come to a halt due to the protracted conflict between the neighboring countries. On Friday, Russia also warned that it may still quit the deal if obstacles to its own food and fertilizer exports are not removed. Moscow has been complaining for months that restrictions on its food and fertilizer exports linked to international sanctions have not been lifted, even after it granted passage to Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. The truck explosion on the Crimean Bridge killed at least four people and led to a partial collapse of the highway bridge section. Russia declared the attack a terrorist act and blamed the Ukrainian security services. The Russian security services also detained a total of eight suspects, including Russians, Armenians and Ukrainians, in connection with the attack.",2.6969781726895063,2.6930143595282976,0.003963813161208751,7

Speaking to NBC News on the sidelines of the Central Asia – Russia summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, the Belarusian leader was asked to comment on whether Moscow could resort to the nuclear option in the conflict with Kiev. Lukashenko categorically dismissed the notion. “The Russian leadership, including President Putin, has never set an objective of using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. There is no such need,"" he noted. Lukashenko went on to say that the “most important thing” is to “not back your opponent into a corner,” urging the West not to cross Russia’s “red lines.” He also offered a reminder that Moscow had made it clear that it could resort to using “all means necessary” to defend itself if Russian territory was attacked. According to the Belarusian leader, Russia has other weapons powerful enough that it does not need to use nukes in Ukraine. He pointed to recent Russian strikes on Kiev’s military and energy infrastructure, which he said came in response to last week’s deadly attack on the strategically important Crimean Bridge. “Russia possesses, and that I know for sure, the most modern types of weapons. There is no need for nuclear weapons,"" Lukashenko said, adding that nuclear war should not be discussed “under any circumstances.” “Even if one nation uses nuclear weapons, this would be the end of our planet. It will cause a chain reaction,” he said, adding that Russia understands that very well. Lukashenko’s comments come after Putin signaled last month that Moscow would use “all means” necessary to defend Russia and its people if its territorial integrity is threatened. He also noted that those who use nuclear blackmail against Russia “should know that the wind rose can turn around.” The Kremlin has also repeatedly warned that an atomic war should never be fought. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu in August made it clear that Moscow is not considering a nuclear strike on Ukraine, given that there are no targets warranting such drastic measures.",2.4571407844860267,2.512295751883035,-0.0551549673970082,8

According to local media, Huang Shih-chieh made the announcement at the inauguration ceremony of the Taiwan-Ukraine Parliament Members’ Friendship Association earlier this week. Huang Shih-chieh said he expects Yulia Klimenko, the former Ukrainian deputy minister of economic development and trade, along with some other MPs, to take part in the 11th Global Assembly of the World Movement for Democracy (WMD). The event will be held in Taipei on October 25–27. Taking to Facebook to celebrate the launch of the association, Huang Shih-chieh expressed his gratitude to Ukrainian colleagues “who are not afraid of the Chinese threat and continue to expand bilateral relations.” Mainland China, which views Taiwan as part of its territory, considers visits by high-ranking foreign officials to the island, as well as any change of status in Taipei’s relations to foreign nations, as an infringement of its sovereignty. Meanwhile, Klimenko, who was speaking at the ceremony via video link, thanked Taipei for supporting Kiev and, according to the local media reports, drew a comparison between her country, which is now battling against Russian troops, and Taiwan. “Ukraine is physically resisting attacks and fighting, while Taiwan is fighting politically,” she claimed as cited by the media. The island’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Joanne Ou, when asked about the visit of the Ukrainian delegation, said that any announcements on the matter would be made in due course. The last few months have seen a string of foreign officials provoking Beijing’s discontent by visiting Taiwan. In particular, a high-profile trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taipei in August caused tensions to flare between Beijing and Washington, prompting large-scale Chinese military drills near the island. Taiwan, which officially refers to itself as the ‘Republic of China,’ has been self-governed since 1949, but has never been recognized as an independent state by the mainland.",2.769643927770516,2.534590442489474,0.23505348528104175,3
2022-10-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/564672-putin-peace-talks-troops/,Putin explains absence of peace talks with Ukraine,"Ukraine refuses to engage in peace talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin told journalists on Friday, when asked about possible negotiations to end the conflict between the two countries. The Kiev government “had been saying that they wanted talks and ostensibly asked for them, but now they issued a formal decision that prohibits them,” he said during a press conference in Astana, Kazakhstan. Earlier this month, Zelensky signed a decree forbidding any negotiations with Putin, saying Ukraine will only talk to Russia when it has a different president. Speaking to journalists on Friday, Putin remarked that mediation by nations including Türkey between Moscow and Kiev may be required, if Ukraine’s position changes. Putin recalled that Russia and Ukraine reached a preliminary agreement which could have the halted hostilities, during Turkey-mediated talks in late March. “Those agreements were almost initialled. But as soon as the troops were pulled back from Kiev, the leadership in Kiev lost all desire to have talks,” he remarked. The Russian Defense Ministry announced a withdrawal of troops from around the Ukrainian capital after news broke that the negotiators in Istanbul had agreed on a draft treaty. Under its terms, Ukraine would have pledged to maintain a neutral status and prohibit foreign troops and military installations on its soil, in exchange for security guarantees from foreign nations, including Russia. Days later, President Vladimir Zelensky accused Russian troops of committing war crimes, claiming that evidence was discovered in Bucha, one of the towns near Kiev that the Russian army had withdrawn from. He declared that the Ukrainian people would not allow him to negotiate with Russia after the discovery. Moscow claimed that the evidence was fabricated to justify breaking off the talks. According to Russian diplomats, Moscow wrote up a formal peace agreement based on Ukrainian proposals and sent it to Kiev, but received no reply. According to Ukrainian media reports in May, Zelensky was pressured into breaking off negotiations with Russia by Boris Johnson, then-prime minister of Britain. Johnson arrived in Kiev, “almost without warning” on April 9. He allegedly told the Ukrainian leader that Western nations would refuse to sign up to the security guarantees that Kiev wanted to receive under the proposed peace treaty. President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that his only goal in the conflict is to defeat Russia on the battlefield and retake control of all territories that Kiev claims to be under its sovereignty.",2.829978361501979,3.3268125206349324,-0.49683415913295326,8

The CEO of SpaceX confirmed the connection on Friday. He responded to a correspondent from the Kyiv Post, who shared news about the company’s demand that the Pentagon foot Ukraine’s growing bill and noted how Melnik insulted Musk recently. “We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk tweeted, adding a ‘man shrugging’ emoji. Melnik lashed out at Musk on Twitter last week, after the US billionaire floated a Ukraine-Russia peace plan that involved Ukraine ceding some territory and adopting a neutral status. Many Ukrainian officials rejected the proposal with anger. Melnik said his message to Musk was a “very diplomatic reply.” We’re just following his recommendation 🤷‍♂️ Days later, Ukrainian troops reportedly started having issues with access to the Starlink system, with the Financial Times describing “panicked calls from soldiers to helplines.” Musk claimed that his company had provided a free service to Ukraine to the tune of $80 million. On Thursday, CNN published a letter, which it said SpaceX had sent to the Pentagon in September, demanding that it cover the cost of operating the system in Ukraine. The company is no longer “in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” the document was quoted as saying. Supporters of Ukraine credit Musk’s satellite-based internet system with providing communications for the Ukrainian government. The man himself claimed that Russia had tried and failed to disable Starlink terminals in Ukraine on multiple occasions, which Moscow denied. Melnik, the top Ukrainian diplomat at the center of the controversy, has a long record of insulting various public figures, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. During his tenure in Berlin, he called the German leader an “offended liverwurst” after Scholz took issue with Kiev’s refusal to host a proposed visit by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Friday marks the last day of Melnik’s posting at the embassy in Berlin. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky relieved Melnik of his position in July, but it took months for his replacement to be appointed. The diplomat was recalled after an interview, in which he denied ethnic cleansing of Poles and Jews by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II. Among the latest targets of Melnik’s tirades were German politicians, who questioned why the diplomat’s 20-year-old son was studying in Berlin instead of going to the frontline with Russia.",4.263009109724992,5.20884679821625,-0.9458376884912578,5

He invited the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to meet in Moscow to discuss the differences between their nations.

It’s an effort by Russia to destabilize. It wants to create disorder in the Caucasus to destabilize all of us,” Macron told France 2 television on Wednesday. Nagorno-Karabakh has long been a flashpoint of ethnic tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Baku claims sovereignty over the entire territory of former Soviet Azerbaijan, including Nagorno-Karabakh, which had an autonomous status within it. The region’s population was predominantly Armenian and sought to become part of Soviet Armenia in the late 1980s, provoking accusations of separatism from Baku. The tensions escalated into an open war in the early 1990s, after which Nagorno-Karabakh remained self-governed, with Yerevan’s informal backing. France and Russia, along with the US, co-chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) Minsk Group, was created in 1992 to mediate the conflict. Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a 44-day war over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020, which ended with a Russian-brokered truce and the ceding of some territories to Baku. Last month, they had deadly skirmishes elsewhere on their border. Russia keeps a peacekeeping military mission assigned to Nagorno-Karabakh. Amid the tensions, top US officials offered to help Armenia, claiming that Washington could provide it with security, unlike Moscow.

2022-10-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/564642-azov-delegation-stanford-university/,Russia reacts to Azov neo-Nazi’s platform at prestigious US university,"Russia’s ambassador to the US has rebuked the prestigious Stanford University for hosting an event which featured fighters from the controversial Ukrainian Azov Battalion, a unit in which some members openly espouse neo-Nazi ideology. “It would appear that in its maniacal drive to tarnish and cancel Russia, the US is prepared to glorify Nazism,” Anatoly Antonov told the media on Thursday. On October 1, the university hosted several Azov representatives, including two former POWs recently released by Russia, according to images posted on social media and media reports. Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia and a vocal critic of Moscow, was also in attendance. The Stanford Daily, the university’s student-run newspaper, claimed that Azov’s far-right connections were “historic” and based on online allegations. It also repeated claims by one of the guests, co-founder Giorgi Kuparashvili, that the group’s insignia is not derived from the Nazi Wolfsangel symbol but rather spells ‘N’ and ‘I’ for “national idea.” The regiment has been rebranding over the years. In 2015, it phased out another Nazi symbol, the Black Sun, from its official logo, and is now reportedly in the process of replacing the Wolfsangel with three sword on patches. Members of the group, including military service members, have a well-documented record of far-right ideology and links to similar-minded organizations around the world. Stanford University’s own Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISC) describes the Ukrainian organization as “a far-right nationalist network of military, paramilitary, and political organizations.” It says it is known for the “recruitment of far-right foreign fighters from the US, Russia, and Europe, as well as extensive transnational ties with other far-right organizations.” The appearance at one of the most prestigious schools was just one of many stops of the group’s members in the US lately. A description of one of the previous events held in New Jersey said the organizers wanted to “dispel the Russian agitprop that the Azov regiment is Nazi” and raise funds for them. The term “neo-Nazi” was previously applied to the Ukrainian group by major Western news outlets, such as the New York Times.",3.1860313310797337,4.325901860618205,-1.1398705295384715,5

Commenting on what he called “an intensive week of consultations” with Moscow and Kiev, the IAEA chief wrote in his Twitter that the sides are “moving closer to the establishment of a protection zone for Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant.” He went on to say that the situation at the plant is “untenable” and that all the negotiating parties “need immediate action to protect it.” Arriving in Poland on the night train from #Ukraine after an intensive week of consultations with 🇷🇺 & 🇺🇦. Moving closer to the establishment of a protection zone for #Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant—the plant's situation is untenable and we need immediate action to protect it. pic.twitter.com/AcpFJ9pIO3 The statement comes in a week when Grossi met with Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry Dmitry Kuleba as well as Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the safety at the Zaporozhye NPP, which has been under Russian control since March. Putin said that Moscow was open to discussing all issues related to the plant’s operations, although he warned against a “dangerous politicization of everything related to nuclear activity.” The meeting took place after the Russian leader last week ordered that daily operations at the facility be transferred to a subsidiary of Russian nuclear company Rosatom. The move was meant to reflect the new status of Zaporozhye Region, which, along with three other former Ukrainian territories, voted overwhelmingly to join Russia during a referendum in late September. At the same time, Grossi made it clear that “the IAEA cannot recognize the annexation” of the plant. The UN agency has repeatedly called for making the NPP a kind of “sanctuary” amid the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, given that attacks on the facility could trigger a nuclear accident. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shelling Zaporozhye NPP, while Kiev attempted to pin the blame on Moscow. In early September, an IAEA delegation headed by Grossi himself visited the plant, the largest in Europe, to examine damage to the facility, assess the situation on the ground and establish a permanent presence there. However, at the time the IAEA stopped short of identifying the culprits behind the attacks on the plant, even though Ukraine’s military had previously admitted conducting strikes near it.",6.154837731849321,3.6014626028839936,2.5533751289653277,9

As of Friday morning, there were no official public announcements about the move from the security services. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko revealed on Monday that he had ordered the State Security Committee of Belarus (KGB) to conduct “necessary measures of a counter-terrorist nature,” but did not announce any changes to the nationwide threat level. “There was information that some neighboring countries were planning provocations, as far as involving the seizure of certain areas of the Belarusian territory,” Makei explained, adding that “no such signal should be left without an adequate response,” and thus the country's security forces are now ready “to respond to any threats that may arise from neighboring countries.” Lukashenko declared this week that Belarus would form a joint security force with Russia in response to “aggravation” from Ukraine and the West. With officials in Minsk accusing Ukraine of blowing up bridges and amassing tens of thousands of troops along the Ukraine-Belarus border, Lukashenko claimed that “Kiev is not just discussing, but is planning an attack on the territory of Belarus” at the behest of its Western backers. While Belarus allowed Russian troops to use its territory at the beginning of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, Lukashenko reiterated last week that his country’s role in the conflict is limited to self-defense and denying Ukraine the ability to “shoot Russians in the back from the territory of Belarus.” Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky rejected the accusations, and in turn claimed that the warnings are actually cover for a possible offensive by Minsk, urging G7 leaders on Tuesday to send “international observers” to his country’s border with Belarus.",2.822884366784389,2.7412985985067952,0.08158576827759356,8

The attack has sparked a major fire at the depot, prompting secondary detonations of ammunition, he added. The shelling prompted an evacuation of a nearby village, Gladkov said, adding that emergency services and local officials have been dispatched to the scene. According to preliminary information, the attack caused no deaths or injuries. Footage circulating online shows a major fire, with explosions heard in the background. The fire sent a large cloud of smoke into the skies above the now-destroyed depot. Earlier in the day, a residential building was damaged during the Ukrainian shelling of Belgorod City itself. An identified object, believed to be debris of a Ukrainian projectile or drone, intercepted by Russian air defenses, crashed into the building, damaging its roof and upper floor. Belgorod is among Russia’s border regions that have repeatedly come under Ukrainian shelling and drone attacks amid the ongoing conflict. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics, which have since joined the Russian Federation, as independent states, and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

The attacks were carried out in the “Nikolayev-Krivoy Rog axis,” the military said, apparently referring to combat ongoing in the new Russian region of Kherson, where Kiev forces continue their attempts to dislodge the country’s military from their positions. The video was shared by the military on Thursday, and incorporates footage captured by kamikaze drones and surveillance UAVs that were observing the strikes. The video shows direct hits on Ukrainian tanks, self propelled-artillery pieces, a US-made HMMWV armored car, and an unmarked civilian car used by a group of soldiers. “As a result of the use of the UAVs, several tanks, self-propelled artillery pieces and wheeled vehicles, including those supplied by NATO countries, were destroyed,” the ministry said in a statement. While the military did not explicitly identify the munitions used during the strikes, footage suggests it was an upgraded version of a Lancet kamikaze drone. Developed by the subsidiary of the Kalashnikov concern, Zala Aero, the drone packs a 5kg warhead and is capable of staying in the air for over an hour. Unlike the earlier version of Lancet, the upgraded drone has larger front and smaller tail wings, while the former had two symmetrical X-shaped wings.",4.634508840586789,2.496725477827589,2.1377833627592,0

This was “a result of the negotiation process on the exchange,” the military explained. “All the released servicemen are being provided with the necessary psychological and medical assistance,” the ministry said, adding that they would shortly be delivered to “medical institutions for treatment and rehabilitation.” Meanwhile, Kiev confirmed the latest prisoner swap, saying its soldiers had been freed on Thursday. “Our people are returning home... 20 people were released from captivity,” the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak, wrote on his Telegram channel. Among them, “14 servicemen of the Armed Forces, [four] territorial defense fighters, one National Guard officer and one naval serviceman,” he added. In a previous exchange, which occurred in late September, 55 Russian and Donbass soldiers were freed. The then head of Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Kiev released Ukrainian opposition leader Viktor Medvedchuk as part of the swap. The Ukrainian authorities charged Medvedchuk with treason last year and banned his party, Opposition Platform – For Life, after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. According to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, 215 Ukrainian soldiers were returned to their home country in the swap.

2022-10-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/564605-ukraine-zelensky-air-defense/,Zelensky demands more anti-aircraft defenses from the West,"President Vladimir Zelensky has urged the West to supply more anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, insisting that his country currently has only 10% of what it needs. Zelensky made the remarks as he addressed a session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on Thursday via videolink. “Our ability to close the skies is not sufficient,” Zelensky told the transnational body, adding that the country “would like” to receive “many times” more anti-aircraft defense systems from the West. There is nothing to add – we have 10% of what we need. Zelensky urged the PACE members to spread pro-Ukrainian sentiments wherever they could and advocate deliveries of anti-aircraft defenses to the country. “I ask you at all levels, in politics, in the media, in communication with voters, to back the supply of sufficient air and missile defense systems to Ukraine,” he said. Zelensky’s plea follows massive missile strikes launched by Russia against Ukraine’s critical infrastructure earlier this week. The strikes came in response to an explosion on the Crimean Bridge over the weekend. Moscow has squarely blamed Kiev for the bridge incident, explicitly branding the blast a “terrorist attack” against the country. The massive missile barrage has been widely condemned by Ukraine’s Western backers, with several countries already pledging to deliver additional anti-aircraft systems and munitions to prop up Kiev in its fight against Moscow. Russia has repeatedly warned the West against “pumping” Ukraine with weaponry, stating that such activities would only prolong the conflict.

The diplomat noted that Moscow is, however, still open to dialogue, but that no “sensible” offers have so far been forthcoming from Washington. In an interview with Russia’s Rossiya 24 news channel aired on Thursday, Lavrov was asked whether he thought Biden’s reluctance to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin would further complicate tensions in the international arena. “It doesn’t complicate [it] at all, because the state of affairs as it stands today has already been driven, first of all by the US, to such a condition that it can’t get any worse, in my opinion,” the Russian minister replied. The diplomat pointed out at the same time that Moscow is not shunning dialogue with Washington. According to Lavrov, Russia has “never rejected a single earnest, sensible offer to hold contacts.” However, “no one is putting forth sensible initiatives,” he added. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that president Biden “has no intention of meeting with President Putin.” The statement echoed a remark made by the US head of state to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday. “Look, I have no intention of meeting with him,” Biden said, when asked about his plans for the upcoming G20 summit in Bali. The US president went on to add, however, that “if [Putin] came to me at the G20 and said ‘I want to talk about the release of Griner,’ I’d meet with him. I mean, it would depend.” Brittney Griner is America’s Women’s National Basketball Association star and Olympic gold medalist who was detained at a Moscow airport in February and later sentenced to nine years in prison by a Russian court on drug-possession charges. Presidents Biden and Putin have not spoken to each other directly since before Russia launched its military campaign against Ukraine in late February.

2022-10-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/564610-kuleba-prank-callers-crimea-bridge/,"Ukraine behind attacks on Russian regions, FM admits to prank callers","Ukraine's Foreign Minister has admitted that Kiev is behind sabotage operations in Russia, many of which which have killed innocent civilians. Dmitry Kuleba was speaking with a person he believed to be a former American ambassador to Moscow, according to Russian pranksters with a history of targetting senior political figures. “Well, if you were to ask me who blows up things in Crimea or Belgorod, then speaking privately, as much privacy we can have in a Zoom call, I’d tell you, yes, that was us,” the top Ukrainian diplomat was shown saying in footage, which was released on Thursday. The apparent admission was obtained by two Russian entertainers who go by the stage names Vovan and Lexus. They usually pose as foreign officials and trick their target into saying things that he or she would probably not want the public to hear. During the conversation with Kuleba, the duo posed as Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia and a vocal critic of Moscow. Among other things, McFaul is involved in an advisory group that helps Kiev ensure continued support from Western governments. The prank involved the fake former-diplomat asking Kuleba about Ukrainian intelligence agents, whom he assumed to be active in Russia. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called Kuleba’s words an admission of criminality by the Ukrainian state. Kiev’s top diplomat “confessed to committing terrorism. And in such a way – ‘yes, that’s us.’ Not just the special services or individual saboteurs. The government, the state,” she said on social media. The pranksters did not reveal the date of the conversation, but they discussed remarks that Zakharova made on September 1st and Kuleba’s travel plans for October, placing it sometime last month. When discussing with ‘McFaul’ Crimea’s significance in Russia’s military operation against Ukraine, Kuleba called the region a “source of ammo” for Russian troops and “an air base for their warplanes.” Destroying military sites in Crimea “has a direct impact” on the effectiveness of the Russian forces, he said. But the peninsula “is not the immediate operative target” for the Ukrainian military, he noted. The foreign minister was also skeptical about engaging with nations in Africa in the context of Kiev’s conflict with Moscow. “All of a sudden, our friends and partners, the US, the Europeans started a few months ago saying that working with Africa was super important, so that Africa was on our side,” he said. Kuleba claimed that some African countries “have taken either an openly strictly pro-Russian position or a strictly neutral position. Those cannot be swayed, no matter how much time you spend.” He added that chasing the support of African leaders would motivate them “to profit from” the conflict in Ukraine rather than to take a position “based on facts.” The minister reiterated Kiev’s calls for increased economic sanctions on Moscow, suggesting that the US and its allies impose restrictions on the Russian civilian nuclear industry. Kuleba urged for more weapons supplies, specifically asking for US-made Patriot long-range anti-aircraft missiles. He also discussed Kiev’s financial situation and how the government hoped that the IMF would provide more loans so that it could operate in the coming year.",2.946039248995628,2.4268032520289053,0.5192359969667226,8

The saboteurs have been caught, and several people have been arrested. They wanted to blow it up. On our territory, on soil,” Dmitry Peskov said. Peskov’s remarks follow Moscow’s proposal to turn Türkiye into a hub for Russian gas, re-exporting it to European consumers. He was speaking on the sidelines of an international summit in Astana, Kazakhstan. The EU was now deprived of the means to receive Russian gas, even if it were to request it, after September's “terrorist attacks” that damaged three out of four strings of the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea, he explained. The Kremlin spokesman stressed that the pipeline to Türkiye was the only “fully functional, fully loaded and working as clockwork route” for Russian gas to EU countries. Ankara could develop its gas infrastructure further to increase its re-export capacity, he suggested, claiming that the Turkish leadership was interested in the proposal. President Vladimir Putin “hinted about the origins of certain forces” that were behind an attack on TurkStream, Peskov added, without providing details on which incident he was referring to. On Wednesday, the Russian president appeared to accuse Washington of having a hand in the sabotage of Nord Stream, saying the beneficiary was the party that “can now force liquefied natural gas from the US on to European countries on a much larger scale.” In the same speech, he voiced the idea of a Turkish gas hub. On Monday, Putin accused Kiev of launching a number of sabotage plots targeting Russian energy infrastructure, including the TurkStream pipeline. In mid-September, Russia’s FSB security agency reported capturing a Ukrainian agent and several accomplices, who allegedly plotted to plant a bomb at a facility through which Russian natural gas is exported to Türkiye.

Moscow’s “response to terrorist acts by the Kiev regime” saw 70 facilities of Ukrainian energy infrastructure hit, which resulted in the country losing 50% of its generating capacity, Volodin wrote on Telegram on Thursday. The accompanying map shows that only three Ukrainian regions – Chernigov in the north, and Volyn and Transcarpathia in the west – were unaffected by the strikes. “If the terrorist attacks continue, the response will be even harsher,” he warned, adding all who organized Ukrainian attacks must be found, and “those who resist will be destroyed.” Moscow fired dozens of missiles at targets in Ukraine on Monday and Tuesday, calling it retaliation for sabotage plots by Kiev targeting crucial Russian facilities, including the Kursk nuclear power plant, the TurkStream gas pipeline and the Crimean Bridge. In the wake of Saturday’s truck bombing of the 18 kilometer bridge, President Vladimir Putin said Kiev’s “terrorist tactics” can no longer go unanswered and a missile strike wave was launched.

Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to a two-month civilian EU mission last week, following talks between Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. The mission is expected to help delineate the disputed border between the two rival post-Soviet states. “There was an agreement by Armenia to facilitate a civilian EU mission alongside the border with Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan agreed to cooperate with this mission as far as it is concerned,” the European Council said on Friday. The Council said the mission aims to “build confidence” and “contribute to the border commissions” to be dispatched onto the frontier later this month. After gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan ended up locked in a decades-long conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, situated in Muslim-majority Azerbaijan but mostly populated by ethnic Christian Armenians. The region broke away from Baku in the early 1990s and remained an internationally unrecognized entity ever since. It de jure remains under Baku’s control. The territorial dispute has repeatedly prompted flare-ups between Armenia and Azerbaijan, culminating in a full-blown war in 2022, which lasted for 44 days and ended with a Russian-brokered ceasefire.

Ionafan is the metropolitan bishop of the Tulchin diocese in Vinnitsa Region, subordinate to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), which declared independence and autocephaly from the Moscow Patriarchate earlier this year following the outbreak of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “The metropolitan on his own internet resource posted publications containing calls for inciting interfaith hatred. The expertise commissioned by the SBU confirmed the illegal nature of the suspect’s actions,” the security service said in a statement. The SBU claimed it had seized incriminating materials, including various “printed pro-Russian content and propaganda literature.” Imagery released by the SBU shows assorted leaflets, including one reading “Donbass is Russia,” credit cards issued by the country’s SberBank, as well as a portrait of Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. A pre-trial probe into the bishop’s alleged activities has been launched. So far, however, Ionafan has not been detained by the Ukrainian authorities. The priest has firmly rejected the allegations raised by the SBU, claiming that the raid was part of efforts to seize a local cathedral from the UOC. Moreover, the metropolitan implied the “evidence” recovered during the raid of his home had been planted. “I believe that the aforementioned actions are deliberate and directed against the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as a whole and against the authority of the Tulchin diocese hierarchs and sowing confusion among its clergy and believers. And in the future, the capture of its Tulchinsky Christ-Nativity Cathedral in favor of a ‘privileged’ religious organization,” Ionafan said in a statement. While the cleric did not name the “organization” explicitly, he was apparently referring to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), a breakaway entity established with active help from the country’s authorities and then-president Petro Poroshenko. Ukraine has long experienced religious tensions, with multiple unrecognized entities claiming to be the true Ukrainian Orthodox Church and challenging the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate. Poroshenko’s efforts, however, caused an open schism within the Ukrainian Orthodox community back in 2018. The rivalry between different churches was further aggravated by the ongoing conflict, with the UOC declaring its autocephaly from the Moscow Patriarchate back in May.",4.217733366979937,3.4283819302747043,0.7893514367052328,4

IRIS-Ts from [Germany] are already here.” The minister noted that Kiev needs more weapons of this kind, arguing that protecting the sky over Ukraine against the “terrorist state” of Russia is a “moral imperative.” Several hours later, Germany’s defense ministry posted a tweet of its own, stressing that Berlin had kept its word and announced that the “first IRIS-T SLM air defence system has arrived in #Ukraine.” In a follow-up message, ministry officials quoted their boss Christine Lambrecht as hailing the shipment as “very important support to Ukraine in its fight against missile shelling, against terror.” A new era of air defence has begun in 🇺🇦. IRIS-Ts from 🇩🇪 are already here. 🇺🇸 NASAMS are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more. No doubt that russia is a terrorist state.There is a moral imperative to protect the sky over 🇺🇦 in order to save our people. pic.twitter.com/jvbXUwDjc8 Der Spiegel media outlet reported on the delivery already on Tuesday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made the original pledge back in June, with the shipment initially slated for November. A total of four units made up of a command vehicle, a radar vehicle, and a truck-mounted launcher are scheduled to arrive in Ukraine some time in 2023. According to media reports, Kiev requested at least a dozen of these ultra-modern air defense systems and offered to purchase them directly from the manufacturer, Diehl Defense. ""State-of-the-art IRIS-T SLM has been delivered from Germany to #Ukraine! Very important support to Ukraine in its fight against missile shelling, against terror,"" said Defence Minister Lambrecht at the Ramstein meeting before the #NATO defence ministerial in #Brussels Der Spiegel claimed the three units promised by Berlin have not even been manufactured yet, however. Meanwhile, Germany’s own military has not received a single unit of the ground-based IRIS-T system variant yet. This underlines concerns voiced by some German politicians and media outlets that Berlin is seriously depleting its own weapons stockpiles by supplying the hardware to Kiev. Meanwhile, Ukraine had until recently consistently lambasted Germany over its perceived unwillingness to provide heavy weaponry. With an effective range believed to be up to 40km (25 miles), the air defense system is rather expensive, according to former Ukrainian ambassador to Germany Andrey Melnik. Speaking to Wirtschaftswoche magazine back in June, the diplomat estimated that one such unit could cost some €140 million ($135.4 million).",2.4948072999570714,1.6962301587083848,0.7985771412486866,7
2022-10-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/564553-pushkin-statue-demolished-kiev/,Pushkin monument demolished in Kiev,"A monument in the center of Kiev to the iconic 19th-century Russian poet Alexander Pushkin was demolished on Tuesday, according to co-founder of the “Decommunization. Ukraine” project Vadim Pozdnyakov. The move comes as Ukrainian authorities continue their campaign of getting rid of the country’s Soviet and Russian past. Pozdnyakov claims the statue, which was located in front of the National Transportation University, was a symbol of the “Russian world” for Ukrainian authorities. Its demolition has been dedicated to a Ukrainian lieutenant, activist and academic Denis Antipov, who died in May during a battle with Russian forces. The heritage the country’s officials are trying to eradicate includes Russian language, street names and statues commemorating multiple cultural and political figures. Monuments dedicated to Pushkin have been particularly targeted, as the poet is widely considered to have been one of the key figures in developing modern Russian literature and advancing the Russian language. “Pushkin is a symbol of Russian imperialism, the personification of the ‘great mighty Russian language,’ a marker of the Russian world and identity,” said Oleg Slabospitskiy, Coordinator of the Public Sector of Euromaidan civil action group, accusing the poet of propagating “Ukrainophobia” and “hatred of Ukrainians and Poles.” In September, Slabospitskiy organized a campaign to vandalize all remaining Russian and Soviet monuments in Kiev while local authorities took down a bust of Pushkin installed in front of one of the city’s gymnasiums. A few weeks prior, a group of alleged neo-Nazis also attacked another bust of the poet located in one of Kiev’s metro stations, dousing it with red paint. Statues of Pushkin have also been demolished in several cities across Ukraine. Earlier this year, a petition demanding to change all Pushkin Streets across Ukraine to the name of American writer Stephen King was published. However, it ultimately failed to gather enough signatures to be considered by the authorities. The Ukrainian Education Ministry has also been making efforts to wipe any links to Russian literature in the nation’s school curricula, with Deputy Education and Science Minister Andrey Vitrenko stating in June that “everything that somehow connects us with the Russian Empire should be thrown out.” As of September 1, when Knowledge Day is celebrated in some former Soviet republics, a number of schools across Ukraine have completely ruled out the use of Russian in the classroom, even where it is the predominantly spoken language. Moscow has repeatedly criticized Ukrainian authorities for what it considers to be “forceful Ukrainization and de-Russification” aimed at suppressing the rights of about a quarter of the country’s population.",3.459101680391469,3.283579780564218,0.17552189982725075,4
2022-10-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/564538-ukraine-zaporozhye-plant-electricity/,Ukraine halts electricity supply to nuclear power plant,"Ukraine has stopped supplying electricity to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators, local authorities announced on Tuesday. “We’ve yet again switched to emergency generation sources to enable all the processes that are going on at the Zaporozhye NPP itself,” the head of the Energodar city administration, Aleksandr Volga, told the Rossiya-24 broadcaster. Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant is currently in a dormant state, with its last reactor shut down back in September amid repeated shelling attacks by the Ukrainian forces. The facility needs an external electricity supply to operate the reactors’ cooling systems. The Zaporozhye plant, alongside with most of the surrounding region, was seized by the Russian military early in the conflict. Along with three other former Ukrainian territories, it was incorporated into Russia after the accession was backed in a referendum last month. The nuclear power plant was officially put under new Russian management last week, after President Vladimir Putin issued a decree on the matter. Currently, the new management has no plans to restart the facility, interim governor of Zaprozhye region, Evgeny Balitsky has said. “The nuclear reactors are not started, and we do not plan to start them in the nearest future. It’s working on diesel generators,” Balitsky told the broadcaster. Russian officials sent mixed signals on the electricity supply to the nuclear power plant on Tuesday, with Vladimir Rogov, a senior official in Zaporozhye Region, claiming the facility had been already connected to Russia’s grid. “The nuclear plant has been connected to power lines from our side,” Rogov told RIA Novosti. The claim, however, was debunked by Renat Karchaa, a senior official with Rosenergoatom, Russia’s state-run operator of nuclear power plants. “Zaporozhye NPP is not powered by the Russian grid. At the moment, there is no technical possibility for that,” Karchaa told TASS news agency later in the day.",3.2448472787923284,3.0893463747039647,0.1555009040883637,9

One can now force the liquefied natural gas from the US on to European countries on a much larger scale,” Putin said in a speech at the Russian Energy Week forum in Moscow on Wednesday. The president pointed out that US liquefied natural gas (LNG) is “definitely less competitive than Russian pipeline gas” due its higher price. Regarding the explosions on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, Putin said: “all the facts have been proven and documented. And the ideologues and the sponsors of those crimes are their eventual beneficiaries; those, who profit from instability and conflict.” “Who stands behind the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines? Obviously, those who are looking to completely sever the ties between Russia and the EU, undermine Europe's political sovereignty, weaken its industrial capacity and gain control of its markets,” the president said. They are also those who “have the technical capacity to carry out such explosions and have already resorted to such sabotage - were caught red-handed while doing so, but avoided liability,” he added. The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, which were built to deliver Russian gas to the EU via Germany, abruptly lost pressure on September 26, following a series of powerful underwater explosions off the Danish island of Bornholm. The ruptures, which are widely considered to be the result of sabotage, led to massive gas leaks and made them inoperable. Moscow later said that one of the lines of Nord Stream 2 remained unaffected and offered to supply gas to Europe through it. The Western media has speculated that Russia could have blown up its own pipelines to put the EU under even more pressure amid the energy crisis. Moscow has denied such claims, with Putin saying earlier that “the Anglo-Saxons,” a colloquialism for the US-UK alliance, could have been behind what the Russian side described as an “act of international terrorism.” Shortly after the leaks were found, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hailed the incident as a “tremendous opportunity” for Europe “to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy.” In late September, Russian Security Council secretary Nikolay Patrushev said Moscow had obtained “certain materials, which point to a Western trace in organizing and executing” the blasts on the Nord Stream pipelines. He argued that the US was the primary beneficiary of the disruption, and cited the CIA-backed attack on Nicaragua’s oil infrastructure in the 1980s as a historic example of America’s involvement in such types of sabotage.",2.87031440866145,1.9585433379845412,0.9117710706769089,1

Moscow called the strikes on Monday and Tuesday a response to Ukrainian “terrorist attacks” on Russian soil. The top Ukrainian official said on Tuesday that his country for the “first time from the beginning of the war” experienced large-scale Russian attacks on infrastructure, according to the US news channel. He assessed that Europe suffered, too, by proxy, because Kiev had to suspend the export of electricity. Ukraine “helps European countries to save on Russian gas and coal” and wants to “reconnect quickly from the other sources,” Galushchenko stated. The minister claimed that the Ukrainian energy system remained stable but urged other nations to expedite sending to Kiev air defense systems, to protect its infrastructure from further attacks. “We send this message to our partners: we need to protect the sky,” he was quoted as saying. The Russian military launched dozens of missiles on targets in Ukraine, which included its key infrastructure sites. Moscow called the military action retaliation for a number of sabotage plots targeting crucial Russian facilities, including the Kursk nuclear power plant, the TurkStream gas pipeline and the Crimean Bridge. Kiev’s “terrorist tactics” can no longer remain unanswered after last week’s truck bombing of the bridge, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. Several parts of Ukraine, including the capital Kiev, reported power outages and other problems with utilities after the Russian strikes.

The assassination of controversial Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin’s daughter on August 22, left American officials “angered,” the article published on Tuesday said. To deter Kiev from making similar “provocative” moves down the road, Washington intentionally allowed details of the plot to be made public in recent days, Politico reported, citing an unnamed official. Last week the New York Times reported that the US intelligence officials believe Dugina’s assassination was authorized by “parts” of the Ukrainian government. The NYT article, citing anonymous US officials, claimed Washington was not involved in the hit in any way, and would have opposed the operation had it known about it in advance. In a “closely held assessment of Ukrainian complicity” shared with the US government, intelligence officials voiced their concern that such a “covert campaign” could “widen the conflict,” and also expressed frustration over “Ukraine’s lack of transparency about its military and covert plans, especially on Russian soil,” the NYT reported. Commenting on the article, Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov said it might indicate a positive development. The Russian official also noted that Moscow “really want[s] to hope that this is not some attempt by the American colleagues, who may possess certain information, to distance themselves from responsibility for future terrorist acts that the Ukrainian state may be preparing.” The Politico article, however, states that the large-scale missile strikes on Ukrainian cities unleashed by Russia this week eclipsed disagreements between Washington and Kiev, with the Biden administration now ever more determined to support Ukraine in countering the Russian offensive. Dugina was killed on August 20, when the car she was driving exploded on the outskirts of Moscow.

According to Wednesday’s report, the male in his mid-50s travelled to Russia from Ukraine via Estonia. Once in Russia, he recovered the components for an IED from a stash pre-prepared by the Ukrainian special services, the statement claimed. He later allegedly assembled the bomb at a rented apartment, with an intelligence agent specializing in explosives giving instructions on how to build and test it. The device was adapted from an anti-tank missile warhead and had a yield equivalent to 3 kg of TNT, according to the description. The FSB said the suspect observed the warehouses of a logistical company in Bryansk, where he wanted to plant the device, before being arrested by Russian law enforcement. Bryansk Region shares a border with Ukraine. Russian law enforcement has released footage, purportedly showing the moment the suspect was apprehended.

It has also revealed details of the alleged Ukrainian terrorist plot, including its mastermind. The agency accused the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry of being behind the explosion, which damaged the strategic structure last Saturday. It claimed that Commander, Kirill Budanov, was personally responsible for the operation. Russia has identified 12 individuals as suspected accomplices in the plot and has arrested eight of them, the FSB said. The list of people in custody includes five Russians and three foreigners, who have citizenship of Ukraine and Armenia. The FSB claimed that the deadly cargo came from the Ukrainian city of Odessa. The explosives were disguised as rolls with plastic construction film, which were shipped on pallets and weighed 22,770 kg, the statement said. Investigators said the shipment left Odessa in August and went through Ruse, Bulgaria, to Poti in Georgia. It was then moved to Armenia, a country which has a free trade agreement and a relaxed customs regime with Russia. It was then imported into Russia via Georgia on October 4, according to the timeline. The transportation paperwork identified a non-existent firm in Crimea as the final recipient, according to the Russian agency. But the set of documents was only the latest of several used to disguise the movement of the cargo, it added. An agent of the GUR, known as ‘Ivan Ivanovich’ controlled the progress of the shipment, the FSB claimed. He used an anonymous ‘virtual’ phone number for communication as well as a second regular mobile number, linked to a Ukrainian citizen, it revealed. “The investigation continues. All organizers and accomplices in the crime, including foreign citizens, will be held accountable,” the agency stressed. A spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence told the media that the FSB was a “fake structure,” and that the report was unworthy of comment. At least three people died in the bombing of the bridge, including the truck driver. A fourth body that may be related to the incident was reportedly discovered this week. The blast also damaged the road section of the bridge and set on fire oil tanks on the parallel railroad line. Kiev stopped short of officially claiming responsibility for the explosion, but many Ukrainian officials cheered the attack in various ways. The national postal service even announced a special stamp dedicated to the incident and had a large copy installed in Kiev for people to take selfies in front of. Aleksey Danilov, the secretary of the Ukrainian national security council, posted images of the explosion next to Marilyn Monroe’s iconic performance of ‘Happy birthday to you’ for US President John F Kennedy. The explosion happened a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin celebrated his 70th birthday. This week, Moscow retaliated to the attack and other alleged Ukrainian plots against Russian infrastructure by launching dozens of missiles on key Ukrainian energy sites.

2022-10-12,https://www.rt.com/news/564503-medvedev-stoltenberg-nato-war/,NATO admitted it’s at war with Russia – Medvedev,"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg may have inadvertently admitted that the Western military alliance is at war with Moscow, at least in the eyes of former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. At issue is Stoltenberg’s statement on Tuesday that a military victory for Russia in Ukraine would be a defeat for NATO. Medvedev called the comment “an open confirmation of NATO’s participation in the war against our country – an unwise, but pure-hearted remark. The honest Norwegian fellow has finally admitted it.” Stoltenberg, formerly prime minister of Norway, made his comments in a press briefing as NATO ministers prepared to meet on Wednesday with Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov. Among other issues, the ministers will discuss how to meet Kiev’s “urgent needs” and shore up their own weapons stockpiles after shipping billions of dollars’ worth of military aid to Ukraine in hopes of helping to defeat Russian forces. “There’s an urgent need for air defense, but of course also many other capabilities – precision-guided ammunition, HIMARS and other advanced, modern, NATO-standard systems,” Stoltenberg said of Ukraine’s aid requests. He added that NATO members are providing unprecedented support because “they understand that we have a moral, political and security interest in ensuring that Ukraine wins the war against President Putin.” Russian officials have pointed out that providing more advanced weaponry to Ukraine, such as multiple rocket launcher (MRL) systems, will increase the risk of triggering a wider conflict. “The fastest way to bring the conflict in Ukraine to the point of no return is to arm the psychos in Kiev with longer-range MRLs,” Medvedev said. “The elderly leaders of Washington and NATO upstarts must use their softened brains at least sometimes.” Stoltenberg insisted that NATO is “not a party to the conflict,” even as it plays a “key role.” He vowed that the bloc will stand with Ukraine “as long as it takes” to defeat Russia. “It is important for all of us that Ukraine wins the battle, the war against the invading Russian forces, because if Putin wins, that is not only a big defeat for Ukrainians, but it will be a defeat and dangerous for all of us.” The NATO chief also accused Putin of “reckless nuclear rhetoric,” contributing to “the most significant escalation since the start of the war.” However, when asked whether the risk of a miscalculation amid heightened tensions with Russia prompted NATO members to consider canceling or modifying the bloc’s planned nuclear drill next week, he said, “Now is the right time to be firm and to be clear that NATO is there to protect and defend all allies.”",2.4076191481435534,2.3083821442494377,0.09923700389411572,8

The device was found resting on the seabed at a depth of 40m between the Nord Stream pipelines, almost directly under one of them, Kupriyanov said. The incident, which received limited media coverage at the time, prompted a brief halt in gas deliveries, while the drone was ultimately recovered by the Swedish military. Back then, the US-led bloc said it had “lost” the device during military drills, the spokesman claimed. The German-made drone carries a 1.4kg shaped-charge warhead, which is intended for destroying sunken unexploded munitions and mines, according to publicly available data. “That’s NATO drills for you, when a military-grade explosive device ends up straight under our pipeline,” Kupriyanov concluded. The remarks come in the aftermath of the apparent sabotage attacks on the Nord Stream pipeline system. The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines both abruptly lost pressure on September 26, following a series of powerful underwater explosions off the Danish island of Bornholm. The ruptures caused massive gas leaks into the open sea and rendered the pipelines inoperable. While Moscow has called for an international – with its own participation – probe into the incident, other parties appear to be reluctant to carry out such an investigation. Sweden, for instance, has already explicitly stated it will not share the results of its investigation into the explosion with Moscow. “In Sweden, our preliminary investigations are confidential, and that, of course, also applies in this case,” Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told reporters on Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already blamed the “the Anglo-Saxons,” a Russian colloquialism for the US-UK alliance, of being behind the blasts, which Moscow described as an “act of international terrorism.” Speaking during a meeting of the Russian Security Council on Monday, Putin said that “we all know well who the ultimate beneficiary of this crime is.”",1.3658059229095005,3.266300355877781,-1.9004944329682802,0

Konstantinov had proposed prohibiting Russian men who are eligible for military service from traveling abroad. He also suggested that those who had left the country after the partial mobilization was announced should be placed on a special “registry.” The Russian government launched a partial mobilization of military reservists last month, with the Defense Ministry stating that it planned to call to arms some 300,000 people to help with the ongoing military operation in neighboring Ukraine. The call-up prioritizes people who had previously served in the military and have real combat experience. Russia has also tightened up its criminal code, introducing stricter punishments for wartime crimes such as looting, desertion or draft-dodging. In some cases, avoiding being drafted during mobilization can land a person behind bars for up to ten years. Since the announcement of the partial mobilization, a number of Russian citizens have opted to flee the country for neighboring states such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, and Armenia, none of which require a visa for visiting Russians.

Minsk has accused Kiev of plotting an imminent attack, but Ukraine has insisted that the warnings are actually cover for a possible offensive from the other side. His Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko announced on Monday that he would form a joint security force with Russia in response to “aggravation” from Ukraine and the West. With officials in Minsk accusing Ukraine of blowing up bridges and amassing tens of thousands of troops along the Ukraine/Belarus border a day earlier, Lukashenko claimed that “Kiev is not just discussing, but is planning an attack on the territory of Belarus” at the behest of its Western backers. Kiev denies the accusations, with Zelensky telling the Group of Seven on Tuesday that “Ukraine did not plan and does not plan military actions against Belarus,” and accusing Lukashenko of creating the pretext to launch an attack of his own on Ukraine, which would result in Zelensky’s forces being split across two fronts. As a “solution,” Zelensky proposed that “a mission of international observers may be stationed on the border of Ukraine and Belarus to monitor the security situation.” “The format can be worked out by our diplomats,” he continued, asking the G7 “to support this initiative of ours.” In a joint statement after the virtual address by Zelensky, the G7 leaders called on Lukashenko to “stop enabling the Russian war of aggression” by allowing Russian soldiers on Belarusian soil, and urged his government to “fully abide by its obligations under international law.” Zelensky’s proposed observer mission was not mentioned. The Ukrainian president did not specify whether he wants observers from the G7 nations or from international organizations. While observers from international organizations would be seen as more neutral, members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) mission in Eastern Ukraine, which began in 2014 but was pulled out just prior to the beginning of Russia’s military operation, were repeatedly accused by Russia of ignoring violations by Kiev. Two employees of the mission were sentenced to imprisonment by the Lugansk People’s Republic last month for treason, after they were found to have been working with foreign intelligence agencies. At the same time, Ukraine has refused to recognize the international observers overseeing the referendums that saw four former Ukrainian regions vote to join Russia.",3.3179587823461802,2.9674918505140275,0.3504669318321527,8

The system – which comprises a command vehicle, a radar vehicle, and a truck-mounted launcher capable of firing eight missiles – was handed over to the Ukrainian military next to the Polish-Ukrainian border on Tuesday, the German magazine reported. The handover took place four days after German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht made an unannounced visit to Ukraine, where she promised her Ukrainian counterpart, Aleksey Reznikov, that his country would receive the IRIS-T “in a few days.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged to provide this system to Ukraine back in June, with delivery initially slated for November. In an update on Monday, Lambrecht said that Russia’s devastating missile strikes on Ukrainian military and infrastructure targets that morning showed “how important it is to supply Ukraine with air defense systems quickly.” Berlin has promised Ukraine at least four IRIS-T systems, each of which can supposedly strike incoming missiles up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) away. Ukraine has reportedly asked Germany for at least a dozen of these systems, and offered to purchase them directly from the manufacturer, Diehl Defense.

Footage circulating online shows the transformer at the substation on fire, with a thick plume of smoke visible many kilometers away from Shebekino. The attack inflicted only material damage with no injuries reported, according to local officials. It was not immediately clear whether the substation was subjected to artillery or rocket fire. The attack disrupted electricity supply in the area, with some 2,000 people affected. The local authorities promised to restore power within several hours.

Addressing reporters on the eve of a meeting of NATO defense ministers, Stoltenberg declared that continued arms shipments to Ukraine are vital to ensure “that Ukraine wins the battle, the war against the invading Russian forces.” However, this assistance has come at a price for the alliance’s own militaries. Germany’s weapons and ammo stocks have been critically depleted since late August. The same month, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US’ stockpiles of 155mm artillery ammunition were “uncomfortably low.” Asked whether weakening its own forces to strengthen Ukraine’s is a wise policy, Stoltenberg described the conflict in Ukraine as existential to the alliance. “If [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wins, that is not only a big defeat for the Ukrainians, but it will be the defeat, and dangerous, for all of us,” he said. NATO is heavily invested in Ukraine, with the alliance’s members providing training, intelligence capability, and tens of billions of dollars worth of weapons to the Ukrainian military. Despite this “unprecedented support,” Stoltenberg has repeatedly claimed that “NATO is not a party to the conflict.” Moscow sees things differently. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has accused NATO of waging war against Russia “by proxy,” while Putin has described Russia as fighting “the entire Western military machine” in Ukraine. NATO leaders claim that their weapons systems have enabled Kiev’s troops to make a series of advances in the south and east of the country in recent weeks. However, with Moscow’s military operation under new command, these advances have come to a halt, and after two days of devastating Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian military and infrastructure targets, Kiev is once again pleading with the West for heavier and longer-range weapons.",2.2647802631068834,2.704272371139897,-0.43949210803301364,8
2022-10-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/564476-zaporozhye-plant-russia-grid/,Europe’s biggest nuclear plant shifts power source,"The Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant is receiving Russian electricity after being taken off Ukraine’s electrical grid, according to an adviser at the state-owned operator. The site, along with the city of Energodar, sits near the frontline, with Moscow and Kiev accusing each other of shelling the facility. “The city has been connected to the grid, and the plant has a new power supply as well,” Renat Karchaa from Rosenergoatom told Russia 24 TV on Tuesday. The change was also reported by Vladimir Rogov, a senior official in Russia’s Zaporozhye Region, where the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe is based. “The nuclear plant has been connected to power lines from our side,” Rogov told RIA Novosti news agency. “However, it is [too] early to talk about restarting the plant’s reactors at the moment,” he later wrote on his Telegram channel. The last of the plant’s six reactors was shut down a month ago after power lines were damaged by the shelling. The facility was then forced to rely on diesel generators. Russia has accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism,” repeatedly warning that the shelling could trigger a nuclear disaster, similar to the incident in Chernobyl in 1986. Kiev has claimed that Russian soldiers have used the plant as cover. Zaporozhye Region was seized by Russian forces shortly after Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring state in February. Along with three other former Ukrainian territories, it was admitted to Russia after the accession was backed in a referendum last month. On Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree formally transferring the plant under Russian authority.",2.495295683831419,4.379042902961809,-1.8837472191303903,9

The bizarre scheme began in July and was reported this week by local media. The victim, a 65-year-old woman from the central Shiga Prefecture, got acquainted with the alleged swindler on social media, police told the journalists. The scammer, whose profile was full of various space pictures, claimed to be a “Russian cosmonaut” currently stationed at the ISS. The woman took the bait and communicated with the scammer for weeks through the messaging app Line before their relationship turned into a fairly standard, yet space-flavored, marriage scam. The con artist repeatedly told the woman he loved her and insisted he wanted to start a new “life in Japan” and promised the woman that he would marry her. “Will you marry me when I arrive in Japan? I love you,” the phony spacefarer reportedly told his victim on multiple occasions. Before doing so, however, he had to return to Earth first, the faux cosmonaut told his victim, claiming he had to pay rocket expenses for his return and massive “landing fees.” The woman believed the story and transferred some 4.4 million yen ($30,000) to the scammer. While the sum requested was already astronomical, her would-be-groom continued to demand more money for his purported space-faring endeavors. The woman ultimately grew suspicious and reported the whole affair to the police. The woman might not be the only victim of the scheme, local media suggested. TV Asahi spoke to a Japanese woman in her 40s who claimed she had also been contacted on Instagram by a man pretending to be a Russian cosmonaut. The would-be scammer tried to guide the potential victim to the same messaging app Line, yet the woman refused and severed contact with the individual.",3.9224444024970992,3.5944944893790356,0.32794991311806365,5
2022-10-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/564467-russia-strikes-ukraine-goals-achieved/,Moscow reveals results of new strikes on Ukraine,"New missile strikes targeting Ukrainian military command and control sites and the country’s energy infrastructure were conducted on Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry reported during a daily briefing. The attacks hit all intended targets and “achieved their goals,” the military claimed. Earlier in the day, Ukrainian officials and media reported more Russian long-range attacks in a rerun of Monday’s strikes. Andrey Sadovoy, the mayor of the city of Lvov in western Ukraine, said his city faced another blackout due to the damage inflicted by Russia. “A missile strike at a critical infrastructure object” had left some 30% of Lvov without power, the official reported on social media. He added that there were issues with the water supply in the city and urged residents to stockpile for possible cuts. In Vinnitsa Region in central Ukraine, the head of the administration, Sergey Borzov, reported drone attacks on a local power station, but later edited his post to a more neutral report of “explosions” in his region. The operator of the Ladyzhin coal-fired power plant confirmed damage to its equipment in a drone raid on Tuesday morning. Reports of Russian missiles being engaged by Ukrainian air defenses came from the regions of Kiev, Odessa, and Vinnitsa. In the Rovno and Krivoy Rog regions, people on social media reported blasts on the ground, presumably caused by Russian strikes. The barrages came a day after almost all major regions of Ukraine came under a massive aerial assault. The Ukrainian military claimed to have intercepted roughly half of the missiles, but nevertheless 11 key sites all across the country were damaged, according to the Ukrainian government. Moscow targeted Ukrainian power plants and other critical facilities after what Russian President Vladimir Putin called a series of “terrorist attacks” orchestrated by Ukrainian special services on Russian soil. The latest of them involved blowing up a truck laden with explosives on the Crimean Bridge, a strategic Russian link. Russian investigators reported on Saturday that at least three civilians were killed by the blast, but the number may be as high as six, given that three people are reportedly still missing, according to the Telegram-based news outlet 112. Putin said Kiev’s tactics could not be left without a response and argued that Kiev had exposed its energy sector to Russian strikes by trying for months to sabotage key Russian infrastructure. Kiev’s foreign backers condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, in contrast to the muted reaction to the incident on the Russian bridge. The White House on Sunday declined to comment on the bridge blast and pledged continued military support of Ukraine.",2.8747278972408457,3.1209676847710712,-0.24623978753022557,0
2022-10-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/564464-belarus-ukraine-conflict-point/,Ukraine conflict faces ‘inflection point’ – Belarus,"A pivotal moment in the Russia-Ukraine conflict will occur in the coming months, Ivan Tertel, the head of the State Security Committee of Belarus (KGB), has said. Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring country in February. “If the Russian Federation properly conducts mobilization, ensures that its military force [involved in the fighting with Ukraine] has equipment and advanced weapons, combat will enter a key phase,” Tertel said during a briefing on Tuesday, as quoted by the news agency BelTA. “According to our assessment, the inflection point will come between November and February,” he added. The statement comes after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his country had begun forming a joint military force with Russia. He cited tensions with NATO as the reason for the move. Russia stepped up strikes on major Ukrainian cities on Monday, hitting targets in Kiev for the first time in months. President Vladimir Putin said that the strikes on military command centers and energy infrastructure were retaliation for “terrorist attacks” on Russian soil. Moscow previously accused Kiev of orchestrating a truck bombing on Saturday that damaged the only bridge connecting Crimea with mainland Russia. Putin announced a partial mobilization last month with the goal of calling up 300,000 reservists. Last week, Army General Sergey Surovikin was appointed to command all Russian forces involved in the conflict. US President Joe Biden, meanwhile, authorized an additional $625 million in military aid for Ukraine last week. The EU also pledged to continue supporting Kiev, with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stating that the bloc would back Ukraine for as long as necessary. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

The measure was introduced on Tuesday and is aimed at “balancing the power system and avoiding large-scale blackouts,” privately-owned energy company DTEK announced on Tuesday. It cited instructions it received from the national transmission system operator, Ukrenergo. The rotating outages will affect both industrial consumers and regular citizens, and was introduced after a massive Russian attack on Ukraine’s infrastructure on Monday. Ukrenergo called on people to dial down their use of electricity to decrease the load on the grid. On Monday evening, it claimed there was a 26.5% drop in consumption in the capital and surrounding region, compared to an average autumn day. The company urged users to keep consumption low during peak evening hours, and said it ordered operators in Kiev, Chernigov, Zhitomir, and Cheboksary to introduce rolling blackouts, which will be in force for several days. Issues with basic utilities such as electricity and water were reported by Ukrainian media in many parts of the country following the strikes. Moscow states that the strikes were in retaliation for what it described as a series of “Ukrainian terrorist attacks” on Russian infrastructure.

2022-10-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/564318-nobel-peace-prize-winners/,"How the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has managed to unite Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian elites in collective anger","This year, the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to Russia for the fourth time in history and for the second year in a row. But not only that, together with the ‘Memorial’ human rights society, the honor is shared by Belarusian human rights activist Alexander Bialyatsky, and the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties. The laureates have for many years promoted the right to criticize power and made an outstanding effort to document war crimes and human rights abuses, the Norwegian committee behind the award explained. What do these people and groups have in common and what does this award mean in the context of the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine? 1987 saw the official beginning of ‘perestroika’. A Russian term which became well known in the West. The authorities of the Soviet Union were actively pursuing reforms, but the consequences were not yet visible. The country wasn’t trembling with separatism in the suburbs, inter-ethnic clashes hadn’t kicked off, and a real economic crisis wasn’t felt. But its citizens were already beginning to taste ‘glasnost’, which saw a relaxation in censorship, détente in international relations, and the flowering of private enterprise. Across the union, people were banding together to form the political clubs that would become the backbone of Soviet civil society. From one of these, ‘Memorial’ was born. The young people who founded it set themselves the noble task of rehabilitating the victims of Soviet terror and preserving their memory. By the autumn of 1988, Memorial had grown into a movement spanning the entire Soviet Union. Its leader was Andrey Sakharov, the first and at the time only Nobel Peace Prize laureate from the USSR. Under his leadership, the society protested and held discussions about the country’s totalitarian past, with a focus on how to make sure the repression never happened again. What Sakharov failed to do was to get the organization officially registered. Although the authorities themselves were pursuing a policy of rehabilitating victims of political repression, they remained deaf to his requests. Meanwhile, in the regions, administrative pressure was exerted on the members of the society. The situation was changed by Sakharov’s death in late 1989. At the funeral, President Mikhail Gorbachev asked his widow, Yelena Bonner, what he could do to commemorate the Nobel laureate. “Register Memorial!” Bonner replied instantly. Her request was fulfilled a month and a half later. And Gorbachev received his own Nobel Peace Prize less than a year later. Notably, Memorial is also associated with the third Nobel Peace Prize laureate from Russia, journalist Dmitry Muratov. He mentioned the organization and its activities in his speech at the award ceremony in Oslo last year. This was not surprising; the Novaya Gazeta newspaper headed by Muratov has been Memorial’s media partner for many years. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Memorial became an international organization engaged in research, advocacy, and education. For more than 30 years, its members have uncovered archives, published books, compiled databases of victims of repression, and created charitable and educational programs. Thanks to their work, millions of people learned about the fate of their family members repressed by the Soviet regime. Memorial secured the opening of a monument to victims of repression in Moscow. In 1990, the Solovetsky Stone, named after one of the Gulag camps, was unveiled in the city center next to a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, one of the symbols of Soviet state terror. The latter was removed shortly afterwards. Every year on October 29, on the eve of the Day of Remembrance for Victims of Political Repression, Memorial initiates a commemorative action at the Solovetsky Stone. At this place from 10am to 10pm, the names of people shot during the Soviet terror are read out – first name, last name, age, profession, date of execution. To take part, people stand in line for hours at a time, often in very chilly weather. Eventually, Memorial went beyond dwelling on the memory of Soviet repression alone. “It simply became impossible to collect profiles of the dead of the repressed and ignore the suffering of the living,” was how members of the society explained their decision to engage in human rights activities. The organization became involved in politics; it supported refugees and opponents of the Russian state, criticized the authorities, and occasionally sued them at the European Court of Human Rights. Memorial has never received support from the Russian state and has carried out its activities through donations and support from sponsors, including foreign donors. Memorial’s first external donor was the Open Society Foundations of Hungarian billionaire George Soros. Subsequently, the US Agency for International Development, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, various UN departments, and other international entities, as well as the embassies of Britain, France, Germany, and other Western countries joined the list of donors. It was this foreign money which formed the basis of Memorial’s legal conflict with the Russian state, and which changed its relationship with the authorities. In the first half of the 2010s, it was registered as a ‘foreign agent’. After years of battles over repeated violations of this law, Memorial was finally liquidated by court order in February 2022. But in addition to the legal conflict between the Russian state and the group, an ideological confrontation has been escalating for years. Human rights activists have taken cases against Moscow to European courts over criminal cases concerning violations of the law on protests. Also, on numerous occasions, Memorial has drawn attention to alleged political persecution or lawlessness in cases related to terrorism. These have involved not only radical Islamists, but also less straightforward situations. For example, ‘The Network’ case was a high-profile prosecution in the second half of the 2010s; 11 anti-fascists and anarchists from the Russian provinces were accused of forming and participating in a terrorist cell. Memorial took the view that the charges had been fabricated. Despite Memorials’ joy, the awarding of the Nobel Prize is unlikely to change its status in Russia. Dmitry Novikov, first deputy chairman of the Duma committee on international affairs, said that this would require “either changing the law or breaking it.” “My prediction is that no such decisions of a provocative anti-Russian nature can in any way induce the State Duma to initiate amendments to the law so that the activities of Memorial are once again legalized and freely carried out on the territory of the Russian Federation,” he explained. The second winner of this year’s prize, Alexander Bialyatsky, was born in what is now Russia, in Karelia, but has lived most of his life in Belarus – his family moved to Gomel Region when the future human rights activist was only three years old. Bialyatsky also began his public activities during the perestroika years. As in the case of Memorial, his efforts were initially aimed at restoring the memory of the victims of Stalinist repression. In October 1988, Alexander participated in the ‘Dzjady’ rally, which was dedicated to the commemoration of the victims of Stalinist repressions and was dispersed by the police. He was held administratively liable for his participation. The protest was organized by the Belarusian People’s Front (BPF), founded by Alexander himself. Its supporters called for “the reorganization of the political system and revival of the Belarusian nation on the principles of democracy and humanism, development of culture, and for the actual state independence of the Republic of Belarus.” In the 1990s, the party, which adhered to anti-Russian ideas and Belarusian nationalism, would be established on the basis of this movement. Under pressure from this party, the Belarusian parliament in the 1990s adopted the white-red-white flag, last seen in the Nazi era, and the Pogonia coat of arms as symbols of the state, symbolizing Belarus’ link with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (used by Belarusian collaborators during the Great Patriotic War). There was active de-Russification – for example, despite 87% of the population being Russian-speaking, the Belarusian authorities made fewer than 5% of schools Russian-speaking. The BPF saw the country’s future as aligned with Western Europe and NATO. Alexander himself was a member of the Minsk City Council in the 1990s and headed the Literary Museum. In 1996, together with his staff, he began helping political activists arrested during protests – this is how the Viasna Human Rights Center appeared, which is still chaired by Bialyatsky. By the end of the 1990s, he had finally withdrawn from politics and concentrated on human rights activities. However, the country’s authorities did not tolerate his organization’s activities, and in 2003, it was deprived of state registration. In 2011, Bialyatsky was accused of tax evasion and sentenced to prison. He was released in 2014. Subsequently, he has won numerous awards from the governments of Poland and the US, as well as the European Union. During mass protests in Belarus in the summer of 2020, Bialyatsky became a member of the Coordinating Council of the Opposition. A year later, he was detained again on charges of not paying taxes. In September this year, a month before he was awarded the Nobel Prize, he was charged again – this time for smuggling a large sum of money. The activist and his supporters regard all these prosecutions as politically motivated, and designed to stifle his opposition to President Alexander Lukashenko. Bialyatsky is currently in pre-trial detention. His colleagues from the Viasna Center hope that the award will have an impact on the proceedings. “He is [now] known both in Belarus and internationally. I think this will stand to his advantage and that he may be released,” his colleague, Natalia Satsunkevich, said. The third laureate is distinguished by its ‘youthfulness’: Founded in 2007, the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties (CCL) did not emerge from resistance to Soviet dictatorship, nor the perestroika winds of change, nor the chaos of the 1990s. The organization’s donors include the already mentioned George Soros foundation, the US State Department, the US Congress-sponsored National Endowment for Democracy, the European Commission, the United Nations Development Programme, the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, and other global players. According to the Nobel Committee, the CCL has worked “to strengthen Ukrainian civil society and put pressure on the authorities to transform Ukraine into a full-fledged democracy.” A somewhat ironic statement at a time when the Kiev regime has effectively become a dictatorship. The country has moved, in just a decade, from being an imperfect multi-party, democracy – before the Western-backed 2014 Maidan – to a situation where the there is no real legal opposition. At first, the post coup regime banned the Communist Party, who were especially strong in the Russian-speaking south-west, and blocked the Russian press. However, under President Vladimir Zelensky, the move to authoritarianism has accelerated. Last year, he had the country's opposition leader – Victor Medvedchuk – placed under house arrest. He was subsequently jailed and forced to pose for humiliating photographs before being released in Saudi-negotiated prisoner exchange. The regime was pushing politically motivated criminal charges on Zelensky's only other realistic rival, former president Pyotr Poroshenko before Moscow launched its military offensive, earlier this year. The president has also banned the state's second most popular party and shut down virtually all media outside his control. In its early years, the CCL organized all kinds of training and awareness-raising campaigns, but its heyday came in 2013 when mass protests in Kiev eventually escalated into a Western-backed coup d’état. At the time, the Euromaidan SOS initiative was set up to “assist the protesters and monitor abuses by the security forces.” Members of the organization actively promoted the idea that the deposed Ukrainian authorities were responsible for the bloodshed during these protests, despite overwhelming evidence that the Maidan snipers incident was the work of the opposition. Subsequently, the CCL even handed over to the International Criminal Court “evidence of crimes against humanity committed by the [President Viktor] Yanukovich regime.” However, independent research has contradicted this standpoint, pointing out that Western-backed Ukrainian activists have been extremely selective in its consideration of existing evidence, thereby covering up the real perpetrators of the tragedy. The fact Kiev has failed to prosecute anybody for the slaughter also speaks volumes. In subsequent years, the Center devoted its efforts to participating in monitoring groups in Donbass and Crimea, and campaigning in support of Oleg Sentsov and other activists imprisoned in Russia. In 2017, the CCL established the Kiev School of Human Rights, and in 2020 deployed activists to cover [again Western-backed] anti-government protests in Belarus. It is noteworthy that over the years, the CCL has not made any statements or investigated human rights violations in Ukraine itself, including the most egregious cases, such as the May 2014 tragedy in Odessa, which left dozens dead. A new phase of the organization’s activities began after the launch of the Russian military operation in February, a fact also highlighted by the Nobel Committee. The reasoning of the ruling specifically noted that “following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Centre for Civil Liberties undertook efforts to identify and document Russian war crimes against Ukrainian civilians.” The organization’s main project so far is called ‘Tribunal for Putin’. The fact that this year’s Nobel Peace Prize was awarded simultaneously to representatives of three countries that only three decades ago were considered an indivisible whole is striking to all. Observers have commented that this symbolizes the fact that the liberal wings of the three countries, despite the differences of their governments, remain linked. But many do not like this interpretation. The most vehement reaction to the news of the Nobel Committee’s decision was in Ukraine. “[The] Nobel Committee has an interesting understanding of the word ‘peace’ if representatives of two countries that attacked a third one receive the Nobel Prize together. Neither Russian nor Belarusian organizations were able to organize resistance to the war. This year’s Nobel is ‘awesome’,” Mikhail Podoliak, an adviser to President Vladimir Zelensky, wrote on Twitter. “The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to representatives of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. I believe it is unacceptable to accept any prize together with Russians and Belarusians now. This is another justification and an attempt to unite the rapist and the victim. We should reject it,” MP Mariana Bezugla claimed. “On the one hand, I rejoice at the Nobel Peace Prize for the worthy Ukrainian organization Center for Civil Liberties. On the other hand, association with Belarusians and Russians is inappropriate because it actualizes the Russian myth of ‘three fraternal nations’ which is the basis of the current war against Ukraine,” historian and former chairman of the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory, Vladimir Viatrovich, wrote on social media. Igor Kozlovsky, a board member of the CCL, expressed a similar idea: “We react very emotionally and are insulted when Europeans and the Nobel Committee lump Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians into one space. We are not against laureates from Russia and Belarus. [But the idea of] ‘Fraternal nations’ offends us.” However, Moscow is not particularly happy with the Nobel Committee’s decision either. The head of the Russian Human Rights Council, Valery Fadeyev, advised Memorial “to refuse this prize in order to preserve at least some elements of a good reputation.” He was particularly outraged by the awarding of the prize to the Ukrainian CCL: “Where was this organization in the previous eight years when Donbass was being bombed, when thousands of civilians, children, and elderly people were being killed? They were collecting information about ‘Maidan victims’ – what Maidan victims?! This was a coup instigated and supported by the West. This is not an ideology of defending human rights, it is an ideology of war.” Leonid Slutsky, the head of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, pointed out the same thing: “The website of this, so to speak, organization is full of accusations of Russia’s ‘occupation’, articles about the ‘Russian invasion’, and about assistance from the West. And not a single word about the thousands of civilians killed by Ukrainian militants in Donbass.” The Russian MP concluded that “the Nobel Peace Prize has once again been turned into a political tool.” “It has once again been awarded to the ‘right’ activists and so-called human rights activists. It is awarded for success in complying with the methodology of the collective West,” he added.",4.8615711817824865,3.326221368872932,1.5353498129095544,4
2022-10-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/564450-ukraine-weapons-wish-llist/,Kiev insists it needs US air defenses and long-range missiles – reports,"Kiev has reiterated calls for Washington to provide more advanced weapons, after Moscow conducted attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure on Monday, according to Foreign Policy magazine. A letter sent by Ruslan Stefanchuk, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, reportedly asked the US for air defense systems, long-range tactical ballistic missiles, and fighter jets. The Foreign Policy report says the letter touted Ukraine’s success in allegedly intercepting half of the missiles launched by Russia on Monday, and called on US congressional leadership to bolster Kiev’s capabilities by prioritizing deliveries of more advanced air defense systems. The lawmaker specifically identified the medium-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) and Land-Based Phalanx Weapon System (LPWS) automatic anti-rocket turrets as being necessary for Ukraine. They would help the country defend “the most important objects, especially crucial power plants,” he wrote, as quoted by the magazine. Stefanchuk also reiterated Kiev’s long-held desire for the US to lift restrictions on supplying advanced offensive weapons, such as F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). The latter can be fired by M270 and M142 launchers, which Ukraine has already received in large numbers from the US and other countries. Washington has said it will not send ATACMS to Kiev because its military does not need them on the battlefield. Ukrainian officials argue that the missiles, which have a range of up to 300km (186 miles), could be deployed against Russian airfields in Crimea. The US banned Kiev from using weapons received from the Pentagon to attack targets in Russia. However, Washington considers the peninsula – as well as the Donbass republics and former Ukrainian regions that recently voted to join Russia – as “annexed” parts of Ukraine. Russia launched a massive missile barrage on Ukraine on Monday in retaliation for what President Vladimir Putin described as a pattern of Ukrainian attacks targeting Russian civilian infrastructure. He listed the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, the TurkStream gas pipeline, and the Crimean Bridge among the targets of Ukrainian sabotage. Putin said Kiev’s “terrorist tactics” could not be left unanswered, explaining the justification for the strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. The deadly explosion on the Crimean Bridge took place on Saturday last week, and killed several civilians in addition to damaging the structure itself.",2.347195513261134,2.3302585894929853,0.016936923768148926,0
2022-10-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/564439-milner-renounces-russian-citizenship/,Billionaire renounces his Russian citizenship,"Moscow-born billionaire Yuri Milner has cut his last tie to his homeland, renouncing his Russian citizenship after condemning the country for its military offensive against Ukraine. Milner completed the process of shedding his Russian citizenship in August, according to an updated fact sheet posted on the website of his Silicon Valley investment firm, DST Global. The 60-year-old father of three moved his family to California in 2014 after living in Israel, where he obtained citizenship in 1999, for nine years. “My family and I left Russia for good in 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea. And this summer, we officially completed the process of renouncing our Russian citizenship,” the billionaire tweeted on Monday. A number of Russian-born businessmen have tried to distance themselves from their native country amid public outrage in the West over the Ukraine conflict and efforts by the US and its allies to seize the assets of so-called oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin. Milner was among at least seven Russian billionaires who asked US-based Forbes magazine to refrain from mentioning their national origins. Milner, who has been called Russia’s most influential technology investor, built a fortune estimated by Bloomberg at $3.5 billion. He was an early investor in Facebook, Twitter, and Airbnb, and he bet successfully on such Chinese tech companies as online retailer Alibaba and smartphone maker Xiaomi. In 2018, the US Treasury Department placed Milner on its ‘Kremlin list’ of officials and tycoons with alleged ties to the Russian government. However, he hasn’t set foot in Russia since 2014, and his venture capital firm hasn’t raised any funds from Russian investors since 2011. None of the 80 companies in which DST has invested are based in Russia. Milner, who was born to a Ukrainian-Jewish father and a Russian-Jewish mother, graduated with a degree in theoretical physics from Moscow State University in 1985.

2022-10-11,https://www.rt.com/russia/564438-ukraine-halts-electricity-export-eu/,Ukraine halts electricity exports to EU,"Damage to energy infrastructure caused by Moscow’s air strikes has forced Ukraine’s government to cut off electricity exports to the EU. The strikes removed a supply source that Kiev claims helped its partners reduce their reliance on power generated with Russian natural gas. “Today’s missile strikes, which hit the thermal generation and electrical substations, forced Ukraine to suspend electricity exports from October 11, 2022, to stabilize its own energy system,” the Ukrainian Energy Ministry said on Monday in a statement. The ministry noted that even after losing control of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant to Russian forces in March, Kiev had been able to meet export commitments to its EU partners, but Monday’s attacks were the largest of the entire conflict. “The cynicism is that the entire supply chain has been hit,” Energy Minister German Galushchenko said. “It’s both electricity distribution systems and generation. The enemy’s goal is to make it difficult to reconnect electricity supplies from other sources.” Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday’s air strikes on Kiev and other major Ukrainian cities – targeting military, energy and communications infrastructure – came in response to Ukraine’s attack on the strategic Crimean Bridge on Saturday. “If there are further attempts to conduct terrorist attacks on our soil, Russia will respond firmly and on a scale corresponding to the threats created against Russia,” Putin announced. Galushchenko, however, accused Moscow of waging “energy terror” in retaliation for Kiev helping other countries reduce their dependence on Russia. After joining European energy system ENTSO-E back in June, Kiev said it expected to earn some €1.5 billion from electricity exports to the EU by the end of the year. “That is why Russia is destroying our energy system, killing the very possibility of exporting electricity from Ukraine,” the energy minister claimed. Ukrenergo, the national power grid operator, claimed its specialists have been “engaging backup supply schemes” and repaired some of the damage by Monday night. In the meantime, the ministry urged “all citizens of Ukraine to unite” and minimize their energy use during the peak demand hours, arguing that not only Ukraine is implementing measures to reduce power consumption, but the “whole of Europe is doing this now.”",2.876045743173261,2.169068412676867,0.706977330496394,9
2022-10-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/564434-zelensky-biden-phone-call/,Biden and Zelensky speak after airstrikes,"US President Joe Biden has spoken by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart, Vladimir Zelensky, after Russia pounded military and infrastructure targets throughout Ukraine on Monday. Biden condemned the Russian strikes and promised to send more air defense systems to Kiev. According to a readout of the call published by Zelensky’s office, the Ukrainian president described the Russian strikes as “a sign of weakness of the Russian army,” despite the fact that the barrage crippled the country’s power grid and, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, destroyed “military command facilities” and communications networks. Biden “pledged to continue providing Ukraine with the support needed to defend itself, including advanced air defense systems,” read a summary of the call from the White House. Russian missiles hit multiple Ukrainian cities on Monday morning, two days after the Crimean Bridge attack, which Ukraine is widely believed to have been responsible for. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the strikes as a response to Ukrainian “terrorism,” warning that Russia would “respond firmly” to any future attacks on its soil. Zelensky spent the hours after the attacks lobbying Western leaders to send his military heavier weapons, including surface-to-air missiles. In a tweet announcing his phone call with Biden, the Ukrainian president said that “air defense is currently the number one priority in our defense cooperation.” The US has not sent its most advanced Patriot missile batteries to Ukraine, with the Pentagon arguing that such systems would need US troops to operate them. However, the Biden administration has given Kiev eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), and the Pentagon has signed a $182-million deal with arms manufacturer Raytheon to build more of these systems through August 2024. It is unclear whether Biden’s promise of “advanced air defense systems” was a reference to continued NASAMS deliveries, or shipments of more advanced systems.",2.3153424790501305,1.621867406938969,0.6934750721111616,0

The video was shared by a Ukrainian neo-Nazi militant, who, however, blamed Russian troops for the apparent massacre. The head of the Russian human rights council, Valery Fedorov, informed the UN Human Rights Council (OHCHR), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and Amnesty International, among other groups, about the grisly footage. “This video speaks of extrajudicial killings, the physical elimination of people who show a civil position and dare to oppose official Kiev. The situation is also aggravated by the fact that official representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have previously openly announced carrying out ‘tough sweeping’ and ‘filtration measures’,” Fedorov said in a statement urging an international probe into the affair. Earlier in the day, Russia’s Investigative Committee said it had launched a probe into the alleged massacre, which is believed to have happened near the town of Kupyansk in eastern Ukraine. The town was recently re-captured by Ukrainian troops after being held by Russian forces. The video was released online on Sunday by Maksim Zhorin, formerly a senior commander with the neo-Nazi Azov regiment, which is banned in Russia. Footage shows several presumably dead bodies in civilian clothing half-buried in a pit, with another body of an almost-naked man rolling into the hole. Zhorin initially said that the video showed the “civilian population” and warned that “there will be retaliation.” Shortly thereafter, however, he altered his post, claiming the video had been obtained from a phone seized from an “occupant,” implying the murders had been committed by the Russian military.",4.467155159960996,2.1429143388255505,2.324240821135446,5
2022-10-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/564418-crimea-bridge-repairs-state/,Official update given on repairs to Crimean Bridge,"A pillar and a part of the rail track of the Crimean Bridge, which was damaged on Saturday in a terrorist attack, will need to be repaired, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said on Monday. Speaking at a meeting with Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Khusnullin offered reassurances that the damage did not pose any safety risks to vehicles. “As a result of the diagnostics, the need to eliminate damage to the expansion joint on one of the pillars was established. The preliminary deadline for repairing the damage to the pillar is the end of this week,” Khusnullin said. Stating that about 150 people are now involved in the clean-up work, the deputy prime minister said that the asphalt on the damaged part of the motorway had already been removed. A schedule for dismantling the parts of the bridge that were damaged will be ready within three days, he added. “By this time, additional labor resources, floating cranes and other necessary work equipment will be brought in,” he said. Metal structures for the repairs will begin being delivered by the end of the week from the cities of Tyumen, Kurgan, and Voronezh, the deputy prime minister said, expressing gratitude to everyone involved for their “prompt work.” As for the railway portion of the bridge, Khusnullin said that a preliminary assessment of the tracks had shown that two spans needed to be replaced.“The repairs do not affect the delivery of goods and passengers,” he emphasized. The head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, has estimated that fully restoring the bridge could take about two months. The powerful blast rocked the bridge early Saturday morning, killing at least three people and causing a partial collapse of the road section and a blaze on a parallel railway span where seven fuel tanks caught fire. The explosion led to a temporary halt of both road and rail traffic, although both had resumed already by Saturday evening. On Sunday, Russian officials claimed that the Crimean Bridge – the only one connecting the peninsula with mainland Russia – had been targeted by the Ukrainian security services. In response to what Russia has called a “terrorist act,” numerous airstrikes were carried out on Monday against critical Ukrainian infrastructure sites. Kiev, meanwhile, has not claimed responsibility for the attack, despite the country’s top officials openly celebrating the deadly explosion.",2.9347851544874684,1.3741478060604932,1.560637348426975,0

The order was shared on Monday on the committee’s official Telegram channel with an announcement that a case would be opened against SBU officials over the “unlawful persecution of Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev.” On Monday, the SBU confirmed that Medvedev had been added to its wanted list in March. In his case file on the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs website, the ex-Russian leader is branded a “fugitive from pre-trial investigations” and his date of “disappearance” listed as March 1. The SBU database also issued warrants in March for Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who is charged with “encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine which led to the death of people or other serious consequences.” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov and hundreds of other Russian officials, including MPs, are also on the list. Earlier on Monday, Medvedev claimed on his Telegram channel that the current “Nazi political regime” in Kiev will present a “constant, direct and clear threat to Russia,” and called for the “complete dismantling” of the “political regime” in Kiev in order to protect Russia’s people and borders. His message came after Russia launched a series of missile strikes across Ukraine, targeting key infrastructure in response to the October 8 attack on the Crimean Bridge, which Moscow claims was a terrorist attack carried out by the SBU. Medvedev commented on Monday’s strikes, claiming they were just the “first episode” and that “there will be others.”",3.064124851930376,1.4935138348056884,1.5706110171246876,5
2022-10-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/564406-mass-burial-video-investigation/,Russia opens probe over Ukrainian Neo-Nazi's ‘mass grave’ video,"Russia’s Investigative Committee has opened a probe over a disturbing video showing what are believed to be massacred civilians thrown into a mass grave. The news was announced by the body’s head, Aleksandr Bastrykin, on Monday. The footage in question had been shared on social media by a notorious member of Ukraine’s neo-Nazi Azov regiment with a history of showing gruesome imagery of killed “pro-Russian” civilians. “Experts with the Russian Investigative Committee will take measures to establish the circumstances of the death of civilians, as well as all those involved in their torture and murder, in order to bring them to criminal justice,” the Committee said in a statement. The graphic clip was originally released online on Sunday by Maksim Zhorin, a Ukrainian officer and former senior commander of the neo-Nazi Azov regiment, which is outlawed in Russia. The far-right fighter said the video was shot in the town of Kupyansk, which recently taken by Ukrainian forces. The video shows a big hole dug in the ground with several bodies in civilian clothes lying semi-buried in it. Another body of an almost-naked man with his hands tied behind his back and legs held together by tape can be seen rolling down a steep slope into the pit. A shovel can be seen in the foreground, indicating that whoever shot the video was in the process of burying the bodies in a mass grave, while several men sporting military camouflage can be seen in the background. Zhorin initially said that the video showed “civilian population” and warned that “there will be retaliation.” Shortly after the publication of the disturbing footage, Zhorin altered his post, claiming the video was taken from a phone owned by an “occupant,” implying the murder had been committed by the Russian military. “However, the public raised alarm over the situation in the video. It indicates that the video was filmed recently, when the town was under the control of Ukrainian armed forces. The internal parameters of the video also show that it was filmed on the afternoon of October 9th. These facts speak of new war crimes by the Kiev regime,” the Committee noted. Zhorin is already known for posting graphic images of Russian soldiers, as well as of massacred civilians whom he accuses of being pro-Russian. In May, he released photos of apparent murder victims whom he identified as supporters of a Ukrainian opposition party. The extremely graphic imagery, deleted later by the neo-Nazi fighter, suggested the activists were brutally tortured and beaten to death.",3.086067984680788,2.407724712458527,0.6783432722222611,5

The decision follows missile strikes by Russia across the country, which the Kremlin said, were in response to terrorist actions by Kiev. “For security reasons, our teams have paused operations today,” an ICRC spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement. The spokesperson did not provide any estimates on when its activities might resume. Earlier on Monday, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said it had also halted its humanitarian work in the country until it was safe to resume. The suspension of activities by the aid groups comes in the aftermath of missile strikes on multiple locations across Ukraine, including the capital Kiev, launched by Russia early on Monday. The assault damaged 11 key infrastructure sites across the country, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal. At least ten people were killed and more than 60 injured in the attack, the Ukrainian national police said. The strikes came in retaliation for Kiev’s “terrorist” activities and attempts to target Russia’s critical civilian infrastructure, Russian President Vladimir Putin has confirmed. Over the past months, Ukraine has targeted high-voltage power lines connecting a Russian nuclear power plant to the electricity grid, attempted to sabotage an export gas pipeline, and ultimately, staged the blast that damaged the Crimea Bridge, the president said, warning that Moscow will no longer tolerate such “terrorist” tactics from Kiev.",2.0658357532584146,0.6129673676107948,1.4528683856476197,0

Commenting on the numerous missile strikes carried out across Ukraine on Monday morning, the former Russian leader said that that was a “first episode” and that “there will be others.” Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier on Monday confirmed that the major operation against Ukrainian infrastructure was in response to the October 8 attack on the Crimean Bridge. Moscow considers it an act of terrorism organized by the Ukrainian security services. Claiming that “the Kiev regime has been using terrorist methods for a very long time,” Putin warned Ukraine against further attacks on Russian soil.

2022-10-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/564404-russia-ukraine-counter-terrorism-operation/,Kremlin responds to rumored status change of Ukraine military operation,"Moscow has denied rumors that the military operation in Ukraine is being redesignated as a counter-terrorism campaign, following Kiev’s attack on the Crimean Bridge. When asked about the supposed change, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov replied: “Currently, no decisions have been made in this regard.” Previously, he said that the decision to designate the Russian campaign in Ukraine as a counter-terrorism operation can only be made by President Vladimir Putin. Peskov also said there have been no decisions on introducing martial law in Russian regions which have been targeted by Ukrainian strikes in recent weeks. Moscow’s campaign in Ukraine is officially designated as a ‘special military operation’. A ‘counter-terrorism operation’ (CTO), however, is a completely different matter in legal terms – it is intended to “uncover and prevent” an act of terrorism, minimize its effectiveness, and ultimately eliminate any threats to the population. A CTO also allows the government to call up more people to take part, including servicemen, the national guard, police, emergency workers, and others. The spokesperson’s comments come after Putin declared the recent attack on the Crimean Bridge, which connects mainland Russia with the Crimean Peninsula, an act of terrorism carried out by Ukraine’s security services (SBU). “The Kiev regime has been using terrorist methods for a very long time,” the president said on Monday, citing as examples the assassinations of public figures, and the indiscriminate shelling of Donbass cities and the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. “De facto, the Kiev regime has put itself on par with international terrorist groups, the most odious of them. Leaving such crimes without a response has become impossible,” he stated, before confirming that Russia had attacked Ukrainian infrastructure earlier in the day. On Monday morning, multiple regions of Ukraine came under heavy missile fire from Russian forces, with at least 11 key infrastructure facilities sustaining damage across the country, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal.

Speaking during a meeting with the governors of the Russian regions on Monday, Putin said: “Unfortunately, here, we have no shortage of stupidity.” He added, however, that had Moscow not declared the partial mobilization, “we would never have seen those problems that have accumulated there apparently for quite a while.” Putin concluded that the current situation presents a good opportunity to rectify those issues. The partial mobilization was declared on September 21. Since then, there have been numerous reports of people without the relevant combat experience or skills being mobilized in various regions. In some cases, even people with medical conditions that prevent them from military service unless war is declared have ended up being drafted. All of this runs counter to the criteria laid out by Putin. Some of the people who were wrongly mobilized were eventually returned home after their cases were covered by the media. In late September, the governor of Russia’s Dagestan Region, Sergey Melikov, was caught on camera berating his subordinates for their overzealousness in carrying out the partial mobilization. The official was apparently so infuriated that he used some very strong language during the meeting. Melikov’s wrath was caused by reports of a police car driving around with a loudspeaker on and calling on all male residents of the city of Derbent to “urgently come” to the local military recruitment center. The governor described the local authorities’ move as a case of “utter stupidity” and nothing short of “spreading fake information.” “What f**king idiots are these?” Melikov inquired, referring to the Derbent city officials. The Dagestan governor also posted a message on his Telegram channel apologizing to local residents and promising to punish those responsible. Later on, the head of Derbent’s recruitment office recorded a video in which he also asked for forgiveness. The city authorities explained that they had resorted to such an unconventional approach for lack of up-to-date data on Derbent’s male population in terms of health conditions and marital status.",2.582065333787646,2.6809677042752176,-0.09890237048757156,6

The office of Valery Zaluzhny, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, claimed that at least 75 missiles were fired at his country, and the air defenses intercepted 41.

He said the move comes in response to increased aggression from Kiev and the West. The Belarusian leader said that the plan was decided on when he held a face-to-face meeting with Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an informal CIS summit in St. Petersburg last week. “In response to the aggravation on the western border of the Union State [of Russia and Belarus], we agreed to deploy a regional grouping of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus,” Lukashenko said. He noted that since most of Russia’s troops are currently busy with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the core of this joint force will consist of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus, but there will nevertheless be “more than one thousand Russian soldiers.” Lukashenko added that the formation of this group has been under way for the past two days. He also claimed that Kiev is currently planning to carry out attacks against Belarus and is being pushed to do so by the West. “Kiev is not just discussing, but is planning an attack on the territory of Belarus. Of course, the Ukrainians absolutely don’t need this. Why would they open a second front on our southern borders? What for? This is complete madness from a military point of view,” Lukashenko said. “But, nevertheless, the process has begun. They are being pushed by their masters to start a war against Belarus to pull us into the conflict. To simultaneously deal with both Russia and Belarus,” he said. According to Lukashenko, Minsk has already been warned through “unofficial channels” that an attack on Belarus from the territory of Ukraine is imminent. He claims that Kiev is threatening to carry out a series of attacks on Belarus and has already amassed up to 15,000 troops near the border. The Belarusian leader said that Kiev had threatened him with a “Crimean Bridge 2,” referring to the recent attack on the bridge connecting mainland Russia with the Crimean peninsula, blamed by Moscow on Ukrainian special services. “My response to this was simple,” Lukashenko said. “Tell the President of Ukraine and other lunatics that the Crimean Bridge will seem like flowers to them if they touch even one meter of our territory with their filthy hands.” Kiev has officially denied threatening an attack on Belarus, dismissing it as a ploy by Moscow to “stage a provocation.”",2.0329761242814604,4.348556027485381,-2.315579903203921,8
2022-10-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/564383-hungary-defends-ties-russia/,Hungary defends ties with Russia,"Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has defended his recent meeting with Russia’s top diplomat Sergey Lavrov, explaining that somebody has to talk to Moscow to keep Hungarian homes warm in winter. He was referring to the looming energy crisis in Europe, exacerbated by EU sanctions on Moscow and a sharp decrease in Russian energy supplies. In an interview with Hir TV on Sunday, Szijjarto said that his talks with Lavrov on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last month served as an opportunity to discuss urgent energy supply matters. “So when the excellent opposition colleagues describe how stupid this was, let them think that while there might not be warm elsewhere, they will have heating in their apartments. Because someone had to talk (to Russia),” he said. Szijjarto explained that there is currently “only one gas pipeline in Europe that runs from east to west and operates at 100%” – TurkStream, which delivers Russian gas to Hungary via Türkiye, Bulgaria and Serbia. Russian energy giant Gazprom, Szijjarto noted, has been fulfilling all its obligations towards Serbia. He revealed that he had also discussed Hungary’s overdue payments for gas. Last week, state-owned energy company MVM announced that it had reached an agreement with Gazprom to defer its payments for the winter. Szijjarto said that he views foreign policy as “a tool to make the country better off.” Admitting that his meeting with Lavrov may not be seen by the media as “a high-flying story,” he noted, “But what is foreign policy for, if not for this?!” In an interview with RIA Novosti last month, he expressed regret that he was the only representative of the EU to meet with Lavrov during the General Assembly. If there is no dialogue with Russia, “everything can go even worse than it was before,” he warned. Hungary is heavily dependent on Moscow for energy and gets around 80% of its gas from Gazprom. While Russia has cut off gas supplies to a number of countries, Hungary signed a deal with Moscow in late August for additional deliveries on top of already agreed volumes. Hungarian President, Viktor Orban, has accused the EU leadership of causing a continent-wide energy crisis by sanctioning Russian energy. President Vladimir Putin previously likened the bloc's attempts to cut itself off from Russian fossil fuels to economic “suicide.”",2.858746187867054,4.104462319871234,-1.2457161320041803,8
2022-10-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/564385-putin-promises-response-ukraine-terrorism/,Russian strikes a response to Ukrainian ‘terrorism’ — Putin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that any further Ukrainian “terrorist” assaults on Russian soil will be met with a significant military response. He was speaking after a wave of missiles struck Ukraine on Monday morning. Putin confirmed that Russian troops carried out “massive strikes with long-range precision weapons on Ukrainian objects of energy, and military control and communications.” The response came two days after an explosion damaged the strategic Crimean Bridge, for which officials in Kiev claimed responsibility. “If there are further attempts to conduct terrorist attacks on our soil, Russia will respond firmly and on a scale corresponding to the threats created against Russia,” Putin added. Earlier in the day, multiple regions of Ukraine came under missile strikes, with at least 11 key infrastructure facilities damaged, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal. Putin stated that Russia was retaliating for a number of attempts to strike Russian infrastructure that have been attributed to Kiev. Among other things, Ukraine has damaged high-voltage power lines that transmit electricity generated by the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, tried to sabotage the TurkStream natural gas pipeline, and was behind Saturday’s explosion that damaged the Crimean Bridge, Putin stated. “The Kiev regime has been using terrorist methods for a very long time,” the Russian president said, citing targeted assassinations of public figures, the indiscriminate shelling of Donbass cities and of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant as examples of such actions. “De facto, the Kiev regime has put itself on par with international terrorist groups, the most odious of them. Leaving such crimes without a response has become impossible,” he stressed, before confirming that Russia had attacked Ukrainian infrastructure. In addition to blaming Ukraine for the series of attacks on Russian infrastructure, Putin mentioned the disabling of the Nord Stream undersea pipelines. He said that Russia was being barred by European nations from investigating the sabotage and reiterated that “we all know well the ultimate beneficiary of that crime.” Putin made the remarks as he chaired a meeting of Russia’s National Security Council. The sabotage of the power lines connected to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant was reported in mid-August. According to Russia's security agency, the FSB, Ukrainian agents launched a series of attacks and took down six transmission towers, endangering power supply to the border Kursk Region and other parts of Russia. The attempt to destroy Russian energy infrastructure used to supply hydrocarbons to Türkiye and southern Europe was reported by the FSB last month. Unlike with the incidents in Kursk Region, the would-be saboteur was captured and evidence was collected that the suspect was doing the bidding of Ukraine, according to law enforcement. Saturday’s explosion on the Crimean Bridge, a key link between the peninsula and mainland Russia, killed several civilians and partially collapsed the portion of the bridge used by vehicles. Aleksandr Bastrykin, the head of the Russian Investigative Committee, reported to Putin on Sunday that Ukraine was behind the crime, with the Russian leader concurring that there was “no doubt” about it.",1.7226930633582482,3.458390949213624,-1.735697885855376,0

In an interview, Medvedev, who is now the deputy head of the Security Council, made it clear that he had no doubt who was behind the blast targeting the strategic link between Russia’s Crimean peninsula and the mainland. “This crime was commissioned and executed by the failed state of Ukraine. This is a terrorist act and sabotage committed by the criminal Kiev regime,” he said, adding that authorities had already reached their conclusion. “Russia’s response to this crime can only be the elimination of the terrorists. In a way which is accepted in the world,” he reiterated. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Ukrainian intelligence was behind the deadly attack on the bridge when he met with the head of the national Investigative Committee, Aleksandr Bastrykin. Bastrykin, reported that “this was a terrorist act organized by the Ukrainian security services,” which was aimed at destroying major civilian infrastructure. Two US outlets, the New York Times and the Washington Post, also claimed that sources had confirmed the explosion was orchestrated by Ukraine’s intelligence services. At the same time, Ukrainian officials stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack, but cheered the explosion, with an aide to President Vladimir Zelensky, Mikhail Podoliak, saying that it was “just the beginning,” adding that “everything illegal must be destroyed.” The powerful blast rocked the bridge early Saturday morning, killing at least three people and causing a partial collapse of the road section, as well as a blaze on a parallel railway span where seven fuel tanks caught fire.

In an interview with the TV channel Rossiya 1, fragments of which were released on Sunday, Peskov claimed that the Americans are now making “crazy money” by selling gas to European states at exorbitant prices. “And Europeans pay them, thereby depriving their economy of competitiveness. Production is collapsing. Deindustrialization is coming. All this will have very, very deplorable consequences for the European continent over probably, at least, the next 10-20 years,” Peskov said. He emphasized that in the past, there was “a mutual balance,” as Russia was interested in buyers of its energy resources as much as they were interested in Russia. However, Peskov argued, the EU started to repeat “like a mantra” that it had to rid itself of its dependency on Russian energy, and this eventually resulted in the current situation. The Americans are selling gas at prices that are “three or even four” times higher than Russian gas, Peskov said, adding that “the Europeans are making their economy less competitive as they pay” such money to US suppliers. Gas prices in Europe surged earlier this year in the wake of Russia launching its military operation in Ukraine in late February. After the EU and Western countries, outside the bloc, imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow and began a campaign of cutting themselves off from Russian energy supplies, gas prices hit record highs, leading to a rise in overall inflation on the continent.

The pair was travelling to Crimea to shoot a documentary about the last Russian emperor. The victims of the attack were Eduard, 53, and Zoya, 33, who were husband and wife, Mash wrote. Zoya was a professional historian and journalist, while Eduard specialized in the history and architecture of St. Petersburg. They created two YouTube channels in 2020, where they had begun publishing documentaries. The channels currently only feature a series about the last Russian emperor, Nikolai II, and his family titled: ‘The Last Romanovs. The fall of the empire.’ “This is a small family project,” a description to the channel reads, adding that the couple’s “philosophy is to ‘say no to boring documentaries’.” Eduard and Zoya reportedly planned to shoot another part of their documentary in Crimea when they set off for the peninsula, Mash said. According to the media outlet, they sought to visit the Livadia Palace, the former summer retreat of Nikolai II, which also hosted the Yalta Conference that brought together Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. The couple were travelling together with a friend from Moscow, a judge identified as Sergey, who also had a house in Crimea, where the friends had planned to stay for a month, Mash said, claiming that there was also a fourth person in their car, a man identified only as Gleb.

Ukrainian forces have fortified the border ""to the extent that they put anti-tank mines in three rows on the roads,"" Lappo said. The troops Kiev has sent to the border are “not border guards,” Lappo claimed. “We are under pressure, they are aiming at our border guards, sometimes they shoot in the air, constant aerial reconnaissance is being carried out,” he added.

German news outlets first mentioned the potential delivery last weekend following Lambrecht’s surprise visit to the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, where she met with Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov. Kiev has long demanded Western battle tanks from Washington and its allies, including Germany’s Leopard 2 tanks, though Western nations have so far been reluctant to send them. Last weekend, Lambrecht defended the strategy of providing Ukraine with Soviet armored vehicles, arguing it would be better for both sides.

Vladimir Konstantinov, the head of the republic’s State Council, claimed that “Ukrainian vandals have finally managed to get their bloodstained hands on the Crimean Bridge.” The powerful blast rocked the bridge early Saturday morning, causing a partial collapse of the road on the vehicle section, as well as a blaze on a parallel railway span where seven fuel tanks caught fire. According to Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee, the bridge was damaged by a truck that exploded while making its way across the bridge. The blast caused at least three deaths.",2.4007154707786924,3.8943203477600763,-1.4936048769813839,0
2022-10-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/564338-loneliness-russia-agency-proposal/,Russian MP proposes state agency to combat ‘loneliness’,"A senior MP of the Russian State Duma’s health committee, Sergey Leonov, has called for the creation of an ‘Agency for Loneliness Affairs’. He cited official data, which shows that over five million citizens are struggling with mental disorders. Speaking to RIA Novosti news agency on Sunday, Leonov explained that an institution such as this would help people cope with mental issues often caused by “pathological loneliness.” “We consider the development of tools for psychological assistance to citizens as one of the important tasks. To organize this work, it is necessary to create an Agency for Loneliness Affairs,” Leonov, who is also the first deputy head of the right-wing Liberal Democratic Party, said. Referring to Health Ministry figures, he noted that more than five million people in Russia are struggling with mental disorders. While only a small number of people are suffering from severe illnesses, Leonov said, more common conditions, such as insomnia or depression, also need to be targeted. He added that residents of large cities are especially prone to mental issues, as many of them live in “office – TV – bed mode.” “Therefore, primary psychological assistance should become publicly available,” the MP said, adding that the stigma attached to psychological assistance should also be dealt with. A study conducted in March by the Russian Institute of Public Opinion revealed that over the previous year, 78% of respondents had experienced issues which were difficult to endure without support from other people. Only 9% sought the help of psychiatric professionals, and only 2% saw them regularly. Leonov pointed out that the position of ‘minister for loneliness’ exists in Britain and Japan, and that they are tasked with “developing programs for psychological support for citizens.” The UK government created the post of minister for loneliness in January 2018 to tackle the problem, which affects around 9 million people in the country, both young and old. The move comes one month after the publication of a Commission on Loneliness report which revealed that loneliness is as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Japan appointed a minister for loneliness last year in response to the country’s first increase in suicide rates since 2009, which was fueled by Covid-19 social distancing measures. Working women and single mothers were listed as the most vulnerable groups, so the government pledged to provide them with targeted support.",2.790795549714008,3.203521618304186,-0.41272606859017813,7
2022-10-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/564217-ukraine-vs-freedom-of-speech/,"Ukraine is preparing a law on full control over the media, as the last vestiges of press freedom disappear in Kiev","While fierce battles continue to rage between the Ukrainian and Russian armies in Donbass, Kherson Region, and Zaporozhye, the Kiev regime is busy eradicating the last vestiges of freedom of speech in the country. On August 30, Ukraine’s rubber-stamp parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, passed a bill on the media at the first reading. Despite the numerous changes that the 300-page document has undergone since President Vladimir Zelensky’s team developed and submitted it a few years ago, its essence remains unchanged. If it becomes law, the authorities’ power over virtually all outlets will be essentially limitless. The main danger this bill presents is that it grants government agencies the authority to block internet resources without any court proceedings, and revoke licenses from broadcast and print media solely on the basis of complaints. This huge power would be vested in the National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting. Ukrainian journalists have been criticizing this bill since the first version appeared in 2018, asserting that it abolishes both freedom of speech and freedom of the press. OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Harlem Desir called that version of the law “a blatant violation of freedom of speech,” stating that its adoption “could jeopardize pluralism in the media market, impose additional costs on the media, and negatively affect the reflection of a diversity of ideas and opinions.” Criticism of the bill from both the OSCE and Ukrainian journalists had an effect. In 2020, it was sent for revision, but the changes only include some clarifications concerning gender equality and coverage of sexual orientations. At the same time, it still contains a ban on publishing any messages contradicting the official government line on military issues. It is likewise forbidden to cover speeches made by officials of the ‘aggressor country’ [meaning Russia] or cast former USSR party functionaries in a positive light. For example, including Ukraine's own Leonid Brezhnev. The law would also hold foreign media responsible for any of its audiovisual content available in Ukraine. Moreover, social networks, including foreign ones, will be obliged to remove any material the National Council deems undesirable. The deadlines for removing ‘incorrect’ content or replacing it with ‘correct’ material have also been tightened. Among the ‘offenses’ that can get a media outlet banned is distributing programs in which any participant is on the ‘list of persons who pose a threat to the national media space of Ukraine.’ This is compiled by the National Council itself and does not require anyone’s consent. Otherwise, the essence and spirit of the bill is preserved, including severe censorship of ""objectionable"" media. The American Committee for the Protection of Journalists (CPJ) didn’t call on the Verkhovna Rada to reject Bill No. 2693-D ‘On Media’ for nothing. Maya Sever, president of the European Federation of Journalists, has bluntly stated that it means compulsory media regulation “fully controlled by the government worthy of the worst authoritarian regimes.” She is convinced that “a state that would apply such provisions simply has no place in the European Union.” Kiev's war on journalists did not begin today. In 2000, there was the abduction and death of Georgiy Gongadze, the creator of the ‘Ukrainian Truth’ website, who harshly criticized corruption in the country’s highest echelons of power. A number of high-ranking officials were accused of being involved in the murder of the journalist, who then-President Leonid Kuchma viewed as objectionable, but the investigation revealed the involvement of only four perpetrators. One of these was the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs’ main Criminal Investigation Department, General Pukach, who allegedly gave the order to liquidate Gongadze. Nevertheless, there are many grey areas in the case. It was highly politicized and used as one of the pretenses for demanding a change of power during the days of the Orange Revolution. Anatoly Shariy, who was engaged in high-profile investigative journalism for a number of Ukrainian publications from 2008 to 2011, almost shared Gongadze’s fate. In 2011, a non-staff employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs tried to intimidate the journalist, and a month later an attempt was made on his life. However, afterwards, the Ukrainian police said that Shariy himself was to blame. As a result, fearing for his life, Shariy was forced to flee the country and officially registered in the EU as a political refugee. Human Rights Watch’s report for 2011 cited his situation as proof that the situation for journalists was deteriorating in Ukraine. But the persecution of Shariy did not end there. In 2013 and 2015, Ukraine tried to get his political refugee status revoked and have him extradited back home through Interpol and direct appeals to the Netherlands and Lithuania – this time due to views he published on the war in Donbass. The Ukrainian authorities, including ex-president Pyotr Poroshenko, have also repeatedly sought to have Shariy’s social network accounts closed. It is noteworthy that Shariy’s name has also been brought up in current discussions of the scandalous media bill. In justifying her support for the legislation, the head of the Board of the National Association of Ukrainian Media, Tatiana Kotyuzhinskaya, mentioned the authorities’ desire to limit the influence of Shariy and other bloggers in Ukraine’s infosphere. It’s possible that, among other things, the reason the blogger’s activities have met with such disapproval was his publication of screenshots from messages sent by the Consul of Ukraine in Hamburg, Vasily Marushchinets, which contained calls for “death to anti-fascists,” comments like “it’s honorable to be a fascist,” and statements in the spirit of “Jews declared war on Germany back in March of 1934.” It was only after this that Nazi views in Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry became widely known to the public. Although the Ukrainian media has always had to fight the authorities’ attempts to restrict its activities, it was the Western-backed 2014 Euromaidan that triggered systematic persecution of press freedom in general, and individual journalists in particular. Less than a month after the coup the new government tried to close down one of the two most widely read Ukrainian weeklies specializing in news analysis, '2000', which took a negative view of the political forces that had violently seized power. The newspaper’s editorial offices were ransacked, and many left-wing outlets were shuttered. In particular, these included Borotba, as well as Rabochaya Gazeta, whose editor-in-chief ended up in the dungeons of Ukraine’s secret police, the SBU. In the same year, Konstantin Dolgov, the editor-in-chief of ‘Glagol’, an online publication based in Kharkov, and Andrey Borodavka, a journalist, were arrested and persecuted by the new authorities. Olga Kievskaya, editor-in-chief of the ‘Anti-Orange’ website, was forced to emigrate due to threats to burn her face with sulfuric acid. Meanwhile, Borotba journalists Andrey Manchuk and Evgeny Golyshkin were attacked by Maidan activists, and another journalist, Sergei Rulev, was captured and tortured in Kiev in March. Kiev reporter Alexander Chalenko, well-known analyst Rostislav Ishchenko, and Orthodox journalists Dmitry Zhukov and Igor Druz were all forced to leave Ukraine immediately after Euromaidan due to threats to their lives. Konstantin Kevorkian, director of Kharkov’s First Capital TV company, was expelled from the National Union of Journalists for dissent and arrested, while Valery Kaurov, editor-in-chief of Orthodox Telegraph, an Odessa church newspaper, fled abroad due to criminal charges of ‘separatism’ that have become standard in today’s Ukraine. The vast majority of these cases were not covered in the Ukrainian media because these people were immediately declared “subversive elements” based on the so-called “moratorium on criticism of the authorities,” which the authorities announced themselves back in March of 2014, long before the start of hostilities in Donbass. In 2018, Igor Guzhva, the head of the ‘strana.ua’ website, was forced to flee to Austria, where he received political asylum. The authorities’ efforts to prosecute him began after his investigations into Pyotr Poroshenko’s scandalous commercial activities. Later, under Zelensky, Ukraine imposed personal sanctions on Guzhva, and his website was blocked extrajudicially, while he himself, along with one of his journalists, Svetlana Kryukova, were entered into the ‘Register of State Traitors’. According to the head of Ukraine’s Union of Journalists, Sergey Tomilenko, these sanctions are political, and the European Federation of Journalists issued a statement condemning these actions as “a threat to the press, freedom, and media pluralism in the country.” But not all Ukrainian journalists managed to emigrate, even after surviving prison. In April of 2015, the famous Ukrainian writer-historian and journalist Oles Buzina died at the hands of ‘Patriots of Ukraine’ after receiving threats and attacks due to his views. Despite appeals from the UN, the authorities have hampered the investigation in every possible way, and the murder suspects are still at large, evidence notwithstanding. In July of 2016, another journalist, Pavel Sheremet, was killed by participants in Kiev’s ‘Anti-Terrorist Operation’ (ATO) and supporters of the “purity of the white race.” “Government critics, journalists, and non-profit organizations have come under increasing pressure from the authorities and far-right groups, which have embarked on the path of infringing freedom of speech and freedom of association under the pretext of countering Russian aggression,” Amnesty International said in a 2017 report. Since the first half of 2014, even calling for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of the country has been considered a crime in Ukraine. In particular, Ruslan Kotsaba, a journalist who refused to be drafted due to the consequences of a stroke, was imprisoned for this reason. In fairness, it should be noted that he was acquitted by an Appeals Court after a year and a half of imprisonment. A few years before the start of Russia’s military operation, journalists whose material was published in the Russian media were subject to criminal prosecution. Thus, on August 1, 2017, a Zhytomyr journalist, Vasily Muravitsky, was arrested on charges of high treason and spent almost a year in prison. His offense was writing about social processes in Ukraine and the activities of the Amber Mafia, whose patrons dwell in the highest echelons of the Ukrainian government. The court considered having contracts with Russian news agencies to be “evidence of high treason.” The journalist’s political persecution has been noted by a number of international organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists (USA), Reporters Without Borders, the International Human Rights Organization Solidarity Network, Amnesty International, the UN Human Rights Department, and the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. The persecution of journalists has even affected American citizens. In August of 2014, Alina Yepremyan, a journalist for the Ruptly video agency, was detained and deported from the country after her Ukrainian colleagues reported her to the Security Service of Ukraine. Her offense was shooting a story on draft protests in the Transcarpathian region. In 2018, a report was published by OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Harlem Desir in which he asserts that he had handed the Ukrainian authorities more than 20 statements and appeals collected from July 6 to November 21, 2018, concerning freedom of speech and the rights of journalists in Ukraine. The ‘least serious’ of these included wiretapping the phones of Natalia Sedletskaya, a journalist for the ‘Skhema’ program, and Kristina Berdinsky, a correspondent for Novoye Vremya, as well as a harassment campaign directed against Oksana Romanyuk, the head of the Institute of Mass Media, due to some slips of the tongue. A much more serious violation was the detention of Yusuf Inan, a Turkish opposition journalist with a Ukrainian residence permit, who was deported back to Turkey by the SBU. In August 2018, Associated Press photographer Efrem Lukatsky fell victim to a police attack with the use of gas. Desir also drew the authorities’ attention to the arson of the house of Artur Zhurbenko, a journalist engaged in anti-corruption investigations. He went on to note how ICTV journalist Yulia Gunko was attacked while filming, how ‘Stop Corruption’ journalist Kristina Krishiha had her video reports obstructed, and how neo-Nazis attacked Newsone correspondent Darina Biler on live TV. The report also pointed out that the authorities were not investigating the attempted murder of another journalist, Grigory Kozma. In conclusion, the report mentions the lot of Kirill Vyshinsky, the editor-in-chief of the Ukrainian branch of RIA Novosti, who was accused of ‘high treason’ for working for ‘aggressor’ media. Vyshinsky spent one year and three months in prison before finally being exchanged for Ukrainian prisoners of war. No investigation ever took place into the murder of anti-corruption activist Ekaterina Gadziuk by ‘ATO’ activists. Desir’s report also emphasizes the role of the Security Service of Ukraine in pressuring and persecuting journalists. In particular, Ukrainian counterintelligence agents forced Vyacheslav Seleznev, a journalist for the Strana.ua online newspaper, to inform on the already mentioned editor-in-chief of the publication, Guzhva. Desir also drew attention to a decision made by the Lviv Regional Council to ban all Russian-language content. Exactly the same measures have already been taken in the Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions. The OSCE representative expressed outrage at the sanctioning of the NewsOne and 112 Ukraine TV channels, and also expressed concern that analogue broadcasting of the UA:First TV channel had been terminated in a number of regions, which, in his opinion, could significantly limit access to information for the populations of these areas. We have specifically chosen the report of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, which was published quite some time ago, to demonstrate that the attitude of the Ukrainian authorities towards freedom of speech and the right of journalists to freely express their own opinions have long-standing roots, and their persecution is systemic. Any similar report covering any period from 2014 to the present would contain no fewer instances of violations of these rights and freedoms. The whole list would require a decent-sized book to document. In particular, the persecution of the Ukrainian TV channel Inter, which very actively supported Euromaidan and the ‘ATO’, but suddenly became objectionable to the Ukrainian authorities and neo-Nazis, does not fit within the time frame of Desir’s report. In the second half of 2016, the premises of the TV channel were subjected to ransacking and arson twice, and it was blocked for two days when the attackers brought an anti-tank mine into it. Despite all this, the police did nothing. Six detainees were immediately released upon presenting documents attesting to their participation in the ‘ATO’ in eastern Ukraine. Though a criminal case was opened, none of the perpetrators were ever arrested and the attack was never investigated, despite condemnation from the OSCE. The fact that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine supported the bill ‘On Media’ gives reason to fear that the situation for the country’s journalists will become even worse. Once again, the Zelensky regime has confirmed that it's not building a democratic, but an authoritarian or even totalitarian state, which has no room for such concepts as freedom of speech and the press.",2.7226850952592265,4.322720426773051,-1.6000353315138245,5

The ministry went on to say that Ukraine has never encroached on other countries’ territory, urging the Belarusian authorities to “cease kowtowing to the Kremlin’s whims and immediately stop supporting Russia in its aggression.” Earlier this week, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko blasted Kiev, claiming that the Ukrainian military is engaged in repeated attempts to stage provocations on the nation’s border. He noted that Kiev had amassed up to 15,000 troops near the border, while setting up positions and conducting reconnaissance against Belarus’ military. Lukashenko insists that while Minsk is taking part in Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, its role is limited. He said that Belarus is preventing the conflict from spreading into its territory while making sure that “nobody would shoot Russians in the back from the territory of Belarus.” On Friday, the Belarusian Defense Ministry stated that it has the capacity to field 500,000 trained troops “if the need arises.”",2.551475972249776,2.912660368363509,-0.36118439611373265,8

We know about representatives from more than 30 different countries,” Rogov said. He went on to say that Ukraine has been deploying to the area both mercenaries and troops from the western part of the country in order to instill terror in local residents who voted in the recent referendums. In late September, Zaporozhye, along with Kherson Region and the two Donbass republics, voted overwhelmingly in referendums to join Russia. On Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin signed into law unification treaties with the former Ukrainian territories, officially making them part of Russia. Zaporozhye Region is also home to a nuclear power plant, which has been under Russian control since March. It has been repeatedly shelled throughout the conflict. Moscow has accused Ukraine of attacking the facility, while Kiev blames the Russian forces. Russia has on numerous occasions conducted strikes on foreign fighters in Ukraine, including with high-precision weapons. Moscow has also warned that the best thing mercenaries from other countries can expect in Ukraine is a “long term in prison.” On September 21, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed that Russian forces and the militias of the Donbass republics had eliminated more than 2,000 mercenaries, with 1,000 foreign fighters remaining in the ranks of the Ukrainian military.",3.728133384622859,4.0587082365697285,-0.3305748519468694,2
2022-10-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/564317-crimean-bridge-explosion-truck-driver/,Crimean Bridge blast: What is known about the truck and its driver?,"On Saturday morning, the Crimean Bridge – the longest in Europe, which links the peninsula to mainland Russia over the Kerch Strait – was damaged in an explosion. Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said that a truck blew up as it was traveling along the 19km-long structure. CCTV videos appear to back up that conclusion. Three people, including the driver, were killed in the blast, which temporarily halted both road and railway traffic and led to a partial collapse of the highway section of the bridge. RT has gathered information on what is known so far. According to Russian news outlet Mash, the truck traveled across Russia’s southern Krasnodar Region for some time before the incident. For several days, the vehicle reportedly moved through the western part of the province, including the Taman Peninsula, which is linked to Crimea through the bridge. Later, it reportedly went north before “disappearing” from CCTV footage for around six hours on the night before the incident. Early Saturday, it is said to have re-appeared in a village which is a 30-minute drive from the last place it was spotted. One hour later, it drove to the bridge and exploded, according to Mash. Russian authorities have neither confirmed nor denied the report. According to the Baza Telegram channel, the vehicle was owned by a Russian national identified as Samir Yusubov. The channel also published a video of a 26-year-old man who claimed to be Yusubov, and added that he was the owner of the truck. He denied having any role in the incident. “I have nothing to do with what happened on the Crimean Bridge,” he said in the video. Yusubov also claimed that he is not even in Russia right now, and the truck was used by his “uncle” – his father’s cousin, Makhir Yusubov – who reportedly works in freight transportation. The man also said that his ‘uncle’ took transport orders from a website, without providing any further details. Baza reported, citing Yusubov’s relatives, that Makhir was the de-facto owner of the truck. The channel also said that relatives recognized him in one of the CCTV videos showing the truck undergoing a check prior to the incident. Mash added that Makhir has not been in contact with his relatives since at least October 6, two days prior to the incident. Russian business daily RBK claimed that the driver might have been unaware of what the truck was carrying. He supposedly received a fertilizer transport order, it reported, citing a security source who added that he was allegedly “kept in the dark.” Baza further reported that investigators searched the apartments of Makhir Yusubov’s relatives. However, Russian officials have not confirmed this and have yet to name any suspects.",4.126984840683448,2.604408798499731,1.5225760421837173,0
2022-10-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/564314-lithuania-nato-weapons-ukraine/,NATO should give Ukraine ‘everything we have’ – member state,"NATO countries should arm Ukraine with all available weapons, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told Ukrainian media on Saturday. However, he expects the alliance’s other members to foot the bill. “Ukraine needs ‘everything we have,’” Landsbergis told Ukrinform, arguing that the Ukrainian military is already capable of working with the alliance’s arsenal now that its troops are receiving training in multiple European countries. While the US has supplied Ukraine with increasingly powerful weaponry, some of its NATO allies have balked at handing over certain arms systems. Germany, for example, refuses to send its most modern Leopard II main battle tanks for fear of causing further escalation. Even in Washington, Pentagon officials have argued that Ukrainian troops would need substantial training to operate Western tanks. Landsbergis insisted that “these arguments no longer work,” after a series of successful offenses by Kiev’s forces, which are increasingly armed with NATO weapons. “If this is so, I see no reason why Ukraine should not be given everything we have?” the minister said. “I have already said this many times and now I will say it again.” Landsbergis has emerged as one of the most vocally anti-Russian ministers in the EU in the months since Moscow sent its forces into Ukraine. He has threatened Lithuanian entertainers with reprisals for performing in Russia, supported an EU-wide ban on all visas for Russians, and called on NATO to pursue the military defeat of Russia rather than seek a negotiated settlement to the Ukraine conflict. However, his own military has little to give Ukraine. Landsbergis told Ukrinform that he would only provide “political arguments” for arming Kiev’s forces, as Lithuania does not have its own “significant stockpile of weapons.” While Ukraine has repeatedly called for more and heavier weapons from the West, EU stockpiles are running low, with Germany’s stocks already exhausted as of early September. Although US President Joe Biden has vowed to keep the arms pipeline open for “as long as it takes,” the US is reportedly cautious about delivering more advanced weapons systems. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that Russia is now facing “the entire Western military machine” in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has also warned that “the US, in fact, is teetering on the brink of turning into a party to the conflict” due to its lavish assistance to Kiev.",2.315389660956101,2.578124229922678,-0.262734568966577,8

Local law enforcement officers are continuing to investigate the plot and are identifying other potential suspects, the MGB added. The security service also released a video purportedly showing one of the detained members of the cell, who admits the group had been tasked with mining a bridge and “some facilities” that “turned out to be kindergartens.” The identity of the man was not publicly revealed and his face in the video was blurred. Meanwhile, authorities in Kherson Region, which borders Crimea, reported having thwarted a terrorist act targeting a local administration office. The local security services “discovered and defused an improvised shrapnel-filled explosive device” with a yield equivalent to around 1kg of TNT, a Kherson emergency service spokesman told journalists. The local authorities did not provide any additional details about the matter. It is also unclear if any suspects linked to the incident had been identified.

On Saturday, Ukrainian officials and government agencies celebrated the blast, some with memes and tongue-in-cheek references, while others made threats. Senior presidential aide Mikhail Podoliak, an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who has previously called the bridge a legitimate target, tweeted that the explosion was “just the beginning.” He added: “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine.” Kiev’s top spy agency The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the country’s main intelligence agency, shared a photo of the damaged bridge and wrote: “The sun is rising, the bridge is burning beautifully.” The phrase is a play on a line from a poem by Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine’s national poet. Ukrainian news agency UNIAN quoted a source as saying that the SBU was behind the attack. Spokesman Artyom Dekhtyarenko, however, told UNIAN that the security service would only comment on whether it was involved in the blast “after our final victory.” Ukraine’s postal service Ukrposhta, Ukraine’s national postal service, unveiled stamps that it is planning to issue to commemorate the attack. They feature a reference to the 1997 film ‘Titanic’, as well as a Russian road sign with several letters crossed out and replaced to spell ‘Crimean Bridge’ in Ukrainian. Border guards and emergency service Ukraine’s border guard service reacted with a picture of a cat looking at a burning frying pan accompanied by a ‘warning’ that it was too “hot” to cross the bridge. The Emergency Service of Ukraine, meanwhile, posted a dog meme, advising the public to “enjoy the exciting footage of the fire on the Crimean Bridge.” Zelensky’s chief of staff Andrey Yermak, the head of Zelensky’s office, tweeted an emoji of a bridge submerged in water and wrote: “What a beautiful sunny day.” Kiev’s top security official Aleksey Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, took an apparent jab at Russian President Vladimir Putin, who turned 70 on Friday. Danilov posted a video of the aftermath of the explosion juxtaposed with the iconic clip of actress Marilyn Monroe singing ‘Happy Birthday, Mr. President’ for US President John F. Kennedy in 1962.",3.17001542693852,3.517431457817569,-0.34741603087904904,0
2022-10-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/564300-putin-west-deal-turkiye/,Putin wants ‘grand bargain’ – Erdogan aide,"Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to strike “a new grand bargain” with the West to erase the humiliations of the post-Cold War period, a top Turkish presidential adviser told CNN on Saturday. In an interview with the American broadcaster, Ibrahim Kalin predicted that the Ukraine conflict will inevitably end in a negotiated settlement, with the only question being when, “and how much damage will have been done by then?” Such a settlement will be about more than the borders of Russia and Ukraine, he continued, arguing that what Putin really aims to do is renegotiate the balance of power between Moscow and the West, after a weakened Russia accepted several rounds of NATO expansion in the aftermath of the Cold War. “Our understanding is that Mr. Putin wants to have a new grand bargain, a new deal, with the West,” Kalin said. The Turkish official referenced agreements signed by Moscow and NATO in the early 1990s – which included the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, which stated that the alliance would continue to expand, and the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Russia agreed not to use force against its neighbors – as decisions Putin would like to re-do. “The Russian perception is that the Russia of that day, that signed that agreement – that is, the Russia of the Gorbachevs and the Yeltsins – is over,” Kalin claimed. “There is a new Russia, there is a new world, there is a new reality, and they want to have a new bargain.” Putin declared last week that “the ongoing collapse of Western hegemony is irreversible,” and that “things will never be the same.” A multipolar world, he said, will give non-Western nations “an opportunity to strengthen their sovereignty.” According to Kalin, “This puts of course the entire global order, the liberal order, to a test.” He added: “So far the response has been war from both sides.” Western leaders have not indicated that they intend to negotiate an end to the Ukraine conflict in the near future. Washington’s official line is that it will continue to funnel tens of billions of dollars’ worth of arms to Kiev “for as long as it takes,” and will allow Ukraine to dictate its terms for ending the conflict. Amid the broader conflict between Russia and the West, Türkiye has positioned itself as a middleman, with Ankara hosting peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in March that ultimately broke down. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday called for both sides to return to negotiations, declaring that “even the worst peace will be better than war.”",3.8044030594075298,4.525040655331632,-0.7206375959241025,8

The veteran general has held the position of commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces since 2017. The same year, he was awarded the title of Hero of Russia for his role in the military operation in Syria. Before that, he also took part in hostilities in Chechnya. According to various media reports, Surovikin was given the nickname ‘General Armageddon’ by his colleagues, citing his hardline and unorthodox approach to military operations. Surovikin took charge of the ‘South’ grouping during Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. In late June, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that his troops had eliminated a major Ukrainian force encircled in the area of Gorskoye, in the Lugansk People’s Republic. The new appointment comes after Russian troops withdrew from the key town of Krasny Liman in the Donetsk People’s Republic to avoid encirclement, last week. The move sparked criticism from a number of Russian officials, who rebuked the military for not having organized more solid defenses. Meanwhile, some military analysts, and media figures, have become increasingly vocal with concerns about how the Ukraine operation is progressing.",3.24869287575579,2.607408972223926,0.6412839035318636,2
2022-10-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/564297-crimea-bridge-explosion-ukraine/,Crimean Bridge explosion: What we know so far,"A truck blew up on the Crimean Bridge early on Saturday, causing significant damage to a piece of infrastructure that is vital to Russia in its military operation in Ukraine. Three people were killed as a result of the blast, which temporarily halted both automobile and railway traffic. What happened? The powerful explosion occurred on the Crimean Bridge, which connects the Russian peninsula of Crimea to the country’s Krasnodar Region, at around 6am local time on Saturday. It caused a partial collapse of the road used by automobiles and a blaze on a parallel railway section where seven fuel tanks caught fire. Traffic on the whole bridge was stopped due to the incident. Russia’s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said that a truck blew up as it was traveling along the 19-km-long structure. The CCTV videos from the scene also showed a lorry exploding. At least three people were killed as a result of the explosion, according to the Investigative Committee. They’re believed to be the driver and passengers of a car that was attempting to overtake the truck at the moment it blew up. Two bodies have already been retrieved from the waters of the Kerch Strait. Helicopters were deployed to tackle the blaze, which was extinguished several hours after the explosion. The undamaged part of the bridge was reopened with one lane available for traffic in both directions starting at 4pm local time, the Transport Ministry said. Trains will be running again from 8pm, it added. It’s not yet clear how long it will take to repair the damaged section. The Crimean authorities said that ferry service would also be provided to those looking to cross between the peninsula and mainland. A criminal investigation has been launched, with law enforcement agencies having already identified the owner of the truck that exploded as being a resident of Russia’s Krasnodar Region. A search has been carried out at the man’s home. How did the two sides react? Kiev stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack, but an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Mikhail Podoliak, warned Russia that what happened at the bridge was “just the beginning.” The incident was also celebrated on social media by Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) and the country’s Defense Ministry, with the latter claiming that one of the “notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea” has “gone down.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram that the reaction of Ukrainian officials testified to the “terrorist nature” of the government in Kiev. An unnamed Ukrainian government official told the Washington Post that Ukrainian special services were behind the explosion. This followed a report by Ukrainian outlet Ukrainska Pravda, which cited a source in the country’s security services, claiming that the attack was masterminded by the SBU. Why is the Crimean Bridge important? Construction of the bridge, which is also called the Kerch Bridge, started two years after Crimea overwhelmingly voted to join Russia in a referendum in 2014. It was completed in 2018, with the 19-km-long structure – the longest bridge in Europe – becoming a symbol of the peninsula’s reunification with Russia. During the conflict in Ukraine, Russia has been using the bridge to transport armored vehicles and other military hardware and cargo. Several Ukrainian officials and military commanders have in recent months issued threats that the bridge could become a target.",2.3183746687958027,2.8693687906707166,-0.5509941218749139,0

We will deploy them with full force if necessary,” Lavrov told Russian newspaper Argumenty i Fakty on Saturday. “Those speaking to Russia with the language of sanctions must remember that so far we have been responding to the acts of economic aggression in a rather restrained manner, and yet our patience is not limitless.” Many countries imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow in response to its military operation in Ukraine, which was launched in February. “They have failed to have the Russian economy hanging ‘in tatters’ … And they will continue to fail,” Lavrov added, referring to then-US President Barack Obama’s description of the intended effects of the sanctions in 2015. The foreign minister claimed that the economic restrictions backfired, spurring high inflation and energy shortages in the West. “This is the price ordinary citizens pay for the Russophobia of their politicians,” he said. Lavrov stated that Russia will focus on “strengthening its economic and technological sovereignty, establishing alternative financial and logistical chains to facilitate foreign trade.” To do this, Moscow will continue to foster trade ties in Asia, Africa, South America, and the Middle East, he said. The US imposed further restrictions last week, blacklisting additional companies and targeting more than 200 Russian legislators. The EU unveiled its eighth package of sanctions on Thursday, adding 30 individuals and seven entities to the blacklist. The new restrictions came after President Vladimir Putin signed treaties on the accession of four former Ukrainian territories to Russia. The Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining Russia in referendums held last month.

It also revealed that the bodies of two of the victims, a man and a woman, have already been recovered from the water and their identities are being established. According to the investigators, the explosion on the part of the bridge used by automobiles caused the ignition of seven fuel tanks of a train that was heading toward Crimea. The truck was owned by a resident of Russia’s Krasnodar Region, the committee said. A search of the owner's residence is now underway. “The route of the car and the corresponding documentation are being studied,” the statement reads. Earlier on Saturday, the All-Russian Union of Insurers estimated the damage caused to the bridge at 200-500 million rubles ($3.2-8 million). Since the launch of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in late February, various Ukrainian officials have promised to attack the Crimean Bridge, which is the only one connecting mainland Russia with Crimea.

""In the areas where attempts of a breakthrough are being made [by Kiev's forces], large quantities of manpower and hardware have been concentrated on the Ukrainian side,” Miroshnik said during an appearance on the Soloviev Live program on Friday. According to estimates by the LPR’s forces, “we’re talking about 40,000 men,” the official added. Kiev’s troops have been gathering to the north and northwest of the LPR, as well as in the area around the town of Krasny Liman in the neighboring Donetsk People’s Republic, from where Russian forces withdrew a week ago amid a Ukrainian offensive, Miroshnik elaborated. On Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin signed into law unification treaties with the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, officially making them part of Russia. The four territories overwhelmingly supported the move during referendums in late September. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

In a statement, the deputy defense minister, Colonel General Viktor Goremykin, said that the country’s Armed Forces “have all the necessary means to provide for all units and each serviceman in full.” Therefore, he explained, “there is no need to cancel New Year’s … events in the Russian regions in order to use the funds saved to provide for our military personnel, including those called up during the partial mobilization.” Goremykin thanked the regions for their “active support” of the armed forces, but described “the initiatives to cancel children’s holiday events” as “premature and unnecessary.” Earlier this week, three regions – Leningrad Region, which includes St. Petersburg, Belgorod Region, which borders Ukraine, and Kurgan Region in Siberia – said they would transfer money earmarked for the celebrations to support programs for draftees and their families. Several major cities, including St. Petersburg, also announced a reduction in the celebrations. The announcements were made amid reports of equipment shortages and poor living conditions at some of the military bases where the draftees are stationed.

The symbolic pronouncement came two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed laws accepting four former regions of Ukraine into the Russian Federation. Zelensky’s decree recognizes the islands of Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and the Habomai as Japan’s. While the entire Kurili archipelago has been Russian territory since the end of World War II, Japan claims these southernmost four as its own, referring to them as its “Northern Territories.” “An important decision was made today. Fair. Legally impeccable. Historical. Ukraine has reaffirmed its respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Japan, including its Northern Territories, which are still under Russian occupation,” Zelensky said in a video address. Zelensky – who has vowed to retake all of Ukraine’s former territory, including Crimea – declared that “it is necessary to liberate from Russian occupation all the lands that the occupiers are trying to keep.” Japan has condemned Russia’s military operation in Ukraine and imposed economic sanctions on Moscow. In March, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida declared the southernmost Kurils as “our ancestral territories,” after which Russia ended an agreement allowing Japanese citizens to visit the entire archipelago without visas, ceased joint economic activities with Tokyo on the islands, and broke off talks aimed at formally ending the dispute. The two states never formally concluded a peace treaty after WWII, due to the dispute over the four southernmost islands in the Kuril chain. Zelensky’s decree was likely a response to Putin’s signing last week of accession decrees welcoming the formerly Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye into the Russian Federation, after citizens of all four overwhelmingly voted to join Russia. Putin signed laws formalizing these provinces’ accession on Wednesday.

He really meant “preventive kicks,” he told the BBC in an interview that aired on Friday, with the British state broadcaster interpreting this as referring to sanctions. “I said you have to do preventive kicks, not attacks,” Zelensky told BBC’s John Simpson. Quoting him in the text accompanying the video, the BBC inserted the interpretation that this was “referring to sanctions.” This echoed the explanation offered by Zelensky’s spokesman Sergey Nikoforov, after the president’s initial remarks to the Lowy Institute in Australia went public and caused widespread outrage. “What should NATO do? Eliminate the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons,” Zelensky said, according to the translation of his remarks from Ukrainian. “I once again appeal to the international community, as it was before February 24: preemptive strikes so that they know what will happen to them if they use it, and not the other way around.” The phrase he used literally translates as “preemptive strikes,” with the word “udary” in Ukrainian meaning both “strikes” and “kicks.” How exactly the word could translate as “sanctions,” neither Nikoforov nor Zelensky offered to explain. “After that translation, they [the Russians] did their way, how it’s useful for them, and began to retranslate it in other directions,” Zelensky told the BBC, according to the article. He also claimed the Kremlin was preparing the Russian public for the use of atomic weapons. “They begin to prepare their society. That’s very dangerous. They are not ready to do it, to use it. But they begin to communicate. They don't know whether they'll use or not use it. I think it's dangerous to even speak about it,” he told Simpson, in English. The only Russian official to so much as suggest the use of nuclear weapons has been the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov. He was gently reprimanded for it by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who said that while regional heads are free to express their opinions, they cannot give free rein to their emotions, “even in difficult times.” Moscow has repeatedly and publicly committed to the joint position of the nuclear “Big Five” that an atomic war should never be fought. Russian nuclear doctrine allows the use of atomic weapons only in self-defense from an attack with weapons of mass destruction, or when the country’s survival is at stake due to a conventional threat.",4.865970562129929,2.6401013627333763,2.225869199396553,8

The news triggered concerns that Elon Musk may have done something to the service in response to Ukrainian denunciations of his peace plan, but the SpaceX magnate called the newspaper's article “bad reporting.” Musk gave Ukraine thousands of Starlink terminals back in March, helping Kiev’s military to “operate drones, receive vital intelligence updates and communicate with each other in areas where there are no other secure networks,” as the FT described it. In recent weeks, as Ukrainian forces moved into territory previously controlled by Russian forces, the systems stopped working on multiple occasions. One senior Ukrainian official told the FT this led to a “catastrophic” loss of communication, including during “pitched battles.” Failures were “widespread” and “prompted panicked calls from soldiers to helplines,” said another official. Roman Sinitsin, who runs a nonprofit that directs Starlinks to the Ukrainian military, said the problem may have been due to Musk’s SpaceX having a block on the signal in Russian-held areas. “It is absolutely clear to me that this is being done by representatives of Starlink to prevent the usage of their technology by Russian occupation forces,” Sinitsin told the FT, urging SpaceX to coordinate more closely with the Ukrainian military. The same theory was embraced by Aiden “Cossackgundi” Aslin, a British mercenary freed in a recent POW swap. “This is just a slight problem, I think will be fixed as temporary lines are drawn out,” he tweeted. FT’s sources described “acute” outages in the Kherson region – where Ukrainian forces advanced in recent days – but also Zaporozhye, where the frontline hadn’t changed. Meanwhile, two military sources said their Starlinks were working just fine in the recently captured areas of Kherson and Kharkov regions. Ukraine’s defense ministry and general staff declined to comment on the record. Reacting to the report, US Congressman Adam Kinzinger – an outspoken Ukraine supporter – tweeted that the outage “should be investigated” as a “national security issue.” The Illinois Republican’s concern came after Musk had made a peace proposal for Ukraine that was furiously rejected by both Kiev and its backers in the West. While Musk did not respond to the FT’s request for comment, he addressed the story publicly. “Bad reporting by FT,” he tweeted on Friday. “This article falsely claims that Starlink terminals & service were paid for, when only a small percentage have been. This operation has cost SpaceX $80M & will exceed $100M by end of year. As for what’s happening on the battlefield, that’s classified.” He later added that he was “in regular contact” with Ukraine’s digital minister Mikhail Fedorov, as well as “quite a few” other parties to the conflict. “Trying to do the right thing, which is not always clear,” Musk added.",3.61299703190333,3.343255825880438,0.2697412060228923,5

The Kremlin confirmed in June that Putin would attend the summit, although spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that the format of Putin’s participation “is still not defined.” Kiev stated in August that Zelensky “believes that he should be on the territory of Ukraine,” but would “think about” making the trip if Putin were to attend in person.

With Widodo having met both Zelensky and Putin earlier this summer in a bid to “invite the two leaders to open dialogue and stop the war,” Bagis told The National that Indonesia aims “to make the G20 a platform for peace, not conflict.” Biden also appears to have softened his exclusionary stance toward Putin, telling reporters on Thursday that it “remains to be seen” whether he would meet the Russian president on the sidelines of the summit. The State Department quickly stepped in to say that in the view of the entire government, “it cannot be business as usual when it comes to Russia.” Although Ukraine is not one of the world’s 20 largest economies, Zelensky was invited to Bali as a guest.",3.5922854906993678,2.9225654693001957,0.6697200213991721,8
2022-10-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/564258-peskov-putin-disagreement-false/,Washington Post lying about Kremlin ‘turmoil’ – Moscow,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that a Washington Post report alleging “turmoil” and confrontation in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle is “absolutely not true.” The report in question was attributed to anonymous US spies. “A member of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle has voiced disagreement directly to the Russian president” over the conflict in Ukraine, the report stated, alleging that “the criticism marks the clearest indication yet of turmoil within Russia’s leadership.” No source was given for this report, which was attributed to “information obtained by US intelligence.” Peskov told the Post that disagreement between Putin and his aides is “part of the usual working process.” “There are working arguments: about the economy, about the conduct of the military operation. There are arguments about the education system. This is part of the normal working process, and it is not a sign of any split,” he said, adding that the information supposedly obtained by American intelligence is “absolutely not true.” American officials have previously boasted about waging an “info war” against Russia by leaking false intelligence reports to the media, NBC News reported in April. Intelligence officials, for example, admitted to fabricating a warning that Russia was preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine in March, leaking the story to the Washington Post despite it being based on “low confidence” intelligence. A report claiming that Putin was “being misled by his own advisers” was also reportedly made up or exaggerated by US spies. “There’s no way you can prove or disprove that stuff,” a retired intelligence operative told NBC. The Post’s latest report was also received with doubt by the US’ European allies. According to the newspaper, “senior security officials in Europe said they were not aware that anyone had dared to challenge Putin directly over the course of events in Ukraine,” and said that they hadn’t seen the supposed US intelligence report that the article was based on.",2.6672768960436257,3.2891850627027224,-0.6219081666590967,8
2022-10-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/564262-russian-cities-cancel-new-year/,Russian cities cancel New Year celebrations,"Almost a dozen Russian cities, and at least three regions, have decided to either cancel or limit the upcoming New Year’s Eve celebrations amid the protracted conflict between Moscow and Kiev. Local officials will instead allocate the intended funds towards supporting people joining the Russian Armed Forces as part of the ongoing partial mobilization. The mayor of the city of Kaluga, Dmitry Denisov, was one of the first to announce the measure on Wednesday. Kaluga, which is located just around 200 kilometers southwest of Moscow, would cancel all the festivities planned for late December and early January, he said, adding that it would be better to spend money on local draftees. “The men should be equipped better than it is expected under regular supply standards,” Denisov said, adding that the city would not host concerts and fireworks displays and would instead “spend all the money” on supports for the local draftees. By Friday, Denisov’s initiative has been supported by the heads of the Siberian city of Tobolsk, the northern city of Cherepovets and the city of Nizhny Novgorod, in the Volga region. Mayor of St. Petersburg Aleksandr Beglov also said in a Telegram post that the city would cancel its traditional concerts at the Palace Square and Nevsky Avenue in the city center as well as a fireworks display. New Year’s Eve celebration events for children would, however, still go ahead as planned, he added. The Russian city of Yekaterinburg announced it would not give up on all celebrations completely but would “review” its New Year’s Eve program. Apart from the various cities, at least three Russian regions – Leningrad Oblast surrounding St. Petersburg, the Belgorod Oblast bordering Ukraine and Kurgan Oblast in Siberia also announced transfers of money from the celebration funds to support programs for draftees and their families. According to Russian media, people in the western Kaliningrad Oblast and in Voronezh Oblast in Central Russia are also calling on the regional authorities to join the initiative. More than 200,000 draftees had joined the Russian army by October 4 as part of the mobilization effort, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has revealed. On September 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a partial mobilization, looking to recruit some 300,000 reservists to take part in the ongoing military conflict with Ukraine, which began in late February. The Russian Defense Ministry has since clarified that the mobilization prioritizes those who have served in the military and who’ve had previous combat experience as well as the necessary specializations needed on the front line.",4.4027073510129835,2.8747639359364485,1.527943415076535,7
2022-10-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/564254-russia-nuclear-weapons-estonian/,Russia won’t use nukes – Estonia,"Russia will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, because doing so would not be militarily “reasonable,” Colonel Margo Grosberg of the Estonian military’s defense intelligence center told reporters on Friday. Nevertheless, Western pundits and politicians have repeatedly invoked warnings of nuclear war. “I stress that in military terms, the use of this type of a weapon is not reasonable in any way, it would not achieve an effect,” Grosberg said, according to Estonia’s ERR news broadcaster. However, amid reports in the British media that Moscow is preparing for exercises involving its nuclear forces, he added that “the nuclear threat must be kept in mind, but it is not very large.” The Kremlin dismissed the British report, saying it would not partake in “nuclear rhetoric” with the West. Talk of a possible Russian nuclear strike on Ukraine has reached fever pitch in the Western media in recent weeks, with American spies, diplomats, and President Joe Biden himself discussing such a strike as a realistic possibility. Speaking at a fundraiser in Washington on Thursday evening, Biden declared that “we have a direct threat of the use [of a] nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going,” warning that a nuclear detonation would lead to “Armageddon.” Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky called on Thursday for NATO to launch “preemptive strikes” against Russia during a discussion on nuclear weapons. While Zelensky’s aides later said the Ukrainian president was not referring to nuclear attacks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the statement amounted to an attempt to spark a world war, which would lead to “unforeseeable disastrous consequences.” Russia’s current nuclear doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons in the event of an initial nuclear strike on its territory or infrastructure, or if the existence of the Russian state is threatened by either nuclear or conventional weapons. Before four former Ukrainian regions were incorporated into the Russian Federation this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that he would defend these lands with “all the means available to us.”",2.3116732564747124,1.8235790459393504,0.48809421053536206,8
2022-10-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/564236-drone-russian-military-airport-explosion/,Drone explodes at Russian military airport,"An explosion occurred at a military airbase in Kaluga region located southwest of the Russian capital when an unidentified drone hit the ground, local authorities said on Friday, adding that there have been no casualties or major damage. According to Kaluga’s Governor Vladislav Shapsha, a blast occurred at military airport ‘Shaikovka,’ with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which “presumably flew from [this] side of the border,” hitting the ground in the area. “There are no casualties. The airfield infrastructure and equipment didn’t sustain any damage,” the official said, adding that there is no threat to the airport’s current operations while investigators are already looking into the incident. Shaikovka is located about 600 kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border and 300 kilometers southwest of Moscow. Moreover, according to media reports, the facility is home to a regiment of Russian strategic supersonic bombers. While Shapsha did not comment on who might be behind the intrusion, news outlet Mash described the incident at the base as a “diversion.” It claimed that the UAV with a grenade was launched Friday morning not far from the airbase. “[The drone] did not enter Russia from the territory of Ukraine. Its purpose was to destroy the airport’s runway,” it wrote, adding that the flight strip had been damaged but that it has already been repaired. Since the onset of Russia’s military campaign in late February, Ukraine has repeatedly used drones for military purposes. In late September, in one of the most notorious examples, a Ukrainian explosive-laden UAV attacked Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, though no damage was caused to its reactor.",5.270292560344166,3.714254702208184,1.5560378581359822,0
2022-10-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/564238-zaporozhye-nuclear-plant-restart/,Russia outlines plan to restart Zaporozhye nuclear plant,"Russian specialists are working to restart reactors No. 5 and 6 of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, a senior official at Russia’s state nuclear energy giant said on Friday. The process may require “about a week,” Renat Karchaa, an advisor to the head of Rosenergoatom, told TASS news agency. The preparations have been confirmed by city authorities in Energodar, where the site is located. The plant is “in working order and can generate power” after it is turned back on, local administration chief Aleksandr Volga said in an interview on Russian television on Friday. He explained that the city intends to use the plant as a source of thermal power during the heating season, and is rerouting the plumbing accordingly. A gas-fired power plant in Energodar is out of operation after being hit by Ukrainian artillery, regional officials earlier said. Vladimir Rogov, a senior Zaporozhye Region official, told the media there are problems that need to be fixed before the nuclear site can be operated again. He explained that most of the power lines connecting it to the grid were previously damaged and will have to be repaired. Only one transmission line currently remains intact, but it passes across the Dnepr River to Kiev-controlled territory, he explained, adding that the connection was currently being used to power the station itself. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a change of ownership of the largest nuclear plant in Europe to reflect the new status of Zaporozhye Region as one of the four provinces newly incorporated into Russia. A new organization operating under Rosenergoatom has taken over the facility, with the staff offered new employment in the same positions. Kiev, which considers the region to be its own territory, has sent instructions to the plant's workers to ignore the change of ownership and take orders from the Ukrainian operator, Energoatom. The perilous situation was discussed this week by Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and Ukraine’s President Vladimir Zelensky. The UN’s nuclear watchdog does not recognize Russia’s claim on the Zaporozhye plant. “The plant’s courageous staff deserve our sincere gratitude and respect for continuing to fulfill their vital tasks in unimaginably difficult conditions, with their workplace located in the middle of a war zone,” Grossi said. “There is a need for urgent action to make their jobs and lives easier, not the opposite”. Aleksandr Volga reported that out of 11,000 employees that the nuclear site normally requires to operate, some 7,800 have remained in their positions. He confirmed that the IAEA was scheduled to rotate its inspectors on Friday, with two people currently stationed leaving and four new specialists arriving in Energodar. The Russian official said he expected the newcomers to help with the safe restart of the reactors. Energodar has been under Russian control since March, but Ukrainian forces are within artillery striking distance. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev of endangering the Zaporozhye facility with its attacks on the city, while Ukraine has claimed Russian forces were responsible for the shellings. The IAEA fact-finding mission, which arrived in Energodar in early September, corroborated reports of damage to the station, but declined to assign blame.",2.6242398101811064,2.0400331759855845,0.5842066341955219,9
2022-10-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/564232-eu-ukraine-money-support/,EU will urge member states to send more money to Ukraine,"Josep Borrell, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, will urge member states to set aside more funds to cover enhanced military assistance for Ukraine. The top diplomat shared his plan with reporters at an informal EU summit in Prague on Friday. “I will ask the leaders to support the proposal for a new tranche for European Peace Facility to continue providing military support to Ukraine, also to the training mission,” Borrell said, as quoted by Reuters. Earlier this week Borrell expressed hope that at the next Foreign Affairs Council gathering on October 17, the EU will be able to “formally launch” its training mission for Ukrainian armed forces. Writing in his blog, the diplomat also claimed that the EU would “reinforce” its strategy of supporting Ukraine – “militarily, financially and politically.” The European Peace Facility (EPF) that Borell referred to, is a mechanism created last year to enhance the EU’s ability to act as a global security provider. The EPF reimburses governments for military equipment supplied to Kiev, “including items designed to deliver lethal force for defensive purposes.” The latest round of funding for Ukraine under the EPF, worth €500 million, was agreed by the European Council in July. With this package, the total EU contribution for the country within this framework amounts to €2.5 billion. The EPF has a ceiling of about €6 billion and is supposed to support not only Ukraine but also other countries. As EU nations face an energy and cost-of-living crisis, exacerbated by anti-Russia sanctions and a reduction in Russian energy supplies, Borrell earlier urged people in the bloc to combat “the temptation to abandon Ukraine.” Responding earlier this week to the EU’s plan of creating a training mission for Kiev's armed forces, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that such a move would only “fix the EU in the status of a participant in the conflict.” In April, she accused the bloc of turning into “NATO’s economic relations department.” This followed Borrell’s tweet that “This war (in Ukraine) must be won on the battlefield.” Moscow has consistently warned Western countries against providing military support to Kiev. It argues that such assistance would only prolong the conflict and will lead to unnecessary casualties. Ukraine, in turn, has repeatedly claimed that the EU is too slow in its weapons supplies and that it doesn’t always provide what Kiev had requested.",2.466494699396628,1.5470409565122965,0.9194537428843317,7
2022-10-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/564219-ukraine-wants-us-long-range-missiles/,Ukraine badgering US for long-range weapons – WSJ,"Ukraine is urging Washington to supply it with longer-range missiles that would enable its forces to attack targets deep inside Russian territory, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing sources. According to unnamed US officials interviewed by the outlet, Kiev wants future arms deliveries to include advanced systems such as the US Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). US members of Congress and Ukrainian officials say this would allow Kiev’s forces to strike Crimea, which overwhelmingly voted to join Russia in 2014, and which Ukraine still considers as its own territory. However, the Biden administration has so far been reluctant to supply Kiev with long-range missiles due to fears that they might escalate the conflict and trigger a response from Moscow, the report says. “The reason we are not giving them these weapons is disagreement over striking targets in Crimea,” a congressional official explained to the outlet. Ukrainian officials told US lawmakers that they needed ATACMS to conduct strikes on a Crimean air base from which Russia’s Iranian-made drones are said to be operating. Tehran previously denied it had sent Russia its unmanned aerial vehicles, stressing that it takes a neutral stance on the Ukraine conflict. Meanwhile, according to the Wall Street Journal’s sources, another reason for Washington’s unwillingness to give ATACMS to Ukraine is a concern that it would deplete America’s own stockpiles, harming its military readiness. According to various media reports, Ukraine has long been asking its Western backers to support it with high-end weapons, including Patriot air defense systems, F-16 fighter jets, M-1 Abrams and Leopard tanks. However, the West has so far resisted these calls, citing inevitable logistical and maintenance issues. As of late September the Pentagon had committed to Ukraine 34 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), while insisting that the country does not need long-range missiles. This, however, has not dissuaded Kiev from pressing its case, with Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba claiming last month that Kiev and Washington were “discussing this issue.” Moscow has previously warned the US against sending such munitions to Ukraine, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying that the move “would cross the red line” and make Washington “an actual party to the conflict.”",2.0439536857929697,2.203190394692938,-0.15923670889996844,7
2022-10-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/564174-trenin-putin-greater-russia/,Dmitry Trenin: Putin has proclaimed a new national idea for Russia as it abandons the dream of a Greater Europe,"During his four terms at the helm of the Russian state, Vladimir Putin has made many landmark speeches. Several of them stand out as pivotal points in Moscow’s evolving foreign policy course. Back in October 2001, addressing Berlin's Bundestag in German, Putin proclaimed Russia’s “European choice”. In February 2007, speaking at the Munich security conference, he lashed out at America’s global hegemony and laid down Russia’s own terms for relations with the West. In March 2014 in the Kremlin, Putin welcomed Crimea and Sevastopol joining Russia, thus expanding the country’s borders for the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union. His most recent speech, also delivered in the Kremlin’s St. George’s Hall, merits special attention as a foreign policy manifesto which today charts a course of systemic opposition to the West. The most striking feature was how little time it devoted to Ukraine – apart from its four former regions joining Russia. There was no mention of Moscow’s key demands, such as Kiev's neutral status, demilitarization, and denazification. There was no comment on the latest developments on the battlefield, where the Ukrainians have seized the initiative, pushing the Russian forces to a defensive posture for the first time. Instead, Putin’s central theme was Russia itself. He came closer than ever before to repudiating the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 by the leaders of the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian republics. Putin said that those politicians had flouted the will of the people who just eight and a half months prior had overwhelmingly voted in favor of keeping a renewed Union. The Russian president then claimed that people have an inalienable right to self-determination based on their historic identity. The proof that he produced was the groundswell of support for the idea of the ex-Ukrainian regions joining Russia, expressed via the referendums held in Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhiye. 2022 sees the undoing, in part, of the catastrophe of 1991 – such was the message. Coincidentally but symbolically, this year has also witnessed the passing of some of the key co-figures related to the documents that dissolved the USSR: Ukraine’s Leonid Kravchuk, Belarus’s Stanislav Shushkevich, Yeltsin’s éminence grise Gennady Burbulis, as well as the man whom they sought to outflank, the first and last Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev. Putin, who just a few days before his Kremlin speech addressed an audience in Novgorod, the cradle of our country's statehood, standing in front of the monument to the “Millennium of Russia”, was closing the books on the last three decades of that history, and opening a new chapter of consolidating the Russian world as a political entity. With the sculptures of Peter the Great and Catherine II looking on, he was preparing to make history. Re-uniting the divided people of Russia and gathering the lands where they live is essentially the core element of the new Russian idea that Putin is offering to his compatriots. The immediate task of course is to integrate the new territories that have just joined Russia following the referendums. This requires a major effort in many areas and at various levels. It is anything but easy. Russian forces, which for months have been advancing on Ukrainian territory, suddenly find themselves in a situation where they have to abandon some areas which are now legally Russian land, populated by Russian citizens who just voted in the referendums and now face severe reprisals at the hands of the counter-attacking Ukrainians. Next comes the need to rebuild the cities and villages ravaged in the war, repair damaged infrastructure, restart the economy, provide communal services, and re-organize public administration, health services, and education. Of paramount importance is socializing the millions of residents of the four regions who were automatically granted Russian citizenship, in the Russian national environment. Moscow has some experience of that from 2014 when Crimea and Sevastopol joined Russia, but doing this in a wartime situation is more challenging. A lot will depend, of course, on how the Russian forces cope on the frontline that passes very close to Donetsk and Kherson, and which still leaves the city of Zaporozhiye in Ukraine’s rear. Even if the Ukrainian counter-offensive runs out of steam and the Russians resume their advance, none of these tasks can be accomplished quickly. This part of the new Russian national idea will keep the nation busy for a long time. Putin’s concept, however, doesn’t stop there. It is not so much about restoring the Soviet Union: in Putin’s words, such a restoration is not Moscow’s objective. The Baltics, the South Caucasus and Central Asia are probably not envisaged as part of the new construct. However, as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hinted on the State Duma floor, in future other Ukrainian regions might be given the chance to follow Kherson and Zaporozhiye. To Putin, Greater Russia is a distinct civilization which opposes not only America’s hegemonic policies, but also the West’s projection of its values as universal. This is an about-face not only from Gorbachev’s musings about a common European home, but also from Putin’s own travails in trying to forge a Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok, and his efforts to find a way for Russia to join NATO. A Greater Europe didn’t happen; a Greater Asia that includes Russia is de facto emerging. As to a Greater Russia, this requires more than a leader’s imagination. The Soviet Union, as the living generations remember it, was very much the product of the Great Patriotic War. The hybrid war with the West, of which Ukraine is only a small part, will doubtless reshape Russia. The question is, will it also transform it to fit the vision of a powerful economy and a vibrant society, faithful to its declared values – the substance, rather than the form of a Greater Russia.",2.8591518575752963,3.2178924570596927,-0.3587405994843964,6

In doing so, the Ukrainian leader “showed to the entire world the latest proof of the threats that come from the Kiev regime.” Lavrov said Russia’s special military operation had been launched to neutralize those threats. He dismissed as “laughable” an attempt to downplay Zelensky’s words made by his press secretary, Sergey Nikoforov. “We all remember how [Zelensky] declared in January Ukraine’s intention to acquire nuclear weapons. Apparently, this idea has long been stuck in his mind,” the Russian minister said. On Thursday, Zelensky told the Australian Lowy Institute that NATO must carry out preemptive strikes against Russia so that it “knows what to expect” if it uses its nuclear arsenal. He claimed that such action would “eliminate the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons,” before recalling how he urged other nations to preemptively punish Russia before it launched its military action against his country. “I once again appeal to the international community, as it was before February 24: Preemptive strikes so that [the Russians] know what will happen to them if they use it, and not the other way around,” he said. His spokesman then claimed that people interpreting Zelensky’s words as a call for a preemptive nuclear strike were wrong, and that Ukraine would never use such rhetoric.",2.342715981672044,2.0868338945122042,0.25588208715983995,8

The press secretary pledged that Ukraine will never resort to nuclear threats, calling it something only the “terrorist state Russia” would do. Moscow has denied that its senior officials were threatening anybody when they described the country’s official nuclear posture, in the context of warning NATO members against attacks on Russia. Hours earlier, Zelensky told the Australian Lowy Institute that NATO should carry out preemptive strikes against Russia so that it “knows what to expect” in the event that it uses atomic weapons. Such an attack would “eliminate the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons,” the Ukrainian leader claimed. He urged the US and its allies to make a show of force, recalling how he appealed to other nations for preemptive measures against Russia before Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February. “I once again appeal to the international community, as it was before February 24: preemptive strikes so that they [Russians] know what will happen to them if they use it, and not the other way around,” he said. His press secretary also noted that before the hostilities started, “the only measures we talked about were preemptive sanctions”.

Russia has repeatedly stated that it is not considering a nuclear strike on Ukraine but has warned that it will use any means necessary in order to protect its borders, people and sovereignty. Meanwhile, both Washington and London have also admitted that it is unlikely that Moscow will deploy tactical nukes in the Ukraine conflict and have seen no indications of Moscow preparing such an attack. Nevertheless, Western leaders have warned Russia against ever crossing that line, vowing “catastrophic consequences.”",1.578342774679349,3.035564578405757,-1.457221803726408,8
2022-10-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/564173-ukraine-negotiations-matvienko-jakarta/,Top Russian senator urges Ukraine to start talks ‘today’,"The head of Russia’s Federation Council, Valentina Matvienko, has called on the Ukrainian parliament to immediately engage in peace talks with a view to settling the conflict between the two countries. The proposal was made during the G20 parliamentary speakers’ summit in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on Thursday. The Ukrainian delegation, headed by Verkhovna Rada chair Elena Kondratyuk, has also been invited to the event, despite the country not being part of the group of the world’s top economies. “Let us, the parliament of Russia and the parliament of Ukraine, sit behind the negotiating table today, at the G20 parliamentary platform. Let’s try to understand each other and find solutions,” Matvienko said. The senator noted that Moscow and Kiev had almost reached a peace deal during talks in Istanbul in late March, but “Ukraine was obviously under external management at that time and gave up on those agreements.” Russia has made numerous offers to Kiev to engage in peace talks since the outbreak of the conflict in late February, she pointed out. “We are saying it again – we are in favor of negotiations, of dialogue, of a peaceful political solution to this crisis. Let’s start talking. Let’s get behind the negotiating table,” Matvienko suggested. The head of the upper house of the Russian parliament later clarified to journalists that Moscow was “ready to cease hostilities on the conditions that are being put forward by Russia.” This meant that the status of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, which officially became part of the Russian state on Wednesday, won’t be up for discussion during the negotiations with Ukraine, she said. Matvienko said she wasn’t surprised by the lack of response to her proposal to start dialogue from the Ukrainian parliamentary delegation. “It’s understandable because Ukraine isn’t free in its decisions. It can’t make any decisions on its own, without the involvement of its masters,” she said, likely referring to Kiev’s backers in the US, UK, and the EU. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree that forbade any negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelensky claimed that Ukraine would only talk to Russia if it had a different president. The Kremlin responded to the move by saying it was ready to wait for the Ukrainian president to change his position or for Ukraine to find a new president with a different stance.",2.5043092780320433,2.9470727893205058,-0.4427635112884625,8
2022-10-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/564170-ukraine-terririst-attacks-nyt/,Kremlin questions if US knows Ukrainian plans for terror attacks,"Moscow hopes the US government did not tells reporters its suspicions that Kiev masterminded a high-profile assassination in Russia with a view to washing its hands of future terrorism incidents, the Kremlin warned on Thursday. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov was commenting on a report in the New York Times, which contained details of an assessment by the US intelligence community regarding a bomb attack near Moscow in August, in which journalist and political activist Darya Dugina was killed. “The involvement of the Ukrainian state in this terrorist act, the murder of a young woman, was argued and demonstrated by our special services in a reasonably swift manner,” Peskov told journalists. The Kremlin spokesman noted the NYT article may be a positive development, provided that its reporting accurately reflects the stance of the US intelligence community. “We really want to hope that this is not some attempt by the American colleagues, who may possess certain information, to distance themselves from responsibility for future terrorist acts that the Ukrainian state may be preparing,” he added. According to the NYT, American spies believe that “parts of the Ukrainian government authorized” the assassination of Dugina. Its sources claimed that the US had nothing to do with the crime and had no advance knowledge of it. Washington reportedly admonished Kiev for the killing, despite Ukraine’s insistence that it had nothing to do with it either. The story described Washington’s concerns about possible Russian retaliation for targeting Dugina and a number of Ukrainian officials who cooperated with Moscow in governing lands captured from Kiev. A senior Ukrainian military official confirmed to the NYT that Kiev had carried out “attacks on accused Ukrainian collaborators,” some of which were fatal. “Some American officials believe it is crucial to curb what they see as dangerous adventurism [on Kiev’s part], particularly political assassinations,” the newspaper added. Dugina was the daughter of Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, a controversial public figure known for his advocacy of Russian exceptionalism. Some observers claimed that his ideas had influenced Russian foreign policy, including Moscow’s decision to send troops into Ukraine in late February. Darya shared her father’s political convictions. Russia’s security service, the FSB, identified two Ukrainian nationals, a man and a woman, as members of a hit squad responsible for Dugina’s assassination. Both had left the country before they could be arrested. The woman, Natalya Vovk, rented an apartment in the block where Dugina lived and visited an event outside of Moscow, where the bomb was planted on the victim’s car, according to the investigators. The man, Bogdan Tsiganenko, allegedly assembled the explosive device and otherwise facilitated the hit.",3.1006117376292157,2.6833778993668598,0.41723383826235594,1

Kara Murza, who holds both British and Russian citizenship, is reportedly suspected of aiding and abetting foreign powers hostile to Russia. The activist is ""vice president"" of the Washington-based ""Free Russia Foundation,"" a US-government funded pressure group which pushes for ""regime change"" in Moscow. According to newspaper Izvestia, investigators claimed that he had consulted for people working for foreign intelligence services and was paid $30,000 per month for his services. Sources cited by RT Russian and TASS claimed that Kara-Murza was for years involved with organizations based in NATO member states and had helped them undermine Russian national security. RT’s source named the same sum of monetary compensation that Kara-Murza had allegedly received. Russian prosecutors believe that they can prove that the activist’s actions constitute a crime of state treason, the outlets said. The felony is punishable by a prison term of up to 20 years. Kara-Murza has long been a prominent member of anti-government political forces in Russia. He also garnered the attention of Western press for surviving two alleged poisonings, which he and other critics of the Russian government claimed to have been assassination attempts and connected with his criticism of the authorities. The 41-year-old has been held in Russian custody since late April, as law enforcement investigate him for allegedly slandering the country’s armed forces. The case is based on a speech that he delivered before the Arizona state Congress in March, where he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of alleged war crimes. Kara-Murza has permanent resident status in the US, according to Western media. The Russian Justice Ministry designated him an individual acting as a foreign agent on the day he was arrested.",3.4253319499042467,3.5644790140413276,-0.1391470641370809,5
2022-10-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/564160-eu-sanctions-russian-territories/,EU sanctions new Russian territories,"The European Council on Thursday extended its anti-Russian sanctions to Zaporozhye and Kherson, the former Ukrainian regions which joined the Russian Federation this week. The EU governing body announced its decision in a statement on the eighth package of sanctions imposed on Moscow over what it called the “illegal annexation” of Ukrainian territories. “The Council also decided that as of today, the geographical scope of the restrictions introduced on February 23, including notably the import ban on goods from the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, will be extended to cover also the non-controlled areas of the oblasts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson,” the statement reads. On February 23, the day before Russia launched its military offensive in Ukraine, the EU imposed its first package of sanctions on Russia. That was done in response to Moscow’s recognition of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as independent states. Since then, seven more packages have been adopted. The latest batch of restrictions were imposed the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law unification treaties with the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions. The agreements were signed by Putin and the heads of the four former Ukrainian regions on September 30, after the residents of the territories overwhelmingly voted in referendums to join the Russian Federation. The European Council immediately said it would never recognise the referendums and “their falsified and illegal results.” The Council members also said in a statement that Kiev “has the right to liberate occupied territories within its internationally recognised borders” and pledged to further increase pressure on Russia.",2.926406465200171,4.252769811909496,-1.326363346709325,2

On Tuesday, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry posted a picture on Twitter of what it called “a torture chamber” in Peski Radkovskiye, a town in Kharkov Region. The photo depicted a gas mask, which, according to the ministry, was used to torture the local population, and a box of gold dental crowns lying on the grass. “How many more will be found in occupied Ukraine?” it asked, hinting that it was Russian troops who had committed the atrocities. However, according to Bild, the teeth apparently belonged to patients of a local dentist, not to Ukrainian torture victims. “These teeth look like those stolen from my collection,” Sergey, 60, told the outlet when he was shown the photo distributed by the Ukrainian authorities. “I’m the only dentist here. So if they were found here, they must have come from me.” When asked if the teeth could have come from dead people, the dentist categorically dismissed the notion. “Oh God, no! They belonged to the people I’ve treated all these years. I pulled out these teeth because they were bad,” he explained. The dentist also voiced suspicions that it was Russian troops who stole them, either because they thought them to be made of gold, or to intimidate local residents. While the teeth were not a product of torture, local residents claimed that Russian troops had been involved in a number of alleged atrocities. They said soldiers had beaten some local residents and used them as forced labor for digging trenches. Moscow has repeatedly denied allegations that it has committed war crimes in Ukraine. Russia sent troops into the country on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

The sides are also apparently mulling face-to-face negotiations to remedy remaining issues. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, as quoted by the outlet, Moscow and Washington are looking into reviving mutual inspection of nuclear arsenals. The ministry noted that the US and Russia are negotiating “over relevant channels” on how to return “to the full implementation of the treaty” in the element relating to verification mechanisms. It went on to say that the sides are holding virtual talks within the New START bilateral consultative panel. “At the moment, the possibilities for holding its next session in face-to-face format are being explored,” the ministry added. Russia and the US are also discussing “what organizational and technical problems need to be solved,” it told the outlet, adding that “significant progress” has been made to remedy a number of issues, but some “considerable difficulties remain.” These difficulties are said to include Covid-19-related issues that require “a final settlement.” Another major sticking point, apparently, is the West’s sanctions over the Ukraine conflict that prevent Russian specialists from traveling to the US. The ministry said that after the West had imposed sanctions, “visa problems started to emerge during transit, as did difficulties with making payments for services during inspections,” adding that “all this effectively blocks our ability to carry out inspections on the US territory unimpeded.” It also told Izvestia that while Russian inspectors cannot reach the US, American officials have no such problems, which “gives the US side unilateral advantages.” In early August, Moscow informed Washington that it was temporarily withdrawing from the New START inspection regime, citing the sanctions that prevent its inspectors from performing their duties. These included visa restrictions on Russian inspectors and a ban on Russian aircraft in US and EU airspace. However, in late September Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed that Moscow and Washington are seeking to resume inspections, in order to “return to the full implementation of the treaty.” New START, which was signed in 2010, remains virtually the last arms-control deal between the two nuclear powers since America’s unilateral withdrawal in 2019 from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The deal limits the number of nuclear warheads that the US and Russia can possess to 1,550 each. It also says that each side must have no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and nuclear bombers. The total number of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles must not exceed 800.",3.141091986015092,2.574388922600034,0.566703063415058,8

The envoy was referring to the Cuban Missile Crisis, which unfolded between the US and the Soviet Union in October and November 1962. The standoff is considered to be the closest the world has come to all-out nuclear war. Tensions flared after Moscow deployed ballistic missiles to Cuba in response to Washington putting similar weapons in Italy and Turkey. However, the sides were able to resolve the dispute through negotiations. Russia’s stance that a nuclear conflict can’t be unleashed and can’t be won remains unchanged, the ambassador stressed. “In Washington, they’ve already forgotten the basics of strategic stability, which boils down to a very simple formula: whoever shoots first, dies second,” he said. “On the 60th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, I’d like to believe that there are those in the US who have learned this main lesson. In any case, our countries are obliged to prevent the world from sliding into a catastrophe,” Antonov insisted. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed “some senior officials in NATO states” for suggesting that deploying nuclear weapons against Russia was justified. He warned that Moscow was ready to “use all means” to defend itself if attacked. However, those words were interpreted by some in the West as a threat by the Kremlin to use atomic weapons against Ukraine. While most bilateral contacts have been frozen by the US side, Moscow and Washington still cooperate on deconfliction in Syria, space, and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the ambassador pointed out. According to Antonov, the US is currently not ready for a complete severance of diplomatic ties with Russia, and plans to send a new ambassador to Moscow is proof of that. Lynne Tracy, who now heads the American mission in Armenia, has been nominated as a replacement for US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan, who left Moscow in early September due to family reasons. However, this does not mean Washington will give up on its plans to weaken Russia, by supporting Kiev and other means, the ambassador said. Antonov went on to argue that the conflict in Ukraine has become a “trigger” that revealed “deep-rooted problems” in the world, and that Russia “isn’t satisfied with the rules of the game that the Americans are trying to impose,” which only benefit the US.",2.600413339753882,2.1854561574815157,0.41495718227236633,8

Peskov’s remarks appear to have come in response to statements by Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod, who has announced his government’s intention to oppose Russia’s participation in the investigation and the possible identification of those responsible. Moscow maintains an international probe – with its participation – must be carried out. The Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines abruptly lost pressure last Monday, following a series of powerful underwater explosions off the Danish island of Bornholm. The incident caused massive gas leaks, with large volumes of it entering the sea. The ruptures are widely considered to be the result of sabotage, carried out by an unknown party. Moscow has squarely branded the incident a terrorist attack, while President Vladimir Putin blamed the explosions on “the Anglo-Saxons,” a Russian colloquialism for the US-UK transatlantic alliance. Washington, for its part, has openly cheered the incident, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken hailing it as a “tremendous opportunity” for Europe “to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy.”",3.469647298819711,3.598014908198011,-0.12836760937830016,1

The anonymous intelligence officials also claimed Washington had not been involved in any way, would have opposed the operation if they had known about it, and “admonished” Kiev afterwards, none of which could be independently verified. Dugina was killed on August 20, when the car she drove exploded on the outskirts of Moscow. Russian authorities pointed the finger at Kiev and named two Ukrainian nationals as the suspects, but never accused the US of having any role in the assassination. “The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance,” the anonymous officials told the Times. They “also said they were not aware of the operation ahead of time and would have opposed the killing had they been consulted,” according to the story. The “closely held assessment of Ukrainian complicity” was shared with the US government last week, the Times said. The spies were reportedly concerned that such a “covert campaign” could “widen the conflict” and “frustrated with Ukraine’s lack of transparency about its military and covert plans, especially on Russian soil.” “While Russia has not retaliated in a specific way for the assassination, the US is concerned that such attacks – while high in symbolic value – have little direct impact on the battlefield and could provoke Moscow to carry out its own strikes against senior Ukrainian officials,” some of whom have “less protection” than President Vladimir Zelensky, the Times wrote. The anonymous spies did not reveal who in Kiev may have authorized the hit, who carried it out, whether Zelensky signed off on it, who from Washington delivered the “admonishments” to whom in Ukraine, or what Ukraine’s response may have been. One Ukrainian official who did comment to the Times was Mikhail Podoliak, a Zelensky adviser, who initially insisted Ukraine had “nothing to do with this.” Podoliak also told Ukrainian media last month that targeted killings of pro-Russian officials and civilians was “certainly not terrorist or, strictly speaking, criminal.” When the Times asked Podoliak about the new US intelligence assessment, on Tuesday, he said that “any murder during wartime in some country or another must carry with it some kind of practical significance,” and that “someone like Dugina is not a tactical or a strategic target for Ukraine.” “We have other targets on the territory of Ukraine,” he said, “I mean collaborationists and representatives of the Russian command, who might have value for members of our special services working in this program, but certainly not Dugina.” The US outlet described Dugina as “the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist” Aleksandr Dugin, himself “a leading proponent of an aggressive, imperialist Russia.” It also noted the US and EU had sanctioned her for “spreading Russian propaganda about Ukraine” and sharing her father’s worldview.",2.5286948122618824,3.263026983021798,-0.7343321707599157,7

Speaking on the Soloviev Live show on Wednesday, the Colonel General said the Russian Ministry of Defense should stop hiding information from citizens and be more truthful in its reports. “No more lies. We’ve talked about this before. [RT Editor-in-Chief] Margarita Simonyan has spoken about this in length but, apparently, this has not reached the ears of some individual leaders,” Kartapolov said, noting how reports from the Soviet Information Bureau during the early months of the Nazi invasion of the USSR in 1941 provided more information than what is being said in Russia’s Ministry of Defense reports today. “In every report they said that somewhere we are retreating, somewhere we are stubbornly repelling the attacks of a superior enemy, somewhere we have left settlements,” the politician said, stressing that when people read the Soviet reports, they gained an understanding that the situation was difficult and that the country was in danger. Kartapolov said that Russia is also in danger today and that the enemy is already on Russian land, referring to Belgorod Region, where, he claims, nearly all villages bordering Ukraine have been destroyed, while the city of Valuiki is under constant fire from Kiev’s forces. The chairman lamented the fact that none of this information is being reported by official sources and people learn about these things from governors, telegram channels and military correspondents. “The reports from the Ministry of Defense practically do not change their content,” Kartapolov noted, warning that the Russian people “are not stupid” and can see that they are not being allowed to learn even a portion of the actual truth. “This can lead to a loss of credibility,” the deputy warned. While the Russian Defense Ministry releases daily updates on its Telegram channel, reporting on the number of enemy combatants or equipment destroyed, it rarely indicates how many Russian service personnel are killed or injured, or how much military equipment is lost in the fighting. The last time Moscow officially announced its losses was on September 21, when Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu stated that the Russian military had lost some 6,000 fighters since hostilities broke out in late February.

A presidential decree on the fate of the facility was published on Wednesday. The plant will be operated by a subsidiary of Russia’s state-owned nuclear power giant Rosatom. For now, it will continue to function under Ukrainian-issued licenses until Russian equivalents are obtained, according to the document. The move comes as Moscow finalizes the accession of four formerly Ukrainian regions – Zaporozhye, Kherson, as well as Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics – to Russia. The territories overwhelmingly backed a proposal to join Russia in referendums last month. The votes were firmly rejected by Kiev and its Western backers, who denounced them as “sham” votes. In recent weeks, Zaporozhye nuclear power plant has been subjected to repeated missile, artillery and drone attacks, attributed by the Russian military to Ukrainian forces, as well as targeted by saboteurs in apparent attempts to seize the facility from Russian forces. Kiev, along with multiple Western officials, however, has been blaming Moscow for shelling the nuclear facility it controls. The Zaporozhye plant was seized by the Russian military early in the ongoing conflict. Until now, however, it has remained under Ukrainian management.

His comment came in response to a media report that the Alpine nation had signaled its readiness to host de-escalation talks. Asked by a journalist whether Vienna has made any such overtures to Moscow, Peskov replied: “No, we haven’t received [any].” The question was prompted by a report published by media outlet The Hill on Tuesday. The article, citing “one Austrian official,” suggested that Vienna had offered to act as a neutral facilitator for de-escalation talks, amid fears Moscow could deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Austria has also reportedly signaled its willingness to maintain communications channels with Moscow. The Austrian government has yet to comment on The Hill’s claims. While the outlet acknowledged that the US government itself says it has seen no signs that Moscow is prepared to use weapons of mass destruction, it speculated nonetheless about Washington’s possible response. A former Pentagon official-turned-defense expert cited in the article opined that such a scenario would entail the US providing Ukraine with long-range missiles, as well as severe censure of Russia from the likes of India, China and Türkiye. Peace negotiations between Kiev and Moscow halted shortly after their meeting in Istanbul on March 29. The Ukrainian government attributed its reluctance to talk to the discovery of alleged mass killings of civilians in the town of Bucha, which Kiev blamed on Russian forces. Moscow denied it was behind the atrocities. As the conflict progressed throughout the summer, top Ukrainian officials began insisting on first defeating Russia militarily and only then sitting down for talks. Last Friday, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that Kiev will not engage in negotiations with Moscow as long as Vladimir Putin remains president there. The statement came on the same day as Putin gave the green light to the accession to Russia of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as well as to Ukraine’s Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, which had been seized by Russian forces and subsequently voted for joining the country. The Russian president did stress, however, that Moscow was still open to negotiations with Kiev, on condition that the latter would not raise the issue of the four former Ukrainian regions.",2.6588158437189082,2.2760263941364327,0.3827894495824755,8

At least one person was killed in the shelling, and a number of residential buildings as well as a hotel, sustained damage, a local law enforcement officer told RIA Novosti news agency. He added that the attack on the city was supposedly carried out using three HIMARS rockets, but the consequences of the shelling are still being clarified by Russia’s Investigative Committee. Emergency services continue working at the scene to clear the rubble. Ukrainian forces have also continued to carry out attacks on other residential areas in Russia. The Mayor of Donetsk, Alexei Kulemzin, reported on Wednesday that at least three civilians had been killed in strikes on the city over the past two days. Zaporozhye Governor Yevgeny Balitsky has also accused Kiev of trying to make life unbearable for the residents of newly incorporated Russian territories after Ukrainian troops carried out over 40 artillery strikes on and around Energodar, targeting the city’s gas-fired power plant in an effort to “derail” preparations for the winter season and make the city “unlivable.” Russia took control of a large part of the Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions in the early phase of its military operation against Ukraine. The regions voted in referendums last month to join Russia. On Wednesday President Vladimir Putin signed into law four treaties, which formalized the transfer of Zaporozhye and Kherson, as well as the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk to Russian sovereignty. Kiev has rejected the ballots and the change of status and pledged to use military force to oust Russia from all lands that Ukraine considers its own.

2022-10-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/564103-kremlin-ukraine-special-operation/,Kremlin responds to rumors over Ukraine operation rebrand,"Moscow has not rebranded its military campaign in Ukraine as a “counter-terrorist operation” after taking four former Ukrainian regions under its sovereignty, contrary to some expectations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. “This is solely the prerogative of the commander-in-chief, the country’s president,” he told journalists on Wednesday when asked about a possible change of format. “As of this moment, no such decision has been taken. We are talking about the special military operation, which continues,” he added. Some political observers predicted that the Russian government would reclassify the hostilities with Ukraine after incorporating a number of former Ukrainian regions, where much of the fighting against Kiev’s troops is taking place. Officials in Moscow accused Kiev on multiple occasions of using “terrorist tactics” against people in frontline regions. There was some expectation that Russia would designate the operation against Ukraine accordingly. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law on Tuesday four acts, which designate the Donetsk and Lugansk Republics and Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions as new subjects of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian troops are in control of parts of those territories and have recently retaken a number of settlements, which were previously held by Russian forces. Peskov reacted to Kiev’s advances, stating that the new lands “are with Russia forever [and] will be returned.” The official also commented on the standing issue of the borders of Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions. Peskov described the two new parts of Russia as lands “where the military-civilian administration was in power at the moment of accession.” “Certain territories will be returned, and we will continue consulting with the people, who would wish to live with Russia,” the spokesman said. Kiev declared Russia’s move to accept new territories as legally void and based on “sham” referendums that changed nothing for Ukraine. The Ukrainian government declared that it will oust Russian troops from all lands it considers to be under its sovereignty with the help of the US and its allies.",2.037966268822008,2.248136075685759,-0.21016980686375097,2

However, measures to aid Kiev in its conflict with Moscow are still supported by the majority of respondents, the study shows. The results of the poll, which was conducted throughout June in 27 member states, were released on Wednesday. They showed that 60% of the EU’s population were on board with sending weapons to Kiev. The backing for lethal aid was the highest in Poland, where 84% spoke in favor of it; and the lowest in Italy, where it was supported by just 42%. “In fact, Italy is the only member state where a majority of citizens oppose the delivery of weapons,” the study pointed out. Meanwhile, 60% of those surveyed believed that the shipments of arms to Kiev should be organized through EU mechanisms, while 54% preferred them to be carried out by their home countries. A similar poll conducted in March showed that 64% in the bloc were in favor of arms deliveries. Moscow has consistently criticized the US, EU and other countries over their shipments of weapons to Kiev, arguing that they only prolonged the fighting and increased the risk of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO. Support for welcoming Ukrainian refugees has declined by 5% in the EU since March and stood at 81%, according to the survey. It was the highest in Germany, Italy and Spain (83%, 84% and 90%, respectively), and the lowest in Poland (77%) and France (76%). Ukraine was granted EU candidate status shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, with 66% of the population in member states now saying they would like to see Kiev joining the union. The respondents were also asked to name the country they thought was the EU’s most trustworthy ally, with 77% saying that it was the US. As for the economic fallout of the sanctions imposed on Moscow by Brussels, Eupinions pointed out that 46% of EU citizens said their personal outlook on the future was negative, compared to 37% at the same period last year. Overall, the authors of the study came to the conclusion that “measures to support Ukraine in its defense against the war waged by Russia remain popular” in the EU.",2.8881161383893423,3.030851652633019,-0.1427355142436766,7

He believes Kiev intends to “destroy the infrastructure and make [Energodar] unlivable.” The Ukrainian government wants to regain control over the region, but does not want the people living in it to remain, he insisted. In the past 24 hours there have been over 40 artillery strikes on and around the city, with some of the shelling conducted in a chaotic manner, Balitsky said. He claimed that Ukraine’s artillery appears not to care about picking high-value targets, and expends pricey US-provided munitions to cause relatively minor damage. “They even hit the railroad. It cost us 100,000 rubles ($1,680) to fix, and they spent $200,000. And fire indiscriminately all over the territory,” he said. “The Americans are pouring so much money into Ukraine, they can spend [ammo] absolutely without reservations.” Russia took control of a large part of Zaporozhye Region in the early phase of its military operation against Ukraine.

Moscow earlier complained that the diplomat, Pyotr Vrublevsky, remained in office in the Central Asian country more than a month after the incident. Kazakhstan’s Foreign Ministry “notified the Ukrainian side that the remarks [by its ambassador] were unacceptable and hurtful to the people of Kazakhstan, especially ethnic Russians,” spokesman Aibek Smadiyarov told journalists on Wednesday, according to local media. Astana did not expel the envoy, but considers his presence on its soil “undesirable” and has secured a promise from Ukraine to replace him, the official added. Kiev has already named a potential replacement and sent their credentials to Kazakhstan, he added. The comments came a day after the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its concern that Vrublevsky was still serving as the head of the Ukrainian embassy. Russia was led to believe that the diplomat would leave Kazakhstan for good in early September, spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. “This individual came back to the capital of Kazakhstan, and certainly not to ‘collect his things and his family’. He openly attends diplomatic events as the head of the embassy,” she stated. Smadiyarov denied that his country dealt with Vrublevsky in his official capacity. Zakharova added that Moscow had called on Astana to expel the Ukrainian “Russophobe”, accusing him of “transgressing all boundaries of civilized behavior, as well as diplomatic ethics and the laws of his host country” against hate speech. Astana promised that the man would leave Kazakhstan “as soon as possible,” she claimed. Amid the exchange about Vrublevsky, Russia and Kazakhstan summoned each other’s ambassadors. Smadiyarov described his Russian counterpart’s remarks as “out of tune with the allied relationship between Kazakhstan and Russia as equal strategic partners.” The dispute flared up in late August, when Vrublevsky gave an interview with a local video blogger. When asked about the situation in his country, he said: “What can I say… We are trying to kill as many [Russians] as possible. The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to. That’s it.” Officials in Kazakhstan branded his words as incitement of ethnic hatred and out of line for a diplomat.

Earlier the documents were unanimously endorsed by the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament. The agreements were ratified on Monday by the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, after they were certified as lawful by the country’s Constitutional Court over the weekend. The agreements were signed by Putin and the heads of the four former Ukrainian regions on Friday, after the residents of the territories overwhelmingly backed the idea of joining Russia during referendums held between September 23 and 27. The votes have been firmly rejected by Kiev and its Western backers, who have vowed to never accept their results nor recognize the four regions' accession. The DPR and LPR split from Ukraine in 2014 in the aftermath of the Maidan coup and the civil conflict in the country’s east that followed. Shortly after launching a military operation in February this year, Russia seized Kherson Region and a larger part of Zaporozhye Region.

Moscow's envoy was speaking after the Pentagon announced the contents of another military shipment to Ukraine, valued at $625 million. “The US is increasing the deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, providing its military with intelligence information, ensuring the direct participation of its fighters and advisers in the conflict,” Vorontsov, who is the deputy head of the Russian delegation, told the General Assembly’s First Committee, a body charged with arms control and security issues. This “not only prolongs hostilities and leads to new casualties, but also brings the situation closer to the dangerous line of a direct military clash between Russia and NATO,” Vorontsov added. Moscow has repeatedly warned the US and its allies against sending weapons, ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, but Washington and NATO vowed to keep doing so for “as long as it takes,” while insisting that doesn’t make them a party to the conflict. According to the Pentagon, the US has spent more than $19.6 billion in “security assistance” to Ukraine since 2014, and another $16.8 billion since February 24, when the Russian military operation began. The US will continue to provide Ukraine with “key capabilities” and to address Kiev’s “evolving battlefield requirements,” the military added. The latest batch of weapons and equipment, valued at $625 million, includes four High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and ammunition for them, 16 each of the 155mm and 105mm howitzers, 75,000 rounds for artillery ammunition – including guided rounds and remote mine-laying ones – small arms and mortar rounds, and 200 MRAP armored vehicles.

The war games, which form part of the annual Namejs 2022 drills, are set to take place in multiple locations across the city between October 5 and 9. “The National Armed Forces calls on the citizens to treat the ongoing military exercises with understanding. Their aim is to improve the comprehensive national defense capabilities and strengthen regional security,” the military said in a statement. Over the past few days, authorities have repeatedly warned of the impending exercises, releasing multiple statements on the exact locations of the upcoming events. The Namejs 2022 multinational exercise, held in the country every year since 2014, involves some 8,000 service personnel, with both local forces and NATO’s Forward Presence Battle Group Latvia, NATO Force Integration Unit Latvia, and other units of the US-led alliance. The urban training “in realistic conditions” is designed to hone the soldiers’ fighting skills, and to enhance cooperation between various units and military branches. Moreover, the exercise is important to “strengthen the psychological resilience of society,” as it shows “every citizen that we will do everything to protect the country,” the military asserted. The continuous public warnings about the impending drills are intense, apparently, after last year’s fiasco, when similar urban military training during Namejs 2021 drills caught Riga’s residents by surprise. On that occasion, the military failed to provide a coherent warning about the training, with footage going viral of civilians getting caught in mock crossfire. A public uproar forced the military to offer an apology. “During such drills, we only use blank cartridges, which make noise but do not pose any danger to the health and life of others. In this case, blank cartridges were also used, and this situation was a bitter misunderstanding, for which we apologize,” the ministry said at the time.",3.5251977966684365,2.1451609580738666,1.3800368385945698,6
2022-10-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/564066-nuclear-war-russia-un/,Russia ‘fully committed’ to UN consensus on nuclear war,"Moscow maintains that a war between nuclear-armed countries should never be fought, the top nonproliferation official in the Russian foreign ministry told the UN General Assembly’s First Committee on Tuesday. “We believe that one of the most important tasks is to maintain adherence by all countries of the ‘nuclear five’ to the postulate that any war between countries possessing nuclear weapons cannot be allowed to happen, which was reflected in the January joint statement of the leaders of nuclear powers. Russia is fully committed to it,” said Vladimir Yermakov, director of the arms control and nonproliferation department at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The committee, which is in charge of arms control and international security, heard the statement through Konstantin Vorontsov, deputy head of the Russian delegation to the UNGA. Yermakov’s remarks follow a clarification from the Kremlin that Moscow will only use nuclear weapons based on its official doctrine – meaning, in self-defense from weapons of mass destruction, or where its survival was threatened by conventional means. “There can be no other considerations here,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday. Russia has been repeatedly accused by the US and its allies of threatening the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Putin’s spokesman Peskov has repeatedly directed reporters to the official doctrine in order to dispel any misunderstandings. According to Russia’s nuclear posture, Moscow reserves the right to use atomic weapons only “in response to the use of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction against Russia or its allies,” as well as “in response to a conventional attack that threatens the very existence” of Russia as a sovereign state. Over the weekend, however, the leader of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov proposed using “low-yield nuclear weapons” as one of the “more drastic measures” regarding the conflict in Ukraine. Kadyrov was addressing the withdrawal of Russian troops from a Donetsk Region town due to a persistent Ukrainian assault. While Russian regional heads – including Kadyrov, who Peskov said has “contributed a lot” to the operations in Ukraine – are free to express personal opinions, they cannot give free rein to their emotions, “even in difficult times,” the Kremlin spokesman said.",3.615736320149632,2.9300382835498833,0.6856980365997489,9

The court ruling was announced on Tuesday. Authorities removed the vet from a train in Voronezh in January after several fellow passengers on the Sochi-to-Moscow trip complained he was drunk and creating a disturbance. Once in custody, he allegedly kicked a police officer, bruising him. Gilman claimed he did not remember the incident but nevertheless insisted he had “apologized to Russia,” as well as to the police officer. His lawyers told TASS news agency he was in Russia to study and claimed he had planned to seek citizenship, though earlier reports of the trial say he was just visiting and was traveling to Moscow only to replace his damaged passport before returning home to the US. The former marine, who had pleaded guilty but insisted “it was an accident” and claimed he was the victim of poisoned vodka, complained the sentence was too strict. The officer who was kicked, Sergei Strelnikov, dropped all charges against him, arguing he had served sufficient time in pre-trial detention. However, the nature of the charge was such that proceedings continued even in the absence of a victim. Attorney Valeriy Ivannikov said his client plans to appeal or – failing that – propose a prisoner swap with Washington. He may have a chance at freedom through such an exchange, given that another former US marine with a similar conviction was released earlier this year as part of such a trade. Trevor Reed, who was found guilty of attacking a Russian police officer and sentenced in 2020 to nine years in prison, was released in a prisoner swap in April for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, convicted of drug smuggling in the US in 2011. Fellow former US marine Paul Whelan, who in addition to his US passport also holds Canadian, Irish and British citizenship, is serving a 16-year sentence on espionage charges, which he continues to deny. Russian officials have reportedly been in talks with their US counterparts for months about exchanging Whelan and WNBA basketball star Brittney Griner for convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout, who is serving 25 years in an American prison.

The decision was announced on Tuesday as the court found in favor of ANO TV-Novosti, RT’s founding company, against Google LLC, Google Ireland Limited and the Russian Google division. They have been ordered to restore access to some 27 blocked channels. If they fail to do so, a court penalty of 100,000 rubles per day ($1,694) will be imposed on Google until access to all of the channels is restored. Every week, the amount of the daily penalty will double. Google has 30 days to appeal the court’s verdict. The lawsuit against Google was filed back in May when the court, at RT’s request, took interim measures to “make sure it is possible to enforce the judicial act” against the company and seized all financial assets and movable and immovable property of the tech giant’s Russian division to the value of 500 million rubles ($8.4 million). Similar amounts have also been seized from the company in two other pending lawsuits filed by Russian television companies NTV and the GPM Entertainment Television, which have also had their content blocked on YouTube. YouTube administrators restricted access to all RT and RTD channels in early March, shortly after Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine. According to a March report from Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media watchdog, there have been some 54 cases of YouTube restricting content belonging to Russian channels. Following the launch of Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine, Western governments and private tech companies began a censorship campaign against Russian media they deem to be ‘state-controlled’.

The plan was firmly rejected by multiple Ukrainian officials, who flocked to Musk’s feed, with the notorious Ukrainian envoy Andrey Melnik producing the least diplomatic reaction. Musk floated his peace plan on Monday, proposing new UN-supervised referendums in former Ukrainian territories, which are currently in the process of being incorporated into Russia. Kiev should also relinquish its claim to Crimea, which broke away from the country back in 2014, as well as ensuring a steady water supply to the peninsula and declaring itself a neutral country. The plan prompted a furious response from multiple senior Ukrainian officials, including Kiev’s outgoing envoy to Berlin, best known for repeatedly insulting the German leadership and infamously branding Chancellor Olaf Scholz an “offended liverwurst.” Melnik told the billionaire to “f**k off,” suggesting it was the most diplomatic response he could have provided to the peace plan. F**k off is my very diplomatic reply to you, Elon Musk. The peace plan initially garnered solid support in a Twitter poll, but ultimately attracted the attention of pro-Ukrainian trolls who turned the tide, with nearly 60% opposing it after over 2.6 million votes. Musk, who is no stranger to controversy on Twitter, said the poll had come under the “biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.” Another, toned down poll, in which Musk asked whether at least the people of Donbass and Crimea should decide if they want to stay with Russia or Ukraine, was subjected to bot attacks as well. Still, only some 40% of respondents voted to deny these people the right to decide their own fate after more than 2.2 million votes. Early in the ongoing conflict, Musk strongly supported Kiev, sending hundreds of SpaceX’s Starlink terminals to Ukraine. While the proclaimed purpose of the move was humanitarian, Kiev has since admitted to using them for the war effort, while Russian troops claimed to have seized multiple units from Ukrainian troops. In wake of the controversial peace plan, however, multiple pro-Ukrainian users suggested the billionaire should now shove said terminals up his rectum, while President Vladimir Zelensky launched a poll of his own, wondering whether his followers preferred the Musk who supported Ukraine or this one, who “supports Russia.”",2.674016702692085,2.9286850621026175,-0.25466835941053256,5

It comes almost two weeks after President Vladimir Putin called to bolster the military amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The defense chief said that over 200,000 persons have so far been added to the Russian Armed Forces, all of whom are now undergoing the necessary training. Shoigu has instructed relevant officials to provide the mobilized recruits with all necessary equipment and deploy them to military positions. The minister added that there is also a significant number of volunteers showing up at the military commissariats seeking to join the army, and stressed that it is “extremely important” to assess each appeal carefully and to not reject anyone unless there are serious reasons to. He also explained that those who have been called into service in the past two weeks will only be sent to take part in Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine after they finish training and develop combat coordination with units that are already on the ground. In order to speed up the training process, the minister has ordered commanders to provide fresh recruits with additional training under the guidance of officers with combat experience. Furthermore, the ministry announced that conscripts who fall under the upcoming draft, which will take place in November and recruit some 120,000 people, will serve in units not involved in the military operation. Meanwhile, those who have just finished their mandatory service in Russia’s armed forces will be returning home. Speaking in a televised address on September 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a partial mobilization, looking to recruit some 300,000 reservists to take part in the ongoing military conflict with Ukraine which began in late February. The Russian Defense Ministry has since clarified that the mobilization prioritizes those who have served in the military and who’ve had previous combat experience as well as the necessary specializations needed on the front line.",2.920936980834751,1.5434862941700624,1.3774506866646885,2
2022-10-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/564034-peskov-putin-zelensky-talks/,Kremlin reacts to Zelensky banning talks with Putin,"To resume peace talks with Kiev, Moscow will wait for either a change of stance by the current Ukrainian president or for a new leader, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. This comes after President Zelensky signed a decree ruling out negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even before the launch of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in late February, Moscow “was the supporter of the idea of achieving the terms put forward by the Russian side through diplomatic means,” Peskov told journalists on Tuesday. Russia is still ready to look for a negotiated solution to the conflict between the neighbors, according to the spokesman. But “it takes two parties to negotiate,” he noted. “We’ll now be waiting for the current president to change his stance or for the arrival of the future president of Ukraine, who would change his position in the interests of the Ukrainian people,” Peskov said. On Tuesday, Zelensky signed a decree on Ukraine officially rejecting peace talks with Putin. It rubber stamped decisions made by Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, on Friday, just hours after Putin signed agreements on Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions joining Russia. One of the resolutions was: “stating the impossibility of conducting negotiations with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.” Zelensky recorded a video address after the meeting claiming that “we [Ukraine] are ready for dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia.” In his speech on Friday, Putin called upon Ukraine to “cease all hostilities, stop the war it started back in 2014 and return to the negotiating table.” However, he made it clear that the decision to unite with Russia, which the people of Donbass, Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions made during referendums, was not up for discussion. Kiev should treat the “free choice” of the four territories “with respect,” Putin said, adding that it was “the only way for peace.” Moscow and Kiev have not sat down at the negotiating table since talks in Istanbul finished in late March. The Russian side, which initially expressed optimism on the peace process, later accused Ukraine of backtracking on all the progress achieved in Türkiye, saying it had lost trust in Kiev’s negotiators. In recent months, Ukraine has been either putting forward terms that Moscow deemed ‘unrealistic’ for the resumption of talks, or said that they can only begin after Russia is defeated on the battlefield. Since the conflict began Zelensky has on several occasions proposed meeting with Putin face-to-face, in order to find a way to end hostilities. But Moscow insisted that the two leaders should only get together to sign concrete agreements already prepared for them by the negotiating teams.",2.0615732530412796,1.4243325926990913,0.6372406603421883,8
2022-10-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/564043-belarus-russia-military-operation/,Belarus explains its role in Russia–Ukraine conflict,"Belarus is a participant of the Russian military operation against Ukraine, President Alexander Lukashenko said on Tuesday, stressing that its role was strictly limited. “We are not hiding this. But we do not kill anyone. We do not send our troops anywhere. We do not break our obligations,” the Belarusian leader said during a government security meeting, as quoted by state news agency Belta. “Our role is to prevent this conflict from spreading into the territory of Belarus, first of all. And, secondly, it is to prevent a strike against Belarus from Poland, Lithuania and Latvia under the cover of the special military operation,” he added. Belarus, a long-time military ally of Russia, allowed its troops to use its territory to launch an offensive against Ukraine in late February. Minsk has rejected claims by officials in Kiev that its troops were directly engaged in action against Ukrainian forces. During the Tuesday meeting, Lukashenko further described Ukraine’s participation as ensuring that “nobody would shoot Russians in the back from the territory of Belarus”. He also stated that his country offered medical assistance and food to people, Russians and Ukrainians alike. “Most of all, we feed the refugees, those impoverished poor people who arrive to us from Ukraine, numbering 400 to 500 each day. How can we not feed them and treat them?” he asked. Lukashenko assured that his country would not get involved in the Ukraine crisis beyond what he had outlined. He dismissed as baseless claims by some of his critics that the Belarusian government was preparing a military mobilization following a similar move by Moscow. Russia announced enrolment of some reservists into active military service last month. The Belarusian president urged the military to use the Russian experience to keep the national armed forces ready for a possible call to defend the country. “So learn, learn and once again learn. First of all, learn the military profession in a proper way,” he instructed officials, using two quotes from Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, which were popular in the Soviet Union. He also reiterated his assessment that Russia would be willing to cease hostilities with Ukraine, while other parties fueled the conflict with “concrete steps.” He pointed the finger at the US, which he said continues sending planeloads of military equipment for the Ukrainian military to Poland and other NATO members.",1.5368238024215952,1.4856554824332686,0.051168319988326605,8

Rumen Radev’s comments run counter to a joint communique adopted earlier by the leaders of several eastern and central European countries. In a statement published by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency on Monday, Radev’s office said the president felt compelled to clarify why he had not signed off on the pro-Ukraine declaration. According to the Bulgarian head of state, the “security environment” has changed dramatically since 2008, when Bulgaria joined a declaration on Ukraine’s future accession at the summit in Bucharest. The reality on the ground now dictates that Ukraine’s “membership in the Alliance be discussed within the full composition of the North Atlantic Council,” the president said. He also warned against the “direct involvement of NATO countries in the war.” Radev went on to suggest that a “decision on Ukraine’s accession to NATO should be made only after the development of clear parameters for the peaceful settlement of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine,” which would be acceptable to both sides. On Sunday, the presidents of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia expressed their support for Ukraine’s membership bid and urged all allies to “substantially increase” their military support to Kiev. “We firmly stand behind the 2008 Bucharest NATO Summit decision concerning Ukraine’s future membership,” the joint statement read. At the summit in Romania, the alliance’s members welcomed the “aspirations for membership in NATO” of Ukraine and Georgia, stopping short, however, of providing any time frame for these countries’ accession. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, pointed out that “any decision on membership has to be taken by consensus” of all 30 member states. On Friday, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced his country’s intention to apply for fast-track NATO membership. It came on the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin signed treaties on the inclusion of two Donbass republics, and the Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, into Russia – something Ukraine and its backers see as an attempt at an illegal annexation.",1.4252960825947232,1.7329445407219324,-0.3076484581272092,8

According to Bloomberg, Türkiye is yet to make a formal request for a payment reprieve, but discussions were held between officials. If granted, the deal would help alleviate the pressure on the country’s economy amid a period of high global energy prices. Ankara runs a trade deficit of over $11 billion and has experienced a depreciation of its national currency, the lira, the report noted. A Turkish source cited by Russia’s RIA Novosti on Tuesday said the discussion was about pricing rather than any proposed payment delay. The partial use of the ruble in trade changed the terms of the contracts, and the parties are discussing how it could impact the price of the product, the source explained. The two nations previously agreed to switch 25% of their trade in natural gas to Russian rubles, shifting away from the US dollar. Moscow has branded the leading Western currency “toxic” due to the control that Washington has over it, and its willingness to use it for political leverage. Hungary, another major buyer of Russian energy, announced on Monday that it had reached a conditional agreement on postponing its due payments for winter gas supplies. “We agreed on a threshold value, and the part exceeding this we don't have to pay for now, but it goes into deferred payment,” Development Minister Marton Nagy told Reuters. The official said the threshold was set below the current spot price of gas, and the arrangement would last till March. He estimated that Hungary would be able to defer as much as €1 billion ($990 million) in payments.",2.6896936785813472,3.8745802428519585,-1.1848865642706112,7

The treaties were signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the heads of the four former Ukrainian regions on Friday last week. They were certified as lawful by the Constitutional Court over the weekend and ratified by the State Duma, the lower house of the Parliament, on Monday. The latest step in the process of accepting the four regions as new parts of Russia was approved in an unanimous vote. The Russian constitution will need to be amended for the accession to be finalized. The two Donbass regions split from Ukraine in 2014, after people there rejected an armed coup in Kiev that ousted the democratically elected government. An eight-year-long attempt by Russia and some European nations to reconcile Kiev with the rebellious regions failed. Moscow accused the Ukrainian government of deliberately derailing the peace plan and opting to build up its military to ultimately resolve the issue by force. In February, Russia recognized Donetsk and Lugansk Republics as sovereign states and called on Kiev to pull back its troops, which it rejected. Days later Russia launched a full-scale military operation against Ukraine, seizing large parts of Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions in the process. All four territories held referendums last month on joining Russia. Kiev rejected the votes as a “sham” and accused Russia of annexing its territory. The Ukrainian government, which receives military assistance, training and intelligence from NATO nations on an unprecedented scale, says it is determined to beat Russia on the battlefield. Moscow said the referendums were a legitimate way for people to exercise their right for self-determination and be protected from their former government.",2.046761030611589,2.0774172926838053,-0.03065626207221639,2
2022-10-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/564003-medvedev-musk-proposal-stierlitz/,Former Kremlin leader quips Musk is a 'shadowy Russian agent',"After Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, and Kiev’s online troll army, savaged Elon Musk’s proposal for ending the conflict with Russia, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev jokingly called the Tesla founder a “shadowy agent” of the Kremlin. He went on to compare him to Stierlitz, a legendary fictional Soviet spy. “Kudos to [Elon Musk]! However, the shadowy agent has lost the cover. Deserves a new rank, fast. His next tweet will run like, Ukraine is an artificial state. Anticipating…” Medvedev tweeted, in English, on Monday evening. On his Telegram channel, in Russian, instead of “shadowy agent” the former president called Musk “Eustace” – a reference to the code name of the main character in the Soviet-era series ‘17 Moments of Spring,’ better known under his German alias Otto von Stierlitz. Both references were clearly tongue-in-cheek and poked fun not at Musk, but at the utter hysterics of the Ukrainian government and its online influencers over the American billionaire’s earnest peace proposal. Crimea would remain Russian and have its water supply guaranteed, Ukraine would declare neutrality, and the four regions that just joined Russia hold UN-supervised referendums on their fate, Musk suggested earlier in the day. The poll was quickly swamped by what he called the “biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.” It wasn’t just Kiev’s info-warriors and their Western NAFO backers, however. Ukraine’s departing ambassador to Germany used some very un-diplomatic language, while President Vladimir Zelensky himself launched a poll asking his followers if they preferred Musk who supported Ukraine over this one, who “supports Russia.” Early on in the conflict, Musk sent hundreds of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites and terminals to Ukraine. Though their stated purpose was humanitarian, Kiev has since admitted to using them for the war effort. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” Moscow also demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev has rejected this, insisting that the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",2.351132105133815,1.580395980136781,0.7707361249970341,2
2022-10-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/563998-sachs-nord-stream-bloomberg/,Bloomberg tries to drown out economist's Nord Stream theory,"Economist Jeffrey Sachs speculated on Monday that the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines was the work of the US and maybe Poland, to the chagrin of Bloomberg TV hosts who quickly tried to change the subject. Now a professor at Columbia University, Sachs became notorious in Russia for masterminding the “shock therapy” reforms in the 1990s – but has been sharply critical of the West’s approach to the conflict in Ukraine in recent months. Invited to Bloomberg’s ‘Surveillance’ show on Monday, Sachs was asked to comment on Russia he “knew so well” under President Boris Yeltsin. Instead, the hosts scrambled to cut him off after he said the conflict is “on the path of escalation to nuclear war” and did not start in February 2022. “Most of the world doesn’t see it the way we describe it,” Sachs told Bloomberg’s Tom Keene, at which point co-host Lisa Abramowicz tried to change the subject to inflation in Europe. Columbia Univ.'s Jeffrey Sachs: ""The destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline, which I would bet is a U.S.-Poland action [because] first of all, there is direct radar evidence that U.S. military helicopters that are normally based in Gdansk were circling over the area ..."" pic.twitter.com/rGZ6VhlvPq The EU is in a “very sharp economic downturn,” Sachs agreed. The continent was “getting hammered” by energy shortages, made worse by “the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline which I would bet was a US action – perhaps US and Poland,” he managed to add before Keene cut him off, asking for evidence of that claim. “Well first of all, there’s direct radar evidence that US helicopters, military helicopters that are normally based in Gdansk, were circling over this area. We also had the threats from the US, earlier in this year, that ‘one way or the other, we are going to end Nord Stream.’ We also have the remarkable statement by [US] Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken last Friday in a press conference; he says ‘this is also a tremendous opportunity.’ Sorry, it’s a strange way to talk if you’re worried about piracy on international infrastructure of vital significance,” Sachs retorted. “I know this runs counter to our narrative, you’re not allowed to say these things in the West, but the fact of the matter is – all over the world, when I talk to people, they think the US did it,” he added. Abramowicz again tried to change the subject, saying Bloomberg couldn’t provide “counterbalance” to what he was saying. Undeterred, Sachs answered the next question by describing the current situation as “the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis” in 1962, with the US picking fights with both Russia and China, without any attempts to de-escalate things. Currently director of the Center for Sustainable Development at New York’s Columbia University, Sachs gained notoriety among the Russians for his “shock therapy” reforms in 1991-1993. The overhaul of the entire Soviet economy ended up destroying the lives of millions of Russians and handing the country’s wealth over to a handful of oligarchs.",2.5030515974219765,2.791726276196946,-0.28867467877496944,8

In a poll on Twitter, Zelensky asked his followers “which Elon Musk” they “like more”: the one “who supports Ukraine,” or the one “who supports Russia.” At time of writing, just under 85% chose the former. Which @elonmusk do you like more? Earlier on Monday, Musk suggested that Russia hold new UN-supervised referendums in its newly-acquired territories, while Ukraine formally relinquishes its claim to Crimea, guarantees the peninsula’s water supply, and declares itself a neutral country. “This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end,” Musk continued, adding that it is “just a question of how many people die before then.” Musk put the plan to a poll, where around 60% of respondents approved before the vote swung against him. Musk attributed this rapid change in results to the “biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.” Amid criticism from pro-Ukrainian posters and officials in Kiev, Musk stood firm, arguing that Russia’s population advantage guarantees it victory should Zelensky follow through on his stated goal of retaking Crimea and Moscow declare war in response. Russia is doing partial mobilization. They go to full war mobilization if Crimea is at risk. Death on both sides will be devastating.Russia has >3 times population of Ukraine, so victory for Ukraine is unlikely in total war. If you care about the people of Ukraine, seek peace. While Zelensky’s poll leaned heavily to one side, the Ukrainian leader was criticized by some pundits for engaging in such social media tiffs. “This guy does photoshoots for Vogue and sits on a never-ending mountain of cash from [the] west…and then gets angry when Elon suggests that maybe ending the war before more of his people needlessly die is a thing worth pursuing,” American conservative Greg Price wrote. Musk has lent Zelensky his support before, offering Ukraine terminals to access his satellite-based Starlink internet service in the early days of the conflict. However, he resisted pressure from “some governments” to block Russian news sites on the service, and admitted to colleagues that he thought RT made “some good points.”",2.3916746052778284,1.9027260407306967,0.48894856454713165,5

Musk was hounded on Twitter by pro-Ukrainian bot accounts and condemned by the Kiev government. He insists that his idea is preferable to the deaths of “millions of people.” Musk posted his peace proposal to Twitter on Monday, suggesting that Russia hold new UN-supervised referendums in its newly-acquired territories, while Ukraine formally relinquishes its claim to Crimea, guarantees the peninsula’s water supply, and declares itself a neutral country. A poll accompanying his post showed around 60% of respondents backing the plan, before pro-Ukrainian accounts in the comments summoned an army of trolls to swing the vote in their favor. Musk himself said that the poll was subjected to the “biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.” Ukraine’s parliament responded to the suggestion with a simple “no,” while Kiev’s outgoing ambassador to Berlin, Andrey Melnik, said that his “very diplomatic reply” would be “f**k off.” Musk then ran a fresh poll, asking whether “the will of the people who live in the Donbass and Crimea should decide whether they’re part of Russia or Ukraine.” The two Donbass Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk declared independence from Ukraine in 2014 and are currently being formally acceded into Russia, while Crimea overwhelmingly voted to rejoin Russia in 2014 and was accepted the same year. With Musk claiming that the troll army was still out in force, 44% of respondents said they would deny these people the choice. Musk was again criticized for supposedly hindering the Ukrainian cause, but the billionaire stood his ground. “You are assuming that I wish to be popular. I don’t care,” he replied to one critic. “I do care that millions of people may die needlessly for an essentially identical outcome.” “Russia is doing partial mobilization,” he explained. “They go to full war mobilization if Crimea is at risk.

The Fourth European NATO Reich, where thirty countries united all their regiments and armies,” Zyuganov said while addressing the State Duma on Monday. With his remark, the politician effectively compared the US-led NATO alliance to Nazi Germany, also known as the Third Reich. During WWII, several European allies and satellite states fought alongside Nazi Germany, while its own military incorporated numerous volunteer units provided by other European nations. Zyuganov made the statement as the Duma gathered to vote on the accession of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR), as well as the former Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, to Russia. The legislation was passed unanimously. The DPR and LPR split from Ukraine shortly after the 2014 Maidan coup in Kiev. Russia recognized them as independent states in February shortly before the ongoing conflict broke out. Ukraine’s southern Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions have been under Russian control since March. Both declared independence from Ukraine in the wake of last week’s referendums and, along with the DPR and LPR, requested to be admitted into Russia.

2022-10-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/563988-elon-musk-ukraine-poll/,Elon Musk proposes Ukraine peace plan,"SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has proposed a plan to end the conflict in Ukraine. The billionaire suggested that new elections be held in the four regions that recently voted to join Russia, while Ukraine would commit to neutrality and relinquish its claim to Crimea. Musk posted an outline of his plan on Twitter on Monday, suggesting that Russia “redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision,” with Moscow withdrawing from these areas if voters choose. Crimea would be declared “formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783,” until Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gifted the peninsula to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954. Musk, whose text messages revealed him to be an occasional reader of RT, called Khrushchev’s decision a “mistake.” The billionaire then suggested that Ukraine commit to neutrality – as Russia had requested long before it launched its military operation in February – and guarantee the supply of water to Crimea. Ukraine shut down the supply in 2014 after Crimeans overwhelmingly voted to rejoin the Russian Federation. Shortly after the launch of Russia’s operation in Ukraine, the supply was restored. “This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end,” Musk commented on his suggestion, adding that it is “just a question of how many people die before then.” The plan is unlikely to find fans in Kiev. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has vowed not to negotiate with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and to seize the entirety of the territory Kiev claims as its own – including the Donbass republics and Crimea – by force. Furthermore, Zelensky sent an application for membership to the NATO alliance last week. Residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, and Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, would likely vote in overwhelming numbers to join Russia if the recent referendums in these territories were held again. All of these regions have a high percentage of Russian speakers and have historically voted for pro-Russian candidates while part of Ukraine. However, Putin has already signed treaties to accede these territories into the Russian Federation, and has vowed to defend them with Russia’s full military capabilities. At the time of writing, nearly 60% of respondents on Twitter backed Musk’s idea. That ratio is likely to change, however, as pro-Ukrainian Twitter users in the comments have called on ‘#NAFO’ trolls to swing the poll in their favor.

In a Telegram post on Monday, Stremousov stated that “everything is under control in the Nikolayev direction,” despite Kiev’s efforts to retake the region. He noted that Ukraine’s forces had advanced southward along the Dnieper River to the village of Dudchany before “taking a beating” from Russian Aerospace Forces. The official admitted that the Ukrainians were able to advance a little bit, but noted that the region’s defense systems were working and that “at the moment, the situation is completely under control.” Stremousov concluded by urging people not to give into panic because of what they hear and read on social media. “This is not Kharkov, this is not [Krasny] Liman, we are holding the fence,” he proclaimed. Russia’s Defense Ministry has also confirmed repelling the attack, stating that over 400 Ukrainian servicemen, 43 tanks and 89 units of special military equipment were eliminated in the Nikolayev-Krivoy Rog area. The announcement comes as Kiev’s forces have mounted large-scale offensives along several points of engagement with Russia. On Saturday, Russian troops were forced to withdraw from their defensive positions in the town of Krasny Liman in the Donetsk People’s Republic after they were nearly encircled by Ukrainian forces, which had brought in reserves and reached a “considerable superiority in men and material.” It has been noted, however, that the Ukrainian side has been suffering significant casualties in the offensive, having reportedly lost over 500 soldiers (200 dead, 320 injured), as well as ten tanks and 25 infantry fighting vehicles during the attack on Krasny Liman, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Kiev’s offensive comes after President Vladimir Putin signed treaties on the accession of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as the Russian-held regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, into the Russian Federation on Friday.

His comments came shortly after Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of the Chechen Republic, suggested that Russia should use “low-yield nuclear weapons” against Ukraine. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Peskov said that governors and heads of regions in Russia have the right to express their personal opinion and to “give assessments” on issues.

Asked if Kadyrov’s remark could be considered an inappropriate display of emotion, the Kremlin spokesman said that in Russia, the use of nuclear weapons “is based on what is laid down in the respective doctrine.” “There can be no other considerations here,” he added. Kadyrov made his comments on Telegram on Saturday in response to the retreat of Russian forces from the town of Krasny Liman in Donetsk Region. The Russian Defense Ministry said the pullback was due to the “emerging threat of encirclement” by Ukrainian forces. The Chechen leader called for Russia to take “more drastic measures” in Ukraine, suggesting martial law in Russian regions bordering Ukraine and “the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.” The latest version of Russia’s nuclear doctrine, published in 2020, states Moscow reserves the right to use atomic weapons only if such arms or other weapons of mass destruction are being targeted at the country or it is being faced with an existential threat from conventional arms.",3.0541673963046714,2.722575119063302,0.3315922772413695,9

The official was speaking about the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), which is slated for Thursday. The new French-proposed club is meant to bring together the 27 EU members and 17 nations that either aspire to join it or have traditionally close ties to it, such as Norway and the UK. Although the idea was given a boost when UK Prime Minister Liz Truss agreed to participate in the first meeting, doubts reportedly remain about the viability of the project, which was originally proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron. “The British took a very pragmatic tactic: if you cannot ‘kill’ the strange initiative, it is better to engage deeply and to direct it in your own way,” a European diplomat told Reuters about Truss' decision to attend the summit in Prague. The forum was initially rejected by some intended members, particularly Ukraine, which perceived it as a French ploy to stall its desired accession to the EU. “Strategic ambiguity on Ukraine’s European perspective practiced by some EU capitals in the past years has failed and must end. It only emboldened [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba declared in May, when Macron first proposed the idea. Kiev and other Eastern European participants have since somewhat warmed up to the EPC, though much skepticism remains, diplomats told Reuters. “It will be just another 'blah blah' forum to discuss … but after a few meetings it might finish without any big success,” a diplomatic source quoted by the news agency on Monday predicted. “There are too many countries with too many interests … How do you have Serbia and talk about Russia? How do you have Turkey and Greece/Cyprus together? How to have Armenia and Azerbaijan at the same table?” the diplomat asked. Though it lacks a coherent agenda, the EPC is largely viewed as a vehicle for the EU to bring closer aspiring members that may be frustrated by the lack of progress in their accession, Reuters said. In particular, countries in the Western Balkans may look to Russia and China for possible investments and other benefits, a prospect that France seeks to counter with this initiative. Another apparent target for the diplomatic drive is Türkiye, which refused to join the EU’s efforts to isolate Russia commercially and politically in retaliation for its military operation against Ukraine. Unlike the EU, Ankara has preserved its ties with Moscow and is attempting to adopt the role of mediator in the conflict.",2.4453519154541508,2.0472221841391183,0.3981297313150325,8

2022-10-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/563959-kherson-zaporozhye-border-peskov/,Kremlin comments on borders of new territories,"Moscow has yet to determine the future borders of Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, which are set to be incorporated into Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has told journalists. “We will continue to consult with the residents of those regions on the issue of borders,” the official said on Monday. The two former Ukrainian regions voted last month to break away from Kiev and request being accepted into Russia. However, parts of them are still controlled by Ukrainian troops. The issue of borders came up last week, when President Vladimir Putin signed orders recognizing the two regions’ independence. The documents did not include any reference to the demarcation of the territories. When asked by journalists for clarification, Peskov promised to give an answer later. Further complicating the situation is the fact that Russian forces are in control of a small chunk of Ukraine’s Nikolaev Region, which borders Kherson Region. Vladimir Saldo, the head of the Kherson administration, claimed last week that the land would be incorporated into Russia. This week, the Russian parliament is scheduled to ratify the unification treaties with the two regions, as well as the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. The latter two territories, which were recognized as independent by Russia in February, are defined “by the 2014 borders,” according to Peskov. Russian troops and Donbass militias have since seized much of the disputed land, but not all of it. Kiev blasted the referendums that paved the way for the accession as a “sham” and reiterated its intention to defeat Russia on the battlefield and oust its troops from all land that it claims as Ukrainian. Moscow said the ballots were a legitimate exercise of the right to self-determination.",1.8156199772913606,1.592829694827591,0.22279028246376953,2

President Vladimir Putin submitted the documents regarding the four former Ukrainian territories to the lower house of parliament on Sunday. All four voted overwhelmingly in favor of joining Russia in referendums held between September 23 and 27. Addressing legislators before the vote, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that accession will “serve the interests of all people of our multiethnic country.” He added that Kiev had oppressed Russian-speaking people, which made the existence of certain territories within the Ukrainian state impossible. State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin argued that accession to Russia is the only way to save the people living in the four former Ukrainian territories from shelling by Ukrainian troops. “The only way to end this is reunification [with Russia],” he said. The accession treaties, which were signed by Putin on Friday, were then approved by the Russian Constitutional Court. The next step in the accession process is ratification by the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia’s parliament. The DPR and LPR broke off from Ukraine shortly after the 2014 coup in Kiev. Russia recognized them as independent states in February. Ukraine’s southern Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions were seized by Russian troops during Moscow’s military operation in the neighboring country, which was launched on February 24.

Ruediger Koenig added that its members want to avoid a major war. He was speaking to Dein Spiegel, the youth version of Der Spiegel magazine, which published the interview on Saturday. The Ukraine conflict dominated much of the article, with Koenig describing Russia’s decision to launch its offensive against its neighbor in late February as a watershed event. “We had peace, and now we see all of a sudden that one country is attacking another one just like that, in Europe,” the official said, adding that no one could have imagined anything like that. Germany’s representative to NATO stressed that the military alliance as a whole, however, has no legal obligation to help Kiev repel Moscow’s attack as Ukraine is not a member state. This means that Article 5 of NATO’s treaty cannot be activated, the official explained. Under it, an attack on one ally is considered to be an attack against the whole of NATO, with all member states having to stick up for the targeted nation. According to Koenig, the military bloc is anxious to avoid getting actively involved in the conflict at all costs because “this would mean a very big war.” Such a scenario, which would see 30 more nations join the fray, is something “nobody wants,” the diplomat noted. When asked what can be done to help Ukraine, the envoy explained that individual member states are providing Kiev with weapons and money. Koenig went on to cite EU sanctions imposed on Russia over the past six months. He concluded that the prospect of peace is rather slim as Ukraine and Russia’s positions seem to be irreconcilable. Koenig clarified that Ukraine “rightly” demands that Moscow cede all former Ukrainian regions in the south and east of the country that recently voted to join Russia, as well as Crimea, which joined the country in 2014. The official pointed out that the Kremlin, however, is unlikely to agree to such terms. Dein Spiegel is a media that offers “exciting, understandably written stories” for children who “want to understand the world,” according to a description on its website.

The exception would allow companies to hire pilots for tankers carrying Russian oil, which is banned under the current sanctions that take effect from December. The news comes after the Danish Maritime Authority told the Financial Times last week that the inability to use pilots for ships sailing through the sometimes-treacherous straits between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea will lead to significant safety and environmental risks. The EU imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow in response to its military operation in Ukraine, which was launched in February.

The object does not, however, pose an “immediate danger” to our planet, the scientists stated. The institute released early imagery of the asteroid, which appears as nothing more than a distant dot in the skies through powerful telescopes. Reached by TASS for comment, an astronomer with the Russian Academy of Science, Yuri Balega, said that 2022 SE37 was unlikely to ever threaten Earth. “This is yet another of almost 30,000 asteroids already discovered by astronomers around the world.

The statement came two days after Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced his country’s intention to apply for fast-track NATO membership. “We firmly stand behind the 2008 Bucharest NATO Summit decision concerning Ukraine’s future membership,” the presidents of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia said. At the Bucharest summit, the alliance members welcomed the “aspirations for membership in NATO” of Ukraine and Georgia but didn’t provide any time frame for these countries’ accession. “We support Ukraine in its defence against Russia's invasion, demand Russia to immediately withdraw from all the occupied territories and encourage all Allies to substantially increase their military aid to Ukraine,” the statement said. Referring to the impending inclusion of four former Ukrainian regions into the Russian Federation, the leaders said that they would “never” recognize “Russian attempts to annex any Ukrainian territory.” Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, commenting on Zelensky’s NATO bid, emphasized that “any decision on membership has to be taken by consensus” of all 30 members. Stressing that NATO “has an open door policy,” Stoltenberg said that currently the top priority of the bloc is “to support Ukraine,” both militarily and financially. He believes that this is also “the best way to respond” to Russia’s actions. Stoltenberg’s remarks echoed a statement made earlier by the White House. Speaking on Friday, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan claimed that the best way now is to provide Ukraine with “practical” support, while “the process in Brussels should be taken up at a different time.” Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna, meanwhile, revealed on Sunday that Kiev’s NATO application “is already on its way to Brussels.” Zelensky’s announcement of the NATO membership bid came on the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin signed treaties on the inclusion of two Donbass republics, and Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, into Russia. Moscow, which considers the enlargement of NATO a direct threat to its national interests, cited Ukraine’s potential membership in the alliance as one of the reasons for its military offensive.",1.4875168730356674,1.915817367947247,-0.4283004949115796,8

Kherson Region and most of Zaporozhye have been under the control of the Russian military since March. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

The latter stated that US arms deliveries – including a $1.1 billion package announced earlier this week – would continue to flow as they have since February. Zelensky responded to Putin’s move on Friday by declaring that he would never negotiate a peace settlement as long as the Russian president remains in power, and also by signing an application demanding “accelerated” admission to the NATO alliance. Zelensky’s application was rebuffed by NATO and US leaders, however, with the White House declaring that Ukraine’s potential membership in the alliance “should be taken up at a different time.” Zelensky has repeatedly declared that his forces would retake all Russian-held lands, including Crimea, which voted to join Russia in 2014, by “any means that we consider correct.” Still, according to Putin, once the Donbass republics and Zaporozhye and Kherson are formally incorporated into Russia, they would be defended with “all means available.”",1.3869196698792965,2.9079327452115784,-1.521013075332282,2

2022-10-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/563904-soundcloud-ban-russia-fake-news/,SoundCloud banned for fake news – regulator,"Russia has blocked SoundCloud, one of the world’s largest online audio distribution platforms, for spreading misinformation about Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine, the nation’s media watchdog Roskomnadzor said in a statement on Sunday. Access to the service has been suspended at the request of the Prosecutor General’s Office because SoundCloud was displaying “materials containing false information about the essence of [Russia’s] special military operation in the territory of Ukraine,” according to the Roskomnadzor document, as cited by various outlets. In particular, this includes spreading falsehoods about the military campaign’s “form, methods of warfare (attacks on civilians, strikes on civilian infrastructure), as well as about numerous civilian casualties at the hands of Russian soldiers,” the regulator said. Roskomnadzor noted that, according to Russian legislation, such “fake information” is subject to being immediately blocked, adding that it had twice demanded that the platform’s owner delete the objectionable materials. The watchdog added that “should the prohibited information be removed, the resource will be unblocked.” SoundCloud was blocked in Russia on Saturday, with Roskomnadzor saying at the time that the platform had violated Russia’s data protection law. It also claimed that the service flouted regulations prohibiting “calls for massive civil unrest, extremist activities” while disseminating “false information of public importance.” In recent months, Russian authorities have imposed various restrictions and fines on a number of Western-based tech giants for failing to comply with local legislation. In March, the platforms Facebook and Instagram were banned in Russia as extremist organizations after they allowed online hate speech against the country’s nationals. In late July, a Moscow court fined social media platforms Snapchat, Tinder, and WhatsApp for refusing to localize the data of Russian users in the country. The same punishment was imposed on American search giant Google after it failed to remove prohibited information on the Ukraine conflict. Prior to that, Spotify, another popular audio streaming service, withdrew from Russia, arguing that it had to do so due to the legislation that criminalizes knowingly publishing false information about the actions of Russia’s armed forces.

2022-10-02,https://www.rt.com/russia/563788-referendums-ukraine-nato-dilemma/,NATO in the horns of a dilemma after former Ukrainian regions vote to join Russia,"By infusing tens of billions of dollars’ worth of military aid into Ukraine, NATO produced a “game-changing” dynamic designed to throw Russia off balance. By undertaking the referendums in Kherson, Zaporozhye, Donetsk, and Lugansk, Russia changed the game altogether. The ancient Greeks spoke of lemma as representing a logical premise, a matter taken for granted. This contrasted with a dilemma, or “dual premise”, where one would be presented with an either/or proposition. The Romans furthered this notion, referring to a “double premise” as argumentum cornutum, of the “horned argument,” because by answering one argument, an individual would be impaled by the logic of the second. Thus are the ancient roots of the modern idiom, “on the horns of a dilemma.” This is the ultimate objective of maneuver warfare, for example: to position your forces in such a manner as to present the enemy with no good option – should they react to one pressing threat, they would find themselves overwhelmed by the other. The Russian military operation that has been underway in Ukraine for more than seven months now has provided ample examples of the military forces of both sides being confronted with a situation that compelled them to alter their preferred course of action; the Russian “diversion” against Kiev early on in the SMO prevented the Ukrainians from reinforcing their forces in eastern Ukraine, and the recently concluded Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkov compelled a hasty Russian withdrawal from a significant swath of previously occupied Ukrainian territory. Both examples cited presented one side with a lemma, or a single problem, which needed to be addressed. But neither was able to put its opponent “on the horns of a dilemma,” forcing a response which would result in impalement regardless of the option chosen. The reason for this is simple – very rarely will competent military commanders allow themselves to be presented with a military problem for which there is no viable response. War, it seems, is hard work, and dilemmas don’t fall from trees. Or do they? Ever since Boris Johnston flew to Kiev in April to convince Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to pull out of peace talks then ongoing with Russia in the Turkish city of Istanbul, NATO has embarked on a program designed to provide Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military and financial assistance, including the transfer of modern heavy weapons and the use of facilities on Western soil where tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops could be trained and organized without fear of Russian intervention. The purpose behind the NATO infusion of weaponry into Ukraine was straightforward – to empower Ukraine to not only lengthen the conflict, but also to undertake offensive military operations designed to evict Russia from what Kiev and its backers consider occupied Ukrainian territory, including the Donbass and Crimea. The counteroffensive in Kharkov in early September underscored the serious consequences of NATO’s actions – even though, given the massive loss of life and material suffered by the attacking Ukrainian forces, made the Kharkov victory Pyrrhic in nature, it was a Ukrainian victory, and one which compelled a Russian retreat. By transforming the Ukrainian army into a NATO army which was manned by Ukrainians, the US-led bloc had, in fact, changed the nature of the game from a straightforward Russia-versus-Ukraine “special military operation” into a “Russia-versus-the collective West” struggle where the military resources originally allocated by Moscow to the fight were now insufficient to the task. Advantage, Ukraine/NATO. Russia, however, was not taking the game-changing actions of NATO standing still. Responding to the new reality on the ground in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin opted not to simply up the ante in this new NATO-driven game of increasing military power but change the game altogether. Not only did he order the partial mobilization of some 300,000 Russian reservists to reinforce the troops currently committed to the SMO, Putin also approved referendums in the four territories where Russian forces are presently fighting – Kherson and Zaporozhye (formerly occupied Ukrainian regions), and Donetsk and Lugansk (former regions of Ukraine, de-facto independent since 2014). These referendums asked the citizens of these four territories one simple question: do you wish to become part of Russia? After five days of voting, the results from all four territories were clear – by an overwhelming majority, the participants in the referendums approved the proposition. Shortly thereafter, they were incorporated into the Russian Federation. What was once Ukraine has now become Mother Russia. Russia didn’t just change the rules of the game – it changed the game itself. Instead of Ukrainian forces fighting Russian forces on the territory of Ukraine, any future combat carried out by Ukraine against Russian forces would represent an attack on the Russian homeland itself. Where does this leave NATO? The bloc's leadership has made it clear from day one that it is not seeking direct confrontation with Russia. While its members have poured in tens of billions of dollars of material into Ukraine to help reconstitute its military, and provided critical logistics, intelligence, and communications support to Ukraine, it has repeatedly and insistently stated that it has no desire to fight a war with Russia directly and has made it clear that it would rather have the Ukrainians serve as a de facto NATO proxy in resisting Moscow. NATO has gone “all in” both economically and politically when it comes to supporting Ukraine, to the extent that some of its members, having stripped their respective military structures of equipment and material, have nothing left to give. Despite this, European political and economic elites continue to articulate their strong support for Ukraine going forward. This support, however, was predicated on the fundamental assumption that by providing Ukraine with this massive level of support, NATO would not get directly involved in a conflict with Moscow. But Russia, by transforming the battleground from one being fought on Ukrainian soil to one where it's now defending its own land, has flipped the script. NATO, having overcommitted to Ukraine, now finds itself “on the horns of a dilemma” – if it continues to provide massive material and financial support to Ukraine, it will, in effect, become a direct party to the conflict, something no one in the bloc wants. However, if it backs away from supporting Ukraine, the various Western political leaders and institutions which have made support for Kiev a sacred obligation will be seen as going back on their word. How NATO opts to proceed has yet to be manifest, but indications are that it will not be in a manner which continues to double down on supporting Ukraine no matter what. Secretary General Stoltenberg’s tepid speech condemning Russia while showing no enthusiasm for Zelensky’s “accelerated application” for membership is indicative of the less-than-resolute nature of its support for Kiev. NATO now will find its role diminished by the consequences of the Russian mobilization and referendums. Years from now, when the history of the conflict is finally written, the decision by President Putin to simultaneously mobilize the Russian reserves while absorbing the territory of southern and eastern Ukraine into the Russian Federation will serve as one of the premier modern-history examples of putting an adversary “on the horns of a dilemma.” The effective neutering of NATO by this action will more than likely be seen as a turning point in the conflict, one which sealed the fate of Ukraine in the face of an inevitable Russian victory.",1.9952072290873641,2.6775716565260743,-0.6823644274387102,8

Speaking to the Spanish RTVE channel, the bloc’s high representative for foreign affairs described the impending inclusion of the two Donbass Republics, and Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions, into the Russian Federation as an “annexation” and an act of “completely unjustified aggression.” “Putin makes it more difficult, even impossible, for the war to end,” Borrell said. The EU is committed to continuing its military support for Ukraine, the diplomat stressed. The bloc also intends to go ahead with another package of sanctions against Moscow “so that Russia would be isolated internationally,” he added. Russia has consistently warned the West against “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons, saying that it would only prolong the conflict. Borrell’s claim that Russia’s “annexation” of new territories will further jeopardize a peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis echoed earlier remarks by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Speaking on the eve of the accession ceremony for the former Ukrainian regions, Guterres condemned in very strong terms both their inclusion into Russia and the preceding referendums, and called on Russia “to step back from the brink.” In response, Moscow accused the secretary general of abusing his authority. Putin, meanwhile, warned the Ukrainian authorities and their Western “handlers” that people living in the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as in the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, have become Russian citizens “forever” because they made a choice “to be with their Motherland.” In his speech at the signing ceremony for the accession treaties, the president also accused the West of seeking “to weaken and break up Russia,” of being “ready to cross every line to preserve the neo-colonial system,” and of overthrowing traditional values, which, in Putin’s opinion, amounts to “pure Satanism.” The Russian president did call on Kiev to “return to the negotiating table.” His Ukrainian counterpart, Vladimir Zelensky, however, said that his country was ready for dialogue with Russia, but “with another president.”",2.155440079222764,2.485082505655328,-0.32964242643256414,8
2022-10-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/563880-russia-aviation-watchdog-vote/,Russia slams 'political' aviation watchdog,"Russia will continue its work in the International Civil Aviation Organization despite the ICAO’s “unfriendly” and “political” decision not to re-elect it to the governing council, the Russian agency overseeing civil aviation, Rosaviatsiya, has said in a statement. Earlier on Saturday, amid the ongoing confrontation between Moscow and Western countries over aviation-related sanctions, Russia did not secure enough votes during the UN aviation agency’s 193-nation assembly in Montreal, Canada. All other members of the council’s ‘chief importance’ group, which Russia had been part of, were re-elected, according to the list published by the organization on Twitter. Rosaviatsiya claimed that in cases when a council member of the group is not elected, a re-vote is required. “However, the Russian delegation was denied this. We believe that the unfriendly decision of the coalition of countries is political and temporary,” the watchdog said. Rosaviatsiya emphasized that Russia remains a full member of ICAO and thus will continue its work in the organization “through the Russian representation in ICAO, as well as in the relevant ICAO working groups.” The agency said that Russia’s removal from the ICAO council would not affect international flights from Russia to “friendly” countries. It also offered reassurances that the Russian aviation industry would continue to adhere to the “high standards” recommended by the ICAO. Earlier this week, Adina Valean, the European Union’s transport commissioner, accused Moscow of violating the ICAO’s fundamental principles. “We cannot accept that a member, breaching so clearly the Chicago Convention, sits in the very council that should act as its guardian,” Valean said, referring to the 1944 treaty, that established the organization's framework. Canada’s transport minister, Omar Alghabra, had said earlier that his country would also be opposing Russia’s nomination to the 36-seat council. Western countries have been accusing Russia of illegally confiscating hundreds of foreign jets. Moscow denies these allegations, citing a law that allows Russian airlines to re-register foreign-owned airplanes and continue using them domestically. The law was signed by President Vladimir Putin in response to the Western ban on supplying aircraft and aircraft parts to Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. Moscow also closed its airspace to airlines from 36 countries, including all EU countries.",2.457706730917128,3.2285115251418732,-0.7708047942247451,8
2022-10-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/563883-fire-crimea-military-airfield/,Fire breaks out at Crimean airfield (VIDEO),"A military aircraft loaded with ammunition skidded off the runway at an airfield in Crimea on Saturday, resulting in a major fire, according to local authorities. Photos and videos published on social media showed massive plumes of thick smoke billowing over the area where the Balbek military airfield is located, not far from the port city of Sevastopol. Some witnesses also claimed to have heard explosions in the area. The incident at the airfield was caused by a military aircraft's hard landing, Sevastopol Mayor Mikhail Razvozhaev said in a Telegram post. The aircraft skidded off the runway and caught fire, according to the mayor, citing local emergency services. Later, Razvozhaev also said that the ammunition onboard detonated. The pilot of the aircraft managed to make it to safety, the mayor added. There have been no official reports of any casualties. The fire at the airfield was “promptly extinguished,” and the airfield itself was not damaged, local authorities said. The developments come amid the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The peninsula, which broke away from Kiev following an armed coup in 2014 and voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to join Russia, has already seen several major incidents over the course of the conflict. Powerful explosions near a Russian ammunition depot rocked the village of Mayskoye in northeastern Crimea in August, while earlier in the month the Saki military airfield saw a series of blasts that injured 14 people and killed one. The Russian Defense Ministry called the strikes acts of “sabotage.” In early September, Ukraine’s top commander, General Valery Zaluzhny, took responsibility for the attacks on the Crimean facilities, calling them a “series of successful missile strikes.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",4.802814546787109,3.8696589661500806,0.933155580637028,0
2022-10-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/563869-zelensky-ukraine-military-draft-discharge/,Zelensky postpones regular military draft and discharge,"Ukraine will not call up new conscripts as part of a regular yearly draft, a decree issued by President Vladimir Zelensky on Friday says. Those drafted last year will remain on active duty until Kiev announces a demobilization, the document says. Last year’s presidential decree on the scheduled military draft was amended with a paragraph saying that those drafted in 2021 can be discharged “not before the announcement of the established demobilization procedure,” a new order published on the Ukrainian president’s official website says. The decree comes amid the protracted conflict between Moscow and Kiev, which saw Russia announcing a partial mobilization in September. Ukraine ordered a nationwide mobilization and imposed martial law on February 25, a day after the start of the conflict. Martial law has since been repeatedly extended. The last time it was declared was mid-August, and is scheduled to be in place until at least November 21. Zelensky also called off the regular spring draft and extended the period of active-duty service for last year’s conscripts in April. In May, Zelensky told the newspaper Ukrainskaya Pravda that the total number of Ukrainian Army servicemen had reached 700,000 amid the multiple waves of mobilization and the conflict with Russia. In June, Ukraine’s defense minister, Aleksey Reznikov, told UNIAN news agency that “more than 1 million people” were ensuring the nation’s “defense and security.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-10-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/563866-krasny-liman-withdrawal-troops/,Russian forces withdraw from key Donbass town,"Russian troops and Donbass forces have withdrawn from their defensive positions in the town of Krasny Liman, the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed in a statement on Saturday. The move came as Ukrainian forces mounted a large-scale offensive targeting the area. Earlier, the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, called the situation in the settlement “alarming,” saying it had been “half-encircled” by Ukrainian troops. “Due to the emerging threat of encirclement, the allied troops have withdrawn from the settlement of Krasny Liman and deployed to more advantageous positions,” the ministry said in a statement. The Ukrainian forces lost more than 200 soldiers as well as five tanks and five infantry fighting vehicles during the attack on Krasny Liman, the military added. Despite the losses, the Ukrainian command sent in reserves and reached “considerable superiority in men and material” in the direction of the attack, the Russian ministry said. A representative of the Ukrainian operational command ‘East’, Sergey Cherevaty, told the Ukrainian media that the Russian forces in Krasny Liman had been “encircled.” He also said that the Ukrainian troops had seized five settlements near Krasny Liman, including the town of Yampol, which is located to the southeast. Pushilin earlier said that the DPR had lost full control of the towns of Yampol and Drobyshevo, while the Ukrainians were shelling the supply route between Krasny Liman and a major Russian logistics base in the town of Svatovo. Krasny Liman, renamed Lyman by Ukraine in 2016, was seized by Russian and Donbass forces in late May. The town is located on the DPR’s northern edge not far from Ukraine’s Kharkov Region, the eastern part of which was captured by Ukrainian troops in early September. The news came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed treaties on the accession of the DPR and neighboring Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) into Russia. The president also signed agreements on the accession of the Russian-held Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, which declared independence from Ukraine. The four territories overwhelmingly voted in favor of joining Russia in referendums held between September 23 and 27. Ukraine and the Western nations refused to recognize the results of the referendums. The developments also come after Putin announced a partial mobilization aimed at calling some 300,000 reservists to arms, most of whom are yet to be sent to the regions.",3.9751265481519025,2.574973935270942,1.4001526128809605,2
2022-10-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/563751-seven-years-in-syria/,Syria was a rehearsal for the struggle between Russia and the West in Ukraine: Here's why they are very different conflicts,"It was seven years ago, this week, that Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to help the Syrian government in its fight against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorists and US-backed Al-Qaeda insurgents. Russia’s military support propped up President Bashar Assad, who seemed to be hanging by a thread, as most of the country’s territory was brought back under government control, and IS was routed. RT tells the story of Russia’s first major military campaign outside its borders, since the Soviet collapse, and explores the consequences. September 2015 was a perilous time for the Syrian state, ravaged by four years of civil war, with IS fighters roaming free across 70% of its territory and Al-Qaeda and the Al-Nusra Front still very much present. Government forces only controlled 8% of the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. In May 2015, terrorists seized Palmyra, a site of unique historical value which was a key trading center of the ancient world at the crossroads of Eastern and Western civilizations. The US, and its allies, began an intervention in Syria in September 2014 with the stated purpose of fighting Islamic State and the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front. At the same time, the West had adopted an uncompromising position on President Assad, demanding his departure over allegations of using chemical weapons against his opponents. The situation brought back memories, still recent at the time, of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi being brutally murdered by fighters from the National Transitional Council – a situation made possible by a NATO intervention authorized by the UN Security Council, with a mandate to protect civilians. In reality, just the opposite happened, as Libyan statehood perished with Gaddafi and a civil war broke out, which is going on until this day. It seemed that Assad’s government and perhaps even the Syrian state did not stand a chance. Russia rewrote that scenario by joining the game on September 30, 2015. Seven years on, experts are unanimously calling the operation a success for Moscow. While no party can claim full control over the country yet, the balance of forces has changed dramatically, with the central government having reasserted its authority over 70% of its territory. In a conversation with RT, Andrey Chuprygin, an assistant professor at the School of Asian Studies of the Higher School of Economics, in Moscow, focused on three major outcomes of Russia’s campaign. “The key thing, of course, is the destruction of ISIS. Second, it prevented Islamic groups from coming to power even as part of a coalition government. There was a high likelihood of that happening at the beginning of the war. Outcome number three is that, unexpectedly, the Syrian operation reinvigorated the dialogue between Russia and Syria’s neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, by providing a platform for cooperation. All other results are moot, and it remains to be seen what they will eventually lead to,” he said. President Putin has repeatedly said that Russia’s presence in Syria was legitimate under international law because Assad himself approached the Kremlin for military assistance. Aviation support was key to the Russian operation, with fighters and attack aircraft flying sorties around the clock. It only took the Syrian Arab Army two weeks to launch an offensive against Aleppo, a strategic stronghold held by the rebels. The Russian Air Force in Syria set a record in November 2015, when 134 sorties were flown within one 24-hour period, after such heavyweights as the strategic Tu-160s (Blackjacks), Tu-95s (Bears), and long-range Tu-22M3s (Backfire-Cs) joined the fray. They targeted insurgents’ command posts and training camps in Aleppo and Idlib. The Russian Navy also took part, as the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier saw combat for the first time and small missile ships fired Kalibr cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea. In early 2016, the Syrian Army began to mount an offensive against opposition forces in the provinces of Hama, Idlib, and Aleppo. Moscow set up the Center for Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria at the Khmeimim Air Base around the same time. In a joint operation with Russian special forces, Syrian troops kicked Islamic State out of Palmyra in March 2016. The terrorist group succeeded in recapturing the ancient city later in December 2016, but their success was short-lived, and the Syrian Army, supported by Russian military advisers and warplanes, freed Palmyra from IS fighters for good in early March 2017. The turning point in the fight against IS came with the liberation of Aleppo and Deir ez-Zor. After Assad and the leaders of the armed opposition signed a ceasefire agreement, fighting shifted to the country’s south. The Astana Process of international negotiations for a peaceful settlement in Syria was launched in 2017. On December 6, 2017, Putin said Islamic State had been routed on both banks of the Euphrates in Syria, while Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of the Russian military, announced that the Syrian Arab Republic was completely free of IS terrorists. The Russian president ordered a drawdown of the Russian contingent, while the Russian bases in Khmeimim and Tartus remained, and military advisers and other specialists continued their work in Syria. “You are returning victorious to your homes, your families, parents, wives, children, and friends… The Homeland is waiting for you, friends. Godspeed! Thank you for your service,” Putin said, adding that if the “terrorists raise their heads again, we will deal unprecedented strikes unlike anything they have seen.” Syrian forces have been stamping out pockets of IS resistance in recent years, but it does not mean that peace, stability, and order have automatically returned. The country is still rife with civil conflict. The Syrian operation was marred by loss of life, which sent shock waves through Russian society. Terrorists exploded a bomb aboard a civilian aircraft flying from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg, which resulted in the deadliest plane crash in Russian history. Everything feeding the infosphere from Ukraine now – mutual accusations of human rights violations and disproportionate use of force – was observed in Syria a few years ago. At the end of April 2018, a group of people from the city of Duma went before members of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) with a statement attesting that a video from the White Helmets group concerning the use of chemical weapons which was the pretense for Western countries conducting airstrikes in Syria, had been staged. The fact that Russia, Western countries, and Turkey held differing views on which groups should be considered militants, and which ones are ‘moderate opposition’, was a separate problem. The position of the West was that being ‘moderate’ does not mean you can’t take up arms and fight against the government. “The West has often said that the progressive opposition is protesting against Assad, while turning a blind eye to the fact that most of this opposition grew out of Islamists and armed groups,” Chuprygin told RT. In the northeast of the country, special status in the Syrian conflict has always been granted to the Kurdish formations, among which the armed formations of the YPG (People’s Self-Defense Units) and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) stand out. The latter was created under the patronage of the United States, which, however, failed to protect them in 2019 when Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring. Later, Russian military police occupied facilities left by the Americans near the city of Kobani, leading to an uproar. Turkey has traditionally had difficult relations with both the Kurds in northeastern Syria and the Assad government. Ankara has been trying to take control of Syria’s border areas in order to prevent the Kurds from officially establishing autonomy in the north of the country, while at the same time strengthening the pro-Turkish opposition facing the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Turkey has conducted operations in Syria several times for various purposes in recent years, the last being in the spring of 2020, when Operation Spring Shield was launched in Idlib after the death of Turkish soldiers. Then, just as one year earlier, it ended as a result of negotiations between Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who reached a number of compromises with respect to each other’s interests. According to Reuters, Russia began to conduct active negotiations with Turkey again in 2022, urging it to normalize relations with Syria. This would allow Russia to withdraw most of its remaining contingent without fear of a sharp escalation – for example, a new Turkish operation, like the one Ankara threatened to launch in the first half of 2022. It is also claimed that some Russian facilities are being passed to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Iran, which has always been of key importance for the stability of the Assad government, is even more firmly entrenched in Syria. Russia’s Syrian campaign is just another indication that the era of a multipolar world has arrived, and that various ‘skirmishes’, like the one the world observed between the leading powers in this country, will only become more frequent. The scenes showing Russian military vehicles ‘pushing out’ the American vehicles and vice versa were a symbol of the new world order. However, serious clashes never broke out between the Russian and US armed forces in Syria, which was aided by a de-escalation mechanism. However, the situation was different with mercenaries. It was the Syrian conflict that drew attention to Russian PMCs, among which Wagner, founded by businessman Evgeny Prigozhin, became the most well-known. A tragic episode occurred in 2018, when they launched an attack on the Conoco oil and gas processing plant, which was controlled by the so-called Democratic Forces of Syria. According to the US, an unidentified enemy unleashed tank and artillery fire on the site without provocation, and then went on the attack undercover. The Americans returned fire with several guns at once, killing 50 to 100 mercenaries, according to various sources. Among other striking examples of the clash of interests in Syria is an incident that occurred in November 2015, when Turkey shot down a Russian plane for allegedly violating its borders, which led to a sharp cooling of relations between the two countries. However, President Erdogan eventually expressed regret and apologized, after which bilateral ties were restored. “Syria is the first place where Russian military power was so actively involved under modern conditions. After the end of the Cold War, it became clear that there was only one great superpower left. And then it began to seem to many of its representatives that if you have a huge hammer, all the problems are nails. And then it turned out that other countries can possess hammers like this too, albeit smaller or differently shaped ones. It is important to study the Syrian, Yugoslav, and Ukrainian cases to ensure mistakes are not made in the future that lead to the use of these hammers,” Dmitry Stefanovich, a researcher at the Center for International Security at the Russian Academy of Science’s Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO RAS), told RT. Stefanovich noted that the resilience of the Syrian government was initially underestimated by Western countries. However, it’s possible to project the survival of Assad’s government onto the Ukrainian situation in 2022. “The impact of Russia’s actions in Syria is obvious. Just compare what was happening before its troops were deployed and what happened afterwards. But it seems an important conclusion was not drawn. If the government is sufficiently determined and resolute, even in a very difficult situation, the state may well not collapse. Ukraine now, relatively speaking, is like Syria then. Though serious blows are being dealt, the government has remained stable and managed to hold together due to serious external support. We will be studying the reasons for this for a long time,” he said. In total, 63,000 Russian servicemen passed through Syria, including 25,000 officers and more than 400 generals. An RT source close to the Russian Defense Ministry notes that in military circles, it is popular to declare that it was through the operation in Syria that Russia gained valuable combat experience. However, in 2022, after identifying a number of problems the Russian Army has had in Ukraine, this view can be regarded as very one-sided. A number of experts believe that the Syrian campaign, in fact, left the commanders a bit overconfident, as the enemy had no aviation, air defense, long-range artillery, or armored mechanized troops. Stefanovich told RT that the experience gained in the Syrian campaign certainly influenced the decision to launch the military operation in Ukraine and guided the way it was conducted at the beginning. “Perhaps there was a hope that this format could be implemented in Ukraine, with limited forces and an emphasis on air power, etc. But practice has shown that not everything works this way. The enemy in Ukraine turned out to be completely different. Of course, some benefits remain. For example, it is in Syria that the Russian Army learned to actively use drones, no matter what you think of this. Objectively, the skills acquired in Syria are now being used in this area,” he said. Stefanovich added that Russia is dealing with a contested environment in Ukraine – a situation in which the enemy puts up active resistance. “Of course, Syria was no cakewalk for the Russian Army either, but the terrorists are not a regular army with a nation-state and large-scale foreign support. Russia is now in a conflict with a large, mobilized country. Plus, this state is supported by NATO’s entire intelligence, logistics, and information infrastructure, primarily coming from the United States. This makes it impossible to use the same methods that we developed in Syria. Generally, we see that as soon as our planes take off or our missiles are launched, this information is immediately received by the Ukrainians, who then set up an ambush and move their equipment to avoid the attack. Naturally, something hits the target, but the airstrikes are not as effective or efficient as they used to be in Syria. At the same time, the experience gained by individual units and PMCs in Syria is more relevant when it comes to storming settlements, although this is still much more difficult now,” Stefanovich said.",3.2533619694618428,1.7625928942341615,1.4907690752276812,6

2022-10-01,https://www.rt.com/russia/563842-putin-us-enemies-masochist-allies/,US treats ‘masochist’ allies like enemies – Putin,"Speaking in Moscow on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the collective West seeks to rule the world with an iron fist, not sparing even the “masochists” whom it calls allies but mistreats as much as the declared enemies. US dictates are backed by brute force, “the law of the fist,” Putin said, adding that any state that aspires to genuine sovereignty is declared an enemy and subjected to “deterrence,” ringed with military bases and alliances, or sanctioned. “When they are displeased, they introduce sanctions against their allies as well – against this or that bank or company. This is their practice and they will expand it. They have everything in their sights.” In launching the “sanctions blitzkrieg” against Russia, the West was blinded by its own “wishful thinking,” believing the world would fall in line at its command – but as it turned out, the orders only excited “complete political masochists and admirers of other unconventional forms of international relations,” the president said. While he did not name the “political masochists,” earlier in the speech Putin noted that the US “actually continues to occupy Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and other countries, which they cynically refer to as equals and allies,” while spying on the homes and offices of their leaders, calling it “a disgrace for those who do this and for those who, like slaves, silently and meekly swallow this arrogant behavior.” The dictatorship of Western elites “targets all societies, including the citizens of Western countries themselves.” He noted that politicians in Europe now “have to convince their fellow citizens to eat less, take a shower less often and dress warmer at home,” while declaring anyone who dares to ask why a radical and extremist, falsely pointing to Russia as the culprit. But people cannot be fed with printed dollars and euros. You can't feed them with those pieces of paper, and the virtual, inflated capitalization of Western social media companies can't heat their homes. The Russian president also pointed to the “radical denial of moral, religious, and family values” by Western leaders, arguing that their “complete renunciation of what it means to be human, the overthrow of faith and traditional values, and the suppression of freedom are coming to resemble a ‘religion in reverse’ – pure Satanism.” Faced with economic troubles they do not know how to resolve, leaders of the West may “trigger a collapse of the entire system and blame everything on that, or – God forbid – decide to use the old formula of economic growth through war,” Putin warned. However, “Russia is aware of its responsibility to the international community and will make every effort to ensure that cooler heads prevail.” According to the Russian president, the “current neocolonial model is ultimately doomed,” but its masters “will cling to it to the end” as they simply have nothing else to offer. Putin’s made his remarks at the signing ceremony for the acceptance of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye into the Russian Federation, following a week-long referendum that the West has denounced as a “sham” conducted “at gunpoint.” Commenting on the speech, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters that Putin was “raving” about the Satanism of the West in order to justify his “colonial and imperial land grab” in Ukraine.",2.946501154538175,1.3964593635607443,1.5500417909774309,8
2022-09-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/563840-zelensky-negotiations-putin-russia/,Zelensky pledges never to talk to Putin,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky refuses to negotiate a peace settlement as long as Vladimir Putin remains president of Russia. He made this claim in a post on his official Telegram channel on Friday. Claiming he had “always offered Russia coexistence on equal, honest, dignified and fair terms,” Zelensky blamed Russia for the failure of negotiations, insisting that it was “obvious this is impossible with this Russian president.” “We are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but … with another president of Russia,” he wrote. Unlike the majority of his Telegram posts, this one was written only in Ukrainian, without an accompanying English translation. Zelensky has repeatedly rejected overtures of peace from Moscow, most recently turning down Putin’s offer on Friday to resume negotiations. What made the offer a non-starter for Kiev is that Putin refused to relinquish the regions that voted this week to join Russia. “Only the path of strengthening Ukraine and expelling the occupiers from our entire territory will restore peace,” Zelensky declared in his address. Zelensky also confirmed that Ukraine had submitted an accelerated application to join NATO on Friday, something he previously admitted was probably never going to happen. While Western media described the move as “more symbolic than practical,” the Ukrainian president argued that Sweden and Finland were able to apply on an accelerated basis even without a Membership Action Plan and it was thus only “fair” that Ukraine do the same. “De facto, we have already completed our path to NATO,” he said in another Telegram post. “De facto, we have already proven interoperability with the Alliance’s standards … We trust each other, we help each other and we protect each other.” Zelensky has previously acknowledged Ukraine might struggle to secure the consent of all 30 NATO member nations, pushing instead for the so-called Kiev Security Compact, which would oblige NATO’s core members to defend Ukraine “in case of aggression” while codifying the provision of bottomless military and financial aid as a stopgap measure. Admitting Ukraine would draw NATO into immediate confrontation with Russia, under the Article 5 mutual defense provision. While the US is committed to the ‘open door’ policy when it comes to NATO, now is the wrong time to consider Ukraine’s membership application, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Friday. The move would also make peace with Moscow impossible, as Putin has made it clear since before the military operation began in February that Ukraine must remain a neutral country under all circumstances.",2.5482101452892003,0.846506336707126,1.7017038085820744,8

Below is the full text of Vladimir Putin’s speech, published by the Kremlin’s official website: Citizens of Russia, citizens of the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics, residents of the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, deputies of the State Duma, senators of the Russian Federation, As you know, referendums have been held in the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. The ballots have been counted and the results have been announced. The people have made their unequivocal choice. Today we will sign treaties on the accession of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Lugansk People’s Republic, Zaporozhye Region and Kherson Region to the Russian Federation. I have no doubt that the Federal Assembly will support the constitutional laws on the accession to Russia and the establishment of four new regions, our new constituent entities of the Russian Federation, because this is the will of millions of people. It is undoubtedly their right, an inherent right sealed in Article 1 of the UN Charter, which directly states the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples. I repeat, it is an inherent right of the people. It is based on our historical affinity, and it is that right that led generations of our predecessors, those who built and defended Russia for centuries since the period of Ancient Rus, to victory. Here in Novorossiya, [Pyotr] Rumyantsev, [Alexander] Suvorov and [Fyodor] Ushakov fought their battles, and Catherine the Great and [Grigory] Potemkin founded new cities. Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought here to the bitter end during the Great Patriotic War. We will always remember the heroes of the Russian Spring, those who refused to accept the neo-Nazi coup d'état in Ukraine in 2014, all those who died for the right to speak their native language, to preserve their culture, traditions and religion, and for the very right to live. We remember the soldiers of Donbass, the martyrs of the “Odessa Khatyn,” the victims of inhuman terrorist attacks carried out by the Kiev regime. We commemorate volunteers and militiamen, civilians, children, women, senior citizens, Russians, Ukrainians, people of various nationalities; popular leader of Donetsk Alexander Zakharchenko; military commanders Arsen Pavlov and Vladimir Zhoga, Olga Kochura and Alexei Mozgovoy; prosecutor of the Lugansk Republic Sergei Gorenko; paratrooper Nurmagomed Gadzhimagomedov and all our soldiers and officers who died a hero’s death during the special military operation. They are heroes. Heroes of great Russia. Please join me in a minute of silence to honour their memory. Behind the choice of millions of residents in the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, in the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, is our common destiny and thousand-year history. People have passed this spiritual connection on to their children and grandchildren. Despite all the trials they endured, they carried the love for Russia through the years. This is something no one can destroy. That is why both older generations and young people – those who were born after the tragic collapse of the Soviet Union – have voted for our unity, for our common future. In 1991 in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, representatives of the party elite of that time made a decision to terminate the Soviet Union, without asking ordinary citizens what they wanted, and people suddenly found themselves cut off from their homeland. This tore apart and dismembered our national community and triggered a national catastrophe. Just like the government quietly demarcated the borders of Soviet republics, acting behind the scenes after the 1917 revolution, the last leaders of the Soviet Union, contrary to the direct expression of the will of the majority of people in the referendum of 1991, destroyed our great country, and simply made the people in the former republics face this as an accomplished fact. I can admit that they didn’t even know what they were doing and what consequences their actions would have in the end. But it doesn't matter now. There is no Soviet Union anymore; we cannot return to the past. Actually, Russia no longer needs it today; this isn’t our ambition. But there is nothing stronger than the determination of millions of people who, by their culture, religion, traditions, and language, consider themselves part of Russia, whose ancestors lived in a single country for centuries. There is nothing stronger than their determination to return to their true historical homeland. For eight long years, people in Donbass were subjected to genocide, shelling and blockades; in Kherson and Zaporozhye, a criminal policy was pursued to cultivate hatred for Russia, for everything Russian. Now too, during the referendums, the Kiev regime threatened schoolteachers, women who worked in election commissions with reprisals and death. Kiev threatened millions of people who came to express their will with repression. But the people of Donbass, Zaporozhye and Kherson weren’t broken, and they had their say. I want the Kiev authorities and their true handlers in the West to hear me now, and I want everyone to remember this: the people living in Lugansk and Donetsk, in Kherson and Zaporozhye have become our citizens, forever. We call on the Kiev regime to immediately cease fire and all hostilities; to end the war it unleashed back in 2014 and return to the negotiating table. We are ready for this, as we have said more than once. But the choice of the people in Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye and Kherson will not be discussed. The decision has been made, and Russia will not betray it. Kiev’s current authorities should respect this free expression of the people’s will; there is no other way. This is the only way to peace. We will defend our land with all the forces and resources we have, and we will do everything we can to ensure the safety of our people. This is the great liberating mission of our nation. We will definitely rebuild the destroyed cities and towns, the residential buildings, schools, hospitals, theatres and museums. We will restore and develop industrial enterprises, factories, infrastructure, as well as the social security, pension, healthcare and education systems. We will certainly work to improve the level of security. Together we will make sure that citizens in the new regions can feel the support of all the people of Russia, of the entire nation, all the republics, territories and regions of our vast Motherland. Friends, colleagues. Today I would like to address our soldiers and officers who are taking part in the special military operation, the fighters of Donbass and Novorossiya, those who went to military recruitment offices after receiving a call-up paper under the executive order on partial mobilisation, and those who did this voluntarily, answering the call of their hearts. I would like to address their parents, wives and children, to tell them what our people are fighting for, what kind of enemy we are up against, and who is pushing the world into new wars and crises and deriving blood-stained benefits from this tragedy. Our compatriots, our brothers and sisters in Ukraine who are part of our united people have seen with their own eyes what the ruling class of the so-called West have prepared for humanity as a whole. They have dropped their masks and shown what they are really made of. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the West decided that the world and all of us would permanently accede to its dictates. In 1991, the West thought that Russia would never rise after such shocks and would fall to pieces on its own. This almost happened. We remember the horrible 1990s, hungry, cold and hopeless. But Russia remained standing, came alive, grew stronger and occupied its rightful place in the world. Meanwhile, the West continued and continues looking for another chance to strike a blow at us, to weaken and break up Russia, which they have always dreamed about, to divide our state and set our peoples against each other, and to condemn them to poverty and extinction. They cannot rest easy knowing that there is such a great country with this huge territory in the world, with its natural wealth, resources and people who cannot and will not do someone else’s bidding. The West is ready to cross every line to preserve the neo-colonial system which allows it to live off the world, to plunder it thanks to the domination of the dollar and technology, to collect an actual tribute from humanity, to extract its primary source of unearned prosperity, the rent paid to the hegemon. The preservation of this annuity is their main, real and absolutely self-serving motivation. This is why total de-sovereignisation is in their interest. This explains their aggression towards independent states, traditional values and authentic cultures, their attempts to undermine international and integration processes, new global currencies and technological development centres they cannot control. It is critically important for them to force all countries to surrender their sovereignty to the United States. In certain countries, the ruling elites voluntarily agree to do this, voluntarily agree to become vassals; others are bribed or intimidated. And if this does not work, they destroy entire states, leaving behind humanitarian disasters, devastation, ruins, millions of wrecked and mangled human lives, terrorist enclaves, social disaster zones, protectorates, colonies and semi-colonies. They don't care. All they care about is their own benefit. I want to underscore again that their insatiability and determination to preserve their unfettered dominance are the real causes of the hybrid war that the collective West is waging against Russia. They do not want us to be free; they want us to be a colony. They do not want equal cooperation; they want to loot. They do not want to see us a free society, but a mass of soulless slaves. They see our thought and our philosophy as a direct threat. That is why they target our philosophers for assassination. Our culture and art present a danger to them, so they are trying to ban them. Our development and prosperity are also a threat to them because competition is growing. They do not want or need Russia, but we do. I would like to remind you that in the past, ambitions of world domination have repeatedly shattered against the courage and resilience of our people. Russia will always be Russia. We will continue to defend our values and our Motherland. The West is counting on impunity, on being able to get away with anything. As a matter of fact, this was actually the case until recently. Strategic security agreements have been trashed; agreements reached at the highest political level have been declared tall tales; firm promises not to expand NATO to the east gave way to dirty deception as soon as our former leaders bought into them; missile defence, intermediate-range and shorter-range missile treaties have been unilaterally dismantled under far-fetched pretexts. And all we hear is, the West is insisting on a rules-based order. Where did that come from anyway? Who has ever seen these rules? Who agreed or approved them? Listen, this is just a lot of nonsense, utter deceit, double standards, or even triple standards! They must think we’re stupid. Russia is a great thousand-year-old power, a whole civilisation, and it is not going to live by such makeshift, false rules. It was the so-called West that trampled on the principle of the inviolability of borders, and now it is deciding, at its own discretion, who has the right to self-determination and who does not, who is unworthy of it. It is unclear what their decisions are based on or who gave them the right to decide in the first place. They just assumed it. That is why the choice of the people in Crimea, Sevastopol, Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye and Kherson makes them so furiously angry. The West does not have any moral right to weigh in, or even utter a word about freedom of democracy. It does not and it never did. Western elites not only deny national sovereignty and international law. Their hegemony has pronounced features of totalitarianism, despotism and apartheid. They brazenly divide the world into their vassals – the so-called civilised countries – and all the rest, who, according to the designs of today's Western racists, should be added to the list of barbarians and savages. False labels like “rogue country” or “authoritarian regime” are already available, and are used to stigmatise entire nations and states, which is nothing new. There is nothing new in this: deep down, the Western elites have remained the same colonisers. They discriminate and divide peoples into the top tier and the rest. We have never agreed to and will never agree to such political nationalism and racism. What else, if not racism, is the Russophobia being spread around the world? What, if not racism, is the West’s dogmatic conviction that its civilisation and neoliberal culture is an indisputable model for the entire world to follow? “You’re either with us or against us.” It even sounds strange. Western elites are even shifting repentance for their own historical crimes on everyone else, demanding that the citizens of their countries and other peoples confess to things they have nothing to do with at all, for example, the period of colonial conquests. It is worth reminding the West that it began its colonial policy back in the Middle Ages, followed by the worldwide slave trade, the genocide of Indian tribes in America, the plunder of India and Africa, the wars of England and France against China, as a result of which it was forced to open its ports to the opium trade. What they did was get entire nations hooked on drugs and purposefully exterminated entire ethnic groups for the sake of grabbing land and resources, hunting people like animals. This is contrary to human nature, truth, freedom and justice. While we – we are proud that in the 20th century our country led the anti-colonial movement, which opened up opportunities for many peoples around the world to make progress, reduce poverty and inequality, and defeat hunger and disease. To emphasise, one of the reasons for the centuries-old Russophobia, the Western elites’ unconcealed animosity toward Russia is precisely the fact that we did not allow them to rob us during the period of colonial conquests and forced the Europeans to trade with us on mutually beneficial terms. This was achieved by creating a strong centralised state in Russia, which grew and got stronger based on the great moral values​​of Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism, as well as Russian culture and the Russian word that were open to all. There were numerous plans to invade Russia. Such attempts were made during the Time of Troubles in the 17th century and in the period of ordeals after the 1917 revolution. All of them failed. The West managed to grab hold of Russia’s wealth only in the late 20th century, when the state had been destroyed. They called us friends and partners, but they treated us like a colony, using various schemes to pump trillions of dollars out of the country. We remember. We have not forgotten anything. A few days ago, people in Donetsk and Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye declared their support for restoring our historical unity. Thank you! Western countries have been saying for centuries that they bring freedom and democracy to other nations. Nothing could be further from the truth. Instead of bringing democracy they suppressed and exploited, and instead of giving freedom they enslaved and oppressed. The unipolar world is inherently anti-democratic and unfree; it is false and hypocritical through and through. The United States is the only country in the world that has used nuclear weapons twice, destroying the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. And they created a precedent. Recall that during WWII the United States and Britain reduced Dresden, Hamburg, Cologne and many other German cities to rubble, without the least military necessity. It was done ostentatiously and, to repeat, without any military necessity. They had only one goal, as with the nuclear bombing of Japanese cities: to intimidate our country and the rest of the world. The United States left a deep scar in the memory of the people of Korea and Vietnam with their carpet bombings and use of napalm and chemical weapons. It actually continues to occupy Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea and other countries, which they cynically refer to as equals and allies. Look now, what kind of alliance is that? The whole world knows that the top officials in these countries are being spied on and that their offices and homes are bugged. It is a disgrace, a disgrace for those who do this and for those who, like slaves, silently and meekly swallow this arrogant behaviour. They call the orders and threats they make to their vassals Euro-Atlantic solidarity, and the creation of biological weapons and the use of human test subjects, including in Ukraine, noble medical research. It is their destructive policies, wars and plunder that have unleashed today’s massive wave of migrants. Millions of people endure hardships and humiliation or die by the thousands trying to reach Europe. They are exporting grain from Ukraine now. Where are they taking it under the guise of ensuring the food security of the poorest countries? Where is it going? They are taking it to the self-same European countries. Only five percent has been delivered to the poorest countries. More cheating and naked deception again. In effect, the American elite is using the tragedy of these people to weaken its rivals, to destroy nation states. This goes for Europe and for the identities of France, Italy, Spain and other countries with centuries-long histories. Washington demands more and more sanctions against Russia and the majority of European politicians obediently go along with it. They clearly understand that by pressuring the EU to completely give up Russian energy and other resources, the United States is practically pushing Europe toward deindustrialisation in a bid to get its hands on the entire European market. These European elites understand everything – they do, but they prefer to serve the interests of others. This is no longer servility but direct betrayal of their own peoples. God bless, it is up to them. But the Anglo-Saxons believe sanctions are no longer enough and now they have turned to subversion. It seems incredible but it is a fact – by causing explosions on Nord Stream’s international gas pipelines passing along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, they have actually embarked on the destruction of Europe’s entire energy infrastructure. It is clear to everyone who stands to gain. Those who benefit are responsible, of course. The dictates of the US are backed up by crude force, on the law of the fist. Sometimes it is beautifully wrapped sometimes there is no wrapping at all but the gist is the same – the law of the fist. Hence, the deployment and maintenance of hundreds of military bases in all corners of the world, NATO expansion, and attempts to cobble together new military alliances, such as AUKUS and the like. Much is being done to create a Washington-Seoul-Tokyo military-political chain. All states that possess or aspire to genuine strategic sovereignty and are capable of challenging Western hegemony, are automatically declared enemies. These are the principles that underlie US and NATO military doctrines that require total domination. Western elites are presenting their neocolonialist plans with the same hypocrisy, claiming peaceful intentions, talking about some kind of deterrence. This evasive word migrates from one strategy to another but really only means one thing – undermining any and all sovereign centres of power. We have already heard about the deterrence of Russia, China and Iran. I believe next in line are other countries of Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, as well as current US partners and allies. After all, we know that when they are displeased, they introduce sanctions against their allies as well – against this or that bank or company. This is their practice and they will expand it. They have everything in their sights, including our next-door neighbours – the CIS countries. At the same time, the West has clearly been engaged in wishful thinking for a long time. In launching the sanctions blitzkrieg against Russia, for example, they thought that they could once again line up the whole world at their command. As it turns out, however, such a bright prospect does not excite everyone – other than complete political masochists and admirers of other unconventional forms of international relations. Most states refuse to ”snap a salute“ and instead choose the sensible path of cooperation with Russia. The West clearly did not expect such insubordination. They simply got used to acting according to a template, to grab whatever they please, by blackmail, bribery, intimidation, and convinced themselves that these methods would work forever, as if they had fossilised in the past. Such self-confidence is a direct product not only of the notorious concept of exceptionalism – although it never ceases to amaze – but also of the real ”information hunger“ in the West. The truth has been drowned in an ocean of myths, illusions and fakes, using extremely aggressive propaganda, lying like Goebbels. The more unbelievable the lie, the quicker people will believe it – that is how they operate, according to this principle. But people cannot be fed with printed dollars and euros. You can't feed them with those pieces of paper, and the virtual, inflated capitalisation of western social media companies can't heat their homes. Everything I am saying is important. And what I just said is no less so: you can't feed anyone with paper – you need food; and you can't heat anyone’s home with these inflated capitalisations – you need energy. That is why politicians in Europe have to convince their fellow citizens to eat less, take a shower less often and dress warmer at home. And those who start asking fair questions like “Why is that, in fact?” are immediately declared enemies, extremists and radicals. They point back at Russia and say: that is the source of all your troubles. More lies. I want to make special note of the fact that there is every reason to believe that the Western elites are not going to look for constructive ways out of the global food and energy crisis that they and they alone are to blame for, as a result of their long-term policy, dating back long before our special military operation in Ukraine, in Donbass. They have no intention of solving the problems of injustice and inequality. I am afraid they would rather use other formulas they are more comfortable with. And here it is important to recall that the West bailed itself out of its early 20th century challenges with World War I. Profits from World War II helped the United States finally overcome the Great Depression and become the largest economy in the world, and to impose on the planet the power of the dollar as a global reserve currency. And the 1980s crisis – things came to a head in the 1980s again – the West emerged from it unscathed largely by appropriating the inheritance and resources of the collapsed and defunct Soviet Union. That's a fact. Now, in order to free itself from the latest web of challenges, they need to dismantle Russia as well as other states that choose a sovereign path of development, at all costs, to be able to further plunder other nations’ wealth and use it to patch their own holes. If this does not happen, I cannot rule out that they will try to trigger a collapse of the entire system, and blame everything on that, or, God forbid, decide to use the old formula of economic growth through war. Russia is aware of its responsibility to the international community and will make every effort to ensure that cooler heads prevail. The current neocolonial model is ultimately doomed; this much is obvious. But I repeat that its real masters will cling to it to the end. They simply have nothing to offer the world except to maintain the same system of plundering and racketeering. They do not give a damn about the natural right of billions of people, the majority of humanity, to freedom and justice, the right to determine their own future. They have already moved on to the radical denial of moral, religious, and family values. Let’s answer some very simple questions for ourselves. Now I would like to return to what I said and want to address also all citizens of the country – not just the colleagues that are in the hall – but all citizens of Russia: do we want to have here, in our country, in Russia, “parent number one, parent number two and parent number three” (they have completely lost it!) instead of mother and father? Do we want our schools to impose on our children, from their earliest days in school, perversions that lead to degradation and extinction? Do we want to drum into their heads the ideas that certain other genders exist along with women and men and to offer them gender reassignment surgery? Is that what we want for our country and our children? This is all unacceptable to us. We have a different future of our own. Let me repeat that the dictatorship of the Western elites targets all societies, including the citizens of Western countries themselves. This is a challenge to all. This complete renunciation of what it means to be human, the overthrow of faith and traditional values, and the suppression of freedom are coming to resemble a “religion in reverse” – pure Satanism. Exposing false messiahs, Jesus Christ said in the Sermon on the Mount: “By their fruits ye shall know them.” These poisonous fruits are already obvious to people, and not only in our country but also in all countries, including many people in the West itself. The world has entered a period of a fundamental, revolutionary transformation. New centres of power are emerging. They represent the majority – the majority! – of the international community. They are ready not only to declare their interests but also to protect them. They see in multipolarity an opportunity to strengthen their sovereignty, which means gaining genuine freedom, historical prospects, and the right to their own independent, creative and distinctive forms of development, to a harmonious process. As I have already said, we have many like-minded people in Europe and the United States, and we feel and see their support. An essentially emancipatory, anti-colonial movement against unipolar hegemony is taking shape in the most diverse countries and societies. Its power will only grow with time. It is this force that will determine our future geopolitical reality. Friends, Today, we are fighting for a just and free path, first of all for ourselves, for Russia, in order to leave dictate and despotism in the past. I am convinced that countries and peoples understand that a policy based on the exceptionalism of whoever it may be and the suppression of other cultures and peoples is inherently criminal, and that we must close this shameful chapter. The ongoing collapse of Western hegemony is irreversible. And I repeat: things will never be the same. The battlefield to which destiny and history have called us is a battlefield for our people, for the great historical Russia. For the great historical Russia, for future generations, our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We must protect them against enslavement and monstrous experiments that are designed to cripple their minds and souls. Today, we are fighting so that it would never occur to anyone that Russia, our people, our language, or our culture can be erased from history. Today, we need a consolidated society, and this consolidation can only be based on sovereignty, freedom, creation, and justice. Our values ​​are humanity, mercy and compassion. And I want to close with the words of a true patriot Ivan Ilyin: “If I consider Russia my Motherland, that means that I love as a Russian, contemplate and think, sing and speak as a Russian; that I believe in the spiritual strength of the Russian people. Its spirit is my spirit; its destiny is my destiny; its suffering is my grief; and its prosperity is my joy.” Behind these words stands a glorious spiritual choice, which, for more than a thousand years of Russian statehood, was followed by many generations of our ancestors. Today, we are making this choice; the citizens of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics and the residents of the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions have made this choice. They made the choice to be with their people, to be with their Motherland, to share in its destiny, and to be victorious together with it. The truth is with us, and behind us is Russia!",2.6272309776772147,1.9429257333654084,0.6843052443118063,6
2022-09-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/563834-putin-speech-accession-ceremony-highlights/,‘World has entered a period of revolutionary transformation’: Highlights of Putin’s signing ceremony speech,"Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a historic speech on Friday at a ceremony in Moscow at which he signed treaties paving the way for the inclusion of four former Ukrainian regions into the Russian Federation. Among other things, the president commented on the future of the four regions within Russia, potential talks with Kiev, and the continued neocolonialist policy of the US and its allies, which he says is at the root of many modern crises. Below are some of the key points Putin made in his address. Russia will never betray those who trust it Russia is open to talks with Kiev Putin has called on the Ukrainian government to “immediately” cease all hostilities and return to the negotiating table. “We are ready for this,” he said. Moreover, Moscow will not discuss “the choice of the people in Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye and Kherson,” Putin maintained, adding that this decision has already been made clear. He also urged Kiev to treat this choice with respect, calling it “the only way to peace.” West seeks to impose tax on humanity The Russian leader accused the West of attempts to ""plunder the world” through the “the domination of the dollar and technology.” The West will do anything to keep its “neo-colonial system,” he added, denouncing it as an attempt to collect “an actual tribute from humanity.” Western aspirations for continued hegemony are the reason for a global “de-sovereignization” campaign, Putin stated, adding that this involves Western nations turning all other countries around the world into their “vassals” through either coercion or bribery. “This explains their aggression towards independent states, traditional values and authentic cultures,” the Russian president said, adding that the West seeks to disrupt international and integrational processes it is unable to control. Western ‘rules-based’ order is a lie The “rules-based order” supposedly defended by Western nations is “utter deceit,” Putin said. Western leaders act on the basis of “double standards, or even triple standards” and change these rules when it suits their interests, he added. It was the West that first violated the principle of border inviolability and then usurped the right to decide which peoples deserve the right to self-determination and which do not, the Russian leader maintained. He also accused the US of eroding global security by unilaterally withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) back in 2002 and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019. Western promises not to expand NATO further to the east turned out to be “dirty deception” as well, he added. Neo-liberalism is the new totalitarianism The Western nations divide the world into their “vassals” and those they call a “rogue country” or “authoritarian regime,” Putin said, adding that their denial of other nations’ sovereignty has turned into a new form of “despotism and apartheid.” The West is still convinced that its “neoliberal culture is an indisputable model for the entire world to follow,"" Putin said, calling such views nothing but “racism.” The Russian leader also denounced ‘Russophobia’ as an example of such a racist attitude. “Western countries have been saying for centuries that they bring freedom and democracy to other nations. Nothing could be further from the truth. Instead of bringing democracy they suppressed and exploited, and instead of giving freedom they enslaved and oppressed,” Putin said. Global transformations are coming The world has entered a new era of a “revolutionary transformation,” Putin believes. New centers of power and development that represent the majority of the international community are forming. They are not only ready to openly speak about their interests but to defend them as well, he said. “The collapse of Western hegemony is irreversible,” the Russian president said. Russia is now fighting for a “just and free” way forward that will leave “dictate and despotism in the past,” he added.",1.4819038064784276,1.5327647371089217,-0.05086093063049413,8
2022-09-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/563836-biden-warns-putin-nato/,Biden warns Putin of NATO red lines,"US President Joe Biden on Friday directly addressed his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, urging him not to “misunderstand” that Washington and NATO are ready to defend “every single inch” of NATO territory. Biden’s remarks came as a response to a speech that Putin delivered earlier on Friday before signing treaties paving the way for four former Ukrainian regions to join Russia, a move the US and its allies condemned in the strongest of terms. “America is fully prepared with our NATO allies to defend every single inch of NATO territory. Mr. Putin, don’t misunderstand what I’m saying. Every inch,” Biden said without elaborating about which specific statements by the Russian leader he was responding to. In his speech Putin, among other things, blamed the US for creating “a precedent” by using nuclear weapons against Japan in 1945. Biden: ""America is fully prepared with our NATO allies to defend every single inch of NATO territory, every single inch."" pic.twitter.com/X9TgGOz1D7 Speaking at the White House, the US president stressed that Putin’s “reckless words and threats” would not intimidate America and its allies. “Putin’s actions are a sign he’s struggling,” Biden said. He was referring to referendums that resulted in the launch of the formal accession process for the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions. “The United States is never going to recognize this. And quite frankly, the world's not going to recognize it either,” Biden said, adding that Putin “can’t seize his neighbor’s territory and get away with it.” The US president’s statement marks yet another round of mutual warnings between Russia and the West. Last week, the Russian president said that his country is now fighting “the entire military machine of the collective West” and emphasized that if needed Moscow “will certainly make use of all weapon systems available” to protect its territorial integrity and its people. Moscow also made it clear that, once the former Ukrainian regions become part of Russia, it will consider Kiev’s military attacks on them as acts of aggression against the Russian Federation. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, meanwhile, warned Russia of “severe consequences” if it uses nuclear weapons on Ukraine. He has also said on multiple occasions that NATO would not tolerate any attack on “allied sovereignty or territorial integrity.” While Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky admitted in March that Kiev was unlikely to become part of NATO, on Friday he announced that the country was filing an expedited application to join the military alliance. However, hours later, Washington said that it is “not the time” to accept Ukraine into the bloc.",1.5266404245621241,1.2384755699565468,0.2881648546055773,8
2022-09-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/563832-concert-putin-territories-speech/,Putin speaks to massive crowd celebrating new territories,"Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed thousands of people gathered on Moscow’s Red Square on Friday evening, celebrating the beginning of the process to incorporate four former Ukrainian regions that voted overwhelmingly to join Russia. Putin’s emotional speech came just hours after he signed treaties on the inclusion of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, into the Russian Federation. The signing ceremony marked the start of the formal process of accession, which will entail the treaties being reviewed by the Constitutional Court and both chambers of parliament. Claiming it was Russia that originally “created modern Ukraine” by transferring Moscow’s “historical territories” to it, Putin said modern Russia had now given people in those regions “the right to choose.” “People came to the referendum and made their choice: to be with their historical motherland, with Russia,” he said to applause from the crowd. NOW - Crowd chants ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" in Moscow's Red Square as Putin makes an appearance. pic.twitter.com/kOajlHOsDV For decades, Putin claimed, the Ukrainian authorities had unsuccessfully tried to eradicate people’s “historical identity,” to destroy their traditions and forbid them from speaking their native language. “These people carried love for their historical homeland in their hearts and passed it on to their children,” the president said, adding that Russia was not only opening its doors, but was “opening its heart” to them. “Welcome home,” he said, prompting chants of 'Russia' from the crowd. Putin also used the address to make several pledges: to improve security in the new territories, to revive their economies and to build schools and hospitals. “We became stronger because we are together. The truth is behind us, and truth means strength, and thus victory. Victory will be ours,” Putin said in conclusion, before shaking hands with the heads of the regions, who joined him on the stage. Meanwhile, on Thursday, on the eve of what Putin described as a “historic day,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on the Kremlin “to step back from the brink” and to stop the “annexation” of the four Ukrainian regions. Guterres also warned Russia that neither the inclusion of new territories into Russia, nor the results of their referendums would be recognized as legal. Moscow, in turn, accused the secretary-general of abusing his power by making political statements on behalf of the UN.",1.293537286173351,1.6097526158388824,-0.31621532966553145,8
2022-09-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/563831-ukraine-reacts-nato-russia/,Ukraine reacts to former regions joining Russia,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky on Friday signed an application to join NATO and demanded an accelerated admission procedure. While pledging the US-led bloc’s support for Kiev, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated that membership would require the consensus of all 30 members. In a video address, Zelensky said Ukraine was already a “de facto NATO ally” and that he was applying to make it official, calling the ceremonial signing of the application a “decisive step.” “We trust each other, we help each other, and we protect each other,” the AP quoted him as saying. NATO had announced an “unprecedented” address by Stoltenberg after Zelensky’s video, but when the bloc’s secretary general actually appeared he repeated previous talking points. “NATO is not party to the conflict, but we provide support to Ukraine so it can uphold its right for self-defense enshrined in the UN charter,” Stoltenberg said. “Ours is a defensive alliance. We stand united and determined to defend and protect every NATO ally and every inch of allied territory.” When asked if NATO was willing to accept Ukraine’s application, Stoltenberg replied that “every democracy in Europe has the right to apply” but getting accepted would require the consensus of all 30 members. “Our focus now is providing Ukraine immediate support,” he added. Stoltenberg also reiterated his rejection of Russia’s “illegal annexation” of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. “If Russia stops fighting, there will be peace, if Ukraine stops fighting, it will cease to exist as an independent sovereign nation in Europe,” he added, using a variation on a talking point recently embraced by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Zelensky’s wife. Calling Kiev a “victim of aggression,” Stoltenberg said the bloc must work to “ensure [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin doesn’t win,” because anything else would tell the world that “authoritarian countries like Russia can use force” to achieve their goals. Taking only four questions from the press, Stoltenberg concluded by repeating, “NATO is not party to the conflict, we support Ukraine but that does not make us party to the conflict.”",0.7516087290280323,1.1298348383429522,-0.37822610931491984,8
2022-09-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/563830-russians-eu-visas-restrictions/,EU announces 'strict' visa restrictions for Russians,"Russian citizens should not be allowed to apply for short-stay EU visas from third countries, EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson explained on Friday while presenting updated visa and border control rules for Russians. “They have to do that from their home country, Russia,” she said, as thousands of men are fleeing Russia amid the ongoing partial mobilization announced last week by President Vladimir Putin. The commissioner explained that the new restrictions were imposed as a response to what she called Moscow’s “escalation” in the Ukraine conflict. The right to apply for asylum is “a fundamental right” for any person, Johansson said, but obtaining an EU tourist or short-term visa is not a right but a “privilege.” Therefore, Johansson said, the EU authorities should also stop renewing short-term visas for Russians in Europe. “If a Russian person intends to stay longer than 90 days in the EU, he or she should not be issued a visa,” she said. At the same time, the commissioner said, Europe “will not close its door to those who are in genuine need of protection.” According to the statement, which was published by the European Commission, all visa applications from Russian citizens should be considered in line with “a strict approach assessing the justification of the journey.” The guidelines also suggest that consulates and border guards should strictly “reassess” visas that have already been issued. Border guards should have the power to revoke Schengen visas regardless of which state had issued them, the document states. The new restrictions come weeks after the EU suspended its visa facilitation agreement with Moscow. Last week, however, EU Council President Charles Michel called on the bloc to welcome Russians who are fleeing the country “because of their political opinions.” Some EU member states are taking a much harsher approach, however. On Friday, Finland closed its borders for Russians with Schengen tourist visas. Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics also said recently that his country would not issue humanitarian or other types of visas to fleeing Russian nationals because many of them “were fine with killing Ukrainians.” According to Western media, citing official statistics from various countries, more than 200,000 people have left Russia since September 21.",1.7680884566659754,2.500148189087973,-0.7320597324219977,8

Preserving this arrangement is the true motive that underlies the policies of the Western elites, and is why their governments try to strip other nations of their sovereignty, according to Putin. This is where their aggression towards independent nations, traditional values, and original cultures stems from. Leaders of nations targeted by the West face the choice of voluntarily submitting to its dictates, being bribed into doing the same, or having destruction and misery brought upon their homelands by the US and its allies, Putin said. “Greed and the intention to preserve unlimited power are the true causes of the hybrid war which the collective West is waging against Russia.” They don’t wish freedom for us. They want us to be a colony. They don’t want cooperation of equals, but pillaging. They want to see us not as a free society, but a crowd of soulless slaves. Putin delivered the speech in Moscow before signing treaties with the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions on their accession to the Russian Federation. The documents must be ratified by parliament before coming into force. The move was condemned by Kiev, which considers it to be an illegal annexation of its territory. Moscow said the accession was legitimized by referendums held in the former Ukrainian regions, in which people overwhelmingly voted in favor of splitting from Kiev and seeking protection from Russia against attacks by Kiev’s forces.",1.1237617934885102,1.7606565050080896,-0.6368947115195793,2
2022-09-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/563814-russia-ukraine-conflict-background/,Long way home: How Ukraine lost control of regions that returned to Russia,"President Vladimir Putin has signed documents paving the way for the formal acceptance by Moscow of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions. The treaties await ratification by the Russian parliament. According to the Kremlin, Friday’s decision followed a democratic vote, in which people living in the former regions of Ukraine exercised their right to self-determination and requested to be protected from Kiev. The historic move was condemned and rejected by Kiev and its foreign backers, which regard it as an annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory. RT takes a look back at how an armed coup in Kiev eight years ago led to a change of European borders and a major armed conflict. Maidan In late 2013, a wave of street protests began in Kiev, ostensibly sparked by the government of Viktor Yanukovich shunning an economic agreement with the EU – a deal sold to Ukrainians as a harbinger of immediate social and economic benefits. As weeks of activism, backed by Western-funded local pressure groups, stretched into months, the Maidan demonstrations were hijacked by radical nationalists, resulting in violent clashes with security forces in which dozens died. Western politicians openly lent their support, with senior US diplomats famously handing out cookies in central Kiev. The emboldened movement gathered momentum and, despite a power-sharing deal mediated in February 2014 by Russia, Germany, France and Poland, escalating violence forced then-President Viktor Yanukovich to flee. The US-backed coup in the capital rallied radical forces, who resorted to openly threatening the pro-Russian population in Ukraine with violence if they dared oppose the newly-installed authorities in Kiev. Minsk agreements The Crimean Peninsula had strong historic ties with Russia, having been transferred to Kiev’s control only in 1954 under Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev. The region is essential for Russia’s national security as its deep harbors host the Black Sea Naval Fleet. In a daring operation that was thought to have prevented significant bloodshed, Moscow deployed special forces across the peninsula, and local authorities held a referendum on breaking with Ukraine and joining Russia. Moscow formally accepted Crimea’s bid in March 2014. The situation with the two Donbass regions developed differently. In mid-April 2014, Kiev sent troops to quash protests in Donetsk and Lugansk. Protesters responded by forming militias and fighting back, militarizing an already inflamed conflict. The following month, the two regions held referendums on declaring their independence. The conflict in eastern Ukraine sank into a stalemate after the Ukrainian military suffered serious losses to what Kiev claimed were Russian troops secretly fighting in Donbass. The warring parties agreed to a ceasefire and a reconciliation roadmap, formalized in two agreements signed in Minsk in 2014 and 2015 respectively, was agreed. The peace plan never fully worked. While hostilities in Donbass abated, Kiev refused to meet its responsibilities, particularly on the question of federalization, unless its troops were given control of the Donbass regions’ borders with Russia. This ran contrary to the terms of the Minsk agreements. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko acknowledged in June that he agreed to the ceasefire only to win time to rebuild the Ukrainian military. NATO encroachment Tensions over Ukraine escalated in 2021, after Russia accused NATO of expanding into the country without formally admitting Kiev into the alliance. Moscow had for decades made clear that Ukraine’s would-be membership of the US-led bloc would be crossing Russia’s security red line. Moscow sought guarantees from Washington that would have addressed its concerns. However, US officials declared that NATO’s “open door” policy meant that Ukraine was free to align itself as it wished. Kiev enshrined the goal of becoming a member of the military bloc in its constitution in 2019. Since then NATO members have intensively trained Ukrainian troops, providing Kiev with weapons and otherwise helping it to field a more capable army. Over the same period, Ukrainian neo-Nazi groups became embedded into military structures, gaining political power well beyond their levels public support. Hostilities On February 22, Russia formally recognized the DPR and LPR as sovereign states and demanded that Kiev pull back its troops beyond their claimed borders. Ukraine refused, and two days later, Russia sent its troops into the country, supported by the Donbass militias. Moscow has since claimed that it recovered military documents indicating that Kiev was preparing its own offensive against Donbass, which was preempted by the Russian attack. In the initial Russian push, Kiev lost control over a large chunk of its territory in the south and east, though in the months since it has managed to retake some of the lost land. Moscow and Kiev were also engaged in a series of peace talks in the first weeks of the conflict. A negotiated agreement securing Ukraine’s neutral status seemed to be in sight, but the process collapsed in April. Kiev now declares that it will only deal with Moscow after ousting it from all the land it considers under its sovereignty, including Crimea. The US has declared a strategic defeat of Russia as its goal and pledged to provide aid to Kiev “for as long as it takes”.",1.2297843364758347,1.6052953213101422,-0.37551098483430745,2

US President Joe Biden vowed fresh sanctions and more aid for Kiev. The four former Ukrainian territories held referendums between September 23 and 27 on joining Russia, with the measures passing with overwhelming support. The Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics in Donbass have been regarded by Russia as independent states since February, while Putin recognized the independence of Kherson and Zaporozhye on Thursday. After the Russian president signed accession treaties with the heads of all four territories on Friday, condemnation poured in from Western leaders. “The United States condemns Russia’s fraudulent attempt today to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory,” read a statement from Biden. “The United States will always honor Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. We will continue to support Ukraine’s efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically.” Biden added that the US would sanction anyone providing “political or economic support” to “Russia’s phony claims of annexation,” and that he would sign a bill providing an additional $12 billion to prop up Ukraine’s government and military. “The UK will never accept the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye as anything other than Ukrainian territory,” British Prime Minister Liz Truss said in a statement. “We will not hesitate to take further action, including imposing more sanctions to cripple Putin’s war machine,” she added.

Friday’s ceremony marked the start of the formal process of their accession. Heads of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik, as well as the leaders of Kherson and Zaporozhye, Vladimir Saldo and Evgeny Balitsky, signed the documents together with Putin. The move follows official requests by the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as the two southern Ukrainian regions, which had declared independence, to join Russia. All four territories held referendums on the issue between September 23 and 27, which saw overwhelming support for the move, according to results announced earlier this week by local election committees. In Donetsk, 99.23% of the people voted to reunite with Moscow, with Lugansk showing a slightly lower figure of 98.42%. Zaporozhye Region highly supported the idea of splitting from Ukraine and joining Russia, with around 93% of voters backing it. Some 87% voted in favor in Kherson Region as well. The treaties will now be submitted to Russia’s Constitutional Court, which will assess them to ensure they do not violate Russian law. Once they are cleared, the agreements will have to be ratified first by the State Duma – the lower house of the Russian parliament – and then by the Federal Council, its upper house. The lawmakers will also need to pass legislation on incorporating the two republics and two regions into Russia. The Donbass republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye, will become part of Russia no sooner than the law is signed by Putin. On Thursday, State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said that the lower house of Russian parliament would convene on October 3 to discuss a number of issues, including the treaties’ potential ratification. The Federal Council could also discuss the ratification at its regular session on October 4, the upper chamber’s head, Valentina Matviyenko, confirmed on Wednesday. “I do not see the need for extraordinary sessions,” she told journalists at the time.

Rogov wrote on Telegram that the attack targeted a convoy of cars that was traveling from Ukrainian-controlled territory to Zaporozhye Region, which declared independence from Kiev and was recognized as a separate state by Russia on Thursday. “It happened at a car market on the Orekhovskoe highway where convoys are being formed to enter the region,” he wrote. “24 people, including 11 men and 13 women were killed, 36 were wounded including a child,” the official said. According to Rogov, the people, who were targeted, had protested and blocked roads earlier this week, demanding that Ukrainian authorities allow them to enter the Russian-held part of the region. “After that they were approached by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the police, who openly threatened them and said that they’ll be sorry for what they were doing,” he wrote. The head of the administration accused Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky of “trying to take revenge on the residents of Zaporozhye Region after they chose to join Russia during the referendum” by ordering the strike. Rogov insisted the Ukrainian attack on the convoy was carried out with the aim of pinning the blame on Russia.

He made the remark after explaining that Western nations were trying to cover up the incident to protect the perpetrators and masterminds. “A number of Western nations launched a search for the ‘authors’ of this terrorist act pretty much the day after it happened,” he explained. “I believe the West is doing everything to hide the true executors and organizers” of the incident.

2022-09-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/563764-they-voted-to-join-russia/,‘I can’t imagine our future differently’: Donbass residents explain why they voted to join Russia,"Last week, referendums on once-again becoming part of Russia were held in the Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR) People’s Republics, as well as in the liberated territories of Zaporozhye, Kherson, and Nikolaev regions (the latter was annexed to Kherson Region). According to the results, the ‘For’ option won all four by an overwhelming margin. RT’s correspondent in Donbass, Vladislav Ugolny, has been observing the sentiment there for the past eight years. He describes how the referendums took place, what they meant to local residents, and why their outcome simply could not have been different. For those who are sufficiently immersed in the history of the struggle of the Russian residents of Ukraine for unity with their historic homeland, the results of the referendums are hardly surprising. But it is also worth pointing out from the start that not everyone in these regions took part in the vote. In 2020, one soldier told his comrades-in-arms that he was only serving in the DPR army for the sake of a good salary by local standards. He said that, at the time, he was ready to dig trenches and go on guard duty. But in case of a resumption of active military operations, he would be at Yuzhny, a station from which buses are dispatched to Russia. Active hostilities resumed over six months ago, eventually leading to the second referendum in Donbass. And this warrior did not take part in it. Why? Did keep his word and escape? No, he died in 2021. He could have said anything – soldiers like to scratch their tongues. But when his comrades-in-arms came under Ukrainian fire and their wounded had to be evacuated, he volunteered. During the rescue operation, he was killed in action. He did not live to see the fighting intensify, nor did he live to see the new referendum. There are many such people who are unhappy with what has been happening in Donbass these past eight years – where they have slowly languished as geopolitical hostages – and are also prepared to die for their land and identity. It is thanks to them and their resilience that Russia’s military offensive was possible. And these referendums also took place because of them. They all had a lot of reasons to hate what was happening. The wounded were often dismissed retroactively to avoid paying for their injuries. And in a betrayal of memory, the names of children killed by Ukrainians in Sloviansk and Konstantinovka, towns not controlled by the DPR, disappeared from the Alley of Angels (a monument honoring the children of Donbass killed by Ukrainians). By removing these names, it was as if DPR officials were abandoning the territories and the memory of those who remained under Kiev’s occupation. In the early years of its independence, the LPR had constant political crises, from which the despised Igor Plotnitsky emerged as the victor. Until he was overthrown and the much more popular Leonid Pasechnik was elected. The hope for reunification was based on the fact that Russia is a stable state governed by the rule of law, with fully-fledged institutions and an established civil society. Living their lives on the frontline of a geopolitical confrontation, Russians in Donbass dreamed that one day war would disappear. They hoped that Donbass would become an ordinary, peaceful region of Russia, like neighboring Rostov. They hoped that they would be able to put away their weapons and return to the mines and factories, and they could teach their children without regular shelling. Or that they could sweep the streets for leaves instead of scrubbing away blood from the pavement. Joining Russia offered hope and was synonymous with victory. After all, this is why the struggle started. Fate decided otherwise and the referendums had to be held during the fighting, with the risk of Kiev shelling the polling stations. Thus, the votes themselves did not become a moment of triumph and victory. But they could no longer be delayed, given that one of the declared aims of Moscow’s military operation was to restore peace to Donbass. The only way to protect both Donbass and the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye from the threat of genocide by the Ukrainian state was to incorporate them into the Russian Federation. The sweeps in Kharkov Region after towns and villages were seized by Kiev earlier this month, and the convoys of refugees, were apparently the final straw. The risk of polling stations being shelled was one reason some locals criticized the referendums. A friend of mine who is now serving in one of the DPR’s army units refused to participate in the referendum. He justified it by saying he had expressed his position a long time ago and was now defending it with a gun in his hand. He also questioned why the entry of the republics into Russia could not have simply been done by a decree of the Russian government. Why, he asks, do they ask a question to which the answer is already obvious? Needless to say, this warrior is not a big fan of democracy. However, his view was marginal. Residents of Donbass, despite the risks of terrorist attacks, flocked to the polls. Since the issue was a foregone conclusion, the polling stations became a place for declaring one’s position. Journalists were told not about the choice people made, but rather about how long they had waited for the opportunity to make it. The procedures of the referendum were designed with the usual legal provisions in mind, but the voters themselves effectively abolished the concept of ‘secret ballot’ by ticking the ‘yes’ box publicly. “The people of Donbass needed the referendum not to reassert their choice, which was made back in 2014 and has not changed since, but to present it to the international community in a more or less accepted framework,” a graduate of the political science department at Donetsk National University said after the vote. A leg injury prevented her from going to the polling station, but she was able to vote Yes by door-to-door voting: As I stood at the mobile ballot box in my backyard in the rain, listening to the sound of explosions in a neighboring district, I felt joy. Because it is, in any case, a step forward after too much stagnation. Dmitry, a native of the border town of Yenakievo, Donbass, said, “Of course I waited for the referendum and voted Yes. I cannot imagine our future any other way. Back in 2015, I was repeatedly offered the chance to leave my home region and live in Ukraine so that I would not know what war is like. “As you can see, I refused. Voting in the referendum was not my biggest contribution, but I was glad I did it. I didn’t doubt it for a second, especially when, about 40 minutes later, a HIMARS missile was shot down over the polling station, with shrapnel hitting my neighborhood.” This is how the referendum was held in Donbass. As for the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, the votes there were less festive there due to greater infiltration by Ukrainian security services and a bigger risk of sabotage. The lack of an eight-year wait was also a factor. However, even there, people were hoping that the Kharkov tragedy would not be repeated in their areas. The referendums that have taken place are like a marriage proposal made after eight years of engagement. There may be reason to speculate why it was not done earlier, but the answer is obvious.",2.989817280570379,2.309652989720784,0.6801642908495951,2
2022-09-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/563777-patrushev-beneficiary-pipelines-attack/,Russian security chief names ‘obvious’ beneficiary of pipeline rupture,"The US stands to benefit economically from the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines and has a record of targeting energy infrastructure with sabotage operations, the head of Russia's Security Council said. “Pretty much from the first minutes after the news of the explosions broke … the West launched an active campaign for assigning blame. But it is obvious that the primary beneficiary, first of all in the economic sense, was the US,” Nikolay Patrushev said on Friday. He compared this week’s incident with the attack on Nicaragua’s oil infrastructure in Puerto Sandino in 1983. Back then CIA officers, based on a ship moored in international waters, coordinated a raid by commandos they had trained to fight against the Sandinista government, US press reported at the time. The US spy agency also provided speed boats for the raid, according to a CIA source cited by Associated Press. The operation was part of the Reagan administration’s “dirty war” on Nicaragua, which later led to the Iran-Contras scandal. The CIA’s secret sale of weapons to Iran to fund Latin American militants was exposed in 1986. Patrushev made the remarks at a meeting with fellow security officials from former Soviet nations. “It appears to be necessary to coordinate our effort to expose the masterminds and executors of this crime, setting a good example for effective cooperation,” he told his counterparts. He noted that Washington's goal was “ensuring strategic and economic superiority over alternative centers of power” even though the EU, a US ally, has been suffering from its policies. The US is replacing Russian natural gas with its more expensive liquified natural gas, as the bloc moves to decouple its economy from Russian energy sources. The leaks in the two Nord Stream pipelines were first detected on Monday, when pressure in the undersea links connecting Russia directly to Germany drastically dropped. The pipelines were apparently breached with explosives, with the blasts detected by earthquake sensors in Sweden. Moscow called the incident an international terrorist attack against civilian infrastructure, while some Western officials described it as an act of sabotage. Some critics of Russia speculated that Moscow decided to blow up its own gas links with Germany to put pressure on the EU. Polish MEP and former Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski thanked the US for the incident, but later deleted the tweet, calling his implied assertion of Washington’s involvement a personal working theory.",3.037377014983312,3.785460656454591,-0.748083641471279,1

Guterres claimed that the referendums, in which people overwhelmingly voted to join Russia, “can’t be called a genuine expression of the popular will” as they were held in areas “under Russian occupation.” He described the upcoming accession procedure of the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, and the self-proclaimed states of Kherson and Zaporozhye as “a process of annexation of the Ukrainian regions.” The move by Moscow “cannot be reconciled with the international legal framework” as the UN Charter and the Friendly Relations Declaration of 1970 outlaw territorial acquisition “resulting from the threat or use of force,” the secretary general said. Russia’s mission to the UN said that it regretted Guterres’ words, which represented a violation of the UN Charter. The UN’s principal document identifies the secretary general as the “Chief administrative officer of the Organization,” it reminded in a statement. “Administrative functions do not give the secretary general the right to make political statements on behalf of the UN as a whole – as it belongs to its member states – let alone to single-handedly deliver interpretation of the norms of the Charter and the documents of the General Assembly.” The UN Charter also says that the secretary general and the secretariat should always act in an unbiased manner and “refrain from any action, which might reflect on their position as international officials responsible only to the Organization,” the Russian diplomats added. However, when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, Guterres has been “consistently demonstrating the same selective approach as the countries of the collective West, literally putting himself in the lineup with them,” the statement read. Instead of acting in line with his duties, the secretary general “chose to be instrumental in influencing the position of UN member states ahead of the anticipated initiation by the Western countries of the discussion of the issue of referenda,” Russia’s mission insisted. Ukraine and its backers in the US and the EU have labeled the referendums a “sham,” vowing not to recognize their results and promising to slap more sanctions on Russia if it accepts new territories. The official ceremony, in which President Vladimir Putin is expected to sign treaties on incorporating the two Donbass republics and the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye into Russia, is scheduled to take place in Moscow on Friday.",1.9278754951462707,1.1334573795691123,0.7944181155771584,8
2022-09-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/563761-guterres-un-accession-russia/,UN chief tells Moscow to ‘step back from the brink’,"UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Thursday warned Russia against the “annexation” of four former Ukrainian regions, accused Moscow of prompting a “dangerous escalation,” and called on the Kremlin “to step back from the brink.” His remarks come one day before the ceremonial signing of treaties on the inclusion of the two Donbass republics, as well as the self-proclaimed states in Kherson and Zaporozhye, into the Russian Federation. Speaking to the reporters, Guterres described the upcoming accession procedure as “a process of annexation of the Ukrainian regions.” “Any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned. It cannot be reconciled with the international legal framework,” Guterres said. He explained that, at this “moment of peril,” his duty is to uphold the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, as well as in a key document of the UN General Assembly, the Friendly Relations Declaration of October 24, 1970. Both documents, he said, clearly state that no territorial acquisition “resulting from the threat or use of force” shall be recognized as legal. Therefore, Guterres argued, the actions of Moscow not only represent “a dangerous escalation” but also violate UN principles, so they “cannot be reconciled with the international legal framework” and “must not be accepted.” The UN chief also emphasized that the referendums in the two republics and two self-proclaimed states, which preceded their official requests to join Russia, were conducted during active military conflict in “areas under Russian occupation” and outside of Ukraine’s “legal and constitutional framework.” Therefore, Guterres argued, “they cannot be called a genuine expression of the popular will.” The secretary general called on Moscow “to step back from the brink” and stop the accession process, claiming that the prospects for a peaceful solution in Ukraine would otherwise be jeopardized even further. “It will prolong the dramatic impacts on the global economy, especially developing countries, and hinder our ability to deliver life-saving aid across Ukraine and beyond.” On September 21, two days before the referendums in the Donbass republics, Kherson, and Zaporozhye, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that the “majority of people living in the territories liberated from the neo-Nazis, and these are primarily the historical lands of Novorossiya, do not want to live under the yoke of the neo-Nazi regime.” The EU, US, and their allies have refused to accept the results of the referendums, calling them a “sham.” Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said, “Russia’s recognition of the pseudo-referendums” means that Kiev has “nothing to talk about” with Moscow.",1.7049211638543593,1.539300240870867,0.1656209229834924,8
2022-09-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/563762-putin-zaporozhye-kherson-independence/,Putin recognizes independence of Zaporozhye and Kherson,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday signed two decrees recognizing the former Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye as independent sovereign states. The decrees come into force immediately. “Recognize the state sovereignty and independence” of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions “effective from the day of signing,” the two decrees dated and signed September 29 say. In the documents, Putin refers to the universally recognized principles and norms of international law, and the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, enshrined in the UN Charter. The move comes on the eve of the official ceremony in which the Russian president is expected to sign treaties on incorporating the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, as well as the two Donbass republics, into Russia. Referendums on joining Russia were held in Zaporozhye and Kherson, as well as the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), between September 23 and 27. In Kherson Region, 87.05% voted in favor of declaring independence and joining the Russian Federation. Zaporozhye Region also supported the idea of splitting from Ukraine and joining Russia (93.23%). In the DPR, 99.23% voted in favor, while the results in the LPR were slightly lower (98.42%). After Putin signs the treaties on the accession of the new regions into Russia, the documents will be submitted to Russia’s Constitutional Court. After this, the State Duma – the lower house of the Russian parliament – will have to ratify the agreements, which will then be sent to the Federal Council, its upper house, for the same procedure. The Donbass republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye, cannot become parts of Russia until lawmakers pass legislation on their incorporation, which would then need to be signed by Putin. In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states, accusing Kiev of failing to implement the Minsk agreements, which were supposed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within Ukraine. Brokered by Germany and France, the protocols were first signed in 2014. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing the need to protect Donbass. It also demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked. During the conflict, Russian forces seized the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Since that time, the local authorities repeatedly mulled the idea of joining Russia, before eventually holding referendums in September.",3.247542916289326,4.065567646400483,-0.8180247301111572,2

Addressing a meeting with the heads of intelligence for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Putin said Russia’s “geopolitical adversaries” are prepared to turn any country “into a ground zero of a crisis,” and to unleash “bloody massacres.” “We also know that the West is devising scenarios for inciting new conflicts in the CIS. But we already have enough of them,” Putin said by videolink. He pointed to the current military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine, as well as “what is happening on the borders of other CIS countries,” an apparent reference to recent border clashes between Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan, as well as between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. All such conflicts have resulted from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Putin said, noting that this was “understandable.” “But the risks of destabilisation are growing again, including the risks of destabilisation in the entire Asia-Pacific region,” he added, claiming that “the notorious collective West” was unable to accept the inevitable collapse of the “old unipolar hegemony.” “We are seeing the difficult process of the forming of a more just world order,” the Russian president said. Putin has long spoken about the end of the so-called “unipolar” world dominated by the United States and its allies. In his infamous speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, he slammed Western leaders for deliberately eroding trust and said that a unipolar system was “not only unacceptable but also impossible” in the world today. Earlier this month, during a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, Putin said Western attempts to preserve the existing world order “have taken an absolutely ugly form lately.” The idea of a new “multipolar” world has been discussed in the West, too, most recently by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who told the World Economic Forum at Davos in May that he hopes for “more multilateralism” and “more international co-operation.” Following Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine, however, the West declared its intention to “isolate” Russia and imposed unprecedented sanctions on it. Russia views these actions as another manifestation of Western attempts to “contain” it and maintain the existing world order.",1.9656629496359712,1.8750857582020948,0.09057719143387644,8

While the West is trying to foment new crises in their territory, Putin noted, there were plenty of real ones dating back to the Soviet Union’s break-up. The Russian president pointed to the present conflict with Ukraine but also the recent border battles between Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, warning that “risks of destabilization are still growing” and threatening to expand to the entire Asia-Pacific. On the other hand, Putin noted, trade, industrial and investment cooperation between Russia and other CIS members has been increasing “in spite of pressure, blackmail and illegal sanctions from the US and its satellites.” In addition to Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan make up the CIS.

The move follows referendums held in the respective territories. The ceremonial signing will take place in the St. George Hall inside the Kremlin Palace on Friday at 3pm Moscow time, after which Putin will deliver a “voluminous speech,” according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The Russian president will also personally meet with the heads of the new territories. The announcement comes after the two republics and two self-proclaimed states made official requests to join the Russian Federation after having held public referendums on the issue between September 23 and 27. The move was overwhelmingly supported by the local population, according to official results announced late on Tuesday. Peskov separately noted that Putin’s speech on Friday will not be a formal address to the Federal Assembly – the country’s parliament – stating that such a speech will be held in a completely different format and is yet to be announced. As explained by Senator Konstantin Kosachev, the vice speaker of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, signing the treaties is only one of the key steps necessary to officially incorporate the new territories into the Russian Federation. After Putin signs the treaties, they must be submitted to the country’s Constitutional Court to ensure they comply with Russian law. Once they are cleared, the documents have to be ratified by the lower house, the State Duma, and the upper house of parliament, the Federal Council. Only after that will the DPR, LPR, and the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye officially become integrated into the Russian Federation. The next session of the Federal Council is planned for October 4, according to chairman Valentina Matvienko, who said that if “everything is confirmed” the body will take the treaties on accepting the new territories up for consideration. The EU and the US have repeatedly refused to accept the results of the referendums, calling them a “sham.” Western leaders have also vowed to never recognize “any kind of annexation in Ukraine.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen claimed she was “determined to make the Kremlin pay for this further escalation,” while US State Secretary Antony Blinken stated that Kiev had “every right” to take back the territories that are trying to secede from its rule.",1.8916721563694823,2.8074203662264474,-0.9157482098569651,2

She added that the entire Baltic Sea is “packed full” of the bloc’s military infrastructure. Speaking at a regular press briefing on Thursday, Zakharova dismissed any allegations that Russia was behind the incident. “May I ask you a question? When exactly did Russia decide it wanted to stop supplying energy to Europe?” she asked. Zakharova said NATO was engaged in military activities close to the location where the leaks were found, noting that it might have presented an interesting “opportunity” for the bloc. “So, maybe the NATO bases never conducted exercises there, while American soldiers have never been stationed on the territory of nearby countries?” she quipped, adding that this summer ""in the area of Bornholm, Denmark, NATO conducted exercises that used deep-sea equipment”. Zakharova was apparently referring to Exercise Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 22 in the Baltic Sea, which took place in June 2022 and were meant to demonstrate the military bloc's “mine hunting capabilities,” according to the statement by the US Navy at the time. In particular it sought to experiment with Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) by deploying them off the coast of Bornholm island. Zakharova urged Washington to offer “an explanation” and “confess” to the truth, saying that the US had left that job to Poland's former foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, who earlier “thanked” the US for destroying the pipeline. NATO said Thursday that the pipelines were damaged in what appeared to be a “deliberate, reckless, and irresponsible acts of sabotage,” promising to meet any attack on its critical infrastructure “with a united and determined response.” Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the Nord Stream leaks as a probable “terrorist act” which is unlikely to have been possible “without the involvement of some state power.” On Monday, Denmark reported leaks from the pipelines after the operator reported a loss of pressure on both Nord Stream 1 and 2. Danish and Swedish authorities later said there had been a series of undersea explosions near Bornholm.

He told journalists it is currently difficult to say with absolute certainty what happened to the pipelines, but “the scale of destruction indicates that it really was a sort of a [terrorist] act.” “It’s very hard to imagine that such a terrorist act could have happened without the involvement of some state power,” he said. The spokesman was also asked to comment on a report by CNN, which cited unnamed Western intelligence officials claiming Russian warships were spotted not far from the offshore gas leaks on Monday and Tuesday. “This area is the Baltic Sea. Plenty more flying, floating and other seaborne vehicles belonging to NATO countries were observed there,” Peskov insisted, describing the report as “stupid” and “agenda-driven.” Leaks from the gas pipelines, connecting Russia to Germany, were discovered by Denmark on Tuesday after the Nord Stream operator reported a loss of pressure. Danish and Swedish authorities later said a series of undersea explosions had been detected near Bornholm island in the Baltic Sea. This led Russia, the US, the EU and Sweden to suggest that the leaks might have been the result of a deliberate act. No accusations have been voiced at the highest level, but some European and Ukrainian officials have hurried to point the finger at Russia, saying the alleged sabotage of the pipelines could have been a ‘false flag’ operation by Moscow in an attempt to smear Kiev and further drive energy prices up in the EU. Peskov responded to those claims on Wednesday, calling them “absurd” and pointing out that the leaks were “a big problem” for Russia too. He reiterated that the US has been recently making “super-duper profits” from supplying LNG to Europe and stands to gain from continuing with those deliveries. Sweden said on Thursday that its coast guard had discovered another – fourth – breach in the Nord Stream pipelines.

2022-09-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/563706-nuclear-weapons-moscow-west/,Sergey Poletaev: Is Russian talk of using nuclear weapons just hot air or are Moscow's warnings serious?,"Just the other day, Moscow sharply upped the ante in the stand-off over Ukraine: it gave the go-ahead for referendums in territories formerly controlled by Kiev and announced a partial military mobilization. It also again issued a reminder that its actions are backed by the world’s most powerful weapons. This was immediately dubbed “nuclear blackmail” in the West. So why are we hearing these hints over and over again? Is Russia really prepared to use such force, or is it just a form of verbal deterrence? First, since the end of the Cold War there has been an imbalance between Moscow’s nuclear power, its economic capabilities, and its political weight in the world. Secondly, these weapons of mass destruction are perceived by our former adversaries as a relic of the past rather than a relevant factor in international relations today. Russia, on the contrary, sees the nuclear arsenal as the basis of its sovereignty and has assumed that as long as we were still a great power in nuclear terms, we could also claim to be important in terms of foreign policy, even as an economic dwarf. It was the presumption of being a great power that determined our actions in Ukraine and throughout the post-Soviet space. This difference in perception is the fundamental reason for the Ukrainian crisis, and it’s why we and the West cannot find any common ground to at least try to kick-start some sort of agreement. Russia does not pretend that the West shares its views on Ukraine. If there were such illusions a decade or more ago, they have long since dissipated. The Kremlin now seeks to push Washington and Brussels out of the country, which it considers to be part of its vital interest zone, and if this fails, it hopes to reformat Ukraine as a state and remove its potential as a threat. In this endeavor, Moscow doesn’t care what others think. The West is stubborn, and this means Moscow’s years-long attempts to settle the matter with little blood spilled have failed. In the interim, things have only gotten worse, and we are now in the eighth month of a large-scale conflict in Ukraine, with Kiev having lost control over five regions since 2014. We also have two armies facing each other, one with the largest country on earth at its rear and the other with the most powerful military bloc in history providing huge support. By raising the stakes and again mentioning nuclear weapons, Russia is telling the West: It could be argued that the Kremlin’s vague hints are not aimed at finding détente, but rather are about promoting increased uncertainty and forcing the opponent to think about exactly where the red lines are drawn. Firstly, for Russia, the number one military objective is to defeat the Ukrainian army (AFU). The Kremlin seems confident that after partial mobilization we can deal with the AFU and its western rear. But it is not certain that we will be able to handle the Western-supplied systems which have been deployed. Secondly, it is likely that clear messages are being conveyed through closed channels to Western counterparts about what Moscow considers totally unacceptable. In any case, NATO has been very careful in its expansion of arms deliveries and has so far categorically not allowed its weapons to hit Russia’s core territory and Crimea, while also still not intervening with its air force and air defense. What’s next? Well, there are three scenarios. Let’s label them by appropriate moods. Black: In response to our actions, NATO raises the stakes again and intensifies its level of engagement to defeat Russia on the battlefield. This is the route to nuclear action, although there are still many more bridges to cross first. Grey: Freezing the conflict in its current state with the perpetual non-recognition of Russia’s new borders. This leaves Ukraine torn apart and left to prepare for more fighting down the road, with ties between Russia and the West severed for many years. Sunshine: For this to happen, awareness of the reality of the nuclear threat must become clear to the Western leadership. Then, and only then, will they lose interest in Ukraine. When it comes to Russia, on the other hand, it will make sense to restore relations, now in the full knowledge of what lines can’t be crossed in the future. Then and only then can we finally move on.

2022-09-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/563717-ukraine-attacks-refugee-convoy/,Children among dead after Ukraine shells refugee convoy – LPR,"The Ukrainian army has attacked a refugee convoy in the eastern region of Kharkov, killing over 30 people, according to the Lugansk People’s Republic’s envoy to Russia. Rodion Miroshnik wrote on his Telegram channel that those killed in the artillery bombardment included children. He added that emergency services are unable to access the bodies, as shelling from Kiev’s forces continues. The republic’s health ministry stated that seven other people were injured, including two children who lost their parents in the shelling. Miroshnik claimed the Ukrainian army knew exactly who they were shooting at, as they had allegedly used drones to track down the refugee vehicle convoy and were “intentionally aiming at civilians.” Kiev has yet to respond to the allegations. Speaking to the Russia 24 TV channel, the LPR envoy noted that the number of civilians trying to get out of Kharkov Region has significantly increased in recent days, as fighting in the area has intensified in the wake of Kiev’s forces reclaiming most of the region. Miroshnik said most of the fleeing residents are trying to cross into Russia’s Belgorod region or the LPR, especially from the cities of Kupyansk and Balakleya. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",3.675092460994388,3.40220267666422,0.27288978433016764,2
2022-09-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/563707-russian-abmassador-nuclear-threat/,No such thing as limited nuclear conflict – Russian ambassador,"The US is risking destruction by engaging in nuclear brinkmanship against Russia, Moscow’s envoy to Washington has warned. There can be no such thing as a limited conflict of this nature, Anatoly Antonov said. The Russian ambassador claimed that American military planners “apparently hope that the United States would be able to take cover behind the ocean” if nuclear weapons are used in Europe, and warned against such a gamble. “It is safe to assume that any use of nuclear weapons could quickly lead to an escalation of a local or regional conflict into a global one,” he wrote in an article published by The National Interest magazine on Wednesday. The risk of escalation is coming from the US, and not Russia, Antonov said. Washington has been for decades encroaching on Russian borders with NATO expansion and dismantling various strategic arms control treaties with Russia, he pointed out. Moscow’s complaints that its national security was being compromised were simply ignored, the diplomat added, which led the country to believe that the US simply wants “to gain security advantages, especially in confronting Russia” and “achieve global military dominance.” The ambassador was involved with issues relating to nuclear reduction, military transparency and mitigation of strategic risks in the Russian Foreign Ministry before taking up his post in Washington. According to Antonov, the ongoing crisis in Ukraine was caused by the continuation of the same policies, to which Moscow had to respond militarily. If Russia believes that its existence is threatened by the US and its allies, it will use nuclear weapons, as is stated in its military doctrine, he added. US officials “twist the statements of the Russian leadership” about this stance to further escalate the situation, the diplomat said. Washington is seeking to intimidate its own people as well as others with “sham Russian ‘nuclear threats,’” Antonov claimed. He urged the US to tone down its hostile rhetoric and policies, to respect Russian national security interests, and join it and other nuclear nations in reiterating a pledge to work towards avoiding any use of the weapons. Speculation that Russia could use its nuclear arsenal to compensate for failures in a conventional conflict have been rife in Western media since before Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in late February. The latest round of speculation and warnings from senior officials came in response to a national address by Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. He said the US wanted to partition Russia in the same way as the Soviet Union was broken up after its collapse, and warned that Moscow would use all tools at its disposal to protect its territorial integrity.",2.038974337440399,1.9922414958873673,0.04673284155303148,8
2022-09-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/563261-every-little-btc-helps/,"Ukraine has taken in at least $100 million in crypto donations this year, but what have officials in Kiev done with the money?","To support the conflict with Russia, thousands of pieces of state-of-the-art military equipment, unprecedented media support, and billions of dollars – to maintain financial stability – have poured into Ukraine from the West. The multimillion-dollar cryptocurrency donations which Ukraine has been collecting “for the needs of its army” since February, seem to have disappeared from public view. So how has Kiev disposed of more than $100 million in crypto collected from around the world? Two days after the start of Russia's military operation, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov announced cryptocurrency fundraising to support the country. Kiev accepted almost all major denominations: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, a number of lesser-known types, and even NFTs. At the time, the decision to accept crypto, to “help Ukrainian fighters”, appeared innocuous. The Russian offensive was rapid and it seemed as though Western aid, although large-scale, would not arrive in time. Cryptocurrencies are an ideal tool in this respect: With a few clicks you can transfer millions of dollars to almost any country in the world, theoretically bypassing banking supervision or the attention of law enforcement. Ukrainian officials clearly expected to attract money not only from the governments of the United States and the European Union but also from concerned citizens familiar crypto. And they succeeded. Just a week after fundraising began, on March 3, Deputy Minister Alexander Bornyakov announced that Kiev had raised $53 million. A week later, this figure doubled – the country had received a round sum of $100 million from all over the world. It seemed that a local crypto-paradise had formed in Ukraine and, once this money was put into circulation, the country would be able to successfully resist Russia. However, the reality turned out to be much more complex. First, the flow of cryptocurrencies drastically weakened. In early June, the same Fedorov reported that “for more than three months, the total amount of donations in crypto assets exceeded $100 million.” After June, he no longer published messages about the value of new contributions. The money that Kiev managed to collect for confrontation with Russia should have been spent as efficiently as possible. And here the ""fun"" begins. Western propaganda carefully, and falsely, shapes the image of Ukraine as a democratic and open country, whose authorities are accountable to their citizens. In reality, however, Ukrainian officials do not provide any detailed and reliable reports on spending. And the case of the millions collected globally in cryptocurrency is no exception. In total, since collection began in February, the Ministry of Digital Transformation has reported twice on spending – on April 14 and July 7, on a total amount of almost $100 million. Information about the July report appeared only on August 17, when it was posted on Twitter and published by Fedorov. The publication delay of over a month is in itself suspicious, but the oddities do not end there. According to the specialized crypto media CoinDesk, Ukraine had received $135 million in cryptocurrencies by June. Given the large-scale support from the West, the actual volume of receipts in cryptocurrencies by September presumably should have grown even more. Having collected impressive sums, Ukrainian officials, for reasons only known to themselves, are in no hurry to spend the money on the needs of their army. After seven months of active hostilities, Ukraine reported spending only about 75% of the crypto funds collected, and this is taking into account only those amounts that are reliably known. What happened to the remaining funds, and why Ukrainian officials seem to be indifferent to tens of millions of dollars, cannot be unambiguously explained. Questions also arise over what exactly Ukraine, as officials claimed, spent the collected crypto on. For example, according to a July report, 213 drones were purchased for $11.8 million. Settling on an average cost of goods is the conventional approach, but it turns out that one drone bought for crypto cost nearly $55,800. An extremely impressive amount, despite there being simply no such equipment in the public domain. For example, the DJI Mavic 3 drone, which has become popular in the conflict, costs between $2,000 and $5,000 depending on modifications. It can be used for reconnaissance and for dropping grenades on the enemy and it is the most common civilian drone. UAVs, on the other hand, with an average cost of $55,000, are more likely to be military grade with secure communication channels. And such UAVs obviously cannot be bought for crypto – they are officially purchased as part of defense contracts. Another feature of Ukrainian purchases for cryptocurrencies is extremely vague reporting on purchases. With public fundraising, it’s an established norm that the ‘collector’ publish how much money was spent on which model of what particular equipment, with photographic confirmation. However, in the case of the Kiev government, such reports are de facto absent. For example, on May 4, it was announced that 31 thermal imaging sights had been handed over to Ukrainian border guards. In total, as reported, they received more than 5,000 optical and thermal imaging sights, bought from crypto. At the same time, published confirmation of the transfer of these items amounted to a single photo of one unspecified unit, taken in an unknown location. Of course, this in itself is not proof that Ukraine has permitted the misappropriation of the collected crypto and falsified information about purchases. However, no confirmation has been published that the equipment was transferred to troops. All Ukrainian reports on the spending of the collected crypto look literally like a web-page, on which the distribution of funds is randomly indicated. It is impossible to verify and, in fact, officials are asking us to simply take their word for it. It is also interesting that the Kiev authorities claim that tens of millions of dollars were spent on the army's needs, but the government Twitter account which supplies spending reports, offers no information about purchases worth such an amount. All expenses publicly reported there do not exceed a few hundred thousand dollars. An analysis of transactions further suggests that Ukrainian officials arbitrarily disposed of the donations collected from around the world. A feature of cryptocurrency is that it’s quite easy to create a wallet to store digital currency and there's no need to worry about banking or tax controls. Bitcoin and others are considered to be completely anonymous. In fact, a bitcoin address itself is just a set of Latin letters and numbers that have no connection to a specific person. However, it is still possible to track bitcoin operations. It's all based on blockchain technology, where all transactions are recorded. This means that anyone can find out when and how much cryptocurrency was transferred from wallet X to wallet Y. Anyone can track such transactions thanks to publicly available and free services such as Blockchain.com or Etherscan. Thanks to this, it was possible to establish that more than half of the bitcoin withdrawn from the Ukrainian government wallet were transferred to 3CcF942kYVRotGrfYQxD4QNn4aKVywpRxb. This wallet was created in 2018 and since then its turnover of funds has amounted to more than $6 billion. Interestingly, according to the Check Bitcoin Address profile service, this bitcoin wallet has been repeatedly used to receive money from fraud and blackmail. Furthermore, it may have been used by cybercriminals to launder money and cover their tracks. In the crypto sphere, this is called bitcoin mixing – when “dirty” bitcoins that are involved in crime are mixed with “clean” cryptocurrency. Hundreds of operations are carried out and, as a result, it becomes impossible to trace where the ill-gotten money went. An example of this kind of bitcoin mixer is Tornado Cash, against which the US Treasury has imposed sanctions. One of its founders has been arrested in the Netherlands. Ukrainian officials could have used the mixer simply to ensure greater anonymity of military equipment dealers. However, the openly criminal background and the lack of full-fledged reporting cast doubt on the proper use of the service Another suspicious bitcoin wallet is bc1qu4qcqp5xthrreedgk4s28kkqddpv4my53zx3uw. Created immediately after the start of active hostilities, it received $8.3 million from the Ukrainian government wallet. It has been used mainly to receive funds from the government crypto wallet and the criminal wallet mentioned above. According to Blockchain.com, the money was moved between them in small chunks, possibly to make it harder to track transactions. The crypto wallets created immediately after the start of Russia's military operation are generally typical for Ukraine. An example, this time using the second most popular cryptocurrency in the world, ETH, would be 0x88ef7bf4e94d9c6a4615e5a9f32ea2d2f141f2e9. In total, 5260 ETH was withdrawn out of almost 10,000 ETH collected by Ukraine. And, interestingly, most of it was withdrawn three days after the publication of the April spending report. Prior to this, no funds had been withdrawn from the wallet for two months. According to Ukrainian officials, transactions using crypto are quite normal for many equipment dealers. For long term operators, it is natural to use their usual wallet, no matter its history. But here we see that more than half of the amount in the two most popular cryptocurrencies was withdrawn either to newly created one-day wallets, or those with a criminal mix. In addition, as mentioned earlier the Ukrainian authorities do not provide detailed reports on spending and it is impossible to verify exactly how the crypto transferred to one-day wallets was used. All this creates the impression that people in Kiev, contrary to all their talk about accountability and transparency, arbitrarily disposed of tens of millions of funds collected in this manner.",2.841144502616352,2.347146140652005,0.4939983619643469,3
2022-09-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/563676-nord-stream-russia-problem/,Kremlin says Nord Stream explosions ‘a big problem for Russia’,"The Kremlin has denounced as “stupid and absurd” any allegations of it being behind the suspected explosions of the Nord Stream natural gas pipelines earlier this week, stating that the incident actually creates many issues for Russia. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov explained that the damage to the pipelines posed a “big problem” for Russia as it had essentially lost its gas supply routes to Europe. Both lines of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline were pumped full of gas and were prepared to deliver it to Europe at the time of the alleged explosion, said Peskov, adding that “this gas is very expensive and now it is all going up in the air.” Peskov also noted that neither Russia nor Europe had anything to gain from the destruction of the pipelines, especially Germany, for which this incident poses a threat to the future development of its industry, as well as its profitability and competitiveness. American LNG suppliers, on the other hand, have been making incredible profits after having multiplied their deliveries to the European continent, Peskov pointed out, adding that these companies are “very interested in maintaining these super-duper profits in the future.” While no suspects behind the incident have officially been named, the Kremlin spokesperson advised against making any official announcements before a proper investigation into the incident is carried out. Peskov did, however, draw attention to US President Joe Biden’s statements from early February, when the American leader threatened to “bring an end” to Nord Stream 2. “What the US president meant by that, we don’t know,” admitted the Kremlin official, but highlighted the “borderline insane hysterical-euphoric reaction” of Polish officials who have already thanked Washington for sabotaging the pipeline. The Kremlin’s response comes after some European and Kiev officials, including President Vladimir Zelensky’s adviser Mikhail Podolyak, suggested that the attack on the pipeline was a “false flag” operation carried out by Russia in order to make Ukraine look bad and to further drive energy prices up in the EU. However, after the former Polish FM publicly thanked the US for the apparent sabotage on Twitter, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova urged the EU to treat the US as the possible culprit behind the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines. She said Moscow would call for a UN Security Council session over the incident. A number of Western nations have repeatedly opposed Russia’s undersea pipelines delivering gas to Europe, both before and after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. The recently built Nord Stream 2 network, which never went into operation due to Germany’s refusal to certify it, has drawn particular opposition from countries like the US and Poland, which has called for the pipeline to be “totally scrapped.”",2.221595900820682,2.69202294346668,-0.4704270426459982,8

Both pipelines were severely damaged earlier this week in what many suspect was a deliberate attack. Danish authorities confirmed gas leaks from the pipelines not far from the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea on Monday after the operator reported a loss of pressure in both Nord Stream 1 and 2. Swedish and Danish authorities later confirmed a series of undersea explosions had been detected before the leaks were confirmed. Russian, American, and Swedish officials all said that the damage might have been the result of a targeted attack on pipeline infrastructure. No suspects behind the incident have officially been named, although in a tweet former Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski “thanked” Washington for destroying the pipeline. Moscow, which called the incident a “terrorist attack,"" also named the US as a potential suspect. Several high-ranking German MPs have pointed the finger at Russia, accusing it of attempts to “stir up uncertainty among the European population.” There has been no shortage of threats from sfome Western nations against Russian undersea pipelines, particularly Nord Stream 2 both before and after late February, when Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.

Citing the ongoing partial mobilization, introduced by the Russian government last week, the embassy warned that Russian authorities may refuse to acknowledge persons with dual Russian-US citizenship, and may deny them access to US consular assistance. It also warns that dual citizens could be prevented from leaving the country and may be conscripted for military service. The message recommends that US nationals make “independent arrangements” for leaving the country “as soon as possible,” noting that the ability to do so is becoming increasingly difficult as border checkpoints are overcrowded and flights out of Russia are “extremely limited” at the moment. The embassy also warns that “severe limitations” have impacted its ability to assist US citizens, and that conditions in Russia, including transportation options, may “suddenly become even more limited.” “US citizens should not travel to Russia and those residing or travelling in Russia should depart Russia immediately while limited commercial travel options remain,” the security alert reads. The US embassy’s warning comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization last week, which aims to conscript some 300,000 reservists across the country to help control Russian-held areas and the 1,000-kilometer contact line with Kiev’s forces in Ukraine. Since the announcement, a number of military-aged Russian men have opted to flee the country to avoid the military draft. The sudden exodus has resulted in chaos at border checkpoints with neighboring countries that do not require a visa for visiting Russians, such as Kazakhstan and Georgia. Flights from Russia to states that do not require a visa have been sold out on the nearest dates.

In a Telegram post on Wednesday, the senator explained that, according to the Constitution, Russian citizens have the right to freely leave the country as long as they don’t have any outstanding issues with the law and have not violated any administrative or criminal codes. He added that all those who left the country during the partial mobilization and have not broken any laws can freely return to Russia at any point without facing any legal consequences, noting that Russia is a state of law. Klimov warned, however, that “serious moral responsibility” cannot be avoided by some of those who decided to run. “It is unlikely that anyone will cover the profits they themselves have missed and the losses they incurred from a hasty escape abroad,” the senator wrote, saying that he doubts “leaving the Fatherland in danger” will bring any luck to such fugitives.

2022-09-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/563639-zakharova-nord-stream-sabotage/,Russia tells EU to treat US as pipeline sabotage suspect,"Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has asked who the EU intends to punish with the “strongest possible response” for damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines. The diplomat said Poland's former foreign minister has already identified the US as the party behind the apparent sabotage. Radoslaw Sikorski is well connected to Washington elites through his employment at various think tanks. The two Nord Stream pipelines were seriously damaged this week in what is suspected to have been a deliberate attack. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday called the incident “sabotage action” and warned that “any deliberate disruption of active European energy infrastructure is unacceptable and will lead to the strongest possible response.” On Wednesday, Zakharova asked who exactly the warning would apply to. “I don’t get it. MEP Sikorski thanked the US for what had happened, so whom is Ursula ‘threatening’ there?” she wrote on social media. Zakharova was referring to the reaction to the incident by Sikorski, now an EU lawmaker, who posted a photo of the site where the explosions occurred on Twitter with the words: “Thank you, USA.” He described the incident as a “special maintenance operation.” Sikorski added that “there’s no shortage of pipeline capacity for taking gas from Russia to Western Europe, including Germany,” referring to the Yamal-Europe land pipeline that goes through Belarus and Poland. After the damage to the Nord Stream strings, Russian President Vladimir Putin “will have to talk to countries controlling” the alternative route to resume supplies, he predicted. Zakharova earlier asked if Sikorski’s tweets amounted to an “official statement that this was a terrorist attack.” Meanwhile, Dmitry Polyanskiy, the Russian deputy ambassador to the UN, thanked Sikorski for “making it crystal clear who stands behind this terrorist-style targeting of civilian infrastructure!” There has been no shortage of threats from some Western nations against Russian undersea pipelines, particularly the Nord Stream 2 both before and after late February, when Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.

Asked about recent comments from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken – who said the White House has no problem with Kiev using Western arms to attack territories that voted to join Russia – Ambassador Anatoly Antonov warned that the weapons shipments only risk “further escalation of the conflict.” “In instigating Kiev to continue using the military equipment received from the West, Washington does not realize the riskiness of its actions,” the envoy said on Tuesday, adding that the Joe Biden administration is “approaching the dangerous line that Russia has repeatedly and clearly warned about: the United States becoming a party to the Ukrainian conflict.” Earlier in the day, Blinken insisted the US “will never recognize the annexation of Ukrainian territory by Russia,” referring to votes in the two Donbass republics already recognized by Moscow – Donetsk and Lugansk – as well as the Ukrainian regions of Zaporozhye and Kherson, which are largely under the control of the Russian military. All four regions voted overwhelmingly to join Russia, according to local referendum observers. “Ukraine has the absolute right to defend itself throughout its territory, including to take back the territory that has been illegally seized, one way or another, by Russia. And the equipment, the weapons that we and many other countries are providing, have been used very effectively to do just that,” Blinken said. In response, Antonov said Russia would take “firm and decisive” steps to “defend the Fatherland,” going on to argue that “diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis cannot be effective as long as the collective West uses the Zelensky regime as a military mercenary against Russia.” “Civilians and children are being killed. Residential areas, schools and hospitals are being irreparably damaged,” the ambassador continued, accusing both the US and its allies in the NATO alliance of “sowing death and destruction.” The Biden administration previously said it received “assurances” from the Ukrainian government that US-made long-range rocket artillery systems would not be used for attacks on Russian soil. However, at the time it was not clear whether those guarantees applied to Crimea, which voted to reunite with Russia in a 2014 referendum similar to those that took place this week, and Kiev has since launched strikes on the peninsula.",2.306596176606356,3.141850234227926,-0.8352540576215701,8

Speaking during a UN Security Council meeting via a video link on Tuesday, he urged the global community not to recognise the outcomes. Zelensky also reiterated his threat to stop any contact with Russia should it implement the results. “Russia’s recognition of these pseudo-referendums as normal, the implementation of the so-called ‘Crimean scenario’ now, another attempt to annex Ukrainian territory, will mean that we will have nothing to talk about with Russian President [Vladimir Putin],” Zelensky stated, urging “every country in the world” to send a strong message against Russia’s actions. The referendums ran across the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine’s southeast and the Donbass republics over the past five days. The idea of joining Russia has been overwhelmingly supported by the local population, according to official results announced late on Tuesday. In Donetsk, some 99.23% of voters supported the idea of reunification with Russia, with Lugansk showing a slightly lower figure of 98.42%.

In Lugansk, over 98% of voters supported joining Russia, official figures show. Donetsk recorded similar results with more than 99% of voters supporting the proposal. Both Zaporozhye and Kherson regions had processed all ballots by late Tuesday, where respectively 93% and 87% of voters backed leaving Ukraine and unifying with Russia. The process of integrating new regions into the Russian Federation may take some time as it requires the approval of the country’s parliament and the president. But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that he was “convinced it will be fast enough.” The Russian constitution and federal law on the accession of new constituent members defines several necessary steps. Senator Konstantin Kosachev, vice speaker of the upper house of parliament, explained in a Telegram post that once the regions willing to become part of the Russian Federation submit their proposals to Moscow, the president informs parliament and the government on the matter. If political agreement on the accession is reached, “draft international treaties on the admission of foreign states or parts of them” to Russia should be developed, Kosachev said. These agreements regulate issues such as the name and status of new territories, citizenship, succession, the functioning of public authorities and legislation. After these treaties are signed, the Russian Constitutional Court assess the them for any potential legal violations. If the treaties are verified the next step is the ratification of the documents by the lower house, the State Duma, and their approval by the upper house, the Federation Council. Simultaneously, a draft federal constitutional law on the admission of new constituent units to Russia should be submitted to the Duma. If approved, it then goes to the upper house for consideration. “This law enters into force no earlier than the entry into force of the international treaties themselves,” Kosachev noted. Moscow has wearned that if the Donbass republics and the two southern Ukrainian regions united with Russia, it would consider any attempts by Kiev to retake them as attacks on its own land. “Immediately the Russian Constitution will come into force in relation to these territories where everything is very clearly stated in this regard,” Peskov told journalists last week. Shortly after the regions decided to hold referendums, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization that involved calling to arms some 300,000 reservists, according to the military. Media reports have suggested that Moscow allegedly plans to mobilize up to a million. Kiev considers the territories to be under illegal occupation and said it would not recognize the results of the referendums. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has ruled out any possibility of talks after the voting. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba stated last Tuesday that “Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them, whatever Russia has to say.” The EU and the US have already called the referendums a “sham.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS on Sunday that the LPR, DPR, Kherson and Zaporozhye regions “will never be recognized” as part of the Russian Federation. He added that Kiev had “every right” to take them back. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

Western nations are using their wealth and ability to print money to vacuum up food products from the global market, the Russian leader insisted during a government meeting on Tuesday. The unfolding crisis has been in the making for several years, he added. “Some leading nations have financial and food policies that led to the result we are observing now,” Putin said, adding that the behavior could be described as “predatory, without any exaggeration.” He noted that the US was a net exporter of food products last year, but now it is a net importer. The Russian leader also reiterated his criticism of the Ukraine grain deal, which allowed Kiev to export food via the Black Sea. The arrangement was mediated by the UN and Türkiye, but Russia believes it is not working as intended, arguing that the shipments do little to alleviate food shortages in needy nations. Putin cited last week’s maritime traffic statistics in relation to the scheme, pointing out that most of the ships carrying Ukrainian grain that didn’t report Türkiye as their destination went to one of the EU nations. “Are they the poorest nations or what? The situation remains the same. Embarrassing as it sounds, but this is plain swindle, and nothing else,” he said. Russia is set to harvest a record amount of grain this year, which is predicted to reach 150 million tons, including some 100 million tons of wheat, Putin said. But Russian food products have a difficult time finding their way to the global market due to Western economic sanctions, as do Russian fertilizers, he added. The West “is causing the global food crisis,” he claimed. The US and its allies deny that the restrictions they have imposed on Russian trade over the country’s military campaign in Ukraine are targeting its food and fertilizer exports. Officials in Moscow say that, while those products are technically not banned, restrictions on things like insurance and port services for Russian merchant ships effectively curb the country’s ability to export food and fertilizers.",5.064225563181308,1.9096244062342436,3.1546011569470647,7

2022-09-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/563607-bordachev-russias-conflict-with-west/,Timofey Bordachev: Russia’s conflict with the West leads to questions over the value of military and political alliances,"The continuing military and diplomatic clash between Russia and the West, led by the United States, raises questions to which, until recently, the answers seemed obvious. These include the phenomena of permanent alliances and allied relations. It is no secret that the behaviour of Moscow’s formal allies in the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) in today’s environment raises questions for the Kremlin, while Russia’s opponents are raising hopes that the existence of these blocs is no longer an advantage, but a problem, for Russia’s foreign and defence policy. We see examples of individual member countries of the CSTO or the EAEU meeting US demands in matters related to economic warfare against Russia. This makes one wonder how important and necessary are Russia’s allies when it cannot, like the US, exercise authoritarian control over its foreign and defence policies? The phenomenon of permanent alliance relations is a relatively recent invention in international politics – it emerged after the Second World War and it is entirely unknown whether the next round of global upheavals of a similar scale will see it survive. Even if we are not all blown to bits by a general nuclear catastrophe in the coming years, what is happening makes the prospects for all the phenomena that have shaped the fabric of international life in recent decades, without exception, highly uncertain. Today, the benchmark example of a permanent alliance of sovereign states is European integration. Another similar example is the NATO bloc, in which participation is cemented by the unconditional authority of a power far superior to its allies and not shy in making that clear. It is no coincidence that the conflict around Ukraine, the first major war of the new era in international politics, is linked to the development of these two alliances. A strong group of states inevitably creates conflicts around itself. Indeed, this becomes a consequence of the fact that it protects the interests of its members. From a theoretical point of view, the phenomenon of alliances is based on a simple formula: stability comes from mitigating inevitable injustices between states of different strengths, through consciously considering the interests of alliance partners as their own, or at least as close as possible to this. This is also the basis of the idea of collective security, first formulated back in the [early 19th century] era of the Congress of Vienna by Klemens von Metternich. By the way, he was the representative of the weakest power among of the victors over Napoleon and, moreover, located in the centre of Europe, and therefore most interested in a stable order. In other words, even relatively permanent alliances are a product of weakness rather than strength and are not the best way for a state to survive if it is unable to defend its interests on its own. Not surprisingly, the idea of permanent alliances did not take root until the middle of the twentieth century, because the world in which the great European empires ruled did not require them to have permanent relations, only ad hoc or interest-driven ones. Everyone knows how chaotic the formation of the coalitions that engaged with each other in 1914 was. Their final composition had less to do with common views, or even the strategic interests of the participating countries, and more to do with an ad hoc calculation of the balance of forces and resources each side needed to win. And because the balance proved to be evenly matched, the war, instead of the impetuous campaigns of the 19th century or the elegant manoeuvres of the 18th century, became an endless mutual annihilation. However, it was the century and a half that preceded the decline of Europe as the strongest part of the planet that shaped the meaning of even short-lived alliance relations – all European conflicts of the “balance of power” period were wars of coalitions. The continuous formation of military alliances of powers was caused by the inability of each of them to defend its interests by relying on its own forces alone. This practice was still infinitely different from the blocs we know today, but it already reflected their main point – the combination of the power capabilities of the participants to achieve a specific goal. It was usually a victory over a state which, for internal reasons, had acquired the scale or audacity to claim too large a share of the pie in the distribution of power in the European political arena. Several times alliances were formed against France, a couple of times against Prussia, once against Russia and never against Britain – the insular position of this state did not make it a continental threat. However, back then, alliances could not be permanent, because for their participants there was never any question of actually being unable to survive without relying on allies. In principle, we see the same thing now, when it comes to the biggest nuclear powers – the US, Russia or China. They do not need allies to survive. Their main interest is to use the territories of their partners as a base for deploying their forces in case of a conflict with an equally powerful enemy. Another dimension is that the direct organizational forms of relations between the most powerful countries and others can be different. But this depends not on their need for allies as such, but on the scale of their own resources necessary for complete control of these satellites. The US still has enormous amounts of these, while Russia or China have far fewer, which leads to peculiarities in the behaviour of those with whom the two powers enter into permanent alliances. We can see, then, how over the past hundred years the phenomenon of permanent alliances has taken a complete form, and it looks very archaic. In those cases where the leading power is not ready to perform the role of dictator due to subjective or objective reasons, the bloc becomes a factor of diplomatic interaction between them rather than an instrument for securing the collective interests of its participants. Even now, Armenia, Russia’s conditional ally in the South Caucasus, can use the presence of the CSTO as a way of exerting pressure on Russian diplomacy while absolving itself of all responsibility. In another case, however, we are witnessing a direct military clash between Russia’s formal allies – Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan – with each demanding support from Moscow. As a result, the whole idea of an alliance in the usual sense of the word has lost all meaning. First and foremost, for its leading participant. The small member states obviously have neither alternative options nor the military, political or demographic resources for fully independent survival. This helps us to solve the problem of the formal preservation of such associations, even if they lose much of their necessary functions and content. However, it should be understood that, in the future, Russia, like its neighbors, will either have to give up the idea of institutionalizing its relations or resort to rather more authoritarian methods of governance.",4.391793994778655,2.863431824045377,1.5283621707332777,8
2022-09-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/563605-kremlin-nord-stream-damage/,Kremlin comments on possible causes of Nord Stream damage,"The Nord Stream pipelines may have been damaged in an act of sabotage, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov suggested when asked about the possible reasons for sudden pressure loss in three of the Baltic Sea gas network’s lines. Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Peskov commented on a statement made by Nord Stream AG, the operator of the network, which said three offshore lines of the Nord Stream pipeline system sustained “unprecedented” damage in just one day. “No option can be ruled out right now,” Peskov said when asked if the damage may have been the result of sabotage. He added that Moscow is very concerned about the situation, and called for an immediate and thorough investigation into the incident, which has implications for energy security on the “entire continent.” Pressure in line A of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was pumped with gas but had yet to go into operation, suddenly dropped overnight between Sunday and Monday. Shortly after that, on Monday afternoon, both of Nord Stream 1’s pipelines also suffered a sharp loss of pressure. Sweden and Denmark’s coastguards have since reported gas leaks off the coast of Bornholm island in the Baltic Sea – one in the Swedish economic zone and one in the Danish zone – and closed off the area to maritime traffic. According to a report from the Tagesspiegel newspaper on Tuesday, Berlin believes the sudden pressure drop in three gas pipelines at the same time could not be a coincidence and is likely a “targeted attack” from either Ukraine or Russia. The outlet explained that a deliberate attack on the pipeline could only have been carried out using special forces, navy divers or a submarine. Berlin reportedly believes the sabotage was carried out by either “Ukraine-affiliated forces” or by Russia itself as a “false flag” operation to make Ukraine look bad and drive energy prices in the EU even higher. Nord Stream 1 was completed in 2011. Construction work on Nord Stream 2 (NS2) began in 2018, and suffered delays due to political pressure and sanctions from the US. NS2 was finished and pressurized in September 2021. However, two days prior to Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, the German government put its certification on indefinite hold, and has categorically rejected any suggestion from Moscow – or domestically – to unblock the pipeline.",4.0738059062025,4.017392952181727,0.05641295402077251,1

An individual can be handed over to the other side if both Kazakhstan and Russia consider their actions to be a criminal offense, he added. The minister explained that a Russian who traveled to Kazakhstan with a view to avoiding the draft can therefore only be extradited if a criminal case is launched against them at home and they’re placed on an international wanted list. The fact that a military recruitment center in Russia is looking for somebody isn’t enough to initiate rendition procedures, Akhmetzhanov said. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization in Russia last week, arguing that the country was facing “the entire Western military machine” in Ukraine. Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu later clarified that some 300,000 reservists would be called up.

2022-09-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/563587-medvedev-nuclear-weapons-ukraine/,Ex-Russian president weighs in on use of nukes against Ukraine,"NATO would not intervene if Moscow used nuclear weapons against Ukraine, Dmitry Medvedev has said, claiming that Kiev’s Western backers would be unwilling “to die in a nuclear apocalypse” for the country. However, the former Russian president said it was highly unlikely that the conditions for warranting a nuclear response by Moscow would arise in Ukraine. Medvedev made the comments as he discussed the hypothetical use of nuclear weapons by Russia on social media on Tuesday. He dismissed remarks by Western politicians, who have been warning Moscow against using nukes, as “diarrheic demagoguery.” The conditions permitting the use of Russia’s nuclear arsenal are stated plainly and publicly in the country’s nuclear doctrine, Medvedev said. Moscow says it will only use its most deadly weapons if it or one of its allies is attacked with weapons of mass destruction or if its existence is at stake in a conventional conflict. Hypothetically, if Ukraine were to pose a threat to Russia’s existence, Moscow could use nuclear weapons, he added, but the stakes would then be too high for third parties to get involved. “I believe NATO would not intervene in the conflict even in this scenario. The safety of Washington, London, Brussels is more important for the Alliance than the fate of useless, perishing Ukraine,” Medvedev predicted. “Sending modern arms to Ukraine is just a business with an extra seasoning of hatred towards us. Nothing more,” he said. “[American] and European demagogues would not die in a nuclear apocalypse. This is why they will swallow the use of any weapons in the ongoing conflict.” The latest warnings against the use of nuclear weapons were led by US President Joe Biden following an address by Vladimir Putin last week, during which the Russian leader claimed Washington and its allies were seeking to partition Russia. He cautioned that Moscow would use all tools at its disposal to defend itself. Medvedev, who currently serves as the deputy chair of Russia’s National Security Council, also warned that the country would not tolerate a nuclear-armed hostile neighbor. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky previously suggested that Kiev’s commitment not to have nuclear weapons could be withdrawn. The idea, which Zelensky voiced during a speech at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, prompted a furious response from Moscow, which perceived the remarks as a serious threat to Russia.",2.719590093519607,2.993399895968755,-0.273809802449148,8

Yelena Kravchenko announced the target deadline this morning, after the LPR opened polling stations on the last day of the five-day-long plebiscite. Organizers of the ballot kept the stations shut during the four previous days due to fear of attacks by Ukraine, instead sending polling officials to canvas residential areas door-to-door. The last day of voting will continue until 4pm local time (1pm GMT), after which counting will begin. Kravchenko said this will likely give election officials enough time to have the results ready later in the day. The head of the LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, who cast his vote in front of cameras on Tuesday morning, offered a more conservative prediction that only preliminary results would be ready this evening. Pasechnik said he was voting for joining Russia and, by extension, “for the bright and happy future of our children and grandchildren.” The LPR is one of four places where referendums on joining Russia are being held. As of Monday evening, the turnout there was reported to be 83.61%, behind the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), where the turnout was 86.89%. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, large portions of which are under the control of Russian troops, reported turnouts of 63.58% and 66.43%, respectively. Kiev has dismissed the polls as a “sham,” while its foreign backers have threatened to impose further economic sanctions against Russia over the referendums.",3.783695601373558,3.721839719897997,0.06185588147556098,2

Tokyo insists the charge has no merit and is demanding an apology for the consulate official’s treatment. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued the complaint on Tuesday, one day after Russia said it had detained Motoki Tatsunori for attempting to purchase restricted information. The ministry rejected the allegations as false and accused Russian authorities of improper interrogation methods. “The alleged illegal activity insisted by the Russian side is completely groundless,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said during a press briefing, adding that Vice Foreign Minister Takeo Mori had summoned Russia’s envoy to demand an apology. Matsuno went on to claim that Tatsunori was interrogated while wearing a blindfold, and that his head and hands were bound, saying the treatment was “intimidating” and may have violated a treaty between Russia and Japan. “It is extremely regrettable and absolutely unacceptable,” he said. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said it detained the diplomat in Vladivostok “on suspicion of receiving, for a monetary reward, restricted information” related to “Russia’s cooperation with another country in the Asia-Pacific region,” as well as the impact of Western economic sanctions. The service added that Tatsunori was declared “persona non grata” for activities that are “incompatible with the status of a consular official and detrimental to Russia’s security interests.” The Russian Foreign Ministry later summoned Japan’s envoy over the incident, and said Tatsunori must leave the country within 48 hours.

The scheme failed, though, as he was captured a few hours later and deported back to Russia. The unidentified 38-year-old man crossed the border near the mouth of the river on a stand-up paddleboard at about 1 a.m. on Monday, according to Estonian public broadcaster ERR. Estonian border guards in Narva-Joesuu sent out several patrols, including a canine unit, and found the illegal border crosser at a bus stop around 4:30 a.m. The man was taken to a border checkpoint for an administrative proceeding, after which he was fined and sent back to Russia. He told the Estonian authorities that he crossed over the border because of the partial military mobilization order that Russian President Vladimir Putin announced last week. Estonia’s government has boosted border security since Russia began its military offensive against Ukraine in February. Eerik Purgel, who heads border and migration control in Estonia’s Ida Prefecture, told ERR that the country hasn’t seen an increase in migration pressure. “We are closely monitoring the situation, and if necessary, we’ll send additional forces to the border,” he said. Narva-Joesuu sits in Estonia’s far northeastern corner, where the Narva River flows into the Gulf of Finland. Estonia stopped issuing visas to Russian tourists in August and joined with fellow Baltic states Latvia and Lithuania earlier this month in restricting entry by Russian citizens who obtained visas in other Schengen Area countries.",2.791346012121441,2.787280837002412,0.004065175119029263,3

The revised tally, which previously stood at 15 victims, was released by local authorities late on Monday. The attack also left more than 20 people, primarily children, injured. The rampage occurred early in the day, when the suspect, identified only as a 34-year-old graduate, stormed the school. The man was sporting all-black clothing with Nazi symbols on them, graphic footage circulating online suggests. The suspect was armed with two semi-automatic less-lethal pistols, illegally altered to use regular ammunition, according to Russian authorities. The suspect killed himself after confronted by law enforcement, while a large number of unused magazines, some with the word “Hatred!” inscribed on them, were recovered at the scene. According to Russian Education Minister Sergey Kravtsov, the suspect was a registered mental patient diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Anticipating the results of the vote in Donbass republics Kherson and Zaporozhye, Aksyonov said this would lead to greater clarity and determination. The People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, as well as the two Ukrainian regions mostly under control of Russian and allied forces, have been voting since Friday on the question of joining Russia – much as Crimea did in March 2014, following the US-backed coup in Kiev. Aksyonov noted that the Crimean vote was “held according to all international laws without a single flaw, but practically no one recognized it,” adding that this was no time to be distracted with questions of “legal purity.” “Soon we will pass a certain point of no return. A new status for the liberated territories will put an end to uncertainty,” the Crimean governor said. “They will become full-fledged subjects of the Russian Federation, and we will de facto stop conducting a special military operation and start a counter-terrorist operation on our own territory.” We were fighting for our people before. Now we’ll be fighting for our land as well. The government in Kiev maintains that the vote will change nothing, and President Vladimir Zelensky has vowed to continue the war until the “liberation” of all “occupied territories” – including Crimea – with Western help. US President Joe Biden on Friday denounced the vote as a “sham” referendum intended to “annex parts of Ukraine by force in flagrant violation of international law,” and said Washington and its allies would impose “severe economic costs” on Russia in retaliation. Aksyonov was elected prime minister of Crimea in late February 2014, just days after Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich was violently overthrown by US-backed militants. He oversaw the referendum in which the vast majority of Crimeans voted to join Russia. Aksyonov’s own son was among the 300,000 Russian reservists called up last week by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",4.428564132754902,3.4906449741903645,0.9379191585645374,2

The controversial ultra-nationalist politician died in April this year aged 75. “The unnamed street in western Moscow has been named after Vladimir Zhirinovsky,” the Moscow government said in a statement. The street is located near the home of the late politician, the LDPR has said, lauding the decision. “He was often seen there, and many neighbors knew him well, nearby there’s the 814th school, where the home polling station of the founder of the Liberal Democratic Party is located,” the party said in a statement on social media.

There were no other casualties in the attack, they added. The incident occurred amid partial mobilization in Russia, which was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. According to Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, 300,000 reservists are going to be drafted amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. A video has allegedly captured the perpetrator shooting chief enlistment officer Aleksandr Eliseyev from point blank as the victim was delivering a speech before the recruits. The gunman then shouted: “Everybody out,” with all the people who were in the room rushing outside in a panic. “We came to the recruitment center and handed out papers. The chief recruitment officer took us to the conference room and began speaking about the situation in the country. That’s when the gunman jumped up from his seat; after that he shot at the officer,” one of the witnesses recalled, adding that at least two shots were fired. The attack was first confirmed by Irkutsk Region governor Igor Kobzev, who wrote on Telegram that the wounded chief enlistment officer was placed “in intensive care in critical condition. The doctors are now fighting for his life.” The governor said that he was “ashamed that such a thing happens at a time when all of us must stand united” and announced additional security measures in the region. The national guard said that the suspect tried fleeing the scene, but was detained by its troops. A sawed-off gun was seized from him. The man hasn’t been registered as the owner of the weapon, the force added. An investigative committee has described the shooter as a 25-year-old local man, saying that criminal cases on attempted murder of a law enforcement officer and illegal possession of arms have been launched against him.

Moscow’s diplomacy regarding the US is an exercise in “crisis management”, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview on Russian television on Monday. He described US behavior as being “increasingly confrontational and worrisome.” “We can see how [the Americans] are trying to mobilize their satellites, their vassals to confront Russia in a more aggressive and hardline manner,” the diplomat said. “Washington’s irresponsible, extremely aggressive, extremely assertive course is bringing us all to the dangerous line. We are warning against maintaining this course.” The brinkmanship has been evident not only when it comes to the crisis in Ukraine, but also in the all-important issue of nuclear non-proliferation and reduction, Ryabkov said. Washington has pretty much dismantled the entire architecture of strategic arms control and is threatening the last remaining bilateral treaty of that kind with Russia, the New START, he pointed out. The core of the problem, the diplomat said, is that the US “does not need agreements, which had been signed on the basis of parity, served not only the security interest of the group [of nations] led by the US, but strengthened the security of entire regions and the world in general. They are not in line with the hegemonic course that the US pursues in the international arena.” The deputy minister said he didn’t expect US policy towards Russia to change anytime soon, because “there is an anti-Russian consensus of the elites” in the US. But the only viable solution is for Washington to recognize that Russia will not be bullied and act accordingly, Ryabkov added. “Time and time again we’ve told our American interlocutors, to use the most neutral term, that they have to back off and stop escalating the situation,” he said. European nations, which sided with Washington’s anti-Russian drive, are suffering because of it, the Russian diplomat pointed out. In fact, their subservience to Washington makes them vulnerable to American exploitation, Ryabkov said. “[The Americans] are undermining Europe’s competitiveness, pumping their products into European markets, be they military equipment or hydrocarbons, which the Europeans would rather get from alternative sources under different circumstances,” he said. But Washington lacks global support, regardless of what American officials claim Ryabkov said. Dozens of nations representing half of humanity either backed Russia’s position on Ukraine or at least acknowledged the merits of Russia’s reasoning about it, he explained.",3.366095062165076,3.746682004694169,-0.3805869425290931,8

Speaking on tv channel Rossiya 24, Lukashenko said he believes the West’s future lies with Russia, which has “everything they need.” On the other hand, he added, the West has things Russia and Belarus need and are willing to buy, including certain technologies. “What else do they want? They just need to make responsible decisions,” he said said. Putin agreed with the Belarusian leader, insisting the West must “treat us with respect.” “Without that we won’t even talk to them. Nobody is going to tolerate humiliation,” Lukashenko continued, noting that both Moscow and Minsk were open to working with those who want to live side by side, building relations based on mutual respect. The Russian leader has previously suggested that the West was essentially waging a hybrid war against Moscow and was looking to “weaken, disunite and ultimately destroy” Russia. In a televised address last week, Putin claimed that Western countries openly admit that they “managed to break up the Soviet Union in 1991” and were now aiming to “split Russia into many regions that would be at each other’s throats.” As a means to that end, Putin claims the West has been intentionally fostering Russophobic sentiments in countries like Ukraine, where he accuses the US and its allies of installing a hostile government and of turning the Ukrainian people into cannon fodder by pushing them into war with Russia. Putin has also warned Western leaders who openly call for a military defeat of Russia that Moscow is prepared to use any means at its disposal to defend itself and to ensure its territorial integrity.

The member of the Federation Council, Russia’s upper chamber of parliament, said people with exemptions from military service should still be able to leave the country. He also suggested raising the penalties for draft-dodgers. President Vladimir Putin declared a partial mobilisation last Wednesday, calling it a necessary step to support the military operation against Ukraine. According to the Defense Ministry, only military reservists, preferably with combat experience, and not regular conscripts, are being recruited. Tsekov’s proposals have been criticized by fellow lawmakers in both chambers of parliament. Senator Andrey Klishas responded by urging “all colleagues” to pay more attention to providing social benefits to mobilized Russians and ensuring that no violations are made in the process, rather than “pumping up tensions”. Yevgeny Popov, a member of the State Duma, said calls for travel restrictions were “excessive” and “harmful”, since “our people have the right to move around as they please”. He said some Russian regions have already reported mobilizing enough reservists to meet the Defense Ministry’s quota, and the rest of the country will soon catch up.

Prigozhin admitted his connection to the group of Russian private military contractors on Monday in a statement released by the press service of his company. The unit started in 2014 as his personal project to fund a fighting force to intervene in Ukraine’s civil war on the side of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, Prigozhin claimed. He said he was one of several wealthy people in Russia, who were willing to invest their money to “defend Russians” from Kiev, but didn’t trust anyone else to use the resources the way he wanted. “On May 1, 2014, a group of patriots was born, which was later named the Wagner group. Their valor and courage made possible the liberation of Lugansk airport and other territories and played a pivotal role in the fate of the two regions,” he said. Russia has since recognized the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as sovereign states. For years Prigozhin denied any connection with the Wagner group. He said he was trying to shield it from possible repercussions and accused journalists of trying to “find dirt” on members of the organization. Wagner fighters were always on shaky ground and didn’t have many job opportunities in civilian life, the businessman added. An assault team commander would find it hard being hired “by a cranky oligarch, whose wife would make him carry her bags while shopping,” he said. “Those brave fellows knew one thing – fighting to defend those in need, putting their lives on the line on the side of good and justice,” the businessman said. “Live up to the code, do what you must, come what may.” Prigozhin said he believed it was time for the fighters to get recognition for what they did for Russia as well as for people in Syria, other Arab nations, Africa and Latin America. Western officials have described the Wagner group as a tool of Russian foreign policy that gives Moscow plausible deniability. Critics claim that Prigozhin has personal ties to the Kremlin. The businessman owns a catering service that won some government contracts, and earned him the moniker “Putin’s chef” in the Western media. Moscow denied claims that the Wagner group acts on its behalf. Over the years, Wagner fighters have reportedly been involved in operations in Libya, Mali, Congo, Sudan and the Central African Republic, among others. Some of its members were arrested in 2020 in Belarus on their way to the Middle East in what was allegedly a failed plot by Ukrainian intelligence to intercept their plane and capture them.",1.7717890866819168,3.5026059730650974,-1.7308168863831805,6

Kherson has so far demonstrated lower turnout, with nearly 49% of voters showing up for the referendum. Polls across the two regions and in the Donbass republics are set to stay open for the next two days. Ukraine and its Western backers have rejected the referendums on joining Russia as illegal and have vowed to not recognize them regardless of their outcome. Speaking to US broadcaster CBS on Sunday, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky warned that should Russia complete the referendums, it would “make it impossible, in any case, to continue any diplomatic negotiations” with Moscow. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",4.438403495442797,1.7365080807193063,2.7018954147234906,2

According to the ministry, the planes that were intercepted in Ukraine’s southern Nikolaev Region were capable of carrying AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARM) that are used to destroy radar stations on the ground. The ministry reported that 12 Ukrainian drones were shot down, and 21 missiles, mostly from US-supplied HIMARS launchers, were intercepted mid-air. The news comes as Ukraine’s Kherson Region and large parts of neighboring Zaporozhye Region, both controlled by Russian troops, are holding five-day referendums on joining Russia. The Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR), which broke away from Ukraine in the wake of the 2014 coup in Kiev, are also voting on becoming parts of Russia. An RT news team came under fire in the city of Kherson on Sunday when a Ukrainian missile hit a hotel they were staying in.

A former Ukrainian politician and another person were killed in the attack. The missile destroyed the rooms where RT correspondent Murad Gazdiev and cameraman Mikhail Kondakov were sleeping. Both are unharmed. The latter was buried under rubble but was pulled out shortly after the strike. “It’s like I’ve been electrocuted, I’m shaking,” Kondakov said after the rescue, surrounded by debris and pointing to a hole in the wall near where his bed was. “I was sleeping here, and it’s where the [missile] has struck. I don’t know how I survived.” The hotel was heavily damaged, and the roof collapsed. Several vehicles parked outside were also destroyed, including a car used by RT, Gazdiev said. He added that, apart from the four-person RT team, three migration center workers and two hotel staff members were inside the building during the strike. “The [Russian] military left this place yesterday. Maybe the strike was planned to hit them,” Gazdiev said, adding that everyone is afraid of a second strike. Local emergency services said two people were killed. Senior Russian-appointed official Kirill Stremousov confirmed that Aleksey Zhuravko, a former member of Ukraine’s parliament, is one of the victims. Zhuravko had posted a video of himself voting for Kherson Region to join Russia in the ongoing referendum. Kherson officials called the strike “a premeditated terrorist act,” and accused Ukraine of using US-supplied M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launchers to shell the hotel. Ukrainian Major General Vadim Skibitsky told the Daily Telegraph last month that Kiev’s intelligence officials consult with their US counterparts before launching missiles, but denied that the US provides direct targeting information. Kherson Region and large parts of neighboring Zaporozhye Region are holding five-day referendums on joining Russia. The first results are expected to be released by Wednesday. The territories were seized by Russian forces after Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring country on February 24. The Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) are also holding referendums on becoming part of Russia. The republics broke away from Ukraine following the 2014 coup in Kiev.

2022-09-24,https://www.rt.com/news/563474-lavrov-unga-world-order/,"Ukraine, EU’s dictatorship and change of global order: Lavrov speaks at UNGA","Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke at the 77th UN General Assembly on Saturday, explaining Russia’s stance on key international issues, including Moscow’s relationship with the West and the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. After delivering his speech, Lavrov gave a big press conference on the UNGA sidelines. Russia’s security proposals “arrogantly” rejected by the West The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is largely a result of the inability of the collective West to negotiate with Russia and address its security concerns, Lavrov told the UNGA. All the repeated attempts to establish the rules of co-existence made by Moscow have been ignored, he said. “We have repeatedly proposed over the years to agree on the rules for coexistence in Europe based on the principle of equal and indivisible security, approved at the highest level of OSCE documents. We made our last proposal to make this principle legally binding in December 2021, to which we received an arrogant refusal,” Lavrov stated. Ukraine is expendable for the US Ukraine has become a mere tool for Washington to maintain its global dominance and target Russia, the top diplomat believes. “It is evident to any unbiased observer: For the Anglo-Saxons, who have completely subjugated Europe, Ukraine is simply expendable material in the fight against Russia. NATO declared our country a direct threat on the path to total US dominance, and named China as a long-term strategic challenge,” Lavrov told the UNGA. The minister further elaborated on the matter at the press conference after his speech, stating that Moscow already views the US and its NATO bloc as parties to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Recently, Ukrainian military has admitted that the Pentagon chooses its targets, he explained.“What is this if not a direct participation in aiming of deadly weapons and participation in the war?” Lavrov asked. Referendums in breakaway Ukrainian regions are in line with Kiev’s wishes Russia’s top diplomat also touched upon the ongoing referendums in the Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR) People’s Republics, as well as in the Russian-controlled parts of the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions. While the vote has already triggered a “tantrum” in Ukraine and in the West, with the G7 vowing even more anti-Russian sanctions, the referendums are actually fully in line with Kiev’s wishes, Lavrov suggested. The people living there are essentially only reacting to what President Zelensky recommended for them to do in one of his interviews in August 2021. Back then, he advised everyone who feels Russian to ‘go to Russia’ for the benefit of their children and grandchildren. That’s what the residents of said regions are doing now, taking their lands, on which their ancestors lived for centuries, with them. US exceptionalism has reached ‘godlike’ level Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington’s strive for global domination and exceptionalism has reached an unprecedented height, resulting in multiple aggressive wars and claiming lives of “many hundreds of thousands” of people worldwide, Lavrov stated. “Having proclaimed victory in the Cold War, Washington elevated itself almost to the rank of the messenger of God on earth, with no obligations, but only ‘sacred’ rights to act with impunity, as it pleases and anywhere,” Lavrov said. Any nation can fall victim to Washington’s ambitions should it somehow anger the “self-styled masters of the world,” Lavrov warned. That fate has befallen the people of Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and other countries, he added. EU is sliding into a dictatorship The EU, while being “subjugated” by the US, is showing the same symptoms of exceptionalism and arrogance, Lavrov believes. The minister recalled fresh remarks by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who threatened Italy with consequences should right-wing candidates sweep to power, as indicated by polls, in Sunday’s election.“This is arrogance, sense of impunity, exceptionalism. Only they have the right to make judgments. What Mrs. von der Leyen said about the Italian elections was astounding,” Lavrov told reporters, adding that he did not recall such threats made by an EU leader before. “The European Union, in principle, is becoming an authoritarian, rigid, dictatorial entity,” the top diplomat said. End of unipolar world is coming Despite all the effort made by the US, its era of dominance is ending and the unipolar world is crumbling, Lavrov said. He added that the future of the world order is being decided now. The question is whether said order will be with “one hegemon, forcing everyone to live according to its notorious ‘rules’ that are beneficial only to itself,” or will be a truly “democratic, just world without blackmail and intimidation of objectionable people, without neo-Nazism and neo-colonialism,” the diplomat said, adding that Moscow firmly stands by the second option. “However, objective geopolitical processes are seen by Washington and the ruling elites of Western countries, completely submitted to [the US], as a threat to their dominant position,” Lavrov stated.",3.357555850918001,2.5726438389413286,0.7849120119766724,8

Saturday's move follows the partial mobilization of military reservists to serve in Ukraine. According to a presidential decree published on the Kremlin’s website, the decision concerns students who are enrolled at state-accredited vocational or higher-education institutions. It covers only those attending state educational institutions and research organizations for whom this is “the first such education.” “This Decree comes into force from the date of its signing and applies to legal relations that arose from September 21, 2022,” the document reads, referring to the date when the partial mobilization was announced. Earlier on Saturday, meanwhile, Putin signed new legislation amending Russia’s Criminal Code. Service members who “voluntarily surrender” to enemy forces during an armed conflict will face up to ten years behind bars upon returning home. First-time offenders, however, are allowed to avoid punishment if they flee from captivity and return to their unit. Other provisions of the new law include up to ten years in prison for service members who refuse to take part in armed hostilities, as well as for those who desert or dodge being drafted. Looting during wartime or a military operation carries a prison term of as long as 15 years.

However, Lavrov added that Russia is now shaping “the future of the world order.” “The US and its allies want to stop the march of history,” Lavrov declared from the podium in New York, describing how in the aftermath of the Cold War, Washington appointed itself “almost an envoy of God on earth,” launching foreign conflicts at will and expanding the NATO alliance deeper into Eastern Europe. The shifting of NATO’s borders to the east and its official declaration of interest in the Indo-Pacific region mean that the US-led bloc “now has the goal of subjugating the Asian area,” Lavrov stated. However, it was the West’s refusal to negotiate over Ukraine that led Russia to fight back, he continued. “The West watched in silence as the coup plotters started bombing the east of Ukraine,” he said, referring to Kiev’s attacks on the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics even after the Minsk agreements had been signed in 2014 and 2015. Were we supposed to put up with Kiev’s attempt to ban the Russian language, education, Russian media and culture? The demands of chasing Russians out of Crimea? The declaration of war against the Donbass, the population of which was declared not human beings, but ‘creatures’ by both the former and the current Kiev’s authorities? Once the US and NATO rejected a Russian-proposed security deal for Ukraine, Moscow had “no choice but to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and start a special military operation,” Lavrov said, adding that “any sovereign self-respecting state would do the same, a state that understands its responsibility to its own people.” Seven months into that operation, and with Russia recently announcing the mobilization of some 300,000 additional troops, Lavrov told the assembly that “the future of the world order is being decided,” with the US-led “unipolar” model “receding into the past.”",3.5250204639957503,1.9983084229089667,1.5267120410867836,8

However, the law allows first-time offenders to avoid punishment if they flee from captivity and return to their unit. Putin also approved several other amendments to existing laws.

2022-09-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/563462-foreign-fighters-ukraine-killed/,Hundreds of foreign fighters killed in Ukraine – Russia,"Up to 300 foreigners fighting for Kiev against Moscow have been killed in Nikolayev Region in southern Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Saturday. “Up to 300 militants were eliminated by a missile attack on the point of temporary deployment of foreign mercenaries in the area of the village of Kalinovka, Nikolayev Region,” the ministry’s spokesman, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, announced during his daily briefing. A large number of foreign combatants have reportedly lost their lives fighting for Ukraine. Earlier this week, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed that Russian forces and the militias of the Donbass republics had eliminated more than 2,000 foreign mercenaries. As of September 21, 1,000 foreigners remained in the ranks of the Ukrainian military, according to the minister, whereas in April the number was estimated at 3,000. Saturday's strike would leave only 700, by those calculations. Russian forces also killed more than 200 Ukrainian troops in Nikolayev Region, and almost as many more in Kharkov Region and in the Donetsk People’s Republic, Konashenkov further announced. The military spokesman also revealed during the briefing that in the vicinity of the village of Sergeyevka, in southeastern Dnepropetrovsk Region, a Russian fighter shot down a Ukrainian MiG-29 that had been “converted to use American HARM anti-radar missiles.” Since the launch of the Russian military operation in Ukraine in late February, Moscow has been warning Western countries to stop “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons, arguing that it would only prolong the conflict. However, in the wake of Russia’s recent announcement of a partial mobilization of reservists, Kiev’s supporters, including the US and UK, have pledged to sustain or increase their military assistance to Ukraine. On Friday, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky admitted that his country’s forces have been suffering at least 50 casualties a day. He claimed, however, that the Russian side was losing several times more. Zelensky’s comments came soon after Shoigu’s announcement that Russia’s forces have lost 5,937 troops since the beginning of the military offensive.

2022-09-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/563463-russia-mir-ukraine-hackers/,Russian payment system hit by Ukrainian hackers – media,"Ukrainian hackers are conducting cyberattacks on Russia’s interbank payment system, threatening to hinder its operations and undermine clients’ trust in the banks, Kommersant reported on Friday, citing sources. According to the Russian outlet, Ukrainian ‘hacktivists’ are carrying out DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks on the Mir payment system and its operator, National Payment Card System, coordinating their activities via pro-Ukraine chats. A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to overwhelm the target with a flood of internet traffic from multiple sources. The attacks are reportedly conducted by generating traffic with the help of browsers or ‘primitive DDoS instruments’ to overload the system. Although Russian officials have declined to comment on the alleged attacks, some experts say it’s possible that the payment system could eventually be compromised, noting that these types of attacks have been going on since the beginning of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. “Under the current conditions, we can expect the culprits to achieve some success in their DDoS attacks on the Mir payment system, the risks are more than real,” one Kommersant source said, adding that a complete failure in the ‘card acquiring’ process, which could last up to several hours, is possible. According Dmitry Vishnyakov, an independent card expert, the uninterrupted processing of transactions is critical to the system’s operations. “If processing is suspended even for one or two hours, this may undermine confidence in the banks,” he told Kommersant. Mir cards work as Russia’s alternative to Visa and Mastercard, which suspended operations in the country after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. Mir cards can also be used abroad. Several banks in Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Vietnam have signaled that they will no longer accept Mir cards. Experts say it is due to fears over Western sanctions. According to research conducted by StormWall in August, the number of cyberattacks on Russian payment systems has skyrocketed, growing by 126% from the same period one year earlier.",3.4906852591204616,2.5380779960435036,0.952607263076958,3

2022-09-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/563459-borrell-putin-not-bluffing/,Putin isn’t bluffing about nuclear weapons – EU,"EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell told the BBC on Saturday that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin could use nuclear weapons if Moscow’s forces are “pushed into a corner.” Borrell called for a peace deal, but his suggested agreement is likely a non-starter. The conflict in Ukraine has reached a “dangerous moment,” the diplomat told the British broadcaster. “It's a dangerous moment because the Russian army has been pushed into a corner, and Putin's reaction – threatening using nuclear arms – it's very bad.” Borrell’s claim that the Russian military has been cornered is likely based on the fact that Ukraine managed to capture a large swath of land in the region of Kharkov earlier this month. However, Ukraine’s numerically superior force still took high casualties against a comparatively small contingent of Russian and allied forces, who withdrew without suffering heavy losses, according to Moscow. In the wake of the Ukrainian offensive, Putin on Wednesday announced a partial mobilization of some 300,000 troops, a number Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said amounts to 1% of the country’s full mobilization potential. Putin also warned that Russia would defend its territory – potentially including the Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, as well as the regions of Zaporozhye and Kherson after referendums this week – with “all the means available to us,” including “various weapons of destruction.” “I’m not bluffing,” the Russian leader added. ""When people say it is not a bluff, you have to take them seriously,"" Borrell told the BBC. The EU diplomat, who previously insisted that “this war will be won on the battlefield,” went on to say that a “diplomatic solution” must be reached, but one that “preserves the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.” Aside from the fact that four former regions of Ukraine will in all likelihood vote to join Russia in a matter of days, Borrell’s definition of Ukraine’s territorial integrity likely aligns with that of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who has vowed to seize the two Donbass republics – which declared independence from Ukraine in 2014 – and Crimea, which voted to rejoin Russia that same year. Long before the four referendums were announced, Zelensky rejected the idea of abandoning his claims over Donbass and Crimea to secure peace with Russia.",2.160623408438332,2.790612522833943,-0.6299891143956113,2

Speaking to the Russian media outlet RIA Novosti on Saturday, a representative of the country’s Foreign Ministry said: “We have already got used to Borrell’s unprofessional and confrontational statements that have nothing to do with diplomacy.” The official added that the sheer idea of establishing “some tribunal ‘to hold Russians accountable’ is fundamentally prejudiced in its very wording and has nothing to do with real justice.” The Foreign Ministry pointed out that “no one gave [Borrell] the right to decide who is guilty.” It also went on to argue that Brussels’ silence on the shelling of Donetsk on September 19, which killed 16 civilians, including two children, was further proof that the EU has given up any pretense of objectivity by now. “Civilian cities of Donbass continue to come under bombardment, there is no end in sight. And Borrell is not condemning these egregious acts, and not calling for an investigation and punishment for those responsible,” the Foreign Ministry representative lamented. Speaking to the media outlet Politico earlier this week, Borrell said that Brussels is open to the idea of a special tribunal for certain Russian citizens. “We’re very much in favor of making the Russians accountable for what they have done,” the diplomat stated.

Supplying weapons to Moscow “directly contradicts the position of neutrality, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, publicly declared by the top leadership of Iran,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement, further calling it “an unfriendly act that deals a serious blow to Ukraine-Iran relations.” The decision to revoke the accreditation and expel a yet-unspecified number of diplomats was delivered to the Iranian charge d’affaires on Friday evening. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defense ministry claimed to have destroyed six “Russian kamikaze drones provided by Iran.” According to photos and videos circulating on social media, Russian forces operating in Ukraine have been using a kamikaze drone marked Geran-2 (Geranium), which resembles the Iranian-made Shahed-136. An unverified video from Odessa on Friday showed Ukrainian troops extracting another type of drone from the waters of the Black Sea. The drone reportedly looks like the observation platform Mohajer-6. The US first accused Iran of selling attack drones to Russia in July, which Tehran has denied. At the end of August, the Kremlin called US media reports about drone transfers “information stuffing,” but said relations with Iran were “developing dynamically” and would continue to do so. In addition to missiles and artillery, Washington has provided Ukraine with hundreds of Switchblade tactical kamikaze drones, as well as the model dubbed Phoenix Ghost, supposedly custom-developed to Kiev’s specifications on short notice. Kiev has also purchased multiple strike drones from the Turkish company Baykar Makina. Ukraine is also seeking to build its own factory to produce the Bayraktar and Akinci UAV.

Zelensky then claimed that West Jerusalem is under Russian influence. ""I am shocked,” Zelensky told a group of reporters from numerous French media outlets. “I don't understand. Israel has provided us with nothing, nothing, zero,"" he continued. ""I understand that they have to defend their land but I have received information that Israel is exporting its armaments to other countries."" Zelensky was likely referring to Israel’s sale of its ‘Iron Dome’ missile defense system to Cyprus, which was reported last month but not confirmed by the Israeli government. Last year, Israel’s defense exports totaled a record $11.3 billion, with 41% of its customers located in Europe. While Israel condemned Russia’s military operation in Ukraine and abided by US sanctions on Moscow, it has not imposed sanctions of its own on Russia, and has refrained from donating weapons to Kiev. Instead, West Jerusalem has sent protective equipment such as body armor and helmets, as well as humanitarian aid. This has not pleased Zelensky, who declared in April that he wished Ukraine to become a “big Israel,” in which citizens are armed and ready for military service at all times. “There were discussions with the leaders of Israel and this did not help Ukraine,” Zelensky told the French reporters. ""Why not give us anti-aircraft defenses?” he asked, claiming that “one can notice the influence of Russia on Israel.” There is no evidence that Moscow has worked to influence Israeli policy on arming Ukraine. However, maintaining diplomatic contact with Russia is in Israel’s interest, considering Russia has a military presence in Syria, and Israeli jets often conduct cross-border airstrikes there. Additionally, Russia and Israel share close cultural ties, given that around 15% of Israel’s population is of Russian descent, and Russia is home to the world’s seventh-largest Jewish population. However, West Jerusalem and Moscow have quarreled over Russia’s decision to close a branch of the Jewish Agency earlier this summer.

At the same time, Ryabkov said, Russia was warning the West that there are “risks” to its interference in Ukraine and it “strongly urges” the US “to avoid a situation that could lead to a direct military clash with Russia.” Ryabkov also accused Washington of deliberately “lowering the nuclear threshold,” and of “implementing a destabilizing program to modernize its nuclear potential.” Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the country’s ground units equipped with intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as vessels from the Northern and Pacific Fleets, on high combat alert. He linked the decision to the “illegitimate sanctions” on Moscow and “aggressive statements” by US and EU officials. In turn, the White House accused Putin of “manufacturing threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression.” On Wednesday, Putin announced the partial mobilization of reservists and claimed the country is now fighting “the entire Western military machine” in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden condemned the Russian leader’s remarks. In a UN General Assembly address – which was quickly rewritten after Putin’s speech, according to Politico – the American leader accused his Russian counterpart of “making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear weapons.”",1.5994618608471094,3.028723506895355,-1.4292616460482455,8
2022-09-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/563414-un-ukraine-war-crimes-accusations/,Russia accused of war crimes in Ukraine,"Ukraine called for a special tribunal to judge the Russian military and civilian leadership on Friday, after a report by a UN group accused Moscow of war crimes. The “Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine” was dispatched by the UN Human Rights Council after it suspended Russia’s membership, and while it worked closely with the government in Kiev, it had no contact with Moscow. The three-member commission was led by Eric Mose, a Norwegian jurist who previously served on the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and presided over the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Mose told the Council that the commission visited “27 towns and settlements,” inspected “sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture,” and “interviewed more than 150 victims and witnesses.” After meetings with the Ukrainian government, “international organizations, civil society and other relevant stakeholders,” it concluded that “war crimes have been committed by the Russian Federation in Ukraine,” according to the minutes of the Council meeting. Mose accused some Russian soldiers of “sexual and gender-based violence crimes” and said the witnesses they interviewed “provided consistent accounts of ill-treatment and torture carried out during unlawful confinement.” While “attempts to engage in a constructive dialogue with Russian Federation authorities had, regretfully, so far not been successful,” Mose described the cooperation with Ukrainian authorities as “very satisfactory” while fellow commission member Pablo de Greiff called it “indispensable.” De Greiff is a Colombian jurist who currently runs the Transitional Justice Program at the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at the New York University School of Law. The commission report also condemned alleged Russian “attacks with cluster munitions or multi-launch rocket systems and airstrikes in populated areas.” The Ukrainian shelling of Donbass civilians, often using cluster munitions and landmines, went unmentioned. While not quantifying the alleged instances of Russian war crimes, Mose mentioned just “two incidents of ill-treatment against Russian Federation soldiers by Ukrainian forces” and described them as “few in numbers.” There was no representative of Russia at the meeting, since it was suspended from the Human Rights Council in April, at the insistence of the US. Ukraine’s representative, however, referred to the commission’s report to call for a Special Tribunal that would have jurisdiction over “aggression against Ukraine” and prosecute the senior political and military leadership of Russia. Moscow has denied that its military was complicit in any crimes and has provided evidence to the UN of Kiev targeting and torturing civilians on a regular basis.",2.650334827287851,3.039984090950085,-0.38964926366223374,5
2022-09-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/563415-zelensky-ukrainian-army-losses/,Zelensky issues Ukrainian estimates on daily army losses,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has said that his forces have been suffering at least 50 casualties a day during the ongoing military conflict with Russia. He claimed, however, that the Russian side was losing several times more. Speaking to French news outlets as part of the ‘Face a Zelensky’ program, the Ukrainian leader said that Kiev has estimates of daily casualties being suffered by the Ukrainian army amid the ongoing conflict with Moscow, but noted that these numbers were not entirely accurate. “It’s about 50 people a day. But these are not exact numbers, because we don’t know how many soldiers or civilians remain in [Russian-controlled] territories,” said Zelensky. He then claimed that there have been “five times less” Ukrainian military casualties than Russian ones. He further elaborated that the position of the Ukrainian military was not to name the exact number of dead or wounded Ukrainian servicemen, noting that “we have to be careful with the numbers, because we are talking about human lives.” Zelensky’s statement comes after the Russian Defense Ministry announced on Wednesday that Russia’s forces have lost nearly 6,000 troops since Moscow launched its military offensive in Ukraine. Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed, however, that losses on the Ukrainian side were ten times higher, at an estimated 61,000 soldiers dead and over 49,000 wounded. “Initially, the Armed Forces of Ukraine amounted to between 201,000 and 202,000 people, and since then they have suffered losses of around 100,000,” the minister said. Shoigu added that Russian forces and the militias of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics have also reportedly eliminated over 2,000 “mercenaries” fighting for Kiev, leaving just over 1,000 foreigners still in the ranks of the Ukrainian military.",3.2664525064564587,1.3832322178632743,1.8832202885931844,2
2022-09-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/563216-future-victims-of-ukrainian-justice/,Vladislav Ugolny: Ukraine is targeting civilians for retribution in the east while its Western backers turn a blind eye,"The Ukrainian offensive in Kharkov Region, launched earlier this month, led to Russia's armed forces losing control of a number of settlements. These include the towns of Balakleya, Izium, Kupiansk, Volchansk and a number of villages and small locales. Nevertheless, the Russian army, by concentrating on rearguard battles, was able to avoid significant losses and managed to retreat to the left bank of the Oskol River to regroup. However, the primary victims of this turn of events were the inhabitants of the aforementioned areas who are now in the hands of Ukraine. There is no exact information about the population of this region. The last census was conducted by Kiev more than 20 years ago, and the country's statistics are known to be wildly inaccurate. At the outset, we can estimate the pre-war population at 200,000 people. After the outbreak of hostilities, some were forced to flee. The number of refugees depended on the intensity of the fighting. For example, in the Russia-border town of Volchansk, people continued to live normally – they had not heard firing in the city since March – and there has always been humanitarian aid. However, the frontline villages south of Izium were virtually wiped off the face of the earth. In any case, we are talking about tens of thousands of people. Most likely, at least 100,000 people lived in the Russian-controlled territories. Some of them remain under the protection of the Russian army, which controls the left bank of the Oskol, and villages such as Kupiansk-Uzlovoi and Borovaya, which have now become the sites of intense hostilities. After the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive, some Kharkov Region residents were forced to leave their homes. An evacuation was carried out in Volchansk, Veliky Burluk, Kupiansk and Izium. Various estimates suggest that between 5,000 and 25,000 people have fled to Russia in September alone. According to Readovka journalists, Voronezh Region accommodated about a thousand refugees. Another small number left Kharkov and headed to the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, in particular to the nearest district center of Svatovo. In any case, most local residents have remained in situ. Based on the communication with residents of small Donbass front-line towns that have been shelled for eight years, it is safe to say that such a decision is not politically motivated. Residents of such areas, many of whom are older people, those with disabilities, families with household plots or low-mobility relatives who require care, usually cling to their land, homes and traditional way of life to the end. They are the ones who have not evacuated their homes in recent months, and it is they who are now under threat. A number of channels have appeared in the Telegram messenger app, one of the leading social media platforms for both sides of the conflict, which publish the personal data of so-called “collaborators.” The basis for accusations could be anything, including communicating with the Russian military or receiving humanitarian aid. Some of these channels are currently blocked, after a wave of complaints to Telegram’s technical support. Despite this, some remain operational and many dehumanize Russia’s supporters as ""zhduny(rus) - waiters."" According to the public consensus in Ukraine, such people who sympathize with Moscow are the cause of the conflict. In the eyes of Ukrainian radicals, anyone who expresses a positive attitude towards Russia is a threat to national security. Thus, personal data in the early days of the offensive was published for one purpose: to point out enemies so that they would be killed during the “sweep” – a set of actions aimed at establishing control over occupied territory undertaken by the army, mercenaries and nationalist battalions. ‘Mopping-up’ is outside the criminal procedure code and is not regulated by any laws. Law may come to the territory later but, in the very first days, “revolutionary justice” is carried out, without lawyers and with the functions of judge, prosecutor and executioner performed by Ukrainian combatants. To help their murderous cause, similar channels are being created that publish personal data with calls for lynching. After the ‘cleansing’ is completed, elements of the Ukrainian legal system will come to the captured cities. They will focus on the concealment of war crimes committed during the 'clean-up', and instead point the finger at Russia. The last two tasks will be carried out simultaneously, such as in Bucha, and those killed by Ukrainians will be cynically presented as victims of the Russian army. According to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), as of last week 16 people suspected of collaborating with Russian authorities had already been detained. The security agents are first and foremost interested in tax officials responsible for the functioning of local businesses during Moscow's control of the territory. However, local teachers who switched to teaching the Russian curriculum are also at risk. Despite international humanitarian law, which obliges the party in control of a territory to preserve the educational process and emphasizes that no harm be done to educators, Kiev seems determined to punish teachers, to use them as an example to others. Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Irina Vereshchuk says that these teachers committed crimes and should be punished for high treason. Such measures by the Ukrainian government are aimed primarily at intimidating educators in Russian-controlled territory. By showing a willingness to prosecute civilian workers, Kiev is raising the stakes. Ukrainian law enforcement is also known to detain forestry workers, for having helped the Russian army to collect firewood. The details are unknown: whether they supplied the Russians with firewood on a commercial basis, felled the forests entrusted to them, or simply told the soldiers where to chop, remains unknown. Any civilian living in Russian-controlled territory could be charged with collaboration. Ukraine has a special ministry for the reintegration of “temporarily occupied territories,” which since 2016 has been developing a policy of “filtering” the civilian population. Initially, its activity was concentrated around Donbass and Crimea but its scope has now expanded. The most striking example is the law 'On the State Policy of the Transitional Period', which has been criticized by, among others, the Venice Commission [on constitutional law] for the fact that Ukrainian state policy in the territories it occupies is aimed at investigating only the alleged war crimes of the opposite side, ignoring the goal of establishing the truth about all crimes. This law also introduced differentiated treatment of citizens, depending on their level of interaction with Russia and/or the Donbass republics. The topic of differentiating guilt – and, according to Ukraine, the entire civilian population is guilty to a greater or lesser degree – was then promoted by all sorts of non-profit organizations. So the Crimean Tatar Resource Center engaged with the Soros Foundation's 'Vozrozhdeniye' and the extremist organization ‘Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people,’ who claim to be the exiled Ukrainian government of Crimea, developed a whole methodology for evaluating the degree of collaboration. For a demonstration of this scale, Ukrainians cited three respective examples: a doctor at a Crimean city hospital, an acting city council deputy and the ex-chief prosecutor of Crimea, Natalya Poklonskaya. According to the methodology, the doctor scores 17 points, the deputy 30, and Poklonskaya 86. Thus, any Crimean doctor is already guilty of collaborationism, having 17 points. Since 2014, Ukrainian society, represented by non-profit organizations, has debated the doctor's degree of guilt and the punishment which ought be meted out. We see the results of such discussions in Kharkov Region. In addition to fighting teachers and foresters, Ukrainian law enforcement and the media are also busy falsifying war crimes. They open the so-called “cellars” – illegal prisons and torture chambers, in which alleged prisoners of war and civilians were kept. The process of falsification relies on vivid shots – frames with a prayer scratched on the wall of one of the basements. Another fabrication involved seven Sri Lankan students attending the Kupiansky Medical College, which was allegedly held by Russian military personnel since March, who testified about torture by the Russians. The official position is simple: angry Russians simply detained and tortured foreigners. That the Russian army in fact evacuated them from Mariupol and Kherson is ignored. For the time being, Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is asking Kiev to provide more information about its citizens. A fair investigation, however, should not be expected until those Sri Lankans find themselves outside the hands of the Ukrainian state. Speaking of Kiev’s hand, another media symbol of the “genocide of the Ukrainian people” was presented as the hand of a deceased man with rubber bracelets in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. This was apparent evidence of a hate crime: a man killed for wearing Ukrainian symbols. As it turned out, the body was that of Sergey Sova, a member of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade, who was killed during fighting near Izium. In general, the only mass graves that Ukrainian propaganda now clings to are the cemeteries organized by Russians, where the victims of the military conflict were buried, including Ukrainian soldiers. There is an inscription on one of the crosses, in particular, “APU [Ukrainian Armed Forces] 17 people, Izium, from the morgue.” Ukrainians claim that there are 440 bodies there. Some of the crosses have memorial plaques, some only an inventory number. The bodies were buried by the Russian army in accordance with the traditions of the region. Perhaps, of course, among those buried under the cross are Muslims, Jews, or adherents to pagan beliefs popular among Ukrainian neo-Nazi battalions, but the Russians did everything possible on their part to ensure the remains of the enemy were not desecrated. In normal circumstances, these bodies would have been given to the Ukrainian side in return for the bodies of dead Russian soldiers, but Ukraine boycotted these exchanges due to an unwillingness to admit significant losses. In particular, the son of the aforementioned Sergey Sova learned a few months later about the fate of his father and through the media requested the body be transferred back home for a proper burial. Prior to that, Sova had most likely been listed as missing, a ploy that suppresses official numbers of dead Ukrainian soldiers and avoids compensation payments to their families. Now, however, the Ukrainian soldiers killed in battle and buried in accordance with the dominant religious traditions in Ukraine will be counted as victims of an “alleged genocide.” After a while, when it is impossible to distinguish whether people were killed in early September or mid-September, they will be presented as victims of the retreating Russian army. All of this is a sinister and cynical story, the truth of which we can learn only after the return of the Russian army to Kharkov. Only then will the massive machine of lies, propaganda and disinformation, which is the work of the Ukrainian government in the occupied territories, be broken, and the world will be able to learn about the real war criminals. As when we discovered after the liberation of Mariupol and the establishment of control over the buildings of Mariupol Airport, that the Ukrainian Security Service and Azov turned it into a concentration camp, known as 'The Library.'",3.1426296903319484,2.556449418326327,0.5861802720056213,6

Voting in the two Donbass republics as well as the two southern Ukrainian Regions started on Friday. Responding to a media query on whether the areas would be treated as Russian land, Peskov replied: “Definitely.” He also said that the country’s constitution would come into force in these territories as soon as they joined. Russia’s former president and the deputy head of the nation’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, warned that Russia would not hesitate to use “all means available” to defend its territory. “An encroachment on Russian territory is a crime,” Medvedev said earlier this week. He also stated that Donbass joining Russia would make the “geopolitical transformation [of] the world irreversible.” The US, as well as its allies in Europe and elsewhere – including Germany – have already stated they would not recognize the results of the referenda that kicked off on Friday. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also branded the polls “sham referendums” on Twitter. The voting is scheduled to be held between September 23 and 27. Washington has also recently pledged more aid to Kiev to “strengthen” Ukraine. The developments come as Russia has announced partial mobilization. On Wednesday, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu stated that the mobilization would involve calling to arms some 300,000 reservists, or just over 1% of Russia’s full mobilization potential. The minister explained that additional troops were required to control the 1,000km-long contact line with Ukrainian forces and Russian-held areas. In February 2022, Russia recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",3.8229871822044936,1.6183506306899935,2.2046365515145,2

The patient was identified as a man who had just returned to Russia after a trip to several European countries. The first monkeypox infection was reported in mid-July in a patient who had returned to St. Petersburg from Portugal. World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said earlier this month that the UN health body had received reports about over 50,000 confirmed monkeypox cases and 16 deaths this year. The number eclipsed the total number of infections since the disease was first identified in the late 1950s, he added. Most of the affected people were men who engaged in sex with other men, with about 40% of the cases being men who have HIV, according to WHO figures. Ghebreyesus said he was hopeful that monkeypox could be eliminated in countries where it is not endemic to animals, with available public health measures.",3.101744775305859,2.883314785467369,0.21842998983849027,7

He also pointed out that Kiev backed out of talks some months ago. Speaking to reporters, Peskov was asked whether Moscow believes that engagement is warranted under the current conditions. President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman signaled that dialogue is “of course needed.” “And it is needed to achieve our goals. But, as we have already said, we do not see any prerequisites for the negotiation process,” he stated. Peskov went on to say that Russian President Vladimir Putin has already explained that “Ukraine left the negotiations several months ago.” The Russian leader, he added, also offered the reminder that various Kiev officials had signaled that they “intend to solve their problems on the battlefield.” “You know very well how our president reacted to this,” he said. On Wednesday, Putin announced a partial mobilization in which 300,000 reservists will be called up to take part in the conflict with Ukraine. The move came a day after the two Donbass republics and the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions decided to hold referendums over September 23-27 on whether to unite with Russia. Russia has repeatedly said that it is ready to talk with Ukraine, but insisted that it isn’t interested in “a meeting for the sake of the meeting.” Moreover, earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that Moscow had never dismissed the idea of peace talks, warning, however, that “the longer this process is delayed, the harder it will be to reach an agreement.” Meanwhile, in late July Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said Kiev refused to negotiate with Moscow, claiming that Russia would not stop until it gets “smashed.” The last time Russia and Ukraine sat down at the negotiating table was in late March. At that time, the two parties were discussing a draft peace agreement that would have made Ukraine a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees given by major world powers. Later, however, Kiev ended the talks after accusing Russian troops of having committed war crimes, an allegation that Moscow has vehemently denied.",1.9935635594300543,2.7673925129326826,-0.7738289535026284,8

He has already arrived in Donbass. “I’m neither a military professional, nor a specialist. But I can’t stand aside from those who are the best among our people, who are vanquishing the villainous enemy on the battlefield,” Milonov said on Friday. The 48-year-old politician is a member of the State Duma, the lower house of the country’s parliament. Milonov described the conflict as “the war waged against us by the entire West – against our future, our children.” “If we don’t defend our honor, freedom and dignity, the West [will make us] their servants, just like Hitler had planned,” Milonov added. The MP’s spokesperson told the TV channel Zvezda that he is already in Donbass. On Thursday, the legislator posted a video of himself firing an artillery gun from an undisclosed location. He had previously delivered humanitarian aid in the Donbass republics. Milonov is known for his hardline conservative and anti-gay views. He was one of the main proponents of the 2013 law that banned “propaganda among minors of untraditional sexual relations.” Andrey Turchak, the head of the General Council of the ruling United Russia party, confirmed that Milonov is among the four MPs who formally requested to be sent to the battlefield. The other three are Dmitry Khubezov, Sergey Sokol, and Dmitry Sablin, all in their early 50s. The requests will be processed by the Defense Ministry, Turchak said. The move comes after President Vladimir Putin initiated the partial call-up of reservists on Wednesday. According to the Defense Ministry, reservists up to 55 years of age could be called up, depending on their military rank. Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said that 300,000 will be drafted. The mobilization was ordered two days before the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) kicked off a five-day referendum on joining Russia. Both republics broke away from Ukraine shortly after the 2014 coup in Kiev. Moscow recognized them as independent states in February.

2022-09-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/563180-kiev-shelling-donbass-civilians/,Western media continues to ignore how Ukraine is using NATO weapons to kill innocent civilians in the Donbass,"On Monday, Ukraine slaughtered 16 civilians, including two children, with 155mm NATO shells, according to the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin. The projectiles hit two adjacent neighborhoods, decimating residential and commercial areas – including a market that had previously suffered fatal attacks. Scenes of death are nothing new for residents and reporters here in Donetsk, which is intermittently the target of Ukrainian attacks, like the one that hit its central region on August 4, killing six people, including an 11-year-old ballerina, her grandmother, and her ballet teacher. But the carnage on Monday was worse than anything I’ve seen in my months of reporting here. Chunks of flesh littered the street – part of a hand, a foot, an ear. Someone had put a dead man’s phone on his stomach. It was ringing, the cheery ringtone incongruous with his lifeless body and the scenes and stench of death around him. Bodies were strewn around on the ground where the munition struck, another inside a shop.A sight I will never forget: an older woman's body, only the upper half...This is pure Ukrainian terrorism. No where is safe in Donetsk. For most people, the concept of war is a distant one, and deaths are normalized by media reporting the numbers of victims and destroyed buildings – so most who hear of civilians being killed don’t really understand what a scene like this looks or smells like. For the locals, it is also normalized, in its own way, after over eight years of Ukrainian attacks – a tragically grotesque kind of normality, where the post-bombing routine starts soon after the last explosions die down. When I arrived at the scene, locals were already sweeping up glass shards and boarding windows, preparing to reopen their shops. Inspectors from the Russian Investigative Committee were on site collecting shrapnel and measuring the shell’s impact point, to determine the nature of the armament. When asked about what happened, they were careful to state that they could not say anything until the conclusion of their investigation. An emergency vehicle arrived and workers began loading the bodies, or body parts, onto stretchers, clearing them away. About 100 meters away, there was a gaping hole in the side of an apartment building. The shell had struck right where writing on the wall indicated the direction to the nearest basement, which was to be used as a bomb shelter. Doors to such stairways are generally permanently left open, so that anyone caught up in shelling might have a chance to survive, if they can make it to the door and basement in time. Victims of another Ukrainian assault, which took place on Saturday, didn’t have that option. The center of Donetsk was hit by around ten bombs over the course of 30 minutes around noon. At least four civilians were killed, one of whom I saw still on the ground. Some minutes later, her body was taken away. One of the shells hit a car driving along Artema Street, setting it ablaze and killing two civilians. By the time I reached that site, the vehicle had burned out, the dead taken away. Workers were already repaving the roads, sweeping debris and glass from sidewalks. From earlier today, upon arriving back in Donetsk which was being bombed by Ukraine. ""According to the JCCC, this time AFU fired 13 shells of 155 mm caliber at the center of Donetsk.""https://t.co/jBgh9oNLBWhttps://t.co/c2ik3Oa0Sd On Thursday, again around noon, Ukraine again shelled central Donetsk, this time next to a busy market. The shelling left six people dead on the street and in a burned out bus. When Russian and Donbass voices state that Ukraine is killing Donbass civilians with Western weapons, the reply is silence, derision, or inversion of reality: claims that Russia is bombing Donbass – which any ordinary resident here would disprove easily, having been under Ukraine’s shelling for over eight years. ""...Fragments of NATO-style weapons, French, American, Spanish, etc. are found at shelling sites. However, the ""civilized"" world is not interested in where & how their military assistance to Ukraine is used.We call on the West to pay attention to this!""#StopKillingDonbass War correspondent, Christelle Neant, wrote of Saturday’s bombings: “After submitting the photos of the shrapnel I found on the spot to Adrien Bocquet, who is now a NATO weapons expert for the DPR’s representation in the JCCC (Joint Monitoring and Co-ordination Center on Ukraine’s War Crimes), he confirmed that they were American 155mm shells, some fired from Caesar guns and others from TRF1 guns. The famous TRF1 guns that can fire (banned) 155mm cluster munitions, which I had mentioned in June, and which the Western press had assured that France had not supplied to Ukraine! Before learning at the beginning of September that Paris had indeed sold them to Kiev!” Europeans in Germany, France and Italy recently held “#StopKillingDonbass” actions, denouncing the sale of Western weapons to Ukraine, and calling for it to end. It was rather fitting that the actions occurred the day after Ukraine bombed central Donetsk again. Necessary initiative:""Actions for stopping the supply of weapons to Ukraine by the West have already taken place in Germany & Italy. The event is currently starting in France & we are expecting another action from Italy.""#StopKillingDonbasspic.twitter.com/TMUgBkcKC4 These actions were followed by the release of a petition against arms supplies to Ukraine, which stated: “Today, contrary to the fundamental principles set forth in Article 2 of the UN Charter, in particular, the principles of sovereign equality and the peaceful settlement of international disputes, our countries supply Ukraine with weapons that cause massive deaths and injuries of civilians in Donbass, including children.” It concludes: “We demand an end to the financing of state terrorism and genocide against the people of Donbass, as well as the ongoing violations of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and other acts of international humanitarian law since 2014.” At this point, there is no safe region in Donetsk, nowhere is off-limits for Ukraine’s bombings, not maternity hospitals, nor busy markets.

Melitopol is located in Zaporozhye Region, large chunks of which are held by Russian forces. A senior Russian-appointed official, Vladimir Rogov, said the culprits threw an explosive device out of a moving vehicle. The blast, which occurred around 7am local time, damaged a house. Rogov blamed Ukraine for the “terrorist act.” The incident took place as parts of Zaporozhye Region and neighboring Kherson Region are holding a five-day referendum on seceding from Ukraine and officially joining Russia. Russian troops seized these lands after Moscow launched its military operation in the neighboring country in February. The Donetsk and Lugansk Peoples’ Republics (DPR and LPR) are simultaneously holding their own referendums on becoming parts of Russia. Rogov previously said that Ukraine was behind the blast near Melitopol’s main market on Thursday, which left six people wounded. Ivan Fyodorov, a Ukrainian official responsible for Melitopol, accused the local authorities of trying to frame Kiev. Also on Thursday, Ukrainian artillery struck a bus in Donetsk, killing six people, according to Mayor Aleksey Kulemzin. City officials later reported that seven civilians were killed and eight wounded in the shelling that day.

On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the partial mobilization amid the prolonged conflict with Ukraine. There is no specific drafting order, the ministry admitted, but said priority would be given to reservists who have previously undergone training as tank operators, artillery crew members, drivers, mechanics and motorized infantry. It also called combat experience “one of the key factors” in its choice of draftees. The Russian military plans to call both the rank-and-file soldiers and officers to arms, the ministry said. Reservists aged up to 35 can be drafted as rank-and-file soldiers, while the age threshold will be between 50 and 55 years for officers, depending on the rank, it added. People employed in the defense industry will be exempted from mobilization, as well as those that do not meet the health criteria, have at least four children, or care for disabled relatives, the ministry explained. Each region will be required to draft a certain number of reservists depending on its population, the ministry added, without providing the exact numbers. On Wednesday, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu stated that the mobilization would involve calling to arms some 300,000 reservists, or just over 1% of Russia’s full mobilization potential. Putin had previously said that the defense ministry had recommended drawing military reservists into active service amid the prolonged conflict in Ukraine and Donbass. Shoigu explained that additional troops were required to control the 1,000km-long contact line with Ukrainian forces and the Russian-held areas. Some media then claimed that the number of those supposedly expected to be called to arms might amount to one million.

2022-09-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/563352-lavrov-un-ukraine-impunity/,Lavrov puts spotlight on ‘impunity’ in Ukraine,"The current crisis in Ukraine was brought about by the West systematically covering up the crimes of political leaders in Kiev since the 2014 Maidan coup, the Russian Foreign Minister told the UN Security Council on Thursday. Sergey Lavrov noted that “impunity” is a good term for what has been happening in Ukraine, not since February but since 2014, when US-backed nationalists and neo-Nazis overthrew the democratically elected government by force. No one has ever been held responsible for the murders on the Maidan, the burning of peaceful protesters in Odessa, or the assassinations of dissidents, he pointed out. Meanwhile, civilians in Donbass have been bombed mercilessly for years and dubbed terrorists and even subhuman, simply for refusing to accept the results of the coup and insisting on their basic human right to speak Russian, Lavrov continued. Ukraine has finally turned into a Nazi totalitarian state. The Russian foreign minister presented a long list of human rights violations by Kiev that went ignored by various European and global human rights groups, from “burning books, just like in Nazi Germany” to using banned ‘petal’ land mines against civilians this summer. “Such outrages became possible and remain unpunished due to the fact that the US and its allies, with the connivance of international human rights institutions, have been systematically covering up the crimes of the Kiev regime for eight years, basing their policy towards [Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky based on the well-known American principle: he may be a son of a b*tch, but he is our son of a b*tch,” said Lavrov. This was a reference to an apocryphal quote attributed to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and thought to apply either to Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua or Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic – both US-backed dictators. Lavrov also accused the Ukrainian armed forces of using civilians as human shields and said that Russia and the Donbass republics are fighting against the “Western military machine” in Ukraine, with the US and its allies perilously close to being overt participants in the conflict. Moscow has shared evidence demonstrating that the West has sought to turn Ukraine into a forward outpost that could threaten Russia’s security, Lavrov told the UN. “I can assure you, we will not let that happen.”",3.6163497915256437,2.4410853600743643,1.1752644314512795,8
2022-09-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/563354-ivan-timofeev-eus-von-der/,"Ivan Timofeev: The EU’s von der Leyen is completely wrong about anti-Russia sanctions, and here’s why","European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has, as could be expected, called for new sanctions against Russia in connection with the forthcoming referendums in Donbass and two regions of Ukraine. These concern the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics – which have been de-facto self-governing since 2014 – and the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. In her opinion, the penalties already imposed on Russia are having an impact. “The sanctions have been very successful. If you look at the Russian economy, its industry is in tatters,” the politician asserted. Let’s allow ourselves to argue a little with Ms. von der Leyen. The key measure of the effectiveness of sanctions is whether they change the political course of the target country. This criterion has been well researched in both academic and applied literature and few people have any doubts about its veracity. However, Russia has not changed its political course in Ukraine under the influence of the large-scale sanctions of the EU, US and other initiators. Moreover, its position is hardening, as evidenced by this week’s announcements of both a partial mobilization and the referendums. Thus, we can say that the measures are actually having a negative effect in terms of what they are supposed to be doing. Apparently, Ms. von der Leyen links effectiveness to the amount of pain inflicted. In other words, she believes that the greater it is, the better. There are problems here, too. The damage is indeed large. But we are not just sitting still and feeling sorry for ourselves. We are adapting very energetically. Now, you can criticize Russia’s domestic financial policy and question import substitution as much as you like. And they will not, of course, make ‘everything as it was.’ But it is clear that the economy is shrinking much less than expected, that inflation has, at least so far, been brought under control, and that adaptations in sourcing, helped by domestic production, are mitigating the effects of the sanctions. The economy is simply becoming different. It is changing in terms of focus and quality. In a number of sectors it will 'run slower' or limp along. But Russia will continue to live. Of course, we have already heard the words “the Russian economy is in tatters,” from US President Barack Obama. That was in 2015. Seven years ago. The effectiveness of the measures can also be evaluated in terms of their impact on business behavior. There are indeed effects here. Hundreds of Western companies have left Russia, incurring losses, for themselves, and losing their market share. Does this mean that the niches they occupied will remain empty? No, it doesn't. They are already being actively exploited by Russian rivals, as well as Chinese, Iranian, Indian and other entrepreneurs and firms. We ourselves, of course, can hardly be complacent. The problems we face are numerous, and, most of them have to be dealt with by fire-fighting. Right now, we are waiting for a new package of sanctions from the EU and others Western actors. Let’s see what they come up with.",3.2867969808502964,3.975913682627656,-0.6891167017773596,8

The alleged would-be saboteur was acting on orders from Kiev, the statement claims. The Russian agency released footage that it said shows the plotter taking explosives from the weapons cache, and his subsequent arrest. The items in his possession included “means of communication with a record of exchanges with his SBU handler, instructions for assembling IEDs and transferring money as well as coordinates of the planned bombing,” the FSB said. Four other people were providing material support to the plot, the agency alleged. They are all Russian nationals and have been taken into custody, it said.",3.276436015579584,4.365523849935172,-1.0890878343555874,0
2022-09-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/563286-lavrov-west-sanctions-china/,West destroying its own privileges – Lavrov,"The main cause of the worsening situation in the world is the “persistent desire of the West led by the United States to ensure its global dominance,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday in an exclusive interview with Newsweek. This endeavor is “impossible for obvious reasons,” Lavrov added. “Those whom we believed to be trustworthy economic partners have chosen illegitimate sanctions and a unilateral break-off of business ties,” Lavrov told the magazine, referring to the US and EU. Lavrov, who is in New York this week for the 77th UN General Assembly, also discussed the impact of the Western embargo on the Russian economy – and their own. The sanctions appear to be a double-edged sword, he said, as “increasing prices and decreasing incomes are seen in many European countries, as well as energy shortages and threats of social upheaval.” The routine benefits of civilization become the privilege of the rich. This is the price that ordinary citizens pay for the anti-Russian policy of the ruling elites. Affordable Russian energy had enabled EU industry to compete with American companies, but “it looks like this will not be the case anymore, and it has not been our choice,” Lavrov told Newsweek. “If people in the West want to act to the detriment of their own interests, we cannot keep them from doing that.” After the West wrecked what took decades to build practically overnight, “I do not think that in the foreseeable future they will be able to restore their credibility as business counterparts,” Lavrov said. Russia will “continue working with those partners who are ready for equal, mutually beneficial cooperation, who have not been affected by anti-Russian hysteria. And they constitute the vast majority of the international community,” according to the foreign minister. Moscow’s relationship with China, for example, is “characterized by deep mutual trust” and maintaining that strategic partnership is “an absolute foreign policy priority,” Lavrov said. Washington and its “satellites” are “still living in the day before yesterday, thinking in terms of unipolarity. They cannot accept the fact that the modern world is no longer West-centered. And it will never be again,” the foreign minister added.",3.6667554037045673,2.2139442331936854,1.452811170510882,8
2022-09-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/563284-china-daily-editorial-eu/,Chinese outlet names ‘biggest loser’ in Ukraine conflict,"No matter the outcome of the Ukraine conflict, the European Union will leave as the “biggest loser,” China Daily, an English-language newspaper owned by the Chinese Communist Party, claimed in an editorial. The outlet argues that the EU has “a price to pay” for “throwing its weight behind Ukraine under the leadership of the US.” According to the editorial’s authors, “the worst conflict on the continent since the end of World War II” has nullified all of the efforts of the EU “to become a political force that can maintain its distance from the United States.” “The European Union as a whole will prove to be the biggest loser no matter how the conflict between Russia and Ukraine plays out. The consequences for European countries are not just economic and well-being shocks but the geopolitical implications as well,” they wrote. Beijing has been sticking to a neutral position since the launch of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, but its refusal to cut ties with Moscow has been criticized by the US and its partners. According to the editorial, anti-Russia economic sanctions, which were allegedly “orchestrated” by Washington, have severely damaged the economy of European countries. Inflation “is having a serious impact” on the life quality of their citizens, especially of the most vulnerable groups, they wrote. “No wonder protests have been held in some EU countries against military support to Ukraine, with the protesters demanding that their governments focus on people’s daily needs,” it claims. The rising costs will stifle demand, which will affect the economic growth and promptly further increase prices. As a result, China Daily argues, EU economies will end up in a “vicious cycle” that will deprive the bloc of the opportunity to become an independent political force. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously warned Western countries of the serious consequences of the sanctions that were imposed on Moscow, for their own economies. In particular, he has likened the EU’s attempts to cut itself off from Russian fossil fuels to economic “suicide.” Putin’s Serbian colleague, Aleksandar Vucic, in turn, recently made the prediction that while the upcoming winter is going to be very cold for Europe, the next will be a “polar” one. EU leaders, however, insist that the difficulties its members are now facing are worth it. The bloc’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, earlier this month compared the EU sanctions on Russia with a diet that you have to maintain in order to achieve results.",2.998230385157142,2.396892529702456,0.6013378554546862,8

The US and its allies aren’t seeking peace in Ukraine, but to use the country to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, said Lavrov, who was in New York for the 77th UN General Assembly session. “Today, Western states funnel weapons and military hardware into the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev, and train Ukraine’s armed forces. NATO and US weapons are used to fire at Russian territory bordering Ukraine, killing civilians there. The Pentagon does not hide that it’s providing Kiev with intelligence and target designations for strikes. We’ve recorded the presence of American mercenaries and advisers on the battlefield,” Lavrov told the US magazine. The United States, in fact, is teetering on the brink of turning into a party to the conflict. This is to your question about the risk of a direct collision between nuclear powers. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday morning that Moscow would “use all the means” at its disposal to defend Russia, referring to statements by officials in NATO countries about using nuclear weapons against Russian troops. The US and its allies are openly seeking to defeat Russia on the battlefield and are ready to sacrifice Ukraine to achieve their geopolitical goals, Lavrov told Newsweek. When Moscow and Kiev almost reached an agreement in March, this turn of events “obviously frightened the Americans and the British, so they actually forbade Ukraine to conduct further dialogue with Russia,” the Russian diplomat said. This was presumably a reference to revelations by pro-government media in Kiev that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had brought such a message to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. “It is objectively not possible to maintain normal communication with Washington” after the US declared “the strategic defeat of Russia” as its policy goal, Lavrov told the outlet. The West left Moscow no choice but to launch a special military operation, after it created and nurtured “a Russophobic neo-Nazi regime” in Kiev and sent weapons into Ukraine in order to turn it into a “springboard for containing Russia,” the foreign minister explained. The goals of the operation are to protect the population of Donbass, eliminate threats to Russia’s security, and the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine,” Lavrov said. “All of them remain relevant and will be achieved, no matter how long it takes.”",1.781927696583557,1.789140853069664,-0.007213156486106875,8

Such a move would be the best response to Vladimir Putin’s “belligerent threats,” Kuleba claimed, apparently referring to the recent statements of the Russian president. On Wednesday morning, Putin announced partial mobilization in Russia, saying that the country is now fighting “the entire Western military machine” in Ukraine. The Russian leader also made it clear that his country would be prepared to use any means necessary, including nuclear weapons, to protect its territorial integrity. “The only appropriate response to Putin’s belligerent threats is to double down on supporting Ukraine. More sanctions on Russia. More weapons to Ukraine. More solidarity with Ukrainians. More businesses pulling out of Russia. More determination to hold Russia accountable,” Kuleba wrote on Twitter. His statement echoed the remarks of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who told Reuters on Wednesday that the best answer to Russia’s latest moves would be “to step up and further support Ukraine.” Many other Western leaders – including US President Joe Biden, EU Council head Charles Michel, and UK Prime Minister Liz Truss – condemned Putin’s remarks and reassured Kiev that their support would remain “firm” and “steadfast.” On Tuesday, Truss announced that next year Britain would match or even exceed its record 2022 military support to Ukraine, which has already amounted to £2.3 billion. Last week, Washington pledged to send an additional $600 million in military aid to Kiev. In total, under Biden’s administration, the US has provided Ukraine with almost $16 billion of assistance. Kiev’s Western partners also pledged to maintain both economic and military pressure on Russia.

Certain management decisions have already been taken, it added. “Today, many Rostech enterprises have already introduced special operating conditions: The employees are working overtime and often on weekends as well,” Rostech said in a statement, adding that it would “further increase its production capacities to meet the goals” set by Moscow. The corporation also expressed its hope that “its contribution to the common cause would help Russia prevail and come out as a victor.” The statement came as Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded the defense industry speed up their work under the state defense procurement and acquisition program. Rostech is responsible for 40% of all defense acquisition contracts, the corporation said. The defense industry giant produces warplanes, artillery systems, high-precision weapons, communication devices and radio electronic warfare systems among others. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilization. He said the Defense Ministry had recommended drawing military reservists into active service amid the prolonged conflict in Ukraine and Donbass. According to Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, the mobilization would involve calling to arms some 300,000 reservists, or just over 1% of Russia’s full mobilization potential. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

Hailing from five countries, the mercenaries had been captured while fighting for Kiev. The prisoners, who are citizens of Croatia, Morocco, Sweden, the UK and the US, were transferred from Russia to Saudi Arabia by Saudi authorities, according to a statement from the ministry. Saudi officials are now “facilitating procedures for their safe return to their respective countries,” the announcement continued. Bin Salman personally negotiated the release, which took place as part of a wider exchange of prisoners of war between Russia and Ukraine, the ministry added. The full details of the POW exchange are unclear, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Moscow and Kiev had agreed to exchange 200 prisoners. This exchange would be the largest such swap since Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began in February. Erdogan, whose government helped broker a deal earlier this summer to restart grain shipments from Ukrainian ports, said this exchange represented “a very important step.” In addition to receiving tens of billions of dollars worth of Western arms, Ukraine has leaned heavily on foreign mercenaries to bolster its military. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, more than 2,000 of these foreign fighters have been eliminated by Russian troops and the militias of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics.

The demonstrations were not authorized by the authorities. So far, Moscow police have not officially released any crowd numbers for the rally and didn't provide exact figures on how many people have been detained. According to an activist group, OVD-Info, hundreds were held by law enforcement in the Russian capital as a crowd gathered not far from the General Staff headquarters in the city center. OVD-info is an activist group covering various protest actions in Russia. It was designated a ‘foreign agent’ by the Russian Justice Ministry in 2021. Earlier, Moscow authorities announced that the demonstration was not authorized, with police warning that anyone taking part could be detained and face fines or even a jail term. The latter, however, would require a court hearing. Other rallies, though smaller in size, were held in other Russian cities. A crowd gathered near Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg. The demonstration there ended up in brief scuffles with police, and detentions. At least 312 protesters have been detained in St. Petersburg, according to OVD-Info. Dozens of people have taken to the streets in the cities of Ufa, Yekaterinburg, Perm and Chelyabinsk, in the Urals region. There the protests reportedly resulted in between 14 and 45 detentions, according to the activists. The Siberian cities of Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk and Yakutsk saw some protests as well.

Zelensky also accused Russia of nuclear blackmail, adding that one should not give in to Moscow’s threats. He also claimed that Russia could then potentially demand “a part of Poland” and threaten to use nukes as well. So far, Kiev’s strategy remains unchanged, Zelensky said. “We will act according to our plans step by step. I am sure we will liberate our territory,” he added.

Partial mobilization in Russia was announced by President Vladimir Putin during a televised address earlier on Wednesday, and the relevant decree was later published online. The document consisted of ten clauses, but one of them – No.7 – was not disclosed. “It’s for internal use, and that’s why I can’t reveal it,” Peskov said after being asked to comment on the matter. “The only thing I can tell you… is that Sergey Shoigu in his interview spoke about 300,000 people, [who are to be mobilized.] The talk is about 300,000 people. And, as the defense minister clarified, they won’t be recruited simultaneously,” he pointed out. Journalists at a press conference also reminded Peskov about a comment he made last week, when he stated that mobilization in the country was not on the agenda. “I was asked about full mobilization back then and it’s not on the agenda at the moment,” he replied. As for the reasons for the current partial call to arms, the spokesman noted that Putin explained in his address that Russia is “now confronted with the military potential of NATO and a number of other unfriendly countries” in Ukraine.

2022-09-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/563250-russian-citizenship-foreign-military/,Russian MPs ease naturalization rules for foreign fighters,"The Russian parliament has approved a draft law offering a simplified path towards obtaining the country’s citizenship to foreign nationals who sign up for Russian military service. The Federation Council, the upper house of the parliament, passed the bill on Wednesday after it was approved by the lower chamber, the State Duma, a day earlier. Normally, foreigners who want to apply for Russian citizenship need to meet several conditions, but those who join the Russian military get some leniency. The new amendment seeks to make the exception apply to more people. Currently, a simplified naturalization procedure applies, among other cases, to citizens of former USSR countries who sign up for service in the Russian military for at least three years. The bill, if signed into law, will make all foreign nationals qualify for the exception and would reduce the minimum required commitment to one year of service. Applicants under the facilitation clause do not need to obtain a Russian residency permit or live in the country for several years, unlike regular citizenship-seekers. They are still required to pledge that they would observe Russian law, have a legal source of income, and speak Russian with a certain level of fluency to apply for naturalization. The bill would also change the rules on how long the first contract signed by a foreigner to serve in the Russian military should be.

2022-09-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/563231-mikhail-gorbachev-ussr-debates/,"Ivan Timofeev: What Russia, and the world, can learn from the failures and successes of Mikhail Gorbachev","Mikhail Gorbachev’s death caused a surge of debate on the political legacy of the USSR's only president. As expected, opinions were split. Negative comments focused on the Soviet Union’s dissolution, the consequences of which still affect us, for example, in the conflict with Ukraine. However, positive assessments emphasized unprecedented democratization, the beginning of the transition to a market economy, a sharp reduction in the risk of conflict with the West, and global integration. For some people, Gorbachev was a symbol of a superpower’s collapse, while for others he was a reformer, who paved the way to liberation and freedom. Unlike the majority of Soviet and pre-revolutionary Russian leaders, who died either in power or as a result of losing it, Gorbachev lived a long and comfortable life after leaving his post. However, he still remains probably the most tragic figure among figureheads in Moscow or Saint Petersburg. A vigorous orchestrator of long overdue reforms, he eventually lost control over them and failed to prevent a quick and inevitable catastrophe. When studying the experience of Gorbachev’s leadership, people are tempted to suggest what they would have done differently. They are sure that they would not have allowed the country to collapse, or that they would have carried out reforms with a tougher, more hard-core approach. Given this thinking, ruling a country might be likened to a sort of a computer game – something like a step-by-step strategy or even a real-time puzzle. Here’s one goal and here’s the next. Here we have raw materials, factories, food, and a population. Here are our rivals, and there are our allies. You can introduce a cheat code and receive an endless supply of money and resources. You can also save the game at a crossroads and then replay it in case of a setback. Finally, you can put it on pause, take a break, or simply forget about it. Few gamers can maintain their initial strategy in one go without saving it at some point or using other trickery. But politics is not a computer game. Gorbachev was destined to take on what was not a pleasant mission. Strictly speaking, he had to pay the bills and loans that had accumulated in huge amounts by the start of his rule. The need for change was obvious even to hardcore conservatives. The Soviet Union was no longer able to carry out a modernization reminiscent of Stalin’s breakthroughs in the 1930s. The country did not have the demographic strength, nor could it use terror and reprisals like before, nor again was there a comparable level of outside threats. There was an abortive attempt to liberate society in the 1960s. Then, during Leonid Brezhnev’s rule, the country fell into a blissful stability. Contemporaries still recall this period with nostalgia, especially after the shock of the 1990s. But this stability had a price – renunciation of structural reforms in the economy and in the political system, which was fraught with the risk of losing control of the situation. By1985, the Soviet Union was faced with several fundamental challenges at the same time. For all its enormous scientific and technological achievements, the economy was stagnating and increasingly dependent on the export of natural resources. Administrative efficiency was in rapid decline. It was degenerating into mismanagement, major shortages of everything, and increasingly lagged behind the West. Attempts to bolster the economy through administrative strategies – from catching idlers to using the free labor of conscripts and Young Communist League members – failed to produce the desired results. The political system began to be dominated by once tough leaders, who were becoming elderly. Standing behind them was an outwardly conformist but increasingly corrupt state and party apparatus. Society was being eroded by cynicism, a combination of feigned loyalty and informal nihilism, comprehensive alcoholism and universal larceny. The gap between the true grandeur of national achievements and the country’s decline in everyday life was staggering. The situation was aggravated by the Cold War, enormous defense spending and support for freeloaders all over the world, who said the right words but betrayed the USSR at the first opportunity. What could be done about these countless problems? How could they be sure their resolve would not sink under the weight of an indifferent bureaucracy? How could they prevent the system from overheating and causing them to losing control over the domestic situation? It is not easy to respond to these questions even now, knowing what has happened. If it were possible today to restart this era as a saved game, would we be able to replay it with success? And how should it be replayed? With another round of stagnation? By launching an authoritarian modernization? By resorting to reprisals? Or by starting up an uncompromising democratization again? And, one more question: What forces or people should we replay this saved game with? We can only use the people who lived in those times, with their limited capabilities and their own picture of the world. This applies to Gorbachev himself, a product of this very system. He was an exemplary hero, a self-made man from a lower social stratum. He climbed the steps of power from the provinces. The reality is that the country had to be reformed using its own potential, with all its accumulated ulcers and diseases. It seemed obvious to start with the economy without touching the political foundations at first. The attempt to reduce the burden of the confrontation with the West in a controlled mode looked equally correct. In the final count, glasnost (openness) and the radical shake-up of the party apparatus seemed an obvious proposition as well. Otherwise, the reforms would have turned into a bubble that rose and then burst on the water surface of a swamp, returning the country to its rotten and pernicious tranquility. This was how the feverish and ill-conceived reforms of Khrushchev’s Thaw died out. In all probability, several factors contributed to the loss of control over the situation. To begin with, Gorbachev fell hostage to his own humanism, his unwillingness to use reprisals, and a tendency to seek compromise. Having realized this, a host of diverse players began testing his strength. Was it possible to promote the idea of a “common European home” while brutally crushing the emerging opposition movements in the socialist camp? Could they use force to suppress Budapest, Prague, or Warsaw? Was it possible to respond with tanks to the fall of the Berlin Wall? This could be done, of course. But it was also likely that such actions would only have expedited the self-destruction of the system. The testing of red lines was gradually becoming more resolute. There was a riot in Vilnius. Force was used, but a whirlwind of protests could not be stopped without great bloodshed. Ethnic conflicts started flaring up, one after another, in the South Caucasus. Boils were bursting in Central Asia. Ukraine was drifting towards independence, with its nomenklatura increasingly aware of the opportunity to take power into its own hands. Eventually, the RSFSR (Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) itself came to lead the process of disintegration. Boris Yeltsin was very skillful at exploiting Gorbachev’s reluctance to use force. Later, Yeltsin himself was not ashamed to fire at the parliament building, send troops to rebellious Chechnya, or establish a super-presidential republic. It is likely that in so doing, Yeltsin managed to stop the disintegration of Russia itself. But the Soviet Union and its political structure collapsed overnight, by historical standards. It was not saved by the nomenklatura, the secret services, the multimillion-man army, or one of the world’s biggest political parties. A much deeper neglect of economic and administrative problems and any opportunity for reform was another factor in the dissolution of the USSR. The informal sector and top-to-bottom corruption interfered with the implementation of any formal plans. They were only seen as a talking shop and demagogy, an imitation of actual activity, and a chance for milking the budget. All the demons of the 1990s – in the shape of a raw-materials economy, corruption and rampant lawlessness – had slowly been brewing for several decades and finally fermented by the mid-1980s. The beginnings of a market economy and democracy gave the corrupt elites a chance to privatize their power and privileges. They became the main beneficiaries of the USSR’s disintegration. Gorbachev happened to be at the worst crossroads of challenges and threats in the process of historical change in Russia. Unlike Tsar Nicholas II, who was afraid of political reform, clung to old ways, was estranged from people, and who became entangled in unfortunate wars, Gorbachev initiated reforms himself and was unprecedentedly close to the people. He tried to finish wars and develop relations with the outside world. But he lost the country, for which he would be blamed for many years to come. He did, however, avoid bloodshed, at the time, that would have been comparable to events in Yugoslavia in the 1990s or the Civil War in Russia in the early 20th century. Our society has rarely had such a deep breath of fresh air as during Gorbachev’s rule. But Russia has never experienced such a deep decline, despite its enormous resources. New generations must not forget Gorbachev’s record. On the one hand, they must be conscious of the dangers of overwhelming corruption, the chasm between society and the powers that be, and total dissimulation. On the other, they must not forget the abuses of reform, excessive trustfulness, and the lack of toughness, when needed. Gorbachev is part of our history, a symbol of a major turning point, who left important lessons for us. Our ability to understand them will largely determine the future of Russia, which has many trials ahead.",3.884808450200502,3.4589325065726415,0.4258759436278603,6

Shoigu went on to say that Moscow had transferred troops from the areas near the towns of Izium and Balakleya in Kharkov Region, northeastern Ukraine, “to strengthen the striking capabilities of the Russian military in the Donbass.” On Wednesday, Shoigu announced that Russia would call on 300,000 reservists as part of a partial nationwide mobilization, adding that the newly arrived troops would be used to defend the line of contact between Moscow and Ukraine’s forces, which is almost 1,000 kilometers long. On the same day, Shoigu also updated Russia’s total losses in Ukraine, putting them at 5,937 dead. Meanwhile, he estimated fatalities on the Ukrainian side as ten times higher, with 61,207 of Kiev’s troops killed.",2.7729985066878817,2.5951227557599643,0.1778757509279174,2
2022-09-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/563248-putin-partition-russia-ussr/,West wants to break up Russia like USSR – Putin,"Russia is under an attack by the West, which wants the country to be broken up into warring pieces, President Vladimir Putin has claimed. “The Western goal is to weaken, disunite and ultimately destroy our nation. They are saying directly that they managed to break up the Soviet Union in 1991, and now it is time for Russia itself to be split into many regions that would be at each other’s throats,” the Russian leader stated in a televised address on Wednesday. Putin’s accusations came as he updated the nation on Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine and explained his decision to mobilize army reserves. He insisted that the hostile Ukrainian government in Kiev was a product of Western-induced Russophobia. “For decades [the West] has intentionally fostered hatred towards Russia, first and foremost in Ukraine, which they envisioned as a foothold against Russia. The West turned the Ukrainian people into cannon fodder and pushed them to a war against our country,” Putin said. He stated that the ongoing conflict started in 2014, when an armed coup in Kiev toppled Ukraine’s elected government. The US and its allies have stated their goal as being Russia’s defeat on the battlefield, which, according to Putin, would lead to a “total negation of [Russia’s] political, economic, cultural and any other kind of sovereignty, a total pillaging of our nation.” He warned that Russia will use any means at its disposal to defend itself and ensure its territorial integrity, up to and including the deployment of its nuclear arsenal, if attacked with weapons of mass destruction. Putin stressed that he was “not bluffing.” The president added that “stopping those who vie for world dominance and threaten to dismember and enslave our homeland” is part of Russia’s national tradition, and that the Ukraine crisis is no different to what the nation has faced in the past.",2.14656232288162,2.33995857384923,-0.19339625096761015,8
2022-09-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/563182-another-afghanistan-in-making-how/,Another Afghanistan in the making? How a fully-fledged war between two ex-Soviet states could threaten stability in Central Asia,"While the leaders of more than 20 major Asian countries – including Russia, China, Turkey, and India – held talks in the ancient city of Samarkand only a few hundred kilometers away, large-scale hostilities erupted on the border between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, last week. As their presidents also participated in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, the conflict erupted with the use of heavy weapons and claimed hundreds of lives. It all began on Wednesday, when the Kyrgyz border service discovered their Tajik counterparts had taken up combat positions on part of the state border, thus nullifying previously reached agreements. In response to the demand to leave the territory, they opened fire. Fighting with the use of heavy weapons continued for several days. The death toll was much higher than in the course of several past incidents. Some 59 deaths were reported in Bishkek and 41 in Dushanbe. Most likely, these are not the final numbers. On Monday, the heads of the intelligence services of the two countries signed a peace protocol. However, the reasons that forced the parties to take up arms have not disappeared, making a repetition of the conflict almost inevitable. Clashes on the border of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are not out of the ordinary due to unresolved territorial conflicts after the collapse of the USSR. The most fertile part of the region, the Fergana Valley, is not only divided between Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, but is also dotted with numerous enclaves, of which only eight are considered large. The current conflict occurred in the area of the Tajik enclave of Vorukh, which is surrounded by the territory of Kyrgyzstan. It is on the Tajik-Kyrgyz border that tensions most often boil over. The epicentres of the collisions are becoming water sources, fertile land, transport infrastructure: roads, detours and so on. Scuffles occur regularly every few months and develop in a similar scenario: Local residents, outraged by the placing of this or that infrastructure facility, throw stones at each other. Soon, gunfire and arson erupt, and officials from the capitals who conduct negotiations get involved in the settlement of the conflict. Sometimes, less often, the military personnel of the two countries are drawn into the conflict. Even the use of mortars now being reported by the parties is not an unprecedented event. The situation was similar 18 months ago, in the spring of 2021. However, each time, the clashes become more violent and the number of victims increases. “How the current collisions differ from the previous ones, in the first place, is their scale,” Andrey Kazantsev, a specialist in the region, and a professor at the Faculty of World Economy and World Politics at Moscow's HSE, explained to RT. According to him, the events on the border of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are part of a problem that has been going on for many years. “Cases of serious shootings at the border, with the use of weapons, are becoming more frequent. This conflict erupts with renewed vigor literally every six months, but this is not a confrontation between Bishkek and Dushanbe. It is regional conflicts that flare up – either for local water, or between groups that carry out cross-border drug trafficking, and so on. Usually, it all starts with the fact that they won't share the water,” Kazantsev explained. The demographic situation in the Fergana Valley is pouring gasoline on the fire. Compared to the rest of the post-Soviet space, it seems to be some kind of anomaly. If most territories experience depopulation, then in the Fergana Valley everything is exactly the opposite: more than 15 million people live on a patch of 22,000 square kilometers. The population density outside cities is one of the highest in the world, at about 650 people per square kilometer. This is comparable to the densely populated areas of China, India, or Bangladesh. About a third of the population of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and half of the total population of Kyrgyzstan live in the Fergana Valley, and in the future the numbers will only grow, because the countries of Central Asia are demographically ‘younger’ states. Andrey Grozin, Head of the Central Asia and Kazakhstan Department of the CIS Institute, also points out the imbalance in the demography of the two warring countries. “There is an explosive population growth in the border regions of Tajikistan, in contrast to Kyrgyzstan, where, on the contrary, the situation is starting to turn towards depopulation. The Kyrgyz fear that the Tajiks will outweigh them for natural reasons. The ratio now in the border areas is about six to one; there are much fewer Kyrgyz than Tajiks. “The Kyrgyz are seriously afraid that internal migration, added to those leaving Kyrgyzstan, will eventually create a situation where there will be a vacuum on the Kyrgyz side, and an absolutely dominant increase in numbers on the Tajik side where people will suffer from lack of land and water resources,” the expert said. The situation with overcrowding is boosted by poverty and a lack of resources. Almost the entire population of the valley is reliant on livestock and agriculture, so every piece of land is worth its weight in gold. It is all the worse because not only honest farmers and shepherds, but also various criminal clans, claim this land. Routes of drug trafficking and weapons smuggling pass through the valley. There is evidence that a large proportion of this business is controlled by Islamist members of terrorist groups. Such circumstances create a situation in which central governments have absolutely no control over what is happening on the ground. As a result, the clashes that arise on the borders are not only interstate in nature, but local: Encounters occur between ordinary people, and not between the governments of the two countries. The lack of control, the rise in crime and poverty, and the struggle for vital resources, such as water. have already led to massacres – in 1989 in the Fergana region of Uzbekistan and in 2010 in the Osh region of Kyrgyzstan. Professor Kazantsev points out that the conflict will be repeated over and over again, since the contradictions between the inhabitants of the border districts are only accumulating, and no decisions on this issue have been taken. “Relatively recently, the peoples perceived each other quite fraternally – there is no such historical enmity as, say, between Azerbaijanis and Armenians. But as the conflict worsens, some differences begin to be constructed. For instance, that the Tajiks are a settled people, and the Kyrgyz are nomadic. Everyone begins to say that their culture is better, that it is more ancient and high, and that the neighbors are barbarians. As rhetoric bitters, the intensity of conflicts is also growing, and the number of victims is increasing. Because there are people who want revenge for their own,” the professor said. Grozin, for his part, noted that the hardening of rhetoric has a negative effect on the prospects of a compromise. “The authorities of both republics have driven themselves into a certain impasse in relations, and any concession will now be extremely negatively perceived by both Tajik and Kyrgyz society. If there ever will be one. This complicates the possibility of any negotiation process at all,” he said. According to him, although the authorities of the two countries are not able to influence this conflict, they skillfully use it for their own purposes. By using nationalist rhetoric and constructing the image of an external enemy, the leadership of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan distracts the public from numerous internal problems. “I believe that on both sides, the states do not have any serious interest in actually looking for a way out of the standstill into which countries have consistently entered for at least the last quarter of a century. Starting with the demarcation and delimitation treaty in 1997. A quarter of a century has passed, but no serious progress has been made in the issue of demarcation and determination of the dividing line. For a variety of objective and subjective reasons,” Grozin explained. The Bolsheviks planted a geopolitical time bomb in the region. From the numerous tribes of Central Asia, the Soviet government singled out five main nations: Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Turkmen, and Tajiks. The borders of the Turkestan Territory, which united five regions with the territories of the Khiva Khanate and the Emirate of Bukhara, were divided between the newly-created republics in the 1920s. However, the national principle did not become the key to the demarcation of the territory. The Soviet government drew the boundaries based on considerations of economic feasibility. The nomadic way of life of local tribes complicated the administrative division: If, for example, at one time of the year in some area the Tajik population prevailed, then at another in this territory the Kyrgyz could be the dominant people. Ultimately, the Bolsheviks were guided by the principle of the peoples leading a settled way of life, which later turned out to be a mistake. During the years of the Russian Empire, this intermountain trough was a separate region. Before that, it was the center and pearl of the Kokand Khanate. The Bolsheviks decided to divide the fertile land between three union republics at once – Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. As a result, the entire valley was dotted with numerous enclaves, of which only eight are considered as large. Three of them belong to Tajikistan, four to Uzbekistan, and one to Kyrgyzstan. Bishkek ‘compensates’ for the small number of enclaves with the large number of exclaves on its territory. Except for two such problem areas (Kyrgyz Barak and Tajik Sarvak in Uzbekistan), the remaining six ‘territorial appendixes’ of the valley are located on the territory of Kyrgyzstan. All of this was unimportant within the framework of one country. But when three independent sovereign states found themselves side by side on the territory of the Fergana Valley, and their borders were intermittently closed, the local population experienced difficulties in supplying water and humanitarian supplies, and isolation from pastures, and medical services, and sometimes their families. At the moment, Bishkek and Dushanbe have recognized only 520 kilometers of the 950 kilometers of their common border. The rest of the sections since the collapse of the USSR are considered controversial and run along villages and roads. Sometimes, the border can pass through two adjacent houses. Specialists in the region are unequivocally sure of one thing: The conflict will continue, and the intensity of military clashes will increase. “Of course, there is a risk that at some point the escalation will reach the interstate level – some of the countries will have a desire to take revenge, announce mobilization and go to war with a neighbor. So far, thank God, this is not the case. The central authorities stop all such situations when conflicts flare up. But it is possible that at some point one of the parties will not hold back – what if the people demand revenge? In this case, a war may start,” Professor Kazantsev warned. Grozin pointed out that even external players – neighbors of warring states – cannot influence this trend. “Russia has repeatedly offered its help as an arbitrator. The parties politely refused such an offer. The same applies to China, which has many interests and wants to maintain stability in the region. But as we can see, even the summit in Samarkand, where both President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to convey the idea of ending the conflict to the leaders of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, had no effect. As we can see so far, inertia persists, the conflict is not going anywhere. Meaning, the words of senior comrades are not enough here. Neither the West nor the East can influence this confrontation,” he said. According to Grozin, the only comforting factor in this situation is the extremely low military potential of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. “These countries do not have the capacity for some kind of long-term armed conflict, even if compared with what we are seeing in the Transcaucasus. There, the military and economic potentials, both from Baku and even from Yerevan, are much greater. In brief, there is nothing to worry about,” he said. Professor Kazantsev, however, does not share the optimism of his colleague. “The fact is that in Afghanistan, which borders on Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, there is already a war going on between the Taliban and various other groups, such as ISIS. And if these two countries start a war, then there will be such an Afghan black hole that will expand and capture neighboring territories. And there will be not one conditional Afghanistan, but three,” he warned.",3.352809130777096,3.980822517276199,-0.6280133864991031,4

Speaking to Sputnik, she noted that two of ten diplomats comprising “the official delegation” had not received the necessary stamp. Zakharova explained that Russia’s overall delegation consists of several groups. The first one, she said, is referred to as “the official delegation.” This group is headed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and has been formed with the approval of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Out of ten members of the official delegation, two did not receive visas. This tactic has already become an ominous tradition on the part of the US, but the point stands,” Zakharova stated, also offering a reminder that Moscow has already voiced concerns on this matter. The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman went on to say that Washington had not granted visas to several delegation members from the second group, which includes various experts and diplomats who support the official delegation. She said, however, that she does not know the exact number, due to late notice. “You would not believe… but the messages on the issuance or non-issuance of the visa were coming in just overnight. So we had to contact our colleagues at night to tell them to get ready for tomorrow’s flight [to the US],” she noted. Of a third group, which incorporates journalists, one person failed to get a US visa, Zakharova said. The 77th session of the UN General Assembly opened on September 13. However, the main event of this session is supposed to be the ‘High-Level week’ from September 20 to 26, which will be attended by many world leaders and foreign ministers. Moscow has repeatedly accused Washington of violating its obligations under the 1947 agreement on the hosting of the UN headquarters in New York City, which requires the US to grant access to foreign representatives without charge and “as promptly as possible.” Following Moscow's and the UN’s calls to issue visas to members of the Russian delegation, the US allowed entry to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and a number of high-level diplomats, enabling them to attend the assembly.",1.9478248869829287,2.4799932038840637,-0.5321683169011351,8

President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will respect the outcome of upcoming referendums by former and current Ukrainian regions on becoming part of Russia. The Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as well as Ukraine’s Kherson and Zaporozhye region are slated to hold votes starting on Friday. Slutsky, who heads the foreign relations committee in the lower house of Russia’s parliament, predicted that the votes will be in favour of joining Russia, and that after Moscow accepts the requests, there will be no point in further talks with Kiev. “Negotiations have been out of the question for some time, unfortunately. The West and the junta in Kiev backed by it have declared they were not ready to negotiate,” the lawmaker told journalists, as quoted by TASS news agency. Officials in Kiev and Western nations have condemned Tuesday’s announcements on upcoming referendums, saying they will not recognize the results.

Speaking to Ukrainian outlet Strana, Vereshchuk, who is also in charge of the “reintegration of temporarily occupied territories,” urged local residents not to take part in the referendums. She warned that those who organize the voting would face “a prison term of five to ten years” and could be barred from being employed in certain positions or engaging in certain activities for up to 15 years. According to Vereshchuk, their assets could also be seized. Vereshchuk signaled that even ordinary Ukrainians may be punished for attending polling stations. “This [may] mean imprisonment for up to five years. So, once again I strongly advise residents of the temporarily occupied territories: do not take a [Russian] passport, do not go to referendums, do not cooperate with the occupiers and leave, if it’s possible,” the official stated. Last week, the Ukrainian government proposed legislation that would impose a prison sentence of up to 15 years on its citizens for obtaining a Russian passport.

He added that Moscow has considerable capacity in terms of personnel. According to Shoigu, the mobilization will apply neither to university students, nor conscripts. The minister stressed that only those who have already served in the military will be called up. “Those are not people who have never heard anything about the army. Those are those who, firstly, had completed their military service, secondly, those who have a military specialty… and have military experience,” he noted. Shoigu also stressed that Russia possesses an immense mobilization capability and could summon almost 25 million people with some military experience. “So one could say that this partial mobilization is just 1%, or a bit more” of the total number of people that could be mobilized, he added. The defense minister noted that the line of contact between Moscow and Ukraine’s forces is more than 1,000 km long, and the mobilization would be used for defending it. “It is natural that this line should be reinforced and those territories (held by Russia) should be controlled. Of course, this is the purpose of this work,” he said, referring to the mobilization effort. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilization, describing the move as sensible and necessary due to the military campaign in Ukraine. He pledged that those who are called up will be provided with additional training and benefits. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

Fatalities on the Ukrainian side are ten times higher, with 61,207 Kiev troops killed, according to the minister. It’s the first time that Russia announced its losses during the military operation since late March when the number of killed servicemen stood at 1,351, according to the defense ministry. “Our losses to date are 5,937 dead,” Shoigu revealed. He also praised the work of military medics, saying that 90% of the Russian troops who had been wounded during fighting were able to return to action after treatment. “Initially, the Armed Forces of Ukraine amounted to between 201,000 and 202,000 people, and since then they have suffered losses of around 100,000, with 61,207 killed and 49,368 others wounded,"" he said. Shoigu added that Kiev has since mobilized hundreds of thousands more men into its forces.

2022-09-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/563209-putin-donbass-mobilization-ukraine/,Russia to begin partial mobilization – Putin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilization during an address to the nation on Wednesday morning. He said the Defense Ministry had recommended drawing military reservists into active service as the country faces a protracted conflict in Ukraine and Donbass. The measure is sensible and necessary under the circumstances, Putin said, considering that Russia is fighting “the entire Western military machine” in Ukraine. He has already signed an order for the call-up to start immediately. The move will see the armed forces draw on military reservists only, and those who have completed national service, the president added. He promised that they would be provided with additional training, along with all the benefits due to people involved in active duty. Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu revealed some details about the mobilization in a separate statement on Wednesday. He said the ministry wanted to call to arms some 300,000 reservists, or just over 1% of Russia’s full mobilization potential. Putin has accused Kiev of backing away from peace talks with Moscow, which he said it had done on the instructions of its Western backers. Instead, the Ukrainian government has doubled down on military action, he said. “After certain compromises [with Moscow] were reached, Kiev received a de facto direct order to derail all agreements. More weapons were pumped into Ukraine. The Kiev regime deployed more gangs of international mercenaries and nationalists, military units trained to NATO standards and under de facto command of Western advisers,” Putin said. Russian forces sent to Ukraine in February have secured a large portion of territory claimed by the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as parts of Ukraine, he said. The resulting front line stretches over 1,000km, the president pointed out. He warned the US and its allies against ramping up pressure on Moscow. Western nations are openly pursuing a military defeat of Russia, seeking to push the country into insignificance and to loot its natural wealth, he stated. “Parts of Western elites use every effort to preserve their dominance. That is why they try to block and suppress any sovereign centers of development, so that they can continue to brutally force their will on other nations and peoples, to impose their pseudo-values,” he explained. “Their goal is to weaken, disunite and ultimately destroy our nation.” Some senior officials in NATO states have even suggested that using tactical nuclear weapons against Russian troops would be justified, according to Putin. The president stressed that Moscow would not hesitate to retaliate to such an attack with its own nuclear weapons. If the territorial integrity of our nation is threatened, we will certainly use all the means that we have to defend Russia and our people. Putin also commented on the upcoming referendums in the two Donbass republics and two regions of Ukraine currently controlled to a large extent by Russian troops. The four entities are putting to a general vote a proposal to ask Moscow to accept them as new parts of the Russian Federation, with polling scheduled to start on Friday. The Russian leader pledged to support the plebiscites in terms of security and said his government would respect whatever outcomes they produce. Russia’s goal is to protect civilians from the Ukrainian government, which had escalated the persecution of its opponents at home and had been using terrorist tactics against people living in Russia-controlled lands, Putin said.",1.8740885452577418,1.5193851615001732,0.3547033837575686,8

Kartapolov, who chairs the Defense Committee of the State Duma, was the co-author of the amendments the lower house of the Russian parliament approved on Tuesday. Among other things, they establish criminal penalties for crimes committed during “wartime,” “martial law,” or a “mobilization period.” Fears that this means a mobilization are “absolutely unjustified,” Kartapolov told the Parliamentary Gazette. “There will be no general mobilization. The president has spoken about this more than once and is directly speaking through his press secretary Dmitry Peskov and many other politicians at the federal level.” Having a law is not the same thing as mobilization, Kartapolov argued, adding that the amendments were “not specifically linked to the special military operation” in Ukraine, but were designed to function “for a long time, at least until they are no longer needed.” The adopted amendments include harsher punishments for looting or going AWOL during wartime, or committing any crime during a period of military mobilization. They also criminalize the sabotage of defense contracts. Kartapolov also confirmed that the militias of the Donbass republics would be integrated into the Russian military, in case Donetsk and Lugansk vote to join Russia later this week. This would “significantly change the situation in a number of ways,” he said. Donetsk and Lugansk declared independence in 2014, after a US-backed coup in Kiev. Moscow recognized them in February, shortly before launching the military operation in Ukraine.

He added that what he called a “parody” of democracy might be funny if it weren’t tragic. The French leader was speaking to journalists on Tuesday, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, soon after the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions, announced that they would hold a vote on joining Russia on September 23-27. In Macron’s opinion, holding referendums in a region “that has been bombed, where people have had to flee” is a “signature of cynicism.” “If it weren't tragic, we could laugh about it,” Macron said. As the upcoming plebiscites, in the president’s opinion, are nothing more than “an imitation of democratic form or democratic legitimacy,” they would not have any legal power, Macron said. Accordingly, he said, they would not be recognized by the international community. The president stressed that his country’s position remains unchanged: Russian forces must leave Ukrainian territory and Moscow “should respect internationally recognized borders of Ukraine.” Macron also used his General Assembly speech to stress that negotiations with Moscow and Kiev could only succeed if “the sovereignty of Ukraine is respected.” In condemning the idea of referendums, Macron has joined many other Western politicians who accuse Russia of violating the principles of international law. Meanwhile, the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as a deputy head of the Security Council, claimed that the votes on joining Russia are important “not only for the systemic protection of the residents” of the Donbass republics and of “other liberated territories,” but also “for the restoration of historical justice.” Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has previously vowed to win back all the areas which are now under “Russian occupation,” including the Donbass republics and Crimea.",1.660973315813273,1.3236627301252848,0.3373105856879881,2

Asked if Moscow could be permitted to keep territory gained since the conflict began in February, Erdogan said: “No, and undoubtedly no.” “If a peace is going to be established in Ukraine, of course, the returning of the land that was invaded will become really important. This is what is expected. This is what is wanted,” he said. “The lands which were invaded will be returned to Ukraine,” the Turkish leader added. Erdogan said that “no invasion can be justified,” but acknowledged that at the same time, “prior to the breaking out of this conflict, many things had happened.” A solution therefore won’t be found in “person to the one side entirely and defending the other,” he said. Questioned about Crimea, which reunified with Russia following a 2014 referendum, Erdogan stressed that he had been asking his “dear friend [Vladimir] Putin” to return Crimea to its “rightful owners” but acknowledged this had “unfortunately” not happened. Erdogan has maintained a largely neutral position on the Ukrainian conflict and emphasized to PBS that the United Nations should conduct investigations into alleged war crimes and play the role of arbitrator between the sides. “We are not going to defend a single leader. But, instead, we have to be looking for a conclusion that will satisfy all parties involved,” Erdogan stressed. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, recognized by the Kremlin as independent republics, announced that they would hold referendums on joining Russia from September 23 to 27. The Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions, which are partly controlled by Moscow, said they would also hold votes at the same time. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has previously vowed to win back all the areas which are now under what he calls “Russian occupation,” including the Donbass republics and Crimea. Commenting last week on his country’s recent counteroffensive, Zelensky claimed that the military forces “are gradually, step by step, pushing the occupiers out.”",1.3786196498962071,1.632325382857972,-0.2537057329617649,8
2022-09-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/563196-vladimir-kornilov-it-is-time/,"Vladimir Kornilov: Time to drop our illusions, the West is waging a war to destroy Russia","And here comes Bucha 2.0: Another provocation where Ukraine has allegedly discovered “mass graves of victims” shortly after Russian troops have withdrawn. This time in Izium. What it amounts to is clear evidence that along with the development of the military conflict in Ukraine, the informational “special” operation against Russia is intensifying. It’s not even about Kiev’s reaction – officials there concoct primitive fakes against our state and the army non-stop, around the clock. The indicator here is the way in which this provocation was immediately picked up by Western politicians, who are already urgently calling for an “international tribunal” to punish Russia. Meanwhile, the West’s media, in a united push, is putting unfounded statements about “mass executions and torture in Izium” on its front pages. This fakery is crass and easily refuted. But it is clear from this unanimous reaction of the West that no one there cares at all how and when the people buried in the cemetery died. The culprit has been appointed in advance – and it has to be Russia. Because only this verdict fits into the overall strategy of the current campaign in Ukraine. Which, as we can see, has nothing to do with Ukraine. The West is completely indifferent to whatever happened to the Ukrainians, whoever killed them (even if it was Kiev’s own army or foreign mercenaries) and no matter how many of them died. Because it is not fighting a war on this territory for the Ukrainians,and especially not for Ukraine. We must speak frankly and openly: the West is waging a fierce war against the Russian state, using local forces as proxies. And this is covered by the fig leaf of “defending democracy.” However, what they really want is for Russia to be destroyed. Forever! Irrevocably! Janusz Bugajski, a leading expert, recently published his book “Failed State: A Guide to Russia’s Rupture.” It is worth highlighting that the work is not a reaction to the Ukrainian conflict, instead it is a logical continuation of all that this ‘Kremlinologist’ has been publicly talking and writing about for years. Back in early 2019, three years before the current crisis started, he published a feature article in the influential Washington newspaper The Hill, entitled ‘Managing Russia's Dissolution.’ This was not just a forecast or theoretical speculation by some dreamer, it was a direct call to action by an outspoken Russophobe. Suffice it to recall that Bugajski then openly urged the White House to promote regional and ethnic self-determination within the Russian Federation. At the same time, he was speculating which regions of the state destroyed by the West should receive independence and which should be given to Ukraine, Finland, Japan and even China. It cannot be said that Bugajski’s article was the only theoretical work on the disintegration of our state. But other reports (at least in the public domain) still sought to veil direct calls for the forced break-up of Russia with arguments about the need to weaken our state. This was the case, for example, with a sensational study by the US intelligence corporation RAND commissioned by the US Department of Defense in 2019. Now the masks are being thrown off and the cadre of Russophobes can openly articulate their long-held dreams. The Daily Telegraph recently featured the former NATO commander in Europe, General Ben Hodges, in a high-profile article about preparing for Russia’s disintegration. Hodges, who is employed by CEPA – a lobby group bankrolled by US arms contractors and NATO – is arguably one of the most active ‘talking heads’ about the Ukrainian crisis on Western television right now. The general hopes the collapse of our state will be fueled by our ethnic diversity and he hopes that Western economic sanctions will create a situation in which it will be impossible to feed 144 million people. The American has clearly not thought how these arguments could also be applied to his home country, which has been torn apart by racial divisions in recent years. Below Hodges, the idea has been cheerfully picked up by less well-known figures operating on the ideological field of Russophobia. The Polish magazine New Eastern Europe published an article about deconstructing Russia and reconstructing the “post-Russian space,” calling it a risky but inevitable scenario. The authors called on the West to lead the process of our state’s disintegration right away. This is echoed by the Canadian-British professor Taras Kuzio on the pages of the Atlantic Council, a NATO-aligned pressure group and the main mouthpiece of Western Russophobes. He, too, cheerfully declares that the process of “the collapse of Putin’s Russian empire” has begun. Hodges’ theses are repeated almost word for word by Estonia’s top Kremlinologist Vladimir Yushkin on the pages of the website of the International Centre for Defence and Security. However, he adds nonsense about the allegedly developing “colonization of Siberia by the Chinese” –which tells us he doesn’t know how to use statistics. All these “prophecies” have been brought into the political realm by Estonian President Alar Karis. Opening the NATO Military Committee conference in Tallinn last Friday, he openly admonished the Chiefs of Staff of the US-led bloc to give up their “fear of destabilizing the situation in Russia.” This is not some retired general, nor a private person with a professorial rank - it’s the official head of a NATO member country. And he is not shying away from calling on the high command of the alliance to pursue a deliberate policy of creating a situation of instability in Russia. So, what more proof does anyone need of what the collective West is hoping to achieve? The ideological touchstone of European liberals, The Economist magazine, has devoted its latest issue to how the West should ensure Ukraine’s victory over Russia. Apart from the traditional advice on further arming the Kiev regime, the magazine explicitly demands that the West must try to drive a wedge between the Russian government and the Russian people. To do this, leaders are urged to bet on Russian liberals who have moved abroad, who in these circumstances can be safely called traitors back home. They are now in a situation where Russia’s enemies are now openly talking about using them to carry out an unrealistic plan to dismember our common motherland! Thus, we can safely say that the collective West has already moved from talk to action and is openly challenging the very existence of the Russian Federation. It’s ideologues and a number of top politicians make no secret of the fact that by exploiting the conflict in Ukraine, they are deliberately helping to create an existential threat to our state. The sooner we ourselves officially acknowledge this, the more effectively we will be able to move to a different stage in both relations with our neighbors and the military operation in Ukraine itself. We still adhere to certain gentlemen’s rules of the game, which were adopted after the end of the Cold War. But now the stakes have been raised too high. To be clear, I am not calling for us to copy the criminal actions of Ukraine. We, unlike them, do not deliberately kill children, torture prisoners of war, or exterminate civilians. But in the face of increasing threats to Russian citizens, we are left with no choice but to act much more forcefully against military infrastructure, even if it’s also used by civilians, in the direction of decision-making centres, and towards those individuals directly responsible for terror and murders wherever they are located, as well as tackling states that pursue hostile policies. After all, we should not forget that when an existential threat to Russia arises, we need to present a tough response. Those who threaten our homeland should be constantly reminded of this.",2.565341752511105,2.7865535459575197,-0.22121179344641462,8
2022-09-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/563195-doj-seized-assets-ukraine/,US reveals plan for seized Russian funds,"The US Department of Justice would like Congress to amend laws governing asset forfeiture, so money confiscated from Russian “kleptocrats” can be given to Ukraine, the head of the interagency sanctions task force Andrew Adams told the Senate on Tuesday while testifying at a hearing called “Tightening the Screws on Russia.” Adams, formerly a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), is the head of the interagency Task Force KleptoCapture, a sanctions enforcement outfit created in February. The “scope, intended impact, and international alignment” of the anti-Russia sanctions are “without precedent,” he told senators. Among the proposals he listed at the hearing was a pitch for Congress to amend the existing US asset forfeiture laws, in order to allow the government to “remediate harms caused to Ukraine by Russia’s war of aggression,” as Adams put it. The departments of justice, treasury and state would like the ability to give the funds seized from Russia and Russians to the government in Kiev, but doing so “requires amendments to multiple statutes governing the use of forfeited funds,” he said. Earlier in his testimony, Adams mentioned that the measures implemented by the US and its allies “have included immobilizing the Russian Central Bank’s assets, held in coffers around the world.” It was not clear, however, whether these funds would fall under the scheme to transfer money to Ukraine – something the government in Kiev has demanded for months, both of the US and of the EU. Asset forfeiture is a controversial practice in US law, which proponents have defended as a “key tool” for weakening organized crime and funding law enforcement. Critics, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), have called it “policing for profit” and described it as “egregiously at odds with our due process rights.”",2.134659287209805,2.9583469392179444,-0.8236876520081395,7

At the same time, Putin emphasized that arms makers should study the weapons that Kiev receives from its Western partners, to further improve Moscow’s military performance. “All of NATO's arsenals have been deployed to support the current regime in Kiev, which means that we must and can study them and qualitatively increase our capabilities,” Putin said during a meeting with defense industry representatives. He added that based on the experience gained, Russian arms can then be improved “where necessary.” This “natural process” should be “as speedy and effective as possible,” Putin said, stressing that the defense industry should increase output volumes and reduce production time as much as possible amid the ongoing offensive in Ukraine. Among the most effective Russian weapons, the president listed high-precision long-range missiles, rocket-artillery and armored weapons. These weapons are allowing Russian forces to destroy Kiev’s military infrastructure and command posts, target nationalist formations and at the same time “minimize losses” of Russian personnel. Putin’s remarks came a day after the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba, in an interview with Bloomberg, urged Western nations to supply more weapons to his country. Kuleba said Ukraine’s current counteroffensive, hailed as a success by Kiev and the West, is a “clear message” that sending more supplies “makes sense” and that Ukraine is in a position to “defeat President Putin and his army.” Last week, the US pledged to provide Ukraine with an additional $600 million in military assistance, which will bring the total US military assistance for Ukraine since early 2021 to approximately $15.8 billion. Moscow has consistently warned the US and its allies against “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons saying that it would only prolong the conflict and would lead to more unnecessary casualties without changing the ultimate outcome.",2.6170381383916514,4.246771532752645,-1.629733394360994,8

His statement came early on Tuesday before the leaders of the Donbass republics announced that both would hold votes between September 23 and 27.

A petition calling on the region’s military-civilian administration to hold such a vote was issued on Tuesday by a local group tasked with representing the general public. They asked the region’s authorities “to immediately organize a referendum on the issue of joining our region to the Russian Federation.” “We want certainty and a stable happy future for our homeland,” the civic body’s head, Vladimir Rogov, said during a gathering in the city of Melitopol. “We are ready to fulfill our right for self-determination and settle once and for all the issue of the territorial status of our region.” Later in the day, Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the region’s military-civilian administration, issued an order to hold a general vote as requested, scheduling it for September 23 to 27. Rogov acknowledged that people in the Kiev-controlled part of the region were unlikely to participate under the current circumstances. Voters there would risk retaliation from the Ukrainian government if they did, he explained. The region is split between Russian-controlled and Ukrainian-controlled parts. The latter includes the provincial capital Zaporozhye, located near the northwestern border of the region. Earlier on Tuesday, a similar initiative was issued in Kherson Region, which is mostly controlled by Russian forces.

Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Kuleba indicated that despite a constant flow of Western armaments into the country, Kiev needs even more of them, given that it is now fighting such an “enemy” as Russia. “Sometimes I’m being asked when there is enough of weapons that we have received. And I always say… it will be enough only after Ukraine wins. Until then, we will be asking for more,” he stated. Foreign minister also noted that Kiev’s recent counter-offensive in Kharkov region has shown that the combination of Ukrainian forces’ “stamina” of Kiev’s forces and Western-supplied weapons, most of which come from the US, are “the recipe to defeat Russia on the ground.” Moscow, however, insisted that it pulled its troops back from some areas to “regroup” and to strengthen the Russian forces in the Donetsk region. At the same time, Kuleba admitted that sustainability of Western weapon deliveries is an issue, which needs to be constantly raised by Kiev authorities as they talk with their Western colleagues. NATO has been supporting Ukraine since 2014, but has significantly ramped up its military assistance after Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring country in late February. However, the delays in weapons deliveries have been quite frequent. Last week, Die Welt reported that while Germany has agreed to provide Ukraine with 18 self-propelled RCH-155 howitzers in addition to the military hardware already supplied, the guns would not arrive for at least another 30 months. Earlier this month, Germany’s defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, claimed that Berlin has handed over “an unbelievable amount” of weaponry from its reserves to Ukraine, adding that the country has “reached the limit” in terms of what it can send to Kiev. Moreover, earlier this month, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg acknowledged that the bloc’s members have significantly depleted their weapons stockpiles, urging the Western defense industry to ramp up arms production.",2.581456291210054,2.2577830866322985,0.3236732045777555,7

2022-09-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/563157-russian-criminal-code-wartime/,Russia to toughen punishment for crimes during wartime,"The Russian lower house of parliament, the State Duma, adopted amendments to the Criminal Code on Tuesday, which would impose tougher punishment for crimes committed during “wartime,” “martial law” or a “mobilization period.” The suggested changes include harsher punishments for looting or going AWOL during wartime, or committing any crime during a period of military mobilization. They also criminalize the sabotage of defense contracts. The bill was introduced on Tuesday and swiftly passed by the Duma in three readings. The upper house of the parliament, the Federation Council, is expected to pass the legislation as soon as Wednesday, according to Senator Andrey Klishas, who chairs the Council Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Building. Changes proposed in the bill expand the section of the code that describes crimes such as disobeyal of a lawful order, or violation of military regulations by service personnel. Such felonies committed in wartime or during an armed conflict will be punished by longer prison terms than during peacetime, if the amendment comes into force. For example, briefly leaving service without official leave could land a soldier in a disciplinary unit for a year. The same act would be punishable by five to ten years in jail, if committed “during a period of mobilization or martial law, in wartime or in conditions of armed conflict or combat operations,” according to the draft document. The bill suggests leniency to runaway soldiers, who commit a crime for the first time or under duress, stating that the judge may decide not to punish such offenders. The same applies to soldiers who surrender themselves to the enemy on their own volition, provided that later they rejoin the Russian forces. Failure to do so could lead to a prison term of up to ten years, according to the bill. The draft legislation also seeks to change the section of the criminal code on war crimes. It introduces looting during an armed conflict as a separate felony. The crime would be punishable by up to six years in jail, if the deed did not involve any violence or cause major damage. Violent or organized looters would be imprisoned for up to 15 years, under the proposal. The bill also seeks to change the part of the criminal code which explains aggravating circumstances. The current version lists a number of calamities, during which felons receive tougher punishments, including natural emergencies, mass riots and armed conflicts. Military mobilization, which is not mentioned in the criminal code now, will be added to the list, if the bill is signed into law in its present form. The wording would be also updated to list “martial law” and “wartime” instead of the current “conditions of military conflict or military action”. The bill also criminalizes repeated refusal to accept and execute mandatory defense contracts by companies under Russian jurisdiction.

LPR head Leonid Pasechnik was the first to sign a law on “holding a public referendum in the republic on the inclusion of the region into the Russian Federation,” after its parliament unanimously supported the move and set a date for the vote. The LPR’s decision was soon followed by DPR leader Denis Pushilin, who declared that his state would also be holding a similar referendum on the same date. Pushilin said he had already introduced the relevant legislation in the DPR’s parliament. Russia recognised the two territories as independent in February, but most of the world still regards them as part of Ukraine. However, Kiev lost de facto control of both in 2014, when the local populations rejected the outcome of the Western-backed Maidan coup. In a letter addressed to the Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pushilin urged the latter to consider incorporating the DPR in the territory of the Russian Federation if people approve the unification during the plebiscite. “The long-suffering people of Donbass deserve to be part of the Great Country, which they have always considered their Motherland. This event will be the restoration of historical justice, the onset of which millions of Russian people crave,” he wrote. The announcement of the referendum comes after the civic chamber of the LPR urged republic’s leaders on Monday to “immediately” hold a vote on joining Russia, stating that it was important to expedite the process and hold a vote as soon as possible. “The events of recent days have shown that the Kiev nationalists have crossed all the red lines,” said the deputy head of the chamber, Lina Vokalova, pointing to the relentless shelling of the LPR’s civilian population.She also recalled that the people of Donbass had already made their choice back in 2014, when the first “self-determination referendum” to secede from Kiev’s rule took place. “All these years we have been waiting and believing that the second one will definitely follow, which will fulfill our dream of returning home – to the Russian Federation,” Vokalova added.

Moscow blamed Kiev for the suspension of peace talks. In late March, the two parties discussed a draft peace agreement, which would make Ukraine a neutral state in exchange for security guarantees given by major world powers.

Russian President Vladimir Putin commented on Kiev’s position last week stating: “Zelensky said publicly … that he is not ready to talk to Russia.

James Hecker told the annual Air Force Association conference on Monday, as reported by Politico. The outlet did not elaborate on whether the general provided any evidence to support the massive claim he made. The general, who commands the US Air Forces in Europe – Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA), spoke during a panel discussion about the conflict in Ukraine. Hecker also said Ukraine’s use of anti-aircraft weapons has denied Russian ground forces the air support they needed. He said the situation has surprised Western military analysts. Ukraine is seeking to beef up its air defenses, and the general suggested that eastern European nations, who have old stockpiles of Soviet weapons, should transfer them to Kiev. The top US official also claimed that Ukraine’s air force has mostly remained intact since the start of the conflict, retaining about 80% of its fleet, contrary to reports from Russia. The Russian military claims to have inflicted heavy losses on the Ukrainian air force throughout the conflict. As of Monday, it said it had destroyed 294 Ukrainian warplanes and 155 Ukrainian military helicopters. Part of the panel discussion focused on US efforts to arm Ukrainian warplanes with AGM-88 High Speed Radiation Missiles (HARM) anti-radiation missiles, which were recently included in US arms shipments to Kiev. Hecker said fitting the US-made weapons to Soviet-made aircraft “was quite an effort” for US military contractors and acknowledged that shooting them from F-16s was a better option, according to Breaking Defense outlet.",4.810044466049812,3.084317332786077,1.7257271332637347,0
2022-09-20,https://www.rt.com/russia/563138-kherson-vote-split-ukraine/,Ukraine's Kherson region may hold vote on joining Russia,"The southern Ukrainian Kherson Region may hold a vote to establish whether its people want to break away from Kiev and ask Moscow to accept it as a new region of Russia. On Tuesday, a petition to put the question to a plebiscite was sent to Vladimir Saldo, who leads the administration in the region, which has mostly been under Russian control for months. The call came from a public council, which is tasked with representing the local people. Earlier, the deputy-head of the military-civilian administration, Kirill Stremousov, said the region’s residents “want guarantees that we will become a part of the Russian Federation.” Many people in Kherson ”are afraid that Russia might leave,” Stremousov said. The Kherson civic chamber, which initiated the vote, cited constant attacks by Ukrainian forces as one of the key reasons for the region seeking to formally cede from Kiev. It said being formally accepted as a part of Russia would boost its security. “We are certain that the initiative would be fully supported by the people of Kherson Region, and its addition to Russia would not only restore historic justice, but also open a new path towards the revival and reconstruction of our land and the return to genuine peaceful life,” said Vladimir Ovcharenko, the chair of the civic chamber. The Kherson Region region is located in the southern part of Ukraine and borders Crimea, the former Ukrainian territory that broke away in 2014 after an armed coup in Kiev. Russia took over the city of Kherson and most of the region in March as part of its military operation in Ukraine. Tuesday's news about Kherson comes on the heels of similar developments in the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, the two Donbass regions that Moscow recognizes as sovereign states. On Monday, both announced plans on initiating a vote to join Russia.",2.0789487205082766,2.10323627363904,-0.024287553130763584,2
2022-09-20,https://www.rt.com/news/563129-nato-tanks-ukraine-pentagon/,US tanks ‘absolutely on the table’ for Ukraine – Pentagon,"The United States may provide “NATO compatible” tanks to the Ukrainian military to replace aging Soviet-era gear, a senior Pentagon official has said, as Kiev continues to urge for a steady stream of Western arms amid fierce fighting with Russian troops. Speaking to reporters at an anonymous briefing on Monday, the defense staffer was asked whether the White House was considering heavy armor in future aid packages to Ukraine, noting that Ukrainian lawmakers recently visited the US capital to specifically push for tanks. “Tanks are absolutely on the table along with other areas,” the official said, noting that while Ukrainian troops are more familiar with “Soviet type tanks,” the Pentagon recognizes “that there will be a day when they may want to transition and may need to transition to NATO compatible models.” Pressed on whether Western tanks might be included in upcoming arms deliveries, the official said that would depend on how quickly Ukrainian forces could be trained to use and maintain the vehicles, but added the administration of US President Joe Biden is “certainly open” to the idea. The White House’s latest security package to Kiev was announced last week, worth some $600 million, marking Biden’s 21st presidential weapons drawdown for Ukraine. The aid included additional rounds for US-provided High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 36,000 artillery shells, 1,000 precision-guided munitions, a number of transport vehicles and small arms Washington has stepped up its arms shipments throughout the conflict, eventually agreeing to provide multi-launch rocket systems such as the HIMARS, as well as long-range artillery platforms, months into the conflict. However, the Pentagon has so far refrained from sending some of the US military’s most sophisticated weapons, such as heavy armor or fighter jets, instead agreeing to facilitate transfers of Soviet-era gear from third countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic. Though Biden has approved more than $15 billion in direct military assistance to Ukraine since Russia sent troops into the country in late February, Ukrainian officials continue to push for heavier arms. In addition to American armor, Kiev has also requested Leopard battle tanks, Marder infantry fighting vehicles and Gepard anti-aircraft tanks from Germany in recent weeks, but Berlin has been reluctant to meet most of those demands. “No country has delivered Western-built infantry fighting vehicles or main battle tanks so far,” German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said in an event last week, adding “We have agreed with our partners that Germany will not take such action unilaterally.” The US defense official did not specify what kind of tanks the Pentagon was considering for Ukraine, referring only to “NATO compatible models.” The M1 Abrams is currently Washington’s main battle tank, several configurations of which are ready for export, according to the Drive.",2.665013593989335,2.701634341135981,-0.03662074714664598,7

The details of the law have been worked out and the cabinet just has to present it to the legislature, she added. There are 629 people who will be affected by the change, Kallas was told during an interview. “In any case, we will send this draft law to the Riigikogu during the current government’s term. This has already been agreed upon, and a deadline has been set. We will definitely give time for people to voluntarily hand over their weapons, and after this deadline expires it will be the police’s turn,” she said, according to the outlet Postimees. Asked if she expects the gun owners to comply voluntarily, Kallas said it was “difficult for her to judge.” I hope that given the current circumstances, people will understand that the citizens of Russia and Belarus with weapons in their hands are a threat to the security of Estonia. The former Soviet republic has been an outspoken supporter of Kiev in the current conflict over Ukraine. Last month, the government in Tallinn voted to stop issuing Schengen visas – documents needed to enter the European Union, of which Estonia is a member – to Russian nationals. That too was justified by Kallas as a “security threat.” Between that and the ban on financial transactions with Russia, many Russian nationals who own property in Estonia may end up having it confiscated by the state. Kallas had resigned as PM in July when her coalition fractured over the proposal to switch education in the country of 1.3 million entirely to Estonian. She has since put together another coalition cabinet, and is proceeding with the plan to make sure that “in Estonia, everyone must speak the state language, especially those who make decisions.” That statement came in reference to Narva, a city on the Russian border where the local government mainly converses in Russian.",2.3984799042078935,2.3896244638428366,0.008855440365056921,8

In two separate cases, a translator with the mission, Maksim Petrov, and one of its employees, Dmitry Shabanov, were found guilty of committing high treason. Each was sentenced to 13 years in prison. According to Lugansk’s State Security Service, Petrov had been collecting information about a military unit, working directly for a handler with a US spy agency. Shabanov is said to have also colluded with an unspecified foreign intelligence service. The cases were heard behind closed doors and the exact circumstances of the treason remain unknown. The head of the LPR, Leonid Pasechnik, banned the OSCE monitoring mission from the republic back in April. He explained that during the conflict between the Donbass republics and Ukraine, which has dragged on since 2014, the mission never actually contributed to the peace process, routinely failed to properly register numerous violations by Kiev, and ultimately became popularly known as “blind observers”. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-09-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/563126-german-afd-donbass-visit/,Ukraine furious over German MPs' Donbass trip,"The Deputy head of the opposition AfD in Germany's Saxony-Anhalt legislature, Hans-Thomas Tillschneider, hit back at Ukraine's ambassador to Berlin, on Monday, after he attacked their planned visit to Donbass. Andrey Melnik had labelled the group “agents of Russian propaganda,” but the politician countered that the diplomat is spreading “fake news.” Several AfD lawmakers intend to visit to make the trip in the coming days. Russia recognises the Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics as independent states, but Berlin regards them as part of Ukraine. Melnik, on Sunday tweeted “AfD MPs visit Moscow-occupied eastern Ukraine next week to support [Russia’s] war of extermination. This is a criminal offense (incitement to the crime of aggression),” and called on Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV, also known as Verfassungsschutz), to take action. He linked to a conspiracy theory-laden report by the US-based Robert Lansing Institute for Global Threats and Democracies Studies claiming “the Kremlin has urged its spies in Western Europe to carry out information and psychological ops” using the AfD lawmakers. Tillschneider responded to Melnik, calling him an “amateur lawyer, [Stepan] Bandera fan and ex-ambassador” who is “spreading fake news.” Bandera was a World War Two Nazi collaborator, who is revered in contemporary Ukraine. “In view of the distorted and partisan reporting on the Ukraine conflict, we want to get our own picture of the situation and assess the humanitarian situation,” Tillschneider added. His colleague Daniel Wald said he would be part of a “harmless delegation trip to Russia and eastern Ukraine.” Melnik has served as Ukraine's ambassador in Berlin since 2015 and is due to leave office later this month. The exchange drew the attention of German media, which had largely ignored the week-old AfD announcement that six state parliamentarians, from Saxony-Anhalt and North Rhine-Westphalia, would visit Donbass between September 20-28. German media coverage repeated the Lansing Institute claims that the AfD “coordinates” with Russian intelligence, and that the visit will “promote Russian reading of the situation in the Donbas, with Ukrainian army discredited, and Russia’s humanitarian efforts highlighted.” Contacted by the Tagesspiegel, the foreign ministry in Berlin said it had no information about the trip. The Lansing Institute is named after President Woodrow Wilson’s secretary of state at the time of the First World War, and is incorporated in President Joe Biden’s home state of Delaware. It does not disclose its funding sources or management, and the report about the AfD visit was not signed. The institute’s director general is Armand Chouet, a “former DRM imagery analyst, Paris-based analyst in the field of North Africa region.”",2.5878679713543136,2.67166815050093,-0.0838001791466163,5
2022-09-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/563119-moscow-bioweapons-convention-proposal/,Russia floats bioweapons proposal,"Russia has urged amendments to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), floating three ideas to reinforce the landmark international agreement and make it more legally binding for its parties. The proposals were announced on Monday by Igor Kirillov, who heads Russia’s Nuclear Biological and Chemical Defense Troops. The proposals were designed after a meeting of BCW member states in Geneva that were held earlier this month, Kirillov told a media briefing. The meeting was convened by Russia, which has accused the US and Ukraine of violating the agreement. Moscow has raised allegations against the two counties of conducting secretive biological research on Ukrainian soil, claiming it had obtained incriminating evidence during the ongoing military operation. The Russian military has repeatedly released said materials to the public in batches since March. “The participants of the meeting were provided copies of real documents previously publicized by the Russian Defense Ministry, as well as with material evidence confirming the implementation of military biological programs on the territory of Ukraine,” Kirillov said. “None of the delegations had any doubts about the authenticity of the submitted documents, including in terms of the accumulation of pathogenic materials in Ukrainian laboratories,” he added. Still, the BWC member-states meeting failed to provide any tangible result and only “a ‘zero’, non-binding statement was adopted,” Kirillov admitted. Due to a lack of reaction from the group, Russia has now proposed a set of changes to the BWC, supposed to make the document – which effectively bans creating and stockpiling bioweapons – more legally binding. Namely, Russia calls for the “resumption of negotiations on a legally binding protocol to the Convention, which includes lists of microorganisms, toxins, equipment” and also provides “an effective verification mechanism,” Kirillov suggested. The comprehensive list may work in a similar fashion as the list of banned materials provided with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), the official suggested. Moscow also calls for the creation of a “scientific advisory committee” within the group. The committee should have a broad “geographical representation” and equal rights for all of the participants. Russia has proposed making the control mechanisms more transparent, with additional “confidence-building measures,” suggesting the BWC participants must be obliged to declare their “activities in the biological sphere outside the national territory.” The US has said that Russia is using its bioweapons claims, which Washington deems to be disinformation and a conspiracy theory, as a way to justify its military actions in Ukraine. The meeting in Geneva ended with the delegates of 35 out of 89 nations either dismissing the Russian claims or expressing support for the kind of research the US and Ukraine were conducting, the State Department said in a statement. Only seven nations expressed support for Russia: Belarus, China, Cuba, Iran, Nicaragua, Syria, and Venezuela. Back in March, the UN said that it was not aware of this program and has neither the mandate nor the technical operational capacity to investigate it. In May, the UN stood by its initial statement.",2.2529735816564345,2.8974462636554033,-0.6444726819989688,8

Addressing the head of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, the chamber said the time for “decisive actions” has come, urging him to hold the vote as soon as possible. “All of us feel and know for a long time that Donbass is Russia, we have been fighting for this for eight long years. For this, we daily suffer strikes on our homes, streets, hospitals, schools and kindergartens,” the head of the chamber, Aleksander Kofman, said in a statement.

Earlier in the day, a similar call was made by the civic chamber of the LPR. It urged the head of the republic, Leonid Pasechnik, as well as the local legislature, to hold a referendum on joining Russia as soon as possible.

Pelosi visited the Armenian capital Yerevan on Sunday and accused Azerbaijan of launching an “illegal and deadly” cross-border attack against Armenia earlier in the week. Baku claimed it retaliated after provocations from Yerevan. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that while Russia welcomed any genuine effort to defuse tensions between the two sides, the US official’s comments were not very diplomatic. “Can actions and statements as brazen as hers actually help with normalization? We’ll see, time will tell,” Peskov told journalists, adding that Moscow’s preference is for “quiet” diplomacy in such scenarios. Pelosi also used the visit to criticize Russia’s military cooperation with Armenia, saying Armenians “were disappointed they got fact-finders and not protection,” from the relationship, suggesting Washington may be a better guarantor of security. Pelosi was referring to the response of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), which Yerevan had called on to deploy troops in response to the flare-up. The CSTO sent a fact-finding mission to inspect the region, and mission chief Col. Gen. Anatoly Sidorov stated that the organization “prioritizes political-diplomatic methods” and is “not in a rush to draw the saber.” Some Armenian officials were disappointed, with Armen Grigoryan, chair of the Armenian National Security Council, hinting that Yerevan could withdraw from the CSTO. During Pelosi’s trip, several hundred people gathered in the Armenian capital to demand the country quit the organization. The activists gathered outside of the venue hosting the US official, waving Armenian and American flags and claiming that Washington should replace Moscow as Yerevan’s primary defense ally.

Speaking to journalists on Monday, Peskov said: “It’s the same scenario as in Bucha. It all goes according to one scenario. It’s a lie,” while pledging that Moscow “will of course defend the truth in this whole story.” In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky compared the scenes witnessed by Ukrainian troops in the Kharkov region to a “bloody soap opera after Bucha.” The Ukrainian authorities, as well as Western governments and human rights groups, accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in the town of Bucha near Kiev in early April – something Moscow has vehemently denied. Zelensky said that “as of today, there are 450 dead people” recovered from mass burial sites in the city of Izium, which was retaken by the Ukrainian military earlier this month. The president went on to claim that “there are others, separate burials of many people. Tortured people. Entire families in certain territories.” When asked whether Kiev can prove its claim of war crimes committed by Russian forces, Zelensky said: “there is some evidence, and assessments are being conducted, Ukrainian and international.” Also on Friday, Oleg Sinegubov, governor of the Kharkov region, told journalists that some of the bodies exhumed in Izyum had their hands tied behind their backs. Later in the day, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at a briefing that the mass burial site uncovered in northeast Ukraine is “part, horrifically, of a continuum, an ongoing story.” The US diplomat also stressed the need for Ukraine and its partners to “build the evidence and document the atrocities that have been committed,” as “in many instances, these amount to war crimes.”",2.1454869168589643,3.4235029360041076,-1.2780160191451433,5

The top UN official commented on moves by the EU and individual member states, which make visas for Russian travelers harder or even impossible to obtain. When asked by the Russian news agency RIA Novosti if he considered the measures a violation of the rights of Russian citizens, Guterres said they were part of the deterioration of relations between the EU and Russia. “I obviously hope that after the war is over, these situations disappear,” the news agency quoted him on Monday as having said in an interview. Guterres remarked that some Russians sought to leave their home country after it sent troops into Ukraine in late February, so the decision by EU members “may not be a good idea,” the report said. The EU as a bloc this month suspended a visa facilitation agreement with Russia. Some member states stop issuing tourist and business visas, while four of them, the three Baltic states and Poland, announced they would deny entry to Russian citizens with valid Schengen visas issued by other nations. The UN chief also commented on the long-lasting spat between the US and Russia over Washington’s refusal to issue visas to Russian diplomats, who need to take part in various events at the UN headquarters in New York. Guterres said that his office was insisting that visas should be granted by the host nation as requested by other members of the UN. However, he added, there was little he could do to force the US’ hand. “I sincerely doubt that [the Russia-requested] arbitrage would lead to a positive result. And in any case, it would not change – probably it would even get worse – the attitude of the host country. The arbitrage would not be able to have any compulsive measure” he said.

The incident happened early on Monday morning, according to the president. The projectile landed some 300 meters from the facility, causing damage to windows and briefly disrupting power supplies to the grid, he wrote on social media. Zelensky posted surveillance footage purportedly showing the strike. The video shows a powerful explosion against the backdrop of the night skyline and was apparently filmed by a malfunctioning digital camera. The frames appear to be out of order, and the timestamps go back and forth. The president’s post also included photos of broken windows, presumably caused by the blast. Zelensky accused Russia of “endangering the world” and said it should be “stopped, before it is too late”. The South Ukraine nuclear power plant is located near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk, deep inside Ukraine-controlled territory in the south of the country. The facility has been operating since 1982 and has three VVER-1000 reactors. Zelensky’s accusations against Russia add to a long list of nuclear-related allegations. Kiev and Moscow have for weeks been pointing the finger at each other over attacks on the Russian-controlled city of Energodar, which hosts the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited the facility earlier this month, confirming damage caused by multiple shelling incidents, but declining to attribute them to either side.",3.8965414657609827,4.578223778984774,-0.6816823132237912,0

He acknowledged that EU nations will first have to be convinced to allow the export of Russian fertilizers through their ports. The offer to donate an estimated 300 tons of Russian fertilizer, unable to leave EU ports due to anti-Russian sanctions, came last Friday from Russian President Vladimir Putin. In late July, the UN co-mediated an arrangement with Ukraine and Russia, which allowed the resumption of Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. As part of the deal, the organization pledged to help ease Western restrictions on international trade that Russia says prevent it from exporting its food products and fertilizers. “This week I had an intensive series of contacts with the leaders of the EU. And I hope there will be a positive change with regard to the possibility of distributing Russian grain and fertilizers without obstacles through Europe to other markets,” Guterres told RIA Novosti in another part of the interview, which was published on Saturday. Putin previously criticized the grain deal, saying that while it was touted as a way to help poor countries deal with surging global food prices, in practice Ukrainian exports mostly went to rich EU nations. The abundance of grain and other food products from Ukraine on European markets has apparently angered local producers, who are struggling to compete with the cheaper imports, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. The EU previously had quotas and steep tariffs for Ukraine trade, protecting its own farmers and forcing Ukrainians to export most of their produce to other places. But the restrictions were lifted after Russia attacked the country in February, and European governments rushed to support Kiev with various forms of assistance.",4.156861832557138,3.6406720347631385,0.5161897977939995,7
2022-09-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/562799-war-of-1812-victorious-retreat/,"Bait and switch: How Russia handed Moscow to Napoleon 210 years ago, but went on to win the war","Two hundred and ten years ago, on September 15, 1812, the French Army led by Emperor Napoleon entered the Kremlin in Moscow. In the eyes of the world, it was all over – the largest city in Russia was lying prostrate at the feet of the world’s greatest military supremo. In three months, however, what remained of Napoleon’s army was fleeing – the corps and regiments mere shadows of their former selves. The huge forces that invaded Russia in the summer were all but destroyed by the end of the year; the exact losses are debated to this day, but the number of soldiers dead or captured is estimated to have been between 400,000 and 500,000. The classic Western narrative is that Napoleon had to retreat because of the Russian winter, his forces beaten down by the harsh climate. The standard Russian view is that Napoleon was met by a different natural force – patriotism, which drove ordinary people to take up arms against the French invaders, complementing the efforts of the regular army. Leo Tolstoy’s account of the war contributed to this image, and it’s hard to compete with the power of his literary genius. However, little was random or ‘natural’ in the defeat of Napoleon. First of all, it is hard to imagine that such a seasoned general had forgotten to consider the climate of the country he set out to conquer. In fact, Napoleon had already waged winter campaigns. The Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 was lost by the Russians under colder temperatures than the Battle of Berezina – where the Russians prevailed. Meanwhile, the Battle of Eylau, which ended inconclusively for both parties, occurred during heavy snowstorms. In other words, Napoleon was not some African chieftain who could be excused for never having seen snow in his life. The grassroots resistance story is also far from accurate. It wasn’t the first time that Napoleon had to fight against a popular militia – in Spain, such forces played an auxiliary role to Wellington’s regular corps, and the French Army wasn’t destroyed so totally and swiftly. Russians themselves faced a guerrilla war in Finland during the Swedish campaign of 1808-09, when the winter was extremely harsh. But it did not stop the Russian offensive. In other words, neither snow nor mass resistance could guarantee the outcome, and certainly could not ensure the defeat of a massive army led by a brilliant general. The War of 1812 was unusual. At first, the French Army advanced and the Russian defenders pulled back. None of the battles could alter the course of the conflict. Napoleon then began to retreat, but the ensuing confrontations did not have any significant impact on the overall situation either. Napoleon kept going backwards after each one, and the Russians kept following his army. But the Russians were not simply reacting to a campaign that seemed to have its own internal logic – they had a detailed plan. The scheme had its roots in the failed campaigns of 1805 and 1806-07. After a series of humiliating defeats, Tsar Alexander I and Napoleon signed the Treaties of Tilsit. However, this peace deal did not resolve the conflict between the two countries, and everyone realized it was nothing more than a brief interlude. Napoleon was great at achieving tactical objectives, and this presented a problem. Also, up to that point, Russia had always been part of a coalition, including Austria and Prussia – but now they were under Napoleon’s rule and were unable to help. This meant that the enemy would have a lot more troops, led by the great military commander. Nobody would have bet on the Russian Army under these circumstances. Therefore, it needed to come up with asymmetric measures. Using a sports analogy, the Russians had to drag Mike Tyson into a shooting tournament. By April 1812, this idea was developed into an action plan. Curiously, it was drawn up by a person who is not well known in present-day Russia. He was Lieutenant Colonel Pyotr Chuykevich, and he served in the War Ministry’s Special Office, a secret department not many knew of. The Special Office was one of the pet projects of War Minister Michael Barclay de Tolly, a Russian prince and soldier of Baltic German and Scottish origin. Barclay de Tolly was a brilliant and successful commander, though his talents were in areas that do not usually bring military glory – he was great at organizing supply chains, logistics, and gathering intelligence. In other words, he was good at the things that are rarely noticed until they become the army’s biggest weaknesses. Chuykevich was one of his appointees to the Special Office, which was, in fact, Russia’s first official intelligence gathering agency. Chuykevich produced an analytical note titled ‘Patriotic Thoughts’, which was delivered to Barclay de Tolly. Having carefully studied the composition of the French Army and Napoleon’s preferred strategy, the lieutenant colonel reasoned that the best way forward was to not let the French Army use its massive advantage in power. He suggested avoiding a general battle to spare Russia’s troops, and retreating while conducting guerrilla warfare, especially in the rear of the enemy, in order to hit their supply lines and exhaust and weaken Napoleon’s army to eventually gain the advantage. It was a sound plan. There were only two possibilities for the formidable French Army to obtain supplies: By having them delivered from Western Europe, or pillaging and foraging for them. Obviously, deliveries from the West would not be reliable due to the enormous and ever-growing distances the convoys would have to cover, as well as the appalling condition of the Russian roads. And if the French Army was betting on foraging for supplies locally, another problem arose. Since the population density in Russia was (and still is) much lower than in other parts of Europe, Napoleon’s foraging missions had to travel far and wide in order to obtain enough provisions. And that is when they would run into a second problem. The Russians were creative in organizing partisan operations. In fact, this designation covered two distinct phenomena. On the one hand, there were regular detachments active in the rear of the French Army’s operating line. They were led by officers and consisted of Cossacks, dragoons, hussars, and sometimes light infantry. They often had their own light artillery. These units carried out reconnaissance, destroyed foragers, and intercepted couriers. The French also had to deal with irregular units consisting of peasants who sought to prevent marauders and foragers from entering their villages. Many such units were headed by the local landlord, who would often be a retired military officer versed in the basics of military organization. They tried to recruit peasants who had some experience with weapons and outdoor living – hunters, whippers-in, foresters, and so on. These units communicated with each other using church bells. Naturally, armed peasants could do little against the French Army, but this was never expected of them – all they had to do was to alert the regular partisan forces. If the partisans failed to deter the enemy, the regular army came to the rescue. This arrangement was not ideal, but it worked much of the time. Within this paradigm, the main army forces had a peculiar role. They had to remain in Napoleon’s sight, limiting his army’s freedom and preventing it from straggling across a large distance or moving across the country freely. The Russian Army used this approach because being aware of its presence, the French could neither relax nor disperse. As a result, the French forces had not even finished their offensive when they began to starve. They were unable to obtain enough food, and couldn't send enough troops to protect communications because Napoleon needed a force capable of confronting the main Russian Army. In addition, the Russians were retreating ever further. The French were already hundreds of kilometers away from their bases and had to leave a lot of people in the rear to maintain order, while supplies from the West had dried up. The battle near the village of Borodino, which Mikhail Kutuzov – the commander-in-chief of the Russian forces – agreed to fight, was at odds with this logic. However, Kutuzov was a politician as well as a military leader. He realized that giving up Moscow without a major battle would be something Russian society would not forgive. Yet he was perfectly aware of the fact that the reasons for fighting were more political than military, so, after the first day of the battle failed to result in a decisive win for either side, instead of pressing on (which would only have led to the utter defeat of the battle-weary Russian Army), he retreated and surrendered Moscow to save the Russian forces. As a result, by entering Moscow, Napoleon grabbed the cheese in the mousetrap. Russia's largest city kept him stranded for several weeks. All that time, the French emperor was trying to negotiate for peace, but he failed. Those weeks put the Grande Armée on the brink of disaster. After a while, the French retreated. As they embarked on the long trek back home, the weather was fine and the horrors of the ‘dreadful Russian winter’ – which, in reality, turned out to be quite ordinary – were yet to come, but the army was already beginning to suffer from starvation. As the temperatures dropped below freezing, horses started dying, and some of them were slaughtered for food. No horses meant no cavalry, making the French vulnerable to Russian mobile cavalry units that were harassing Napoleon’s army. The next steps taken by Field Marshal Kutuzov were predictable. He continued to send in fresh forces against the French rear guard, trying to avoid major clashes and keeping the French moving. The Russian troops were not immune to the cold either, and just like the French, they had stragglers and those who fell ill. However, while Russian soldiers could stay in nearby villages until they recovered, the Frenchmen either had to stay behind and be taken prisoner, or keep going until they developed complications. Once weakened, they became vulnerable to infection. One of the key things Kutuzov ordered his officers to do might not sound heroic, yet was practical. The Russians were deliberately targeting French stores of food. Thus, the defeat of General Jean-Pierre Augereau’s brigade at the village of Lyakhovo by partisans was, in essence, a nice bonus in the hunt for supply depots. The French Army did not freeze to death, but it was starving, while the battles looked more like executions, as the Russians used artillery to disperse French units marching past them, without the need for general engagement. The French couldn’t put up much of a fight anyway, as most of their horses had been eaten and their guns had been left behind. The wounded soldiers faced the same dilemma as the sick – either be dragged along with the risk of complications and infections, or be left at the mercy of the Russians – which was actually not a bad idea. Suffering from the cold and the hardships of the autumn and later winter pursuit, the Russian troops were not inclined to inflict even more pain on the captive Frenchmen. After most of Marshal Michel Ney’s corps was destroyed near Krasny, survivors simply walked towards the Russian positions to ask where they could surrender. Their guns were taken away from them and they were sent to the campfires where Russian soldiers, who were just as cold and miserable, would give their prisoners vodka to feel a little warmer inside. This may seem surreal, but not to those who were on a march in sub-zero temperatures for days. One of the key elements of this ‘choking’ strategy was an operation undertaken by the small Army of the Danube led by Pavel Chichagov behind Napoleon’s lines. These days, Chichagov is mostly remembered as the man who failed to close the trap and allowed what remained of the French Army to escape at the battle near the Berezina River. However, the most important part of Chichagov’s operation was what did before, not during, the Battle of Berezina. Before he proceeded to try to ensnare Napoleon at the Berezina, Chichagov captured Minsk, the key supply depot of the French which held two million daily rations. He did not even have to be at the Berezina, as he had smashed the French Army’s chances of surviving. Due to a personal conflict with Kutuzov and his ultimate failure to trap Napoleon, Chichagov was not hailed as a war hero; however, his main success was the battle against the supply lines. And that was the moment when the bitter cold really set in, killing people who were trudging westward across snow-covered plains and forests. But the weather was just the final nail in the Grand Armée’s coffin, finishing off an army that had already been routed. For Russia, 1812 signified not just a great military triumph, but also the victory of intelligence and self-control over brute force. The Russians had a plan and stuck to it, while Tsar Alexander I was resolute enough to stay on course even after Napoleon captured Moscow. The courage of the soldiers, the climate, and other obvious factors played a role, but the War of 1812 is, above all else, a triumph of strategy and consistency in pursuing goals.",3.5328214589917235,3.7167498467817177,-0.1839283877899942,6

The remnants of the battalion have been withdrawn from the frontline, it added. Russian forces have also conducted strikes on Ukrainian hardware, personnel and some 47 artillery units across more than 120 locations. “In particular, deployment points of foreign mercenaries with the American private security company Academi and the nationalist unit Kraken [were hit] near Kramatorsk and Nikolayevka in the Donetsk People’s Republic,” the military said, without elaborating.

This was initiated by the Azeris and there has to be recognition of that,” she insisted. Border clashes erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan on Tuesday, with both sides accusing each other of initiating the violence. Yerevan has said it lost 135 troops in the fighting, with Baku putting its death toll at 79 soldiers. The two former Soviet republics remain at odds over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which has been controlled by ethnic Armenian forces, supported by Yerevan, since the 1990s, but is claimed by Azerbaijan as part of its territory. The neighboring countries fought a 44-day war over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020, which ended with a Russia-brokered truce and the ceding of some territories to Baku. “The territorial security and sovereignty of Armenia, the democracy of Armenia is of value to us in America. In our relationships with other countries we should be using our influence, our leverage, showing that Armenian democracy and sovereignty are a priority,” Pelosi insisted.

2022-09-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/563021-russia-nuclear-doctrine-ukraine/,Kremlin responds to Western nuclear claims,"Moscow has reiterated that its nuclear doctrine is self-explanatory, with top Russian officials repeatedly stating that the conflict in Ukraine does not meet any of its criteria. The statement followed US President Joe Biden’s threat of a harsh, “consequential” response should Russia use weapons of mass destruction. “Read the doctrine, everything is written there,” Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told RIA Novosti on Saturday, when asked about the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. According to Russia’s nuclear posture, Moscow reserves the right to use atomic weapons only “in response to the use of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction against Russia or its allies,” as well as “in response to a conventional attack that threatens the very existence” of Russia as a sovereign state. The latest update to the doctrine, made in 2020, clarified two more scenarios for the possible use of nuclear arms: receiving “credible information about the launch of ballistic missiles” targeting the territory of Russia or its allies, or an attack “on critical infrastructure that controls nuclear weapons,” potentially rendering the deterrent inoperable. However, none of these hypothetical scenarios is relevant to the situation in Ukraine, Russian officials told the UN Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference in New York on several occasions last month. In mid-August, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu also dismissed as “absurd” claims that Moscow might use nukes in Ukraine, saying there are no targets there that would warrant doing so. Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Friday that so far, Moscow has demonstrated a reserved reaction to actions by the Ukrainian authorities, such as attempts to target vital infrastructure on Russian soil or to stage “terror attacks.” “We’re witnessing attempts to stage terror attacks, attempts to damage our civilian infrastructure. We respond to this with restraint, but only for the time being,” Putin stated, triggering speculation that the approach may change in the future. In an interview with CBS News, a part of which was released on Friday, US President Joe Biden was asked what he would say if he learned that Moscow is considering the use of weapons of mass destruction. “Don’t, don’t, don’t,” Biden said. “You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.” However, the US president declined to specify what the US response would be, only saying it would be “consequential.”",3.1585106388863013,2.059108932201147,1.0994017066851542,8

A picture of one of Zelensky's armed guards wearing an SS-style patch has been quietly removed from all platforms. The photo, originally released on the presidential website, Telegram, and other social media, featured a soldier with a stylized skull and crossbones symbol that closely resembles the one used by the 3rd SS Panzer Division ‘Totenkopf’. The insignia, commonly viewed as a hate symbol, is popular among many neo-Nazis. The offensive patch appeared to be a modernized, ‘tactical’ version of the insignia, with the skull adorned with a ballistic helmet with headphones. But the helmet appears to display the skeleton key symbol, the insignia of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler. The apparent attempt at damage control, however, was only partial successful. The patch is still partially visible on another photo that is still up on one of Zelensky's social media accounts. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly denied the presence of any neo-Nazi elements in the country’s military, bluntly dismissing such assertions as “Russian propaganda.” Despite that, Ukrainian soldiers sporting various neo-Nazi symbols have repeatedly turned up in official photographs published by the country’s authorities.

The Ukrainian leader singled out Germany, where he said the legacy of the Nazis creates “psychological barriers” to sending heavy armaments. Zelensky said that mass graves in the Kharkov region had been found containing “burials of many people,” including “entire families,” some of whom had been tortured. He claimed that “there is some evidence” that war crimes had been committed. Ukraine re-established control over parts of the region last week, following an offensive and the withdrawal of Russian and Donbass troops stationed there. Ukrainian officials then claimed to have found a mass grave near the city of Izium, prompting Western leaders and media outlets to condemn the “atrocities” allegedly committed by Russian forces. While Moscow has not yet commented on the allegations, some reports from the area suggest that the corpses may have belonged to Ukrainian soldiers who were hastily buried by Russian troops after the Ukrainian military stopped collecting its dead earlier this summer. The grave plots seen on some of the pictures were marked with crosses reading ‘VSU’, the Russian abbreviation for ‘Armed Forces of Ukraine’. Zelensky has repeatedly accused Russia of committing war crimes, including the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol and the killing of civilians in Bucha. Moscow described the former event as a “staged provocation” by Ukraine, and the latter allegations as false. In the interview with Reuters, Zelensky called for more countries to send weapons to his military. ""We would want more help from Turkey, We would want more help from South Korea. More help from the Arab world. From Asia,"" he said. Addressing Germany, which has exhausted its own military stockpiles to arm Ukraine and refuses to send its heavy battle tanks, Zelensky claimed that Germans have “certain psychological barriers” to increasing arms deliveries, stemming from their Nazi past. While the Ukrainian president described Russia as “fascist,” Ukraine is the only country in the world to have integrated neo-Nazi militias into its regular armed forces, and Ukrainian troops, including Zelensky’s own bodyguards, are regularly photographed wearing Nazi insignia.",3.053700705060412,2.368150221913678,0.6855504831467338,5
2022-09-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/563003-pentagon-list-weapons-ukraine/,Pentagon releases Ukraine weapons list,"The US Department of Defense has released a list of nearly every weapon it’s donated to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s military operation in February. While the US has already given $15 billion worth of arms, Kiev insists it needs more. Released on Friday, the list accounts for most of the $15.8 billion in security assistance sent to Ukraine since President Joe Biden took office. The majority of that – $15.1 billion – has come since Russian troops entered Ukraine in February. Biden has allocated around $55 billion for military and economic assistance to Kiev, with most US weapons packages funded by a $40 billion spending bill passed by Congress in May. Included on the list are more than 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missile launchers, 126 155mm howitzers with up to 806,000 shells, 16 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), 20 Mi-17 helicopters, over 60 million rounds of small arms ammunition, over 50 counter-artillery radars, and the use of America’s commercial spy satellites. Kiev claims that these weapons have allowed its troops to conduct successful counter-offensives against Russian forces. However, a long-awaited Ukrainian offensive near Kherson last month ended disastrously, with more than 1,200 Ukrainian troops killed and dozens of armored vehicles destroyed, according to Moscow. The Ukrainians fared better in a more recent offensive near Kharkov, capturing a swath of territory ceded by a lighter force of Russian and Donbass troops. Ukraine’s territorial gains around Kharkov came at a heavy cost, with the Russian military claiming to have killed 4,000 and wounded another 8,000 Ukrainian troops and foreign mercenaries. Nevertheless, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky declared that the Kharkov offensive marked a ‘turning point” in the conflict, and that if Ukraine were “a little stronger with weapons,” it could beat the Russian military. To that end, Kiev has been publicly and privately asking the US for more advanced arms, including long-range missiles and F-16 fighter jets. Some American officials and lawmakers have warned that US weapons stockpiles are running low amid the unprecedented arms surge to Ukraine. In a bid to keep the weapons flowing, Zelensky is expected to appeal directly to US defense contractors during an industry conference next week.",3.1308471076253452,1.4654889678198533,1.665358139805492,7
2022-09-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/563001-ukraine-shelling-zaporozhye-nuclear/,Ukraine once again endangering nuclear plant – Moscow,"Ukraine has again shelled the area around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in an effort to undermine the facility’s safety, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed on Saturday. The ministry said that “the Kiev regime has resumed provocations to create the threat of a man-made disaster” at the plant. Within the last 24 hours, the Russian military registered two Ukrainian artillery strikes, one on a suburban settlement and the other on a thermal substation in the vicinity of the facility, which has been under Russian control since March. “In total, 15 artillery shells were fired from the Nikopol area of the Dnepropetrovsk region. The artillery units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were suppressed by retaliatory fire,” the statement read. According to the Defense Ministry, the radiation situation at the plant remains normal. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the grounds of the plant, warning that the attacks could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the Chernobyl incident. Earlier this week, the head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, accused Washington of supplying Kiev with crucial intelligence to designate targets for shelling around the facility. “The consequences of these provocations could be very catastrophic not only for the majority of the population of Ukraine and Russia but also for Europe, and in terms of their scale they could surpass the tragedies that occurred at the nuclear power plants in Chernobyl and Fukushima,” he said at the time. Ukraine has blamed Russia for the incidents, alleging that Moscow has been carrying out the strikes to frame Ukraine, even though its military eventually admitted to targeting the area. Following the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission that visited the Zaporozhye plant in early September, the UN’s nuclear watchdog adopted a resolution demanding that Russia “immediately cease all actions against and at” the plant. Russian officials, however, criticized the document, saying that it failed to mention Ukraine’s attacks on the station. Blasting the resolution as “anti-Russian,” Moscow also accused Western nations of “supporting and shielding” Kiev in “every possible way.”",3.333210643180505,3.207101825909913,0.12610881727059198,9
2022-09-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/562803-best-defense-is-good-offence/,Leaked documents expose Ukrainian attempts to destabilize Russia and draw NATO into a full-scale war with Moscow,"The best defense is a good offence. So goes one of the oldest principles of international relations. And as Ukrainian documents now at the disposal of the media show, Moscow apparently had something to defend itself from when it launched its offensive in Ukraine. Over the past eight years, Kiev’s military and special services have been preparing numerous operations aimed at undermining Russia’s international ties, and internal peace itself. In June, a hacker Telegram channel dubbed ‘Beregini’ published the action plan of the Information and Psychological Operations Department of the Armed Forces of Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces (SSO). According to official information, the tasks of this unit include working with the population of foreign countries, creating agent networks, and infiltrating special services and military organizations to conduct espionage and destroy people who pose a threat to the Ukrainian government (including in other countries), as well as preparing coups and the overthrow of regimes. The SSO plan was prepared back in 2017, and this is just one of many similar secret documents created by Ukrainian spooks. It was just one that became public. But the presence of these plans and the real political and military steps taken by Ukraine, which coincide with SSO programs to a surprising extent, indicate that KI’ve has been actively carrying out anti-Russian activities since at least 2014, when a Western-backed coup took place in the country. When studying the Ukrainian plan from 2017, the first thing that catches the eye is the variety of operations aimed at creating a split in Russian society. Operation ‘Zaslon’ describes a scheme to influence the family members of Donbass soldiers and militiamen, as well as Russian army personnel. The operation’s main goals include blocking military units and encouraging desertion and resignations in the militaries of ‘Eastern,’ the document’s code word for Russia and the Donbass republics. In the event of an outbreak of hostilities, a transition to Operation ‘Bolotnaya Square’ was planned. This consists of cultivating distrust of Russia’s military and political leadership among the country’s population, as well as fomenting dissent “against the aggressive policy of the ‘Eastern’ president and his entourage,” in order to incite mass protests. Ukraine’s actual actions confirm the authenticity of these plans. Even after Crimea’s reunification with Russia, Russian citizens could be found who sided with Kiev. It is noteworthy that in 2018, a fake news story claiming that 300 people had died in a fire at Kemerovo’s Winter Cherry shopping center originated in Ukraine. No less revealing is the story of a Ukrainian Special Forces employee who called on Russians to protest against “pension genocide,” but forgot to change his Ukrainian IP address. The number of Ukrainian sympathizers in Russia is unlikely to have increased this year. Sociological studies indicate that citizens’ support for the Russian government has only been growing. By the beginning of the summer, 72 percent of Russians supported the military campaign, while Russian President Vladimir Putin’s popularity rating had risen, settling at 82 percent. But if Ukraine has failed in killing support for the offensive, it doesn’t mean it hasn’t tried. For example, the command of Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces has been implementing the ‘Smuta’ project since January of 2022. The documentation contains a detailed report on materials published in the Russian media and social networks aimed at destabilizing the country, provoking discontent among its population, and discrediting the authorities. After the outbreak of hostilities, Operation ‘Steppe Wind’ was activated. As stated in the SSO documents, its task is to demoralize the enemy and create tension between the Russian military and DPR and LPR fighters. According to Oleg Matveichev, a professor at the Higher School of Economics, “in fact, there are about 80,000 accounts maintained by Ukrainian students [on the Russian-language internet], but they pretend to be locals: ‘ordinary residents’ of Penza, Kurgan, Chita, and Khabarovsk.” Relatives of Russian servicemen have been terrorized by telephone scammers who report the death of their loved ones in Ukraine or demand money for their “release from captivity.” As reported by ombudsman Tatiana Moskalkova, relatives of Russian soldiers have also received videos showing prisoners being abused. The Ukrainian special services have created several Telegram channels, where unverified data on Russian casualties and prisoners is published. The Ombudsman also said she has received more than 100 appeals concerning prisoners of war, of which about half have been confirmed. Operation ‘Gentle Dew’, which is aimed at residents of territories not controlled by Ukraine, deserves special mention. Its mission is to “form pro-Ukrainian sentiment among the population of the occupied territories and encourage protest movements directed against the ‘Eastern’ and the occupation authorities.” However, there has been no success in implementing this plan. The main reason for this lies in the difference between Kiev’s and the Donbass republics’ views on and approaches to the possible reintegration of the regions with Ukraine. In March 2021, President Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree approving a ‘Strategy for De-occupation and Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol.’ The document, which consists of 158 paragraphs, will give you an idea of how the authorities in Kiev intend to treat the residents of the regions that have left Ukraine. The document proposes to exclude persons who “were part of or collaborated with the occupation administrations” from holding any position in government or civil service. This is a very wide range of people, ranging from members of the 2014 referendum commissions to teachers and doctors working in municipal schools and hospitals. ‘De-occupation’ also involves extending the statute of limitations on criminal cases that were conducted by Ukrainian police before the referendum on the return of Crimea to Russia, as well as pursuing criminal cases within the competence of the Security Service of Ukraine. Translated from legal to layman’s language, this means purposeful persecution of all officials who worked in Crimea in February 2014, as well as participants in mass rallies supporting the reunification of Crimea with Russia, volunteers who helped DPR and LPR residents during the civil war, and so on. While opening opportunities for the residents of Crimea and Donbass to study at Ukrainian universities, Kiev refuses to recognize any educational documents obtained on the peninsula. The question of whether these conditions will make residents of Crimea and Donbass want to return to Ukraine is purely rhetorical. While it is unknown whether the SSO intends to continue implementing its plan to foster pro-Ukrainian sentiment among the residents of Crimea and Donbass, we do know for sure that the Ukrainian side sharply increased its attacks on cities in these regions after the start of Russia’s Special Military Operation. So far, this ‘Gentle Dew’ has only fallen on the region in the form of MLRS Grad shells and Tochka U missiles. Ukraine’s SSO has also carried out several special operations in the foreign policy field. One of them is operation ‘Caspian’, whose purpose is to sow and deepen disagreements between the Russian Federation and certain ‘Fawn,’ which are presumably countries in the Caspian region. The operation is to be considered successful if it leads to “actions indicating the refusal of ‘Fawn’ from interacting with ‘Eastern’.” In general, it is difficult to assess where the line lies between Ukraine’s efforts to disrupt Russia’s relations with its partners and the natural difficulties that arise in the dialogue between any countries. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that during the riots that took place in Kazakhstan in January this year, at least some of the protesters’ actions were coordinated with Ukraine, where Kazakh oppositionists found refuge. Operation ‘Manchurian Hills’ aims to worsen Russia’s diplomatic relations with the countries of the Far East. This Ukrainian special services’ plan has been designed to persuade Moscow that its eastern neighbors are potential threats, thereby provoking Russia to increase its military presence in the region. If we analyze the content of the ‘Strategy of Ukraine’s Foreign Policy Activity’ adopted in July 2021, we can see not the defensive, but the aggressively offensive nature of Kiev’s foreign policy actions. For example, to offer experience “acquired over years of countering Russian aggression” to NATO countries and the Baltic-Black Sea region. Or to assist in fighting Russian “disinformation” in neighboring countries, to support the “people of Belarus,” to “democratize” Russia itself, and to strengthen “pressure on and deterrence of the Russian Federation on the basis of a broad international coalition.” This, by the way, is also included in SSO plans called ‘The Voice of Reason’. Even in bilateral relations, where Ukraine should seemingly focus on developing trade, industrial cooperation, and cultural exchanges, the Foreign Ministry is tasked with “ensuring support from African and Middle Eastern states in countering the aggression of the Russian Federation.” Since the outbreak of hostilities, Ukraine has been trying to present Russia’s actions to the ‘international community’ as an attack by a great power on a small state that is unable to defeat the huge Russian army because it has never had aggressive intentions either against the Russian Federation or any other country. This statement is refuted by ‘Ukraine’s Military Security Strategy’, which states in black and white, for example, that KI’ve may enter into a war with the Russian Federation if Russia tries to “keep the Republic of Belarus in its sphere of political influence.” The goal of Ukraine’s accession to NATO is also clearly outlined. Of course, as a sovereign state, Ukraine has the right to join any international organization. But the issue is that Kiev sees the goal of NATO membership as the US-led bloc’s participation in a war against Russia. This has been confirmed by an adviser to the president of Ukraine, Alexey Arestovich, who, in explaining the purpose of the DEFENDER Europe 2021 exercises, stated that “in the waters from the Baltic to the Black Sea, we are working out – let’s not beat around the bush – how to carry out an armed conflict with Russia, a war with Russia.” Although, back in 2017, the SSO created a ‘Voice of Reason’ plan, which included a task to ensure that “statements confirming readiness to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the situation” appeared in the West. In fact, the West never rejected this idea. After the outbreak of hostilities, it was Kiev that refused peace talks, preferring to wage war with Russia. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky repeated this policy line in Paris, stressing that the conditions for negotiating with Russia hadn’t yet “matured,” as he wanted to take a “stronger position.”",2.2917956091367055,2.046804113021811,0.24499149611489468,6
2022-09-17,https://www.rt.com/news/562993-ukraine-us-long-range-rockets-himars/,Ukraine mulls long-range rocket deliveries from US – FM,"Ukraine and the US are discussing deliveries of long-range missiles that would enable Kiev to strike deep into Russia, Foreign Ministry Dmitry Kuleba said on Friday. Earlier, Moscow had warned that this would make Washington “an actual party” to the Ukraine conflict and prompt a response. Speaking to PBS, Kuleba claimed that Ukrainian generals “have [an] excellent line of communication with American generals” and they “are discussing this issue” of supplying Kiev with longer-range ammo for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). The minister noted that Kiev “appreciates everything the United States [has] done,” adding that it needs specific weapons to “get things done on the battleground.” “I do not exclude the option that the United States will make a positive decision on this specific type of weapon,” he added, referring to HIMARS longer-range munitions. As of September 15, the US has provided 16 HIMARS systems to Ukraine to help it counter Russia’s military operation, which started in late February. Washington has openly supplied Kiev with GMLRS rockets that can hit targets from up to 80km away, but has resisted calls to send long-range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) munitions with a range of fire of up to 300km, arguing that Ukraine does not need them. On Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that if the US decides to supply these types of munitions to Ukraine, “it would cross the red line and become an actual party to the conflict.” She added that the move would trigger “an adequate response” from Russia, which “reserves the right to defend its territory using any means available.” On the same day, CNN reported, citing sources, that Washington does not intend to supply Kiev with the long-range HIMARS rockets that Ukraine has been requesting for months, fearing the move would be escalatory.",2.330610652801401,1.6512660561642758,0.6793445966371252,7
2022-09-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/562979-ukraine-russian-passports-jail/,Ukraine to jail people over Russian passports,"A law proposed by the government in Kiev on Friday would see some Ukrainians who obtain Russian passports punished with lengthy prison terms. Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk insisted the measure is not aimed at ordinary Ukrainians, but officials who work with the “enemy state.” The draft calls for a sentence of 10-15 years for any local or regional government employees who accept an “enemy” passport. Engaging in “propaganda for an enemy state” would carry a sentence of 5-8 years, while “compelling” Ukrainian citizens to accept an “enemy” passport would be punishable by 8-12 years behind bars. Any Russian citizens engaging in “illegal passportization on the territory of Ukraine” would also be subject to these penalties, said Vereshchuk, whose portfolio is “reintegration of the temporarily occupied territories.” She added that this type of law “should have been passed in 2014.” After the US-backed coup in Kiev in February that year, Crimea voted to rejoin Russia, while the Donbass regions of Donetsk and Lugansk declared independence. Kiev brutally suppressed protests in the Kharkov and Odessa regions, while sending the army into Donbass. Ukraine has been working on the draft since July, after blasting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to implement a fast-track citizenship procedure for any citizen of Ukraine. Many residents of the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions have since availed themselves of the opportunity. Earlier this month, Vereshchuk threatened anyone who would organize or participate in a vote to join Russia in the “occupied territories” with up to 12 years in prison and a confiscation of property, under the existing “collaboration” statute. Last week, after Ukrainian troops moved into several cities in the Kharkov Region, following a “redeployment” of Russian forces, Vereshchuk announced that any teachers who had used the Russian curriculum would also face criminal charges. Meanwhile, Ukrainian state police said that “a reckoning” was coming for any civilians suspected of “collaboration” and set up “filtration” operations in the northeastern region.",2.892408460636794,2.785675059191516,0.1067334014452781,2
2022-09-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/562976-zelensky-adviser-civilian-attacks/,Zelensky aide says civilian officials are 'legitimate targets',"The government in Kiev was behind deadly shelling in Kherson and it also organized the murder of two civilian officials in Berdyansk on Friday, Mikhail Podoliak, an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, has confirmed. However, Podoliak insisted these were not acts of terrorism but legitimate strikes against purely military targets. “Everything that happened in Berdyansk, in Melitopol, in Kherson — those are all absolutely legitimate military targets. Those are certainly not terrorist or, strictly speaking, criminal acts,” Podoliak said. At least three people were killed and 13 were wounded on Friday morning when five missiles from the US-supplied HIMARS launchers struck the administration building in Kherson, which is under Russian control. Most of them were civilian passers-by, local authorities said. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy chair of the military-civilian administration, says the strike was intended to take him out. He survived only by chance, having accepted an invitation to appear in a TV talk show at the time of the shelling. In Berdyansk, in the Russian-controlled part of the Zaporozhye Region, two officials of the local military-civilian administration were murdered on Friday morning. Oleg Boyko was in charge of housing and utilities, while his wife Lyudmila headed the local elections commission. An explosion that could be heard in Melitopol on Friday was a controlled demolition of unexploded ordnance, local official Vladimir Rogov said. However, the city headquarters of the organization ‘Together With Russia’ was damaged by a bomb last week. Podoliak did not take credit for the assassination of the Lugansk People’s Republic head prosecutor Sergey Gorenko and his assistant Yekaterina Steglenko. They were killed on Friday when an improvised bomb detonated at the Prosecutor General’s Office in Lugansk. Assassinations by Ukrainian agents have claimed the lives of a number of Donetsk and Lugansk officials over the past seven years. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Ukraine has engaged in “terrorist attacks” against civilians and infrastructure, including attempts to damage nuclear facilities inside Russia. This behavior was unacceptable, he said, and if Kiev persists it will receive a “more serious” response from Moscow than a handful of “sensitive strikes” that damaged power stations and dams this week.",3.1614623483947417,3.031726815072652,0.12973553332208976,0
2022-09-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/562965-ukraine-conflict-energy-crisis/,"Ukraine conflict, energy crisis and ‘colonial’ West: Putin’s latest press conference","Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to the media on Friday following the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Earlier, he met with the leaders of China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Mongolia. In his first press conference since July, the president was asked about the conflict with the West, the ongoing military operation in Ukraine, and the energy crisis in the European Union, among other things. Here are some of the highlights from Putin's press conference. The West always strived to destroy Russia Destroying Russia and “disintegrating” it into a number of petty states has always been a top priority for the collective West, the Russian president said. Ukraine, in its modern state, has been selected to become an “anti-Russian enclave” and the main tool to achieve such goals, Putin believes. “The fact that they’ve always strived for the disintegration of our country is certain. It is only regrettable that at some point they decided to use Ukraine to achieve such goals,” Putin said. “In order to prevent such developments, we have launched the special military operation.” Attitude towards Ukraine may change So far, Moscow has demonstrated a very reserved reaction to such actions by the Ukrainian authorities as attempts to target vital infrastructure on Russian soil or stage “terror attacks,” Putin said.“The special military operation is not a warning of some sort, but a special military operation. We’re witnessing attempts to stage terror attacks, attempts to damage our civilian infrastructure. We respond to this with restraint, but only for the time being,” Putin stated, warning that the approach may change in the future. “Quite recently, the Russian armed forces delivered a couple of sensitive strikes, let’s say they were a warning. If the situation continues to develop in such fashion, the response will be more serious,” he added. No change in Ukraine conflict goals There will be no changes in the goals Russia is striving to achieve with its special military operation in Ukraine, Putin said. “There are no adjustments to the plan. The General Staff makes operational decisions in the course of the campaign as to what is considered a key objective,” the president stated.“The main goal is the liberation of the entire territory of Donbass. This work continues, despite the attempted counterattacks by the Ukrainian army,” Putin said, adding that it was too early to draw any conclusions from the ongoing counteroffensive by Kiev’s forces, and one should wait to see “how it ends.” Prospects of peace talks with Ukraine are uncertain Russia was ready to agree to the security guarantees for Ukraine proposed during the Istanbul talks back in March, the Russian president explained. However, the negotiations were scuppered by Kiev.“The troops were withdrawn from Kiev in order to create conditions for the reaching of this deal. Instead of inking it, the Kiev authorities immediately abandoned all agreements. They announced that they would not seek any deals with Russia, but would seek victory on the battlefield. Well, let them,” Putin said.The prospects of further negotiations or personal talks between him and his Ukrainian counterpart Vladimir Zelensky remain uncertain, Putin admitted. “First of all, they should agree [to hold the talks]. But they refuse. Zelensky declared that… he was not ready and not willing to talk with Russia. Well, if he’s not ready – there’s no need [for that],” Putin said. Colonial mindset plagues the West The collective West still remains trapped in the colonial-era mindset, the Russian president said, suggesting that Western countries simply cannot give up their habit of living at the expense of someone else. “These are former colonial powers, but they still live in the paradigm of colonial philosophy. They are accustomed to living at the expense of others. And they still cannot get rid of this paradigm in their practical daily politics,” Putin stated. On what caused the EU energy crisis The ongoing energy crisis in Europe, which is routinely blamed on Russia and the fallout of its military operation in Ukraine, started long before the ongoing events, Putin believes. The EU created the crisis itself, and now is merely trying to solve it “at the expense of others,” he said. “The energy crisis in Europe did not begin with the start of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, in Donbass, not with this, much earlier, a year ago, if not even earlier. It began, while it may sound strange, with the ‘green’ agenda,” Putin stated, adding that while introducing green energy is important for tackling climate change, multiple European countries opted to ditch fossil-fuel energy at once to reach short-term political goals.The Russian president also mocked the idea floated by European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen of sending the growing energy bills to Moscow, dismissing it as yet another attempt to “shift the problem, the headache from a sick head into a healthy one.”",1.6710204013919832,1.5168871765271472,0.15413322486483594,8
2022-09-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/562973-zelensky-ammonia-pows-fertilizer-shortage/,Zelensky wants to exchange Ukrainian soldiers for fertilizer,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky will allow Russia to resume sending ammonia exports through his country, thus easing a global fertilizer shortage, only if Moscow releases Ukrainian prisoners of war, he told Reuters on Friday. “I am against supplying ammonia from the Russian Federation through our territory. I would only do it in exchange for our prisoners,” Zelensky told the outlet. “This is what I offered the UN.” The Kremlin quickly dismissed the offer. “Are people and ammonia the same thing?” spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded, as reported by the news agency TASS. While Zelensky has claimed Ukraine took hundreds of Russian troops as prisoners during its recent counter-offensive in Kharkov, he has acknowledged Russia holds more Ukrainian POWs. The UN had suggested Russian fertilizer producer Uralchem pump ammonia gas by pipeline to the Ukrainian border, where it could be purchased by Trammo, a US-based commodities trader. The pipeline can pump as many as 2.5 million tons of ammonia per year from the Volga region to the port of Yuzhny on the Black Sea. However, the port has been closed since the start of Russia’s military offensive in February. Ammonia is a vital ingredient in nitrate fertilizer, and a shortage in supply threatens to compound the global food crisis, itself already exacerbated by the conflict as much of the world’s wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia. As many as 70% of European ammonia plants have reduced or halted production in recent months due to record-high energy prices, according to the Russian fertilizer industry. Russia, Ukraine and Turkey signed a UN-brokered deal in July to resume grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports to alleviate the shortage. However, Russia’s representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, recently blamed Western sanctions for holding up shipments of both grain and fertilizer. He accused EU officials of hypocrisy for blocking Russian shipments to Africa, Asia and Latin America while allowing the critical resources to reach the bloc’s own shores. Of the 136 ships that have left Ukrainian ports carrying grain, just six went to the poorest countries suffering food crises.",1.7278426242364635,1.8794816380892907,-0.1516390138528272,7

Local officials claim there were only civil servants and no military personnel in the building at the time of the shelling, which was allegedly carried out with five US-made HIMARS rockets. The deputy head of the administration, Ekaterina Gubareva, has called the incident “a vile terrorist attack in broad daylight,” and urged residents to stay at home citing threats of further attacks.

2022-09-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/562963-putin-modi-talks-ukraine/,Putin makes Ukraine pledge to India's Modi,"Russia wants to end the conflict in Ukraine “as soon as possible,” but Kiev refuses to talk, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. The first in-person meeting of the two leaders since 2019 took place on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Putin told the prime minister that he is aware of his “concerns” over the conflict in Ukraine and pledged to “do everything to ensure that all of this stops as soon as possible.” “Unfortunately, the opposite side, the leadership of Ukraine, has refused the negotiation process. {They} declared that they want to achieve their goals by military means, or, as they say, ‘on the battlefield,’” Putin explained. The Indian prime minister, who has been sticking to neutrality about the military conflict in Ukraine, reiterated his calls for peace during the meeting with Putin. Citing the challenges facing the world now, including food security issues and the energy crisis, Modi said that “today’s era is not an era of war.” He also said that he views his meeting with Putin as a chance to discuss progress on “the path of peace.” “India and Russia have stayed together with each other for several decades,” he said. The US and its partners, meanwhile, have been calling on New Delhi and on Beijing to take a tougher stance on Russia amid its offensive in Ukraine. Kiev and Moscow haven’t returned to the negotiating table since talks in Istanbul in late March fell through. Ukraine’s Western partners, meanwhile, continue supplying it with arms. Moscow, however, insists that it has not given up on the idea of peace talks with Kiev. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made it clear that the longer the process is delayed the harder it would be to come to an agreement. In July, Lavrov’s Ukrainian counterpart, Dmitry Kuleba, said that Kiev would only be eager to resume talks after Moscow suffers “defeat on the battlefield.” According to Kuleba, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky is not ruling out “the possibility of negotiations,” but believes “there is no reason” for it at the moment. Kiev’s stance has largely remained the same ever since.",1.6238081768197377,1.481954422084035,0.1418537547357026,8
2022-09-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/562967-putin-ukraine-plan-change/,Putin clarifies Russia's main goal in Ukraine,"Russia's plan for its military operation in Ukraine has not changed, and the main objective remains to liberate the entire territory of the two Donbass republics, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. The statement comes amid an ongoing counter-offensive by Kiev. “There are no adjustments to the plan. The General Staff makes operational decisions in the course of the campaign as to what is considered a key objective,” Putin told reporters on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. “The main goal is the liberation of the entire territory of Donbass. This work continues, despite the attempted counterattacks by the Ukrainian army,” the Russian president added. Putin pointed out that the Russian army continues to make “incremental” advances in the Donbass itself. He also said Moscow is “not in a hurry” in Ukraine. Commenting on the “Kiev Security Compact” presented by Ukraine this week, the Russian president noted that the two countries had worked out a set of security guarantees and terms for ending the conflict back in March at the Istanbul talks – but then Kiev walked away from the table. “Now they say they don’t want any agreements with Russia, but wish to win on the battlefield. Well, flag in hand,” Putin said, using a Russian idiom for ironically wishing someone success in a hopeless endeavor. Though his spokesman Dmitry Peskov had described Kiev’s proposal as proof that Russia is being threatened by NATO, Putin said he wanted to wait and see what the Ukrainians actually come up with, as “their position on almost every issue changes almost every day.” The West does plan to break up Russia – and has had such plans for decades – the president noted, but one of the reasons the special military operation began is that some Western countries decided to use Ukraine to achieve that. Moscow has responded “with restraint” to Ukrainian “terror attacks” against civilian infrastructure and officials, including the targeting of nuclear facilities inside Russia, Putin said. Such behavior is unacceptable, and if Ukraine continues with it, the Russian response will be “more serious” than the recent “sensitive strikes,” which represented a warning of sorts, the Russian president added.",1.525577085872555,1.7315693464113633,-0.20599226053880826,8

Stremousov was invited to appear on the 'Speak the Truth' talk show on Crimea 24 TV by Oleg Kryuchkov, an advisor to the head of the peninsula. “When I told the editors on Monday that Kirill Stremousov should be invited to the talk show [...] I could not even imagine that it would be saving his life.” Kryuchkov said on social media. Stremousov claims that the target of the Ukrainian forces was the acting head of the Kherson military-civilian administration Sergey Eliseev as well as a meeting of municipal authorities of the region. None of the high-ranking officials were injured in the attack, the official said, but several other people lost their lives or were injured. According to the local health authority, at least 13 people sustained injuries in the attack on the city center on Friday, of which three are currently in a critical condition. They also reported that the attacks left three people dead – two passersby and a driver for a region official.

Quite recently, the Russian armed forces delivered a couple of sensitive strikes, let’s say they were a warning. If the situation continues to develop in such fashion, the response will be more serious. While the president did not specify which specific incidents he was referring to, over the past week the Russian military has targeted several key infrastructure sites across Ukraine.

Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov and his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rahmon met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit underway in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. “The parties discussed the situation on the Kyrgyz-Tajik part of the state border. The leaders of the two countries agreed to order the respective forces to cease fire and withdraw troops and hardware from the line of contact,” a spokesperson for the Kyrgyz president told RIA Novosti in a statement. The two leaders also agreed to set up a joint commission to investigate the triggers of the latest border flare-up. The truce, however, was apparently short-lived, as some two hours after the agreement was reached, the Kyrgyz border guard accused the neighboring country of continuing the attacks. “Breaching the reached agreement, the Tajik side has yet again opened fire on the Kyrgyz border guard,” the guard's press service said in a statement, claiming that Tajik troops had used heavy weaponry, including multiple rocket launch systems to shell the country’s territory. The two Central Asian nations have experienced border tensions over the past few days and have traded blame for the latest renewal of a long-running conflict. Early on Friday, the skirmishes escalated into full-blown fighting involving the use of heavy weapons, as tanks and artillery were reportedly deployed at the border by both sides.

2022-09-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/562935-ukraine-counter-offensive-russia/,"Sergey Poletaev: Ukraine has upped the ante in its conflict with Russia, how will Moscow respond?","After Russia and its local allies liberated Severodonetsk and Lisichansk in early July, the fighting in Ukraine subsided somewhat. It seemed as if Moscow was deliberately letting the conflict settle into something with an air of the routine. Relatively little resources were being spent on it, while the state apparatus was working to overcome the effects of sanctions and to adapt the economy. During this time, the military operation was taking place in a kind of ‘standby mode’ against the background of turbulence in the global economy and the deepening energy crisis in Europe. However, in late summer and early autumn, events on the Ukrainian front called into question the prospects for such a frozen state. As we had anticipated, the operational pause on the part of the Russian army led to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) seizing the initiative and eventually launching two counter-offensive operations. In Kherson Region, Russian-controlled territory between the Ingulets and Dnieper Rivers is supplied through three crossings: the railway and road bridges in Kherson itself and the dam and bridges of the Kakhovka hydroelectric complex. Since mid-summer, Ukrainian forces have been shelling these crossings with varying success. Nevertheless, despite the relative effectiveness of these efforts and the collapse of some sections, they failed to disrupt the supply of both the Russian army group and the city of Kherson, located on the right bank of the Dnieper River. Since August 20, Ukrainian forces have been engaged in a major offensive in several parts of the front. Most notably, they captured a bridgehead on the southern bank of the Ingulets River near Andreevka. Apparently, the plan was to use this to reach the Kakhovka Dam and Berislav from the south-southeast and cut off the northeastern grouping of the Russian forces, forcing them to retreat. The Russian side managed to contain the initial onslaught by the AFU and used its air superiority to inflict a major defeat on the advancing troops. According to some estimates, Ukrainian losses in seven to ten days amounted to as many as 4,000 killed out of 15,000 advancing troops. A huge amount of video footage appears to confirm the order of magnitude of the figures, while heavy AFU losses in the Kherson theater are also reported openly in the Western press. As of mid-September, the AFU’s successes near Kherson included the occupation of the village of Vysokopolye in the northeastern part of the Kherson front, and several small villages near Andreevka, where the depth of the breach was reduced from a maximum of 20-22km to a bridgehead measuring approximately 7-12km. On the evening of September 14, there were reports that the Karachun reservoir dam in Krivoy Rog had been destroyed, which had induced a sharp rise in the water level of the Ingulets River, posing a threat to Ukrainian bridgehead crossings. Still, the fighting near Kherson is not yet over and the situation remains fluid. The Kherson attack, however, was quickly overshadowed by events in the north. On September 6 in Kharkov Region, the AFU launched an attack on the Russian-controlled regional towns of Balakleya, Izium and Kupiansk. A day later Balakleya was completely blockaded, and two days later the AFU approached Kupiansk, located on the Oskol River, threatening to encircle Izium to the south. The attackers operated in light mobile groups, breaking into settlements, blocking roads and going behind the small Russian garrisons. Their superior numbers (an eight-to-one, according to some estimates) allowed them to quickly flood a vast territory and create the impression of a ubiquitous presence. No major fighting took place and for a couple of days the wooded area between Balakleya and the Oskol River was a patchwork of terrain, with little control by either side. As early as September 8, Russia started transferring reserves to the front, for which heavy Mi-26 helicopters were deployed. At the same time, there began a withdrawal of forces from Balakleya, which had been encircled operationally. The Ufa and Samara SOBR (Special Unit of Quick Response — RT.) detachments that had been blocked in the town were the last to leave, doing so without major losses, as early as September 9-10. On September 10, the Russian Defense Ministry announced a complete withdrawal of forces to the Oskol River in eastern Kharkov Region. As a result, Balakleya, Izium and the western part of Kupiansk, which was divided by the Oskol, have come under Ukrainian control. Despite official statements by the Russian Defense Ministry about the withdrawal and redeployment of the Izium-Balakleya group of troops to the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Kharkov events were perceived by many in Russia almost as a disaster. It has become clear that Ukraine is in a position to conduct offensive operations and there is a feeling that the Russian army has no way to respond here and now. As a result of the strike, Moscow’s forces had to hastily abandon territory where Russia’s presence had seemed permanent: passports and license plates had been distributed to locals; Russian businesses had entered Izium, Kupiansk and Balakleya; local teachers had been retrained and were preparing to start the new academic year with Russian programs. The effect was magnified by the swiftness of events: the AFU managed to move the front 60-70km in three days, while in Donbass a movement of 1-2km a week is considered a success. *** What is next? Depending on how much offensive potential it has remaining, the AFU could try to push forward in several ways. First, it might attack east of the Oskol or from the south through a bridgehead at Krasny Liman in order to occupy the remaining Russian-controlled part of Kharkov Region and enter the territory of the Lugansk People’s Republic from the north. Second, it could embark on an attempt to reverse the situation near Kherson and still go on the offensive there. Third, a strike somewhere else could be forthcoming. There have been reports of large AFU forces accumulating near Ugledar, which may indicate preparations for an offensive along the Volnovakha-Mariupol line. Mariupol is just 70km from Ugledar, which is comparable to the depth of AFU operations in the Kherson and Kharkov theaters. Fourth, attempts to shift infantry fighting to Russian territory near Belgorod cannot be ruled out. Provocations in the form of shelling there are constant and have been intensifying in recent days, and it seems that the Ukrainian forces are probing Moscow's reaction. What about Russia itself? On July 7, President Putin said that Russia had not yet started anything in earnest in Ukraine. It seems that it is impossible to achieve the operation’s goals without defeating the Ukrainian army, which means that Russia needs to seize the initiative and change its approach to combat operations. In what form this will happen – whether air strikes will be stepped up and geographically expanded, or the Russian force grouping will be increased and major offensive operations prepared, or some form of mobilization will eventually come to pass – we will find out sooner or later.",2.1095626513774697,3.3105682875102205,-1.2010056361327508,6

The prime minister acknowledged that the situation along the troubled border remains strained. According to Pashinyan, 135 Armenian military personnel have been killed since fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan broke out on Tuesday. That same day, Yerevan requested assistance from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, of which it is a member. The alliance, which includes Russia and a number of Central Asian nations, dispatched a monitoring group that has already arrived in Armenia. The mission is tasked with developing proposals for defusing tensions in the region. According to officials in Yerevan, the latest round of fighting began after the Azerbaijani military shelled several Armenian villages. Baku insists it was only acting in self-defense following a “massive provocation” by Armenia in several areas. Azerbaijan had accused Armenian forces of mining supply routes and shelling its military positions. Speaking at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan on Friday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev described Armenia’s latest actions as a “huge blow to the process of normalizing relations between the two countries.” On Wednesday, Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry claimed Baku had suggested declaring a humanitarian ceasefire. The diplomats also added that Baku is not interested in further escalation. Yerevan, though, says the truce has already been violated due to continued shelling by Azerbaijan. The conflict between the two nations revolves around the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is mostly populated by ethnic Armenians. Yerevan has backed the region’s push for independence ever since it sought to break away from Azerbaijan in the early 1990s. Baku claims the territory as its own. In 2020, Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a 44-day war over Nagorno-Karabakh, which ended with a Russia-brokered truce, and Azerbaijan seizing nearly half of the region.",2.346042853910958,3.9821089788738697,-1.6360661249629116,4

Volodin accused the Polish president of rehabilitating Nazism and of insulting the memory of those who “gave their lives for the freedom and independence of the Polish people.” “Russian law provides criminal penalties for such statements. It is right for the supervisory authorities to study the comment of Andrzej Duda and take appropriate measures to bring him to criminal responsibility,” he wrote on Telegram. Volodin also reminded of the high price the Soviet people paid for the liberation of the world from Nazism – 27 million dead. “Today Poland exists as a state only thanks to our country,” Volodin said. Duda’s comments came the day after the lower house of the Polish parliament voted to seek 1.3 trillion euros in compensation from Germany for damages incurred during the Nazi occupation. The German foreign ministry earlier said that it considered the question of wartime reparations “closed.” Meanwhile, Polish media reported that a ruling-party MP Jaroslaw Krajewski had called to demand 368 hectares from the Czech Republic, in compensation for what Warsaw considers the disadvantageous demarcation of the Polish-Czechoslovak border in the 1950s.",3.1868774880142796,4.217676439200401,-1.0307989511861217,4

Speaking at a UN Security Council meeting, Nebenzia slammed Western “illegal unilateral sanctions,” thwarting the implementation of the UN- and Turkey-brokered deal unblocking Ukrainian grain export via the Black Sea in exchange for Russian agricultural products gaining unimpeded access to global markets. “The European Union and the United States’ narrative saying that their sanctions do not interfere with the export of food and fertilizers does not reflect reality,” Russia’s envoy noted. According to Nebenzia, about 300,000 tons of Russian fertilizer to the tune of “tens of millions of dollars” have been stuck in European ports due to the sanctions. He went on to explain that “the restrictions have made bank transactions much more difficult,” given that Russian bank accounts playing a key role in the agricultural sector were closed off. Another major issue is that shipping insurance fees have skyrocketed, he said. The diplomat also accused EU officials of hypocrisy, saying, Brussels prohibits European carriers from transporting Russian fertilizers to Africa, Asia or Latin America, but allows deliveries to EU countries. “Great help to poor countries. This selfishness, cynicism and hypocrisy of EU officials is especially indicative,” he noted. The envoy added that almost half of all Ukrainian grain shipments go to high-income countries, while only six out of 136 vessels carrying just over 250 thousand tons of cargo went to the poorest countries suffering from a food crisis. These comments echo earlier remarks by Russian President Vladimir Putin who last week accused the West of lying when it claimed Ukraine needed access to sea shipping to alleviate surging food prices and the risk of famine in poor countries. Wheat deliveries from Ukraine, a major producer, were disrupted after Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring state in late February.

2022-09-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/562893-ukraine-first-monkeypox-case/,Monkeypox reaches Ukraine,"Ukrainian health officials on Thursday confirmed the country’s first case of monkeypox, which has spread to more than 100 countries worldwide, primarily affecting gay men. The case was confirmed by a Ukrainian medical laboratory, which conducted a PCR test on the patient. Among the symptoms reported by the man were a high temperature and a rash on his body. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, the patient had no contact with known monkeypox patients and had not traveled abroad. Endemic to parts of West and Central Africa, monkeypox cases began appearing in Europe earlier this year, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in July. According to WHO figures from last week, more than 52,000 cases and 18 deaths have been confirmed in 102 countries. The virus overwhelmingly affects gay and bisexual men, who make up 98% of patients, according to a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine last month. While the WHO is uncertain whether sexual activity is the only means of transmitting the virus, the paper noted that 95% of patients studied contracted it via sex with other men. In the US and Europe, cases have been reported in children and animals. Monkeypox is similar to human smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. Its symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and exhaustion, and those afflicted develop distinctive skin lesions. These symptoms generally recede within two to four weeks, and those affected usually make a full recovery. A combined monkeypox/smallpox vaccine manufactured by Bavarian Nordic has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. No vaccines have been made available in Ukraine, with the health ministry’s website citing “the lack of registered cases and the reduced probability of their introduction.”",4.033015629126888,1.7846939481851458,2.2483216809417423,7
2022-09-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/562892-moscow-un-nuclear-watchdog-ukraine/,Moscow responds to UN resolution on nuclear plant,"Russia has criticized the resolution adopted by the UN nuclear watchdog on the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. The document passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is “anti-Russian” and does not say a single word about the Ukrainian shelling of the facility, Russian diplomats have said. The facility, the largest of its kind in Europe, is located in Ukraine but currently controlled by Russian forces. On Thursday, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted a document demanding Russia “immediately cease all actions against, and at, the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine.” The text also said the board “deplores the Russian Federation’s persistent violent actions against nuclear facilities in Ukraine.” Russia’s mission to the IAEA responded by saying that the document was “pushed through” by the West, while “the majority of humanity refused to support it.” The resolution passed with 26 votes in favor. Russia and China, which are also on the board, voted against it, while seven nations – Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Burundi, Vietnam, India, and Pakistan – abstained. Those supporting the document mostly consisted of the US and its allies in Europe and elsewhere. The Russian diplomats also blasted the fact that the resolution fails to mention the shelling of the station, the evidence for which Moscow had provided several times. The officials also accused Western nations of “supporting and shielding” Kiev in “every possible way,” while blaming Ukraine for the attacks. The document was passed in the wake of the IAEA mission that visited the Zaporozhye plant in early September. On Wednesday, in a phone call with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the IAEA's work, which is contributing to the safety of the facility. This was the second resolution adopted by the IAEA amid the Russian military operation in Ukraine. The first one was passed in March before Russian forces had taken control of the power plant. The documents are similar in nature and in both cases were introduced by Canada and Poland on behalf of Ukraine, which is not on the agency’s board, according to Reuters. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the grounds of the plant. Kiev has denied the accusations and instead blamed Russia for the incidents, despite the area already being under Moscow’s control.",3.4831955173617004,3.276482775869543,0.20671274149215746,9
2022-09-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/562888-moscow-red-line-us-ukraine/,Moscow clarifies ‘red line’ for US,"Washington becomes “complicit in war crimes” by supplying weapons to Kiev, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a media briefing on Thursday. If the US decides to supply longer-range missiles to Ukraine, “it would cross the red line and become an actual party to the conflict,” she added. Such a move would be equivalent to deploying ground-based medium-range missiles to Europe, Zakharova said, adding that such weapons were previously banned by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty), which the US abandoned back in 2019 under then-President Donald Trump. “In such a scenario, we would have to come up with an adequate response,” the spokeswoman said, adding that Russia “reserves the right to defend its territory using any means available.” Washington has already supplied Kiev with M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS multiple launch rocket systems, as well as regular rounds for them capable of hitting targets at a range of about 70km. Now, Kiev also seeks to get ahold of the US-made Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS. These missiles, which can also be fired by HIMARS and MLRS systems, have a significantly longer range of some 300km and could strike targets deep in Russian territory. Washington is seeking to drag the conflict in Ukraine out for as long as possible while still controlling how it develops, Zakharova said, calling it a sign of America's “direct involvement in the fighting.” She also accused the US of seeking “global destabilization” and instigating a new “arms race.” Her words came just a day after the Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, accused the US of “inciting Kiev” against Russia, as well as aiding Ukraine’s military efforts and “boasting” about it. The diplomat also blasted US claims about not being a party to the conflict as “ridiculous” and “unfounded.” In September, the Pentagon revealed a new military aid package for Kiev worth $675 million. The package includes artillery ammunition, armored vehicles, and remote-launched mines, among other items.",2.7448068125799954,2.753133239147764,-0.008326426567768497,8

According to Peskov “all relations in the SCO are built on the basis of mutual respect for each other’s interests and mutual benefit.” “No one sets the goal of making the SCO an alternative to a military organization. This is friendship in the name of something, not against someone,” he said. In the wake of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, relations between Moscow and the West are at an all-time low. As NATO continues to expand and its members impose economic sanctions on Russia, Moscow insists that any attempts to isolate the country will fail. The key organizations that Russia is a part of, such as the BRICS and SCO, are also expanding. Iran and Argentina officially applied for BRICS membership in late June, and Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt have shown interest in joining the bloc. Ahead of the summit in Samarkand, SCO Secretary General Zhang Ming said the suggestion that there is “a long queue outside the door” to the organization is not an exaggeration. On Thursday, the SCO signed a protocol with Iran which paves the way for the country’s full accession. The SCO encompasses 40% of the world’s population, and more than 30% of global GDP. The organization currently has eight full members: Russia, India, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan. Belarus and Iran are now in the process of joining the SCO and have observer status, along with Afghanistan and Mongolia. On Tuesday, Uzbekistan’s national SCO coordinator, Rakhmatulla Nurimbetov, revealed that six countries will receive the status of dialogue partners during the summit.",2.854451511919977,2.1080035153327983,0.7464479965871789,8
2022-09-15,https://www.rt.com/news/562869-ukrainian-women-attacked-france/,Ukrainian women assaulted by compatriot who mistook them for Russians,"Police have arrested a man responsible for assaulting two Ukrainian women in France. While he was initially believed to be Russian, a press release by the prosecutor in Nice on Wednesday has revealed the assailant is in fact a former Ukrainian soldier. The two victims, Ukrainian refugees Alina and her mother Elena, initially reported that their assailant was a Russian-speaking man who apparently attacked them for listening to Ukrainian music on their phones as they were walking along the beach. “When we heard how he spoke, we understood” that he was Russian, Alina told local news outlets. The two women sustained several injuries in the attack as doctors say Elena has a broken nose, while Alina may have suffered a concussion. When it was first reported, the incident drew outrage from Kiev as the media and several officials were quick to report that the assailant was Russian. In response to the reports, many commenters wrote on social media that the incident was an example of how dangerous Russian people were. The spokesperson for the country’s Foreign Ministry, Oleg Nikolenko, insisted that “the aggressors must be punished” and called for an immediate and thorough investigation into the attack while Ukraine’s Embassy in France denounced the assault as a “heinous incident.” On Tuesday, French police arrested a man who had confessed to attacking the two women. He turned out to be a 33-year-old man who had arrived in France seven months ago after having previously served in the Ukrainian military. Police say the man admitted assaulting the women, but downplayed the severity of his attack and insisted he merely “slapped” them, as reported by the 20 Minutes news outlet. The Ukrainian also stated that he thought the women he attacked were Russian nationals because of their “Russian accent.” According to the Nice prosecutor, the assailant now faces up to three years in prison and a fine of €45,000 ($45,000) for race-based violence. The hearing is expected to take place in November.",3.5768032295147743,3.121857183705688,0.4549460458090864,5
2022-09-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/562858-lavrov-un-general-assembly/,Lavrov’s UN itinerary revealed after doubts about his attendance,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will have a busy schedule for the upcoming UN General Assembly, his ministry has said. Until this week, there were doubts about Lavrov’s attendance at the international event, since the US could have refused to issue him a visa. The preliminary itinerary of the top Russian diplomat was described by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova during a briefing on Thursday. According to her, Lavrov will deliver a speech before the UN and attend a meeting of the BRICS, an economic club which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. He will also hold some 20 bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the US-hosted international event, she said. Lavrov’s participation in the 77th UN General Assembly was in some peril. The US, which placed personal sanctions on the Russian minister, did not issue a visa to him until mere days before the event, according to Moscow. Zakharova criticized what she described as an underhanded tactic employed by the US. Washington undermines its role as the host by “inventing visa restrictions and creating logistical problems for access to the UN headquarters in New York,” she said. The US has a record of restricting access to UN events to foreign politicians that it considers undesirable. A fresh example came in January 2020, when Washington denied a visa to then-Foreign Minister of Iran, Mohammad Javad Zarif. He wanted to attend a UN Security Council meeting and personally condemn the US assassination of Iranian General Qassem Suleimani, which happened that month. The 1947 agreement on the hosting of the UN headquarters required the US to grant access to it to foreign representatives “as promptly as possible.” But the US insists that it has the right to deny visas on security and foreign policy grounds. The UN GA will start on Friday and last until September 26, with most important parts of the gathering scheduled for the next week. The Russian delegation will use the opportunity to advocate on issues that it considers important, the Russian spokeswoman said. One of Moscow’s goals is to stress the role of the UN as the core of the multilateral global political system and to defend it from “attempts to undermine its authority and subjugate it to the whims of the West,” she said. Russia will also call for the reduction and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, speak against militarization of space, promote the idea of establishing global rules for the use of cyberspace and denounce attempts to glorify Nazism, Zakharova added.",3.0742386629616627,1.5398422868379231,1.5343963761237396,8
2022-09-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/562847-us-propaganda-information-war-russia/,Vitaly Sovin: The US propaganda machine is playing dirtier than ever in its information war against Russia,"After the publication of a recent story in the New York Times based on allegedly ‘declassified materials’ from US intelligence agencies about Russia’s ‘purchase’ of millions of artillery shells and missiles from North Korea for use in Ukraine, something went awry. Against the backdrop of statements from representatives of the State Department and the Department of Defense, who did not provide any factual information, John Kirby, the US National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications, walked it back. He conceded that there were no indications that the arms purchase had actually occurred yet, or that any North Korean munitions had made it onto the battlefield in Ukraine. The narrative, however, serves a number of purposes: The current situation is reminiscent of events that occurred two years ago, when the New York Times, in June 2020, was the source of a fake story alleging that Russian military intelligence had offered Taliban-linked fighters ‘bounties’ for killing US troops in Afghanistan. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez then proposed a sanctions package called the Russian Bounty Response Act of 2020, which included asset freezes and visa restrictions on Moscow’s top leadership. Menendez’s proposal was supported by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Democrat), who said that sanctions on Russia for ‘collusion’ with the Taliban should be imposed immediately. Then-President Donald Trump called the New York Times’ story “fake.” Trump later confirmed that US intelligence agencies had found it to be untrue. Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said there was no evidence of ‘Russian collusion’ with Taliban officials. The Taliban also denied the claims. In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, the ‘Russia’ factor was used in Democratic Party circles to point the finger at Trump for his failures on Afghanistan. The very next year, under President Joe Biden, the US infamously withdrew its military, leaving over $7 billion worth of weapons behind, according to the Pentagon. With the midterm election scheduled for November and the Ukrainian army suffering significant losses, the US continues to play dirty in its use of information warfare. It is clear that if Biden’s Democrats win, the anti-Russia campaign in its various manifestations will only intensify.",1.7113915263806039,2.665673325675652,-0.9542817992950483,7

The decision was announced by the European Council in the Official Journal of the European Union on Wednesday. It stated that the restrictions against Russian individuals accused of “undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine” would last until March 15, 2023. Aside from Zhirinovsky, who was the founder and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), the EU also removed Olga Aiziman – the former wife of Russian business tycoon Mikhail Fridman – as well as Saodat Narzieva, the sister of billionaire and former Arsenal football club shareholder Alisher Usmanov. Over 1,200 people and 108 legal entities are under EU sanctions. The list was initially formed in 2014 after Crimea seceded from Kiev’s rule after a public referendum and reunited with Russia. The number of individuals targeted was significantly increased after Moscow launched its military offensive against Kiev in February. The list includes members of the Russian government, high-ranking politicians, MPs, businessmen, journalists and other public figures. All the sanctioned individuals are barred from traveling to the EU and their assets in the bloc have been frozen. Russia’s Central Bank (CBR) estimated back in July that Western sanctions had frozen nearly $100 billion worth of investments belonging to over five million Russian citizens who held foreign stocks in Western accounts. Earlier this month, CBR head Elvira Nabiullina proposed creating a compensation fund for affected Russian investors by using the income generated from the frozen assets of nonresidents who have been sanctioned by Russia.",1.810082034415659,2.8999421669334984,-1.0898601325178394,7

All decisions will be based on the results of the joint mission sent by the organization to Armenia, Sidorov added. Tensions between Yerevan and Baku spilled over earlier this week when they accused each other of instigating violence, after clashes on the border between the two countries resulted in the deaths of dozens of soldiers from both sides. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has called on the CSTO for military assistance, claiming that Azerbaijani troops have seized parts of his country’s sovereign territory in recent days. Baku has “unilaterally” proposed a “humanitarian ceasefire,” stating it is not interested in escalating or destabilizing the situation any further.

The remark came as he met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Russia and China “stand together for a just, democratic, multipolar world order based on international law and the central role of the UN, and not on some rules that somebody invented and attempts to impose on others without even explaining what they are,” Putin said. The administration of US President Joe Biden has been using the phrase “rules-based world order” to describe the way it prefers the world to operate. During the meeting, Putin thanked Xi for China’s balanced stance on the crisis in Ukraine. China has criticized Russia for having attacked the country, but blamed the US for triggering the escalation by its push to expand NATO. Putin also reiterated Russia’s support of the 'one China' policy and Beijing’s claim of sovereignty over the island of Taiwan. The Chinese government has accused the US of undermining its territorial integrity by increasingly treating Taipei as a separate nation rather than a self-governing part of China. Putin praised the SCO as “a forum for constructive and creative cooperation.” He remarked that the members of the group have different cultural traditions, economic models and foreign policy priorities. Their willingness to work together as equal partners respecting each other has helped bolster the SCO’s prominence in a relatively short period of time, the Russian leader remarked. “It is now the biggest regional organization in the world, uniting a vast geographic space and about half of our planet’s population,” Putin stressed. The SCO is an economic integration and trust-building organization that unites a number of Eurasian nations, including Russia and China.

2022-09-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/562821-georgia-war-russia-referendum/,Proposal for ‘Georgian referendum on war’ explained,"A senior Georgian MP who suggested holding a referendum to confirm whether the people want the country to go to war with Russia says he put forward the idea in jest. “There was sarcasm and some irony in the statement,” Irakli Kobakhidze, who leads the parliamentary faction of the Georgian Dream party, said in a TV interview on Wednesday evening. The party is part of the ruling coalition. The proposal to hold a referendum on war came earlier this week, when the MP dismissed calls by Ukrainian officials, including the chair of the Ukrainian National Security Council, who suggested that Tbilisi could seize the moment and open a “second front” against Moscow. Russia and Georgia were engaged in a brief armed conflict in August 2008, after then-President Mikhail Saakashvili sent troops to capture South Ossetia, a part of Georgia that had split from it in a bloody war in the 1990s. Russian peacekeepers stationed there to prevent potential hostilities were among the first people killed by the advancing Georgians. Moscow retaliated and crushed the Georgian Army. It has since recognized South Ossetia, as well as Abkhazia, another breakaway region, as independent states and pledged its military protection to them. Tbilisi considers the regions to be occupied by Russia. Officials in Kiev argued that Georgia is now in a position to capture land it claims as its own while Russia is engaged in the military operation in Ukraine. Kobakhidze said the government has no intention to fight Russia, but the issue could be put to a general vote. In an interview with Rustavi2 TV, the MP said that opinion polls and studies have backed the government’s position that the people do not want to renew hostilities with Russia. This could change under certain circumstances, Kobakhidze added, but at the moment, Georgians realize that a war with Russia would pit them against people in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, making the conflict fratricidal. “We must not allow any war in which Georgians and Abkhazians and Georgians and Ossetians would face each other with weapons in their hands again,” he said.",2.8522336453051946,2.6328949162821096,0.21933872902308504,6

The US has done everything to turn Ukraine into a dumping ground for its obsolete weapons, but also a testing range for new NATO equipment, Antonov said, pointing out the insatiable appetite of the US military-industrial complex for profits. By the Pentagon’s own admission, the US has sent Ukraine “more than $17.2 billion in security assistance” since 2014, and another $14.5 billion since February. Kiev’s patrons are “hungry for power and money” and not interested in peaceful solutions, said Antonov. There is little to no talk in the West about negotiations, only about sending more weapons to Ukraine, he added. “Their main main goal is to defeat Russia by any means, and subsequently prevent it from playing a key role in the international arena. And if possible, break it into pieces,” the ambassador said. “They will not stop pushing Ukraine into further suicidal adventures, such as the ‘offensives’ that were doomed from the start.” Ukraine has claimed its recent advances in the Kharkov region are a “turning point” in the conflict. On Monday, the New York Times reported that the US and UK had been involved in planning the operation, including the admission by the Pentagon’s policy chief Colin Kahl that the US military “did do some modeling and some tabletop exercises,” which it shared with Kiev. “The current situation of Washington inciting Kiev against us is an indisputable, obvious fact,” said Antonov. If the Americans go along with Ukraine’s “insane” demands for long-range rockets, he added, “such a scenario would mean direct involvement of the US in a military confrontation with Russia.” Even so, this will “not lead to real change on the frontline,” Antonov said, “Only naive, short-sighted politicians who know history poorly can talk about victory over Russia on the battlefield.” Russia’s mission is to “lay down the foundations of a multipolar world order and send the American ‘rules-based world order’ into the dustbin of history,” and Moscow’s diplomats “have no doubt that we will achieve victory,” he concluded.",2.21106266302297,2.8093974175269056,-0.5983347545039357,8

The two nations have witnessed deadly border clashes this week, with Armenia accusing Azerbaijan of taking control over some of its territory. “It is not in the interest of our country to escalate the situation and destabilize it,” the statement read. The announcement was made as Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov met Russia’s special representative for international cultural cooperation, Mikhail Shvidkoy. Yerevan has so far not confirmed receiving the offer. Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan on Wednesday accused Azerbaijan of launching a “large-scale attack” on Armenia and “encroaching on [its] territorial integrity” during a meeting with foreign ambassadors in the Armenian capital. He also blasted Baku for issuing “ultimatums” and supposedly expecting Yerevan to “agree to all its conditions without negotiation.” Earlier this week, both Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other of instigating violence as clashes on the border resulted in the deaths of dozens of soldiers from both sides. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan also said on Wednesday that he had asked the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CTSO) – a Russian-led defense alliance – for military assistance, accusing Azerbaijani troops of seizing some parts of Armenia’s sovereign territory in recent days. Tensions between the two neighbors have been running high over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. Yerevan has supported the region's independence, which is mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, ever since it sought to break away from Azerbaijan in the early 1990s. In 2020, Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a 44-day war over Nagorno-Karabakh, which ended up with a Russian-brokered truce. In August, Baku demanded “demilitarization” of the region, while Yerevan accused it of pressuring Armenia into abandoning the route linking it to Nagorno-Karabakh. The CSTO announced on Wednesday that it would send a mission to Armenia to assess the situation on the ground. It will be led by CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas of Belarus and include Russian General Anatoly Sidorov, the head of the bloc’s joint staff.",3.5103220022099095,2.5499632491682145,0.960358753041695,4
2022-09-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/562523-ukranians-led-ussr/,"From Brezhnev to Khrushchev: Ukraine had a huge influence on the Soviet Union, something Kiev now prefers to downplay","In the very first years of the Soviet Union’s existence, Ukrainian Bolsheviks played an important role in building what became the world's largest ever state. And it was people from Ukraine itself who engaged in the ‘Ukrainization’ that aimed to replace the Russian language and culture there during the Stalin years. Although this process was officially curtailed in the late 1930s, it continued by inertia for many more years. As a result, Soviet policy allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become a fairly independent entity with its own national elite and intelligentsia, which opened the path to independence. Moreover, many Party officials from Ukraine held key positions in the USSR right up until its collapse. Here, RT seeks to explore what influence Ukrainians had on the Soviet Union’s development and how Kiev managed to carve out for itself a high degree of independence. Although born in the very center of Ukraine, Leonid Brezhnev preferred not to talk about his nationality. Joseph Stalin considered him a Moldavian. Until the 1950s, he had passed himself off as a Ukrainian and, after that, as a Russian, according to documents. However, former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, in his memoirs ‘Power and Life’, wrote that his friend Edward Gierek, de facto ruler of Poland for a decade, had told him that Brezhnev's mother was Polish. “Edward Gierek was a personal friend of Brezhnev’s. He informed me (although I cannot vouch for the authenticity of this information, since our intelligence service did not have a single undercover agent in the Soviet Union) that Brezhnev's mother was Polish. Brezhnev hid this because Russians tend to treat Poles with sarcasm and contempt. Nevertheless, Polish was his native language, and he often spoke Polish with Gierek on the phone.” Even now, many pages in the history of the Soviet Union remain a mystery. One of these concerns the ethnic composition of the country’s leadership. Such information was not published by the Party’s Central Committee until 1989, and biographies of members of the governing bodies during the entire Soviet period were not released until 1990, just before the dissolution of the USSR. All of these documents confirmed that many of its statesmen, politicians, diplomats, as well as military and intelligence officers, had been born in Ukraine. However, information about their ethnic origin was often omitted. Also, many of those who originated from Ukraine were registered as ‘Russian’ or simply as ‘Soviet’. This is why it is so difficult to assess the full scope of political influence Ukrainians had on the decision-making process in the Soviet Union. It is true that Ukrainians contributed a great deal to building socialism. If we round them all up, we see that there had always been very large numbers of people from Ukraine in the top tiers of power. Two of them, Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, ruled the country as general secretary of the Communist Party’s Central Committee. The country’s final ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev, was the descendant of Ukrainian peasants who had moved to Stavropol. Kliment Voroshilov and Nikolai Podgorny were both Ukrainians who served as chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, while quite a number of Ukrainians served at various times as deputy chairmen, including Demyan Korotchenko, Mikhail Grechukha, Ivan Grushetsky, Alexey Vatchenko, and Valentina Shevchenko. Dozens of Central Committee secretaries and Politburo members, as well as members of the All-Union government were also Ukrainian. There were also Ukrainians at the helm of the KGB – for example, Vladimir Semichastny, who co-organized the successful coup against Khrushchev in October 1964. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was managed by local elites, which is completely at odds with the modern myth of Ukraine having been an ‘oppressed nation’ in the Soviet Union. Moreover, so many Ukrainians held key positions in the Soviet government that any allegations made by the present-day Ukrainian authorities about the Ukrainian SSR struggling under the yoke of the Russian SFSR and being de facto Soviet Russia’s colony simply don’t have a leg to stand on. On the contrary, by the 1950s, the Ukrainian SSR had become a full-fledged statelet that had its own constitution and flag and even parliament. In fact, its structure mirrored that of the government of the Soviet Union itself. Ukraine’s policy was determined by the Communist Party of Ukraine with the Politburo being its highest body of power; its legislative branch was represented by the Supreme Council (this later became the Verkhovna Rada); and executive power was wielded by the Council of Ministers. The truth is that Soviet Russia had none of the above-listed privileges. The All-Union government allowed other republics to have their national branches of the Communist Party and national Academies of Sciences, but it did not permit this for Russia. The Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic had no government of its own. Joseph Stalin made sure it never did for fear that an empowered Russia might grow to challenge the All-Union government. This policy was so severe that in 1949 a number of senior officials from Leningrad were executed, exiled or imprisoned on trumped-up charges of treason for their intention to create the Communist Party of Russia. This became known as the Leningrad Affair. Thus, attempts to misrepresent Soviet Russia as a colonial power in charge of the other republics in the USSR are very misguided. Other republics even enjoyed more autonomy. For example, the Belarusian SSR and Ukrainian SSR had their own foreign policy agencies and their own missions at the United Nations from 1945, while Russia did not. This is an unprecedented level of autonomy for a republic that is part of a larger state. For example, it is not something granted to Scotland by the United Kingdom. Indeed, not so many of the present-day nation states in Europe can boast they were actually co-founders of the UN. Each Soviet Socialist Republic, including Ukraine, had its national language recognized as official – for example, Soviet currency bills stated their value in all of the national languages. More importantly, the republics were governed by locals. It was through the collaboration of the local elites and the All-Union government that a policy of indigenization, or nativization, was promoted from the 1920s. In the case of Ukraine, it was the ‘Ukrainization’ project. The idea was to kill two birds with one stone: promote the Communist ideology and to preempt any possible nationalist movements in the republics by giving them privileges and powers. Since local nationalists were unavoidably part of the republics’ governments, nativization was perceived by the Communists as a viable solution to win them over and encourage them to cooperate. Another serious threat was the White movement. In 1926, Odessa’s population consisted of 160,000 Russians and 73,000 Ukrainians. Kharkov, which was at the time the Ukrainian SSR’s capital city, had 154,000 Russians and 160,000 Ukrainians. Back then, the criteria for establishing one’s nationality were quite loose: sometimes, it was enough to say where a person’s household was located while native language could have been disregarded. In order to build a new socialist state, the Bolsheviks decided to nip any potential resistance in the bud by supporting Ukraine’s culture and downplaying Russia’s. At that time, many peasants were migrating to the cities in search of a better life. Since they had no roots there, they were a suitable target for the Bolsheviks’ nativization program. To promote this agenda, they officially proclaimed a policy of indigenization designed to remove ‘vestiges of nationalism’ at the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party in April 1923. The policy implied the promotion of local languages and cultures, as well as the formation of national elites. The main goal of the campaign was to replace the Russian culture and language in the Soviet republics with local cultures and languages, which was touted as a fight against the ‘Great-Russian chauvinism’ inherited from Russia’s imperial past. The Bolsheviks effectively stated the need to remedy the consequences of the ‘Russification’ policies pursued by the Russian Empire in order to facilitate the process of building socialism. For that, they nurtured local elites, gave official status to their languages and financed the spread of culture and printed media in these languages. Thus, the Belarusians and the ‘Little Russians’ (Ukrainians) – two ethnicities that had been at the core of the Russian nation – started to shape into ‘independent’ nations pursuing their own ideologies within borders that had never previously existed. The ‘Ukrainization’ policy was supervised by local officials. In 1924, the main ideologue and mastermind of the ‘Ukrainian nation’, historian Mikhail Grushevky, returned to Kiev with the Bolsheviks’ permission. He devised and implemented a method of widespread promotion of the Ukrainian language through the secondary education system. At the same time, linguists were tasked with developing a literary form of the Ukrainian language. The project was implemented by Ukrainian Bolsheviks Nikolai Skripnik and Stanislav Kosior. “We, Great-Russian Communists, must make concessions when there are differences with the Ukrainian Bolshevik Communists concerning the state independence of Ukraine, the forms of its alliance with Russia, and the national question in general,” Lenin wrote back in 1920. The results came quickly. Ukrainian language classes were introduced in all institutions where educational workers and teachers were trained across the Ukrainian SSR, as well as in schools where teaching was conducted in another language. As a result, the share of industrial workers who increasingly started identifying themselves as Ukrainians grew from 41% to 53% between 1926 and 1932. However, the ‘Ukrainization’ process was largely imposed from above, forced upon the urban Russian-speaking population, which was mostly dissatisfied with the policies. They were particularly opposed to the requirement to use Ukrainian at formal events and occasions. De-Russification was coupled with propaganda campaigns launched in Soviet newspapers, while publishing in the Ukrainian language was growing rapidly. This success somewhat tamed the ardor of the Ukrainian Bolsheviks, but the campaign had already picked up steam to the point where it was extremely difficult to stop and the Kremlin was forced to accommodate the local elites’ craving for independence for many more years. It was not until the late 1930s that the Ukrainization project was finally scrapped due to apprehensions that it could revive the Ukrainian nationalist movement. There was also another reason behind that decision – high school graduates often did not speak Russian and, therefore had difficulties at universities where teaching was still conducted in in the tongue. This apparent imbalance within the educational system spurred the decision to declare national schools ‘hotbeds of bourgeois-nationalist influence on children’. The ‘Ukrainization’ pursued by the Soviet leadership until the late 1930s laid solid groundwork for the development and growth of the Ukrainian nation and its culture. Even after the project was abandoned, the surge of nationalist feeling it had triggered persisted for many more years by inertia. Soviet policies effectively made the Ukrainian SSR a self-sufficient territorial entity within the Soviet Union, with its own national elite and a class of creative intellectuals, which paved the way for Ukraine’s eventual independence. The post-war Ukrainian Soviet Republic went in the opposite direction and began promoting the Russian language and culture. This happened after Nikita Khrushchev hammered scholars and social scientists in August 1946 at the plenary session of the Communist Party of Ukraine’s Central Committee for errors in their interpretations of history. He challenged them to cultivate “zero tolerance for any manifestation of bourgeois nationalism”among Ukrainian citizens. And the loyalty of Ukrainians to the Soviet regime was ensured by Lazar Kaganovich, a prominent politician in charge of the ‘Ukrainization’ project in the 1920s. Still, the Ukrainian humanities continued to develop after World War II despite the unremitting party oversight. In 1949, for example, the first volume of the 20-book complete works of poet and writer Ivan Franko was published, followed by Ivan Kotlyarovsky’s collected edition in the early 1950s, and poems by Lesya Ukrainka were prepared for printing. Some research institutes were focusing on Ukrainian studies. All of that changed after Stalin died in 1953 and his cult of personality was denounced by Nikita Khrushchev, who had been raised in Eastern Ukraine, at the 20th Party Congress. The Ukrainian SSR ushered in a new period of ‘Ukrainization’ after the Khrushchev Thaw had brought partial liberalization. Use of the Ukrainian language saw many changes as well. Dictionaries of the Ukrainian language were compiled and most universities switched to Ukrainian as their language of instruction. Moreover, the Crimean Autonomous SSR, where Russian prevailed, was transferred from the Russian to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic by a decree from Khrushchev. “The victory in the Great October Socialist Revolution and Lenin’s policy on nationalities allowed the Ukrainian people to create their first nation state,” the first secretary of the Central Committee of Ukraine’s Communist Party, Pyotr Shelest, said in 1970, meaning the Khrushchev Thaw, among other things. And he was right – the national party’s top brass enjoyed a special status in Ukraine, both in the party and government structures. Notably, this status was reinforced under Leonid Brezhnev, when Vladimir Shcherbitsky assumed the post of the Central Committee’s first secretary. In that period, monuments to Ukrainian Cossacks were erected and an open-air Museum of Folk Architecture and Rural Life in Pirogovo near Kiev was established. In the stagnation-plagued Brezhnev era, Ukrainians often received top governmental positions in Moscow. It was for a reason that people used to joke, “My golden capital, glorious Dnepropetrovsk,” twisting a line from a popular song about Moscow. In 1965–1977, Nikolai Podgorny, a Ukrainian national, was the chairman of the Presidium of the USSR’s Supreme Soviet and Kharkov-born Nikolai Tikhonov, whose career began in Dnepropetrovsk, was the Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1980 to 1985. Several members of the Central Committee at the time had ties to the Dnepropetrovsk region. Among them were Andrei Kirilenko, Pyotr Shelest, Vladimir Shcherbitsky, Andrei Grechko, and Dmitry Polyansky. In the 1980s, when Ukraine’s Communist Party was headed by Shcherbitsky, the Ukrainian SSR was called the last stronghold of communism. But history would have none of it. And a fateful phrase by the president of independent Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk comes to mind in this regard, “Ukraine can be proud to be the state that has shattered the Soviet Union.” Indeed, despite Ukraine being among the USSR’s leading economies and in the top ten most developed European nations, it was the Ukrainian leadership that played a key part in the collapse of the Soviet Union, a multinational country in which the Ukrainian people had held a special position.",3.2702715883632894,2.695982232615939,0.5742893557473505,4

The cyberattack comes as Russia’s Ministry of Digital Development has recently revealed that the number of attacks on Russia’s infrastructure of remote electronic voting has exceeded 35,000 during the course of the recently finished regional elections across the country on September 11. It has also been reported that Moscow’s online voting system came under over 10,000 DDOS attacks during the three-day municipal elections.

The development comes amid continued clashes on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Pashinyan claimed that Azerbaijani troops seized some Armenian territory as a result of the fighting. He also said that Yerevan had invoked Article four of the Collective Security Treaty, which treats an attack on one member as an attack on all. “We have asked for help, including military, in restoring the territorial integrity of Armenia and ensuring the withdrawal of Azerbaijani Armed Forces,” Pashinyan said. Earlier on Wednesday, the CSTO announced it would send a mission to Armenia to assess the situation on the ground. The delegation is expected to be led by CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas of Belarus and include Russian General Anatoly Sidorov, the head of the bloc’s joint staff. Tensions between Baku and Yerevan spiked this week week when troops engaged in clashes on the border, resulting in dozens of deaths on both sides, according to officials. Azerbaijan has previously accused Armenia of staging a large-scale “provocation” on the border by instigating violence – something Yerevan had denied. Relations between the two neighbors have been strained for decades because of the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The area is a de-jure part of Azerbaijan but is mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, who sought to proclaim independence from Baku in the 1990s with support from Yerevan. In 2020, the two nations fought a 44-day war over Nagorno-Karabakh, which saw Azerbaijan make some gains but eventually ended with a Moscow-brokered truce. In August, Baku demanded the “demilitarization” of the disputed region while Yerevan accused Azerbaijan of pressuring it into abandoning a route linking Armenian territory to Nagorno-Karabakh, which is also known as the Lachin corridor.",4.166387804832981,3.707756926189823,0.4586308786431581,4

The image shared by the office of the leader was made during his visit to the recently re-captured town of Izyum on Wednesday. The controversial skull-and-bones image was featured on the back of a heavily armed Ukrainian trooper, who appeared to be part of Zelensky’s security detail during the trip. It can be seen in one of the photos, which the president’s office released on social media. The symbol was the insignia of the SS-Totenkopfverbande units, the part of the Nazi paramilitary Schutzstaffel responsible for security at the death camps. It was also adopted by the elite Panzer Division ‘Totenkopf’ of the Waffen-SS, which was formed from the death camp guards and fought on the Eastern front and committed numerous war crimes. In modern times, it was adopted by various far-right and nationalist groups in Ukraine, which got their inspiration from Ukrainian nationalist forces that collaborated with the Nazi Germany during World War II and fought against the Soviet Union. Organizations monitoring extremists consider it a hate symbol. In May, Zelensky’s office included a photo of a Ukrainian artillery trooper wearing a similar ‘death head’ patch on his chest in a selection posted on social media on the occasion of the Allied victory in the European theater of war. The same photo was also shared by the country’s defense ministry that day. Russia cited the influence that extremists groups have in the Ukrainian national guard and military as one of the reasons for sending troops into the country in late February. Zelensky was elected president in 2019 on a platform of reconciliation with rebel forces in the east and normalization of ties with Russia. His initial attempts to deliver on the campaign promises were met with fierce criticisms and street protests by nationalist groups, which called for tougher policies and suppression of Donbass.

Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists that the news agencies allegations were completely unfounded. The outlet claimed that at the beginning of Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine in late February, Dmitry Kozak, Deputy Kremlin Chief of Staff, managed to hammer out a provisional accord with Kiev that would see it walk back on its bid to join NATO. According to the report, Kozak recommended the deal, but it was rejected by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Reuters’ sources said that the Russian leader made it clear that the concessions his aide had gained from Kiev did not go far enough. Commenting on the Reuters story, Peskov said that it “has absolutely no relation to reality”. “No such thing ever happened. It is absolutely incorrect information,” he stressed. Over the years, Moscow has repeatedly sounded the alarm over NATO encroaching on Russia’s borders as the military alliance accepted new members from Eastern Europe. Ukraine’s potential accession to NATO and the deployment of Western troops and military hardware on its territory have been particularly contentious points for Moscow. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

Speaking to Die Welt, the scandal-ridden diplomat – who was fired after a string of contentious remarks, including one directed at German Chancellor Olaf Scholz – indicated that the Russian leader knows how to toy with the Germans. “Putin knows the German soul and, unfortunately, can play well with it,” he said, adding that the Russian president relies on “intimidation” when engaging in dialogue with Berlin. “This fear is his greatest weapon, and German policies have also failed in recent years and decades,” Melnik stated. He went on to say that Russia is unlikely to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine as part of its military operation, due to the high costs this would entail. Melnik also commented on his resignation, striking an unusually self-critical tone. “You have to answer for your mistakes. No matter how critical one is of the government, Germany is our most important ally in Europe,” he said, adding that Ukraine “has to win over the Germans” and expressing hope that his successor will do a better job than he did. His remarks come after Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba blasted Germany on Tuesday for failing to give a “single rational argument” as to why it could not supply Kiev with battle tanks, accusing Berlin of offering “only abstract fears and excuses.” Melnik was sacked by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in early July after a flurry of controversies. His headline-grabbing remarks included calling the German chancellor an “offended liverwurst” and defending Stepan Bandera, a controversial Ukrainian nationalist hero who collaborated with the Nazis during WWII. Melnik insisted that Bandera was not involved in the mass murder of Jews and Poles during the war.

2022-09-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/562776-peskov-ukraine-security-pact/,Ukraine's security appeal to West an 'urgent' threat to Russia - Kremlin,"Moscow will be forced to double down on its military offensive in Ukraine after Kiev released a proposal on how the US and its allies could guarantee its security, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned. The document highlights the threat that NATO poses to Russia, he argued. The Russian official noted on Wednesday that the proposed series of treaties between Ukraine and the US and its allies is specifically meant as a stopgap solution before Ukraine formally joins NATO. Moscow considers Ukraine’s accession to the US-led military bloc unacceptable due to the perceived threat to its national security such a step would entail. “One of the main threats to our nation remains, which means that one of the main reasons for the special military operation remains, or even becomes more urgent,” Peskov told journalists. He added that the best path that Ukraine has to ensure its national security under the circumstances was to address Russia’s concern over its cooperation with NATO. “The leadership of the country must take steps to eliminate the threat posed to Russia. They know well what those steps should be,” Peskov said. The proposed ‘Kiev Security Compact’ was released on Tuesday by the office of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. The document was prepared by his chief-of-staff Andrey Yermak and former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Kiev wants the US and other members of NATO to offer legally binding guarantees of its security and pledge long-term economic assistance. The document explicitly rejects Russia’s demand of a neutral status for Ukraine. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated earlier on Wednesday that the proposal was meant to trick European nations into a costly sponsorship of Kiev. They will risk their own economic viability, thus undermining their own political power, which secretly is the goal of Kiev’s puppeteers in Washington, she claimed.

Not just for Ukraine, but for all of Europe and the world at large,” Von der Leyen insisted in her State of Union speech on Wednesday. “This is not only a war unleashed by Russia against Ukraine, this is also a war on our energy. It’s a war on our economy. It’s a war on our values. It’s a war on our future. It’s about autocracy against democracy,” she said. However, despite large parts of Ukrainian territory remaining under Russian control, and the looming energy crisis in Europe resulting from the EU’s sanctions on Moscow, the EU Commission chief expressed confidence that the outcome of the Ukraine conflict will be positive for Brussels. “I stand here with a conviction that with the necessary courage and with necessary solidarity Putin will fail and Ukraine and Europe will prevail,” she said to great applause. “Europe’s solidarity with Ukraine will remain unshakable.” She also praised the EU for its response to the Russian military operation, which has included military and humanitarian support for Ukraine, as well as the “toughest sanctions the world has ever seen.” However, von der Leyen acknowledged that achieving victory against Russia would require serious sacrifices from European citizens. “The moments ahead of us will not be easy – be it for the families who are struggling to make ends meet, or businesses who are facing tough choices concerning their future.” Supplies of Russian oil and gas to Europe have drastically decreased amid the conflict in Ukraine, due to EU sanctions and Moscow’s countermeasures. People in Austria, the Czech Republic, and other countries in the bloc have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest the soaring costs of energy, demanding that their leaders do something to resolve the crisis. However, there is a lack of unity in the EU on the idea of a price cap on Russian gas, which is being pushed by von der Leyen as a relief measure.

2022-09-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/562753-ukraine-compact-trap-europe/,Moscow outlines ‘diabolical’ plan by Washington,"Ukraine’s newly published proposal for Western security guarantees is an invitation for the economic self-immolation of the EU, according to Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Russian diplomat believes that the proposed international agreement which Kiev released on Tuesday is an economic trap for EU nations set by the US with Ukraine’s assistance. Most of the measures included in the document “are already being implemented” by Kiev’s backers, but Washington’s EU allies are expected to pledge to keep the Ukraine aid money flowing for the foreseeable future, Zakharova said in an interview on Wednesday. If signed, the ‘Kiev Security Compact’ would mean “harsh slavery” for the bloc from which it would not recover anytime soon, she claimed. “A total commitment to supporting the Kiev regime would simply mean immolation [for the EU]. And this proposal is addressed to nations that are debating how they can live through the winter,” Zakharova said, in reference to the energy shortages that EU member states are struggling to confront. Developed EU nations face an economic and humanitarian disaster after taking directions from the US on how to respond to the crisis in Ukraine, according to the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.

Now “they are being corralled together” so their lives will become “colder, poorer, and harder,” she said.

The move, announced by the presidential spokesperson in a Facebook post on Tuesday, will reverse one of Tokayev’s first decisions after taking office in 2019 following the decades-long rule of Kazakhstan’s first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev. The renaming initiative was included in a constitutional reform package following a push launched earlier this month by lawmakers, who argued that it is “wrong” to name the city after a person who is still alive, and that “the people have also not accepted the new name of the capital.” The country’s capital has seen multiple name changes in the past century, and has even been relocated on more than one occasion. Astana was once known as Akmolinsk in imperial Russia, was renamed to Tselinograd during the Soviet era, and then to Akmola when Kazakhstan got its independence in the 1990s, only taking its present name in 1997. The parliamentary initiative also comes after violent unrest earlier this year, triggered by a sharp spike in fuel prices following the end of a state-enforced price cap, as well as discontentment over alleged corruption. Days of protests, rioting, and clashes with security forces resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of arrests – with Russian-led peace-keepers brought in to quell the violence at one point – but ultimately prompted a number of constitutional and economic reforms by the government.",2.8523568433988475,2.78192700722888,0.07042983616996734,3

The mission will be led by CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas of Belarus and include Russian General Anatoly Sidorov, the head of the bloc’s joint staff. The decision was made at a videoconference of the bloc’s Security Council convened by Armenia, which currently presides over the CSTO. Armenian PM Nikol Pashinyan informed the allies about the overnight border clashes with Azerbaijan. At least 49 Armenians and 50 Azerbaijanis were killed in the fighting, which involved heavy artillery and drones, according to the defense ministries in Yerevan and Baku. Russian President Vladimir Putin informed the allies on the practical steps Moscow has taken to de-escalate the tensions on the Armenia-Azerbaijan border. The CSTO endorsed the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict “exclusively by political and diplomatic means based on the generally recognized principles of international law” and the Russian-mediated ceasefire in November 2020, the organization said. Moscow had brokered an end to the 44-day conflict, in which Azerbaijan recaptured a large portion of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians that seceded from Baku in the 1990s. While the remaining part of Nagorno-Karabakh has been patrolled by Russian peacekeepers and remained relatively peaceful ever since, in August, Azerbaijan demanded that Armenia fully “demilitarize” the area and threatened a military operation if this does not happen. Armenia appealed to the CSTO after Tuesday’s clashes began, but it is not known if Yerevan has officially invoked Article 4, which treats an attack on one member as an attack on all. The bloc, established in 1994, also includes Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan were members until 1999 but then withdrew, with Baku and Tbilisi seeking ties to NATO instead.

Moscow will act to prevent a disaster from happening, while the US does not seem to care about the potential damage to Ukraine and its European NATO allies, the speaker of the Russian parliament has said. “Kiev’s terrorist actions are putting the world on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. We cannot allow this to happen,” Volodin said, opening the legislature’s autumn session. While the US may be far away from the plant, “their NATO allies in Europe stand to suffer” in case of a radioactive release, Volodin noted, adding that the US government and EU parliaments are silent about the threat, but many other states around the world share Russia’s concern about the situation. Russia has controlled Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. Attacks on the facility started in July, with the Russian Defense Ministry documenting more than 30 artillery and drone strikes, as well as two attempts by Ukrainian commandos to storm the plant, one during the visit of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission earlier this month. Kiev has accused Moscow of staging the shelling to make Ukraine look bad, even though its military eventually admitted to targeting the area. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, who personally led the mission to inspect the plant, said on Monday that both Russia and Ukraine are “interested” in a proposal for a local ceasefire and a security zone around the ZNPP. All of its six reactors are currently offline, due to the ongoing artillery threat. Moscow has rejected any notion of withdrawing its troops from the area, however, with the Kremlin saying that the only discussion at this time is “about forcing the Ukrainian side to stop the barbaric shelling” of the premises. In his remarks on Tuesday, Volodin said, “time has once again shown the correctness of the decision” by President Vladimir Putin to send troops into Ukraine in February.",3.300462584170416,4.015091713673234,-0.7146291295028182,9

According to the ministry, “50 servicemen of the Armed Forces,” including 42 army soldiers and eight border guards, died while supposedly repelling a “large-scale provocation” launched by Armenia. The statement also mentioned there had been wounded in the clashes but did not reveal their number. Azerbaijan claims the midnight shelling on Tuesday was provoked by Yerevan, after the defense ministry in Baku accused Armenian “saboteurs” of mining roads and infrastructure on the Azeri side of the border over the weekend. Yerevan rejected Baku’s accusations and blamed Azerbaijan for launching a sudden attack in seven locations along the border, with artillery and mortar fire, as well as drone strikes targeting “both military and civilian” infrastructure in Armenia. According to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, 49 Armenian soldiers were killed while repelling the Azeri attack. Tensions between the two neighbors run high over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The local mostly-ethnically Armenian population sought to declare independence from Azerbaijan in the early 1990s with support from Armenia, sparking a prolonged conflict between the two nations. In 2020, Baku and Yerevan fought a 44-day war over Nagorno-Karabakh, which saw Azerbaijani troops making gains and eventually ended with a Russian-brokered truce. On Tuesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry called on both sides to observe the ceasefire and exercise restraint. In early August, Baku demanded the “demilitarization” of the disputed region while Yerevan accused the Azerbaijani side of pressuring it into abandoning the so-called Lachin Corridor – a mountain path linking its territory to Nagorno-Karabakh.",3.361198144003759,6.353355574614568,-2.992157430610809,4

For all the problems the Russians may have faced in Ukraine, their military is “still very large and very powerful” and Russian President Vladimir Putin “still has an awful lot of military capacity left at his disposal, not just to be used in Ukraine, but potentially elsewhere.” Ukrainian forces moved into areas north and east of Kharkov last week, with President Vladimir Zelensky claiming gains of 2,000 square kilometers. Moscow claimed the Russian troops that previously held the strategically important city of Izyum were “redeployed.” Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna told France 24 on Tuesday that the Kharkov operation was a “turning point” not just of the fighting since February, but of “the war that started in the spring of 2014,” referring to Kiev’s efforts to suppress the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics in the aftermath of the US-backed coup. Earlier in the day, appearing on ABC’s Good Morning America, Kirby expressed confidence that Kiev could maintain the pace of operations, noting that “they’ve planned this counteroffensive pretty carefully.” According to the New York Times, British and US military officials worked together with Ukraine’s general staff to plan the counterattack. The new US defense attache in Kiev, Brigadier-General Garrick Harmon, “began having daily sessions with Ukraine’s top officers” in the run-up to the counteroffensive, the paper reported on Tuesday. “We did do some modeling and some tabletop exercises,” Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told the Times in a telephone interview. “That set of exercises suggested that certain avenues for a counteroffensive were likely to be more successful than others. We provided that advice, and then the Ukrainians internalized that and made their own decision.” The US also provided Ukraine with intelligence about Russian positions, pointing out the front in the northeast was weaker than in the south, Kahl said.

While Stefanishyna claimed that Ukraine has rejected Russian offers of peace talks, Russia said it has conducted “massive strikes” on Ukrainian positions. Ukraine reclaimed a swath of territory in Kharkov Region last week, with Kiev claiming a successful counteroffensive and Russia downplaying its significance, stating instead that it pulled its forces back to “regroup” and strengthen its positions in Donetsk. “It’s not only the turning point of the full-scale war…it’s the turning point of the war that started in the spring of 2014,” Stefanishyna said, referring to Kiev’s eight-year effort to suppress the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. Stefanishyna claimed that Russian officials reached out to Kiev in the days after the apparent counteroffensive, offering to talk peace terms in exchange for a ceasefire. Moscow has not commented on these claims, and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Sunday that Russia remains open to negotiations, but that peace will be made more difficult the longer the military operation continues. Stefanishyna said that the supposed Russian offer was rebuffed, and that Ukraine will only enter negotiations after it has achieved its military objectives. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has repeatedly stated that Kiev’s military goals involve driving Russian forces out of Ukraine and recapturing both the Donbass republics and Crimea, which voted to rejoin Russia in 2014. Despite Stefanishyna’s optimism, the Russian Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday that its air force, missile troops, and artillery conducted “massive strikes” on Ukrainian positions in the preceding day. Hitting Ukrainian units near Slavyansk and Konstantinovka in eastern Ukraine, and Artemovsk and Kurdyumovka in the Donetsk People’s Republic, the ministry said that its bombardments took out more than 800 Ukrainian and foreign troops. Further attacks targeted Ukrainian units in the south of the country and near Kharkov in the north, the ministry said, while a separate series of strikes wiped out a 45,000-ton ammunition dump near the town of Voznesensk in Nikolaev Region and killed 300 Ukrainian troops.",3.8806058577689813,2.333354479359213,1.5472513784097681,2

Irakli Kobakhidze was commenting on statements made by some Ukrainian officials in recent months, who had called on Tbilisi to join its fight against Russia. “We can hold a referendum, a plebiscite on whether people want to open a second front [against Russia] in Georgia or not,” Kobakhidze said, according to the Georgian news Channel 1. He said Georgians should “make a decision” themselves on whether they agree with officials in Kiev or their own government, which opposes such a move, he added. “If people want it, we can discuss it together later,” the politician said, without offering a timeline on when such a referendum might happen. On Monday, Ukrainian MP, Fedor Venislavsky told Channel 1 that Tbilisi had a unique opportunity to seize back the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which it considers parts of its sovereign territory. The two regions declared their independence from Georgia in 2008 following a brief military conflict between Moscow and Tbilisi. The conflict was prompted by Tbilisi’s forces shelling the region, where Russian peacekeepers were stationed. South Ossetia announced plans to unite with Russia in March this year, but with Moscow now focused on the conflict with Kiev, Tbilisi could try to get both breakaway republics back, Venislavsky said. Similar comments were made in August by the head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, Aleksey Danilov, who told Ukraine’s Channel 24 that Georgia should “recapture” the territories. Danilov’s words sparked a flurry of criticism from the Georgian opposition at the time, with some branding the idea of Georgia joining the conflict as “irrelevant” and “inappropriate.”",2.75092128988133,1.8609992262426454,0.8899220636386846,8

Endlessly funneling weapons and support to Ukraine while pretending not to be directly involved in the conflict will not work, added the deputy chair of the Russian Security Council. The “security guarantees” proposal unveiled by Kiev on Tuesday was “really a prologue to the Third World War,” said Medvedev, calling it a “hysterical appeal” to Western countries engaged in a proxy war against Russia. If the West continues its “unrestrained pumping of the Kiev regime with the most dangerous types of weapons,” Russia’s military campaign will move to the next level, where “visible boundaries and potential predictability of actions by the parties to the conflict” will be erased and the conflict will take on a life of its own, as wars always do, Medvedev argued. “And then the Western nations will not be able to sit in their clean homes, laughing at how they carefully weaken Russia by proxy. Everything will be on fire around them. Their people will harvest their grief in full. The land will be on fire and the concrete will melt,” Medvedev wrote, before citing a Bible verse from Revelations 9:18. “Yet still the narrow-minded politicians and their stupid think tanks, thoughtfully twirling a glass of wine in their hands, talk about how they can deal with us without entering into a direct war. Dull idiots with a classical education,” Medvedev wrote. His comments were prompted by Kiev’s publication of a “security treaty” proposal, developed under the tutelage of former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen. The draft envisions the US and its allies guaranteeing Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders with weapons, ammunition, financial assistance and training, as well as committing to maintain sanctions against Russia for as long as Kiev wants, and handing over any confiscated Russian property to Ukraine.",2.7643247507988185,2.1623386279062546,0.6019861228925638,8

The decision will allow Moscow’s representatives to visit New York for the United Nations General Assembly, despite being under US sanctions. “Today, visas were given to Lavrov and a number of those who will accompany him,” the Interfax agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesperson as saying. Moscow had repeatedly criticized Washington for refusing to grant visas to the Russian diplomats to attend the 77th session of the assembly. “We expect visas to be issued to the rest of the delegation and logistical issues promptly resolved,” the spokesperson reportedly said, slamming the “illegal sanctions” on Russian representatives. The US slapped personal sanctions on high-level Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, following the launch of Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine in February. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov accused Washington earlier on Tuesday of “breaking their obligations” by delaying the granting of visas, but said he hoped the US would fulfill its obligations. “Let’s hope that the United States will deliver on its duties,” he said, saying that Washington must grant visas to everyone scheduled to attend the General Assembly.

The opening of Taiwan's office in Lithuania’s capital Vilnius last year prompted outrage from China, which considers the island as a part of its territory. A recent visit of a large Lithuanian delegation to Taiwan, soon after the controversial visit of the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, led to further deterioration of its relations with China, but nonetheless Vilnius proceeded with its plan to open an office in Taipei. “Mr Paulius Lukauskas, the first representative of Lithuania in Taiwan, successfully arrived in Taiwan in early September,” Remus Li-Kuo Chen, head of the European Affairs department at Taiwan’s foreign ministry, said. On Monday, Lukauskas formally applied for accreditation, and therefore the new Lithuanian office is “basically” now operating, Chen explained. However, he said, the office is still in the process of installing the equipment and conducting necessary “preparatory work” prior to an opening. On Monday, during his visit to the island, Lithuania’s Vice Minister of Economy and Investment Karolis Zemaitis said that the representative office will open as soon as possible. Admitting that he is unsure if all the necessary preparations can be completed before the end of his visit on Friday, Zemaitis stressed that “the most important point is that the representative is already physically here and working.” Last year’s opening of a representative office of Taiwan in Lithuania led China to downgrade its diplomatic ties with the Baltic country to the level of chargé d’affaires. In August, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin described a visit of the Lithuanian delegation to Taipei as “a deliberate violation of [China’s] sovereignty and a gross interference in China’s internal affairs,” and threatened a stern response. After Beijing imposed sanctions on Lithuanian Deputy Transport and Communications Minister Agne Vaiciukeviciute who headed the delegation, Lithuania’s foreign ministry issued a formal protest to China. The exchange came shortly after the US House Speaker traveled to the island on August 2, a move that sparked a fierce reaction from Beijing. China considers visits by high-ranking foreign officials as violations of the ‘One China’ policy enshrined in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, as well as a number of official statements.",2.7113553226730955,2.644568446927006,0.06678687574608944,8

The first goal for Kiev is to assure the protection of critical infrastructure facilities with air defense systems, Podoliak wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. The move is “obligatory” because, according to the aide, “Russia fights against civilians.” Moscow has been insisting since the start of the conflict that its forces only target Ukrainian troops and military facilities. The second goal is capturing the areas controlled by the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, he said. The “liberation” of Donetsk and Lugansk will cause a “domino effect,” leading to the collapse of the front and political destabilization in Russia, Podoliak believes. Achieving those tasks is “possible,” he insisted, but added that “weapons [are] required” to do so, apparently addressing Kiev’s western backers. The statement by Zelensky aide follows a Ukrainian counteroffensive last week, which saw Russia withdrawing its troops from Izyum and some other settlements in the Kharkov region. Moscow claimed it decided to “regroup” its forces to strengthen its contingent in Donetsk, while Kiev celebrated the move as its victory. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

Kiev suggests countries including the US, UK, Australia and Turkey would act as security guarantors for Ukraine. The “multi-level” approach would see a “core” group of allies making clear commitments to support Ukraine’s military, while a broader group would provide non-military guarantees based on sanctions. “We need a military force strong enough to repel the Russians’ desire for revenge. And one capable of causing irreparable damage to the aggressor if this desire turns out to be irresistible,” Zelensky’s chief of staff Andrey Yermak said. He said the agreement would not be a substitute for joining NATO, but a means of ensuring security until Ukraine officially joins the US-led military bloc. Former NATO secretary general Rasmussen said the “immediate priority” was to achieve victory for Kiev and stressed that Ukraine would require decades of support from its Western partners. Security guarantees for Ukraine was a main sticking point in talks with Russia in Istanbul in March. Moscow argued that if Ukraine promised not to seek NATO membership, it would be provided with guarantees from a number of countries, including Russia. Talks eventually came to a halt after Ukraine’s negotiators insisted on sovereignty over the Crimean peninsula, which seceded from Kiev’s rule in 2014 and joined the Russian Federation following a public referendum. The ‘Kiev Security Treaty’ proposal has been in the works for months. Russia has previously insisted that the only promises of security for Ukraine can be provided by Moscow, but former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said in August that Kiev had given that chance up. “No one will accept Ukraine into NATO now.

The goal is “to destroy the economy, push our country to the backyard of the world politics. Recently, they’ve been calling to openly use sanctions to undermine stability in Russia,” he stated. Lavrov stressed that the ministry’s priority is to promote sustainable relations “with all interested foreign partners” based on mutual respect and cooperation. The Russian Foreign Ministry warned in August that the ongoing hybrid war raises the threat of a nuclear conflict, in which there can be no winners. However, according to Igor Vishnevetsky, the Foreign Ministry’s non-proliferation department deputy head, Russia remains “committed to… building a world free of nuclear weapons.” Since the start of the hostilities in Ukraine, Washington has been top of the list of countries providing Kiev with military equipment, including Javelin anti-tank weapons, Stinger portable anti-aircraft missiles, howitzer artillery, and long-range HIMARS rockets.

He was responding to a question about Moscow’s reaction to last week’s advances of Ukrainian forces in Kharkov Region. Moscow pulled back its troops from a number of settlements in the area for what the Russian Defense Ministry described as a “regrouping” necessary to continue the military operation against Kiev. Peskov said there was “no talk” of mobilization and downplayed some of the criticism that the military leadership and the ministry faced from various commentators over the retreat and Ukrainian gains. He assessed that the Russian public supported Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to attack Ukraine and was “very sensitive” to events there, meaning some people will take last week’s setback very emotionally. “Criticisms are a normal part of pluralism of opinions, as long as they stay within the legal boundaries,” he said. Western military experts have been expecting Russia to increase mobilization for months, after their early forecasts of a swift fall of the Ukrainian government failed to materialize. The previous peak of such predictions came in early May, when Russia celebrated the anniversary of its victory over Nazi Germany. Putin’s speech on May 9 included neither a formal declaration of war against Ukraine nor an announcement of mobilization, contrary to what foreign experts anticipated.

Russian high-precision attacks have targeted the deployment areas of units of the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade near the towns of Slavyansk and Konstantinovka in eastern Ukraine, the statement read.

According to the Defense Ministry, it also conducted strikes on several Ukrainian units both in the south of the country and in the north, closer to Kharkov. “As a result of the strikes, the losses among Ukrainian service members and foreign fighters exceeded 800 people killed and wounded,” the ministry stated. The attacks come after Ukrainian troops apparently advanced in Kharkov Region, with Russian and allied forces withdrawing from some areas to “regroup.” On Monday, commenting on the recent development in Ukraine, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov insisted that Russia will continue with its military operation “until the goals that were set in the beginning are achieved.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-09-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/562701-sco-agenda-expansion-uzbekistan/,World’s largest regional organization set to expand – member state,"The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is set to expand at its upcoming summit in the Uzbek city of Samarkand, the host nation’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has announced. The SCO is the largest regional bloc in the world, comprising eight members including Russia, China and India. In an article published on his official website on Monday, Mirziyoyev expressed confidence that the event scheduled for September 15-16 will “mark the birth of a new stage” in the organization’s history. “The number of [SCO] members will grow, and its future agenda will be formed, and this is highly symbolic,” the leader of the Central Asian nation wrote. There are currently eight full members of the group: India, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. Two countries – Iran and Belarus – are in the process of joining the SCO and have observer status, along with Afghanistan and Mongolia. Mirziyoyev believes the Samarkand gathering will be remembered for the launch of “a new, inclusive dialogue.” In a world suffering from a “deep crisis of trust” and geopolitical confrontation, the SCO should become “a pole of attraction without dividing lines, in the name of peace, cooperation and progress,” he stated. One of the key goals of the SCO is to expand its cooperation with Afghanistan which, Mirziyoyev believes, “should try on a new peaceful mission of connecting Central and South Asia.” The SCO encompasses 40% of the world’s population, and more than 30% of global GDP. In September 2021, the SCO launched technical procedures for Iran’s admission. The Russian President’s Special Envoy for SCO Affairs, Bakhtiyor Khakimov, said at the time that the accession process would take a considerable amount of time. Belarus was the latest country to apply for SCO membership. Its bid was announced by Khakimov in June this year. On Tuesday, Uzbekistan’s national SCO coordinator, Rakhmatulla Nurimbetov, revealed that six countries, including four Arab nations, will receive the status of dialogue partners during the summit. One of the leaders expected at the gathering is Chinese President Xi Jinping, making his first foreign trip in more than two years. Though Turkey is not a member of the SCO, the country’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also expected to arrive in Uzbekistan for talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The two leaders are set to discuss matters related to the Ukraine conflict and the UN-brokered “grain deal.”",3.015783422607761,2.953495523778943,0.06228789882881802,8

Schmidt, who has close links to US national security, praised Kiev for amongst other decisions, swiftly moving government information into better-protected cloud services. Russia’s attack in late February “gave everybody a political excuse to do the right thing,” he said on Monday, as cited by Agence France Press (AFP). The tech entrepreneur also praised fellow US billionaire Elon Musk for sending Starlink equipment to Kiev, ensuring that Ukrainian civilian and military officials have reliable access to the internet. The SpaceX CEO is “genuinely a hero here,” Schmidt said. Musk previously repeatedly claimed credit for successfully defeating alleged Russian cyberattacks aimed at disrupting Starlink access for Ukrainian users. The ground equipment necessary for getting internet through Starlink satellites was reportedly contracted by the Pentagon, though Musk implied that he’d donated it. Meanwhile the Ukrainian government offered citizens a way to use smartphone apps to report intelligence data, Schmidt said. The tips are being analyzed by AI-powered programs to help acquire targets for Ukrainian military strikes, he said. US officials previously claimed that the US intelligence service and their NATO counterparts played a large part in organizing a Ukrainian military offensive in northeastern Kharkov Region last week. Kiev reported retaking some 6,000 square kilometers of land from Russia. Moscow acknowledged pulling troops back for regrouping. In addition to serving as a top Google executive, Schmidt held top advisory positions in several bodies linked to the US national security apparatus. He served as the chair of the Defense Innovation Advisory Board and the chair of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. He visited Kiev last week and attended the Yalta European Strategy forum in Kiev, according to photos posted by several top Ukrainian officials, including Ukraine’s Digital Transformation Minister Mikhail Fedorov.

2022-09-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/562689-us-ukraine-russia-struggle/,Timofey Bordachev: Attempts by the US to force the global community to back its position on Ukraine have failed,"Been there, done that. This is not the Cold War, and Russia is not the Soviet Union. One of the signs of the changes taking place today is not the division of the world into opposing camps, but rather the adjustment to changing conditions resulting from a great power conflict. This could very probably be a signal that, in the future, we will not see the restoration of the bipolar international order which existed from 1945 to 1990. The stance taken by most of the world on the conflict between Russia and the West shows that humanity is now far more united and capable of adapting, even to major challenges that may not have been envisaged just a short time ago. It belies the notion that American centrality in world affairs continues to make any issue related to Washington the most important one in the world and capable of causing a global split. That doesn’t mean Russia should think that, by being on the right side of history, it will automatically secure the support of the majority of states. This is something that remains to be fought for. It would be reckless to assume that the refusal of the majority of the world’s nations, representing 85% of the global population, to join the West’s economic war against Russia means support for Moscow’s behavior. Six months after the start of the military operation in Ukraine, the dynamics of international attitudes towards the politico-military conflict and its participants show that most countries are keen to distance themselves. The exception here is China, whose policy is increasingly pro-Russian and, as its own problems with the US escalate, it continues to show the real depth of mutual trust between Moscow and Beijing. However, this relationship is derived from the development of the two countries over the past 20 years and the objective convergence of their approaches to major systemic problems – i.e. it’s not linked to the immediate crisis in Europe. It is, of course, too early to tell what the international order will look like in the future, after the West is forced to admit its historic defeat in the struggle to maintain global dominance. It will be shaped gradually as the leading powers, often in very dangerous ways, define the limits of their power capabilities and the limits of what is permissible. This process, given the irrationality of a major general war and the scale of longstanding problems, is likely to be much more protracted than previous episodes of radical change in the international order. We are now witnessing one of the first stages of a lasting global political realignment. We are, in fact, talking about the end of a period that has lasted several hundred years. But even at this stage, we can already see some signs of the behavior of powers that will be systemic factors in the development of international politics. It is therefore important that one sign of the changes taking place is not the division of the world into opposing camps, but instead – for the most part – adjustment to the changing conditions resulting from the conflict. This could very probably be a signal that we do not run the risk of restoring the bipolar system that characterized the international order of the Cold War period. And we can make an additional argument that the rules and norms of behavior of that time can only serve as a lesson for our foreign policy in the modern era. The flagship of such adaptation is of course India, one of the largest states in terms of population, which has very serious ambitions in terms of its role in the world. So far, it has not achieved the economic, military or human development that would make it a true great power. But at the same time, India is the leader of a majority that has no intention of letting itself be divided into opposing camps or of becoming a resource base for a rival like America, Russia or China. New Delhi has consistently maintained a business relationship with Moscow and has become one of Russia’s biggest foreign trade partners in recent months. Indian officials constantly stress that their worldview is not anti-Russian and the reticence in some areas regarding cooperation with Russia is related only to a well-founded fear of domestic business concerns being exposed to US reprisals. India is seen as a role model by most developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. We see in particular that, six months after the Russia-West crisis turned into a politico-military clash, the number of countries willing even verbally to support the US in its fight against Moscow has more than halved. Thus, last week, observers’ attention was drawn to an attempt to rally the support of UN countries around a new statement condemning Russia’s policy on the Ukraine issue. While more than 140 countries supported a similar resolution at the UN General Assembly in March, only 58 followed up this time. A total of 30 of those are formal members of the US-led NATO military bloc and several more are bound to Washington by bilateral defense treaties. Thus, more than two-thirds of the entire international community have avoided outlining their position on European affairs. This is, of course, partly a result of Russian and Chinese diplomacy, constantly pointing out that the real cause of the war in Europe is US policy. But this dynamic shows first and foremost that developing countries understand there are opportunities for them not to make such a choice. Instead, a strategy of distance from the conflict is more rational and justified in the current context. And, as affairs in Europe drag on and take on the features of a permanent conflict between Russia and the West, with varying degrees of tension, most of the world will increasingly adapt to life in these circumstances. For the US itself, the reduction of its capacity to impose its will has led to a strategy of intimidation and pressure on independent players in the international community. However, this policy won’t be successful either. Even though Washington has an enormous repressive machine at its disposal, turning all its international activities into the enforcement of “sanctions” would make it completely ineffective. That said, we certainly cannot rule out such a scenario. As a result, more and more countries will cooperate with both Russia and the West, and the pace of this cooperation will depend on the possibility of getting something from these two adversaries. In turn, the conflict in Europe will become increasingly localized and of direct interest only to the main participants. What the rest of the world is doing is trying not to participate. For Russia, this means it needs to remain open and able to offer developing countries what they require – in the areas of energy, goods, science or education. But there is absolutely no need to lure anyone into the struggle for Russian interests and values – exactly what most of the world wants to avoid. Thus, we can be relatively calm – the division of the world into opposing camps, which is an integral condition for the outbreak of a larger war, will be avoided.",2.8319654638519913,4.834596355992304,-2.002630892140313,6

The prime minister rejected Azerbaijan’s claims that it was Armenia, which initiated the violence, and blamed Baku for launching an attack in seven locations against his country. Azerbaijan earlier said that its military also suffered casualties as a result of the clashes, but didn’t reveal the exact figures. On Tuesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry called on the sides “to refrain from further escalation, exercise restraint and strictly observe the ceasefire,” which had been agreed between Yerevan and Baku through Moscow’s mediation in 2020. Back then, the neighboring countries fought a 44-day war over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, with Baku capturing some areas, which had been controlled by ethnic Armenian forces since the early 1990s.",5.66224561834282,3.356329315816484,2.305916302526336,4

Washington previously declined to send such weapons, for fear of escalating the conflict with Russia. The Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, can be fired by M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS multiple launch rocket systems, both of which Ukraine already has. But compared to regular rounds for the launchers, it has a significantly longer range of some 300km. The missiles are among the 29 types of weapon systems and munitions that Kiev is seeking to get from the US to fight Russia into the next year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The list, which was shared with US lawmakers and studied by the newspaper, also includes tanks, drones, artillery systems, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and 2,000 regular rockets for HIMARS/MLRS systems, according to the report. Ukrainian officials have long been asking the US to give them longer-range arms, including the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). The surface-to-surface missile complex was specifically named in a keynote military strategy paper published in the Ukrainian media last week, co-authored by the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian forces, Valeriy Zaluzhny. One of the key points of the article was that Ukraine needed longer-range weapons to affect Russian policy, by putting pressure on its civilian population. Most Russians, the Ukrainian strategists wrote, perceive military action in Ukraine as something distant, and “because of that Russian citizens don’t take the losses, defeats and most importantly costs of this war in all senses of the word as acute,” Zaluzhny and his co-author, former assault troops commander Mikhail Zabrodsky, argued. The article stated that the goal of the Ukrainian military next year was to “make those feelings more impactful, regardless of the distance to the targets.” Washington and Kiev previously said the US conditioned its military aid to Ukraine on its pledge not to use the weapons against Russian territory. Washington declined to provide longer-range weapon systems, citing concern that Moscow would take it as a major escalation, potentially drawing NATO directly into the conflict. The Ukrainian strategy paper suggested that an escalation of the conflict was inevitable. It predicted that Russia would deploy nuclear weapons against Ukraine and called on Kiev’s Western supporters to preemptively use “all means at their disposal” against Russia.",2.873177600231414,3.6486476103308454,-0.7754700100994314,7

Armenia has yet to file any official appeals, and it remains unclear what kind of help it seeks to request. Both Russia and Armenia are part of the CSTO, a mutual defense pact, analogous to the US-led NATO bloc, made up of six former Soviet republics also including Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Moscow and Yerevan also have a separate Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, which marked its 25th anniversary on August 29. Earlier, Pashinyan held separate phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron about the “provocative, aggressive actions of the Azerbaijani armed forces against the sovereign territory of Armenia.” The Armenian Defense Ministry said that, as of 4:00 am on Tuesday morning, the situation along the border remained “extremely tense,” with ongoing Azerbaijan artillery and mortar fire, as well as drone strikes allegedly targeting “both military and civilian” infrastructure in Armenia. Azerbaijan claims the shelling was provoked by Armenia, while the defense ministry in Baku accused Armenian “saboteurs” of mining roads and infrastructure on the Azeri side of the border over the weekend, causing an unspecified number of military casualties. Baku also denounced as “false” the reports of a “full-scale invasion” by Azerbaijan into Armenian territory, claiming it was only responding to the “Armenian provocations.” Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds ever since they declared independence from the Soviet Union, primarily over Nagorno Karabakh – which was inside Azerbaijan but had a majority ethnic Armenian population. Armenians prevailed in the early 1990s, establishing control over most of the enclave and territories connecting it to Armenia proper. In September 2020, Baku launched a campaign to reclaim the territory, with the help of Turkish-supplied drones.

Those who taught local children under the Russian curriculum will now face criminal charges in Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk told the Ukrainian media outlet Strana. “They have committed a crime against our nation,” Vereshuk said, adding that “a court will determine their … punishment.” The deputy prime minister accused the detained teachers of engaging in “illegal activities” without elaborating which specific crime they had committed. According to Strana, Vereshchuk said they could be charged with “violating the laws of war” – a charge typically used against those engaged in torture, killings of civilians and looting. She also “warned” that “Russian citizens” that have arrived in what she called “temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories” that they “would certainly face punishment unless they immediately leave our territory.” Detained teachers would not be eligible for prisoner swaps with Russia, Vereshchuk added, arguing that “they are not combatants” and are thus not covered by the Geneva conventions. Ukrainian teachers who agreed to use the Russian curriculum would be branded “collaborators” and face criminal charges, Vereshchuk warned. Such charges involve “serious prison sentences,” the deputy prime minister said as she called on people in the Russian-controlled territories to “by no means cooperate” with Moscow and “evacuate.” Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are hunting for remaining Russian soldiers and local “collaborators,” the pro-Kiev mayor of Izyum told the BBC.

The Armenian Defense Ministry said the army of Azerbaijan has used heavy artillery and drones. A Turkish-made Bayraktar drone was allegedly shot down over Vardenis, which is in northern Armenia and not adjacent to the disputed region of Nagorno Karabakh. Armenian troops are “giving an adequate response,” Yerevan said. The government of Azerbaijan said Armenia “began widespread provocations” against the Azeri armed forces, which responded with “intensive fire” on Armenian positions. The defense ministry in Baku accused Armenian “teams of saboteurs” of mining roads and firing mortars into Azerbaijani army positions near the towns of Basarkecher, Istisu, Garakilsa and Gorus, on the Azeri side of the border, causing “losses among personnel and damage to military infrastructure.” Azerbaijan also stated that there were losses among the personnel and military equipment of the Armenian armed forces. Tuesday morning’s clashes are a major escalation of tensions between the two Caucasus countries. Azerbaijan attacked Nagorno-Karabakh in early August after accusing Armenia of violating the 2020 ceasefire and demanding the full “demilitarization” of the area inhabited by ethnic Armenians – and prompting condemnation from Russia, which is a guarantor of the truce. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan. Yet, the region has a mostly Armenian population and sought independence from Baku in the 1990s. It has been de-facto self-governed and has enjoyed support from Armenia since then.

2022-09-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/562658-iaea-zaporozhye-nuclear-ceasefire/,Ukraine and Russia interested in nuclear plant ceasefire – UN,"Russia and Ukraine are interested in the International Atomic Energy Agency's plan to create a “protection zone” around the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi claimed on Monday. While there has been no agreement yet, Grossi said both sides are “engaging” and have questions about the proposal. Speaking with reporters, the IAEA chief outlined that the proposed “nuclear safety and security protection zone” would “include” a ceasefire and “may include other things,” according to Reuters. “Basically it's a commitment that no military action will include or will imply aiming, of course, at the plant, or a radius that could be affecting its normal operation. This is what we expect,” he explained. “Diplomatic caution and professionalism requires prudence, but what I see is two sides that are engaging with us, that are asking questions, lots of questions.” Grossi led a team of IAEA inspectors to the Zaporozhye NPP and nearby Energodar at the start of September. They observed the damage from artillery attacks on the Russian-controlled facility but declined to attribute blame. Moscow has registered almost 30 attacks on the facility since July, including at least two attempts by Ukrainian troops to storm the power plant – even as IAEA inspectors were visiting. Kiev has accused Russia of staging the shelling to discredit Ukraine, even though its military eventually admitted to targeting the area. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that there was “no discussion about the withdrawal of troops” from the Zaporozhye NPP. “The discussion is about forcing the Ukrainian side to stop the barbaric shelling of the facilities on the territory of the plant, which could lead to sad and catastrophic consequences,” Peskov said during a press briefing. The Zaporozhye NPP, Europe’s largest, consists of six reactor blocks. The last of them was shut down on Sunday, with the local military-civilian administration citing the risks of continued Ukrainian shelling. According to Grossi, that is still not enough to avoid a nuclear meltdown, as the reactors require external power supply to operate safely. Two IAEA officials are currently stationed at the Zaporozhye plant, as part of the agency’s “continuous presence” on the site.",3.0213951197765008,4.990040903907222,-1.9686457841307217,9

He was responding to a question about the affect internal American politics could have on his country, during an interview aired on Sunday, but recorded in Kiev at some point over the past week. “I’m grateful to President [Joe] Biden and the White House and the bipartisan support,” Zelensky told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria. ""Without this support, we will not be able to return our lands.” “I want to believe that bipartisan support will remain strong and steadfast. For us, that’s extremely important,” Zelensky added, addressing Zakaria’s claim that a Republican victory in the November midterms would result in the US “supporting Ukraine less.” If the West stops sending weapons and money to Kiev, “Russia could win this fight,” Zelensky opined. He added that he would be willing to make arguments in defense of the aid to US taxpayers, who need to know their money is being used to defend Western “values.” The US has funneled more than $30 billion in military aid to Ukraine, of which $17 billion came between the 2014 coup and the escalation of hostilities in February. The most recent batch of ammunition and weapons, announced last week, was valued at $675 million. In addition to weapons, ammunition and cash to fill Ukraine’s budget, the US and the UK intelligence agencies are “working with the Ukrainians,” including the planning for last week’s offensive in Kharkov Region, according to Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. “This kind of collaboration shows the strength of our combined military intel,” Warner, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Sunday. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

2022-09-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/562652-ukraine-us-intel-znpp/,US involved in Ukrainian strikes on nuclear plant – Moscow,"Washington has been supplying Kiev with crucial intelligence to designate targets for shelling around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the head of Russia’s Security Council Nikolay Patrushev has claimed. Speaking at a security meeting on Monday, Patrushev said there was a “serious threat” to radiation safety posed by Kiev’s shelling. He insisted that attacks near the plant are carried out using NATO-supplied weapons while Washington is providing Ukraine’s forces with the targets. The security official noted that the continued firing around the ZNPP could lead to an unprecedented nuclear disaster. “The consequences of these provocations could be very catastrophic not only for the majority of the population of Ukraine and Russia but also for Europe, and in terms of their scale they could surpass the tragedies that occurred at the nuclear power plants in Chernobyl and Fukushima,” Patrushev warned. According to a Sunday report from Russia’s Defense Ministry, Kiev’s forces have carried out a total of 26 separate attacks on the nuclear power plant, as well as the nearby city of Energodar, since September 1. Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov reported that the city and nearby areas have lost electricity as a result of the attacks. On Sunday, the last working power unit at the ZNPP was switched off and the plant has stopped producing electricity. The decision to shut the station down was made due to continued shelling of the plant and subsequent damage to the power lines, local officials said. According to Vladimir Rogov, a member of the pro-Russian Zaporozhye Region administration, the constantly changing mode in which the reactors and turbines were forced to operate because of the attacks created the risk of a nuclear accident. The largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the ZNPP has been controlled by Russian forces since March, but continued to be operated by Ukrainian staff. The facility has sustained multiple missile and artillery strikes in recent weeks. Moscow blames Ukrainian forces for the attacks. Kiev, however, has shrugged off the accusations and claims that Russia has turned the plant into a military base and that it is shelling the facility itself in order to paint the Ukrainian government in a bad light. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose inspectors visited the plant in early September, has demanded that all attacks on the plant “be stopped immediately,” but refrained from identifying the party responsible for them.",4.762680479162912,5.373934370178981,-0.6112538910160694,9

Russia is again urging “countries, which have influence on the Ukrainian side,” to use that influence “to make this shelling that continues on a daily basis, stop,” he said. The Zaporozhye nuclear facility, which is the largest in Europe, has been under Russian control since March, but is still operated by Ukrainian staff. The facility and the nearby town of Energodar have come under repeated missile and artillery strikes in recent weeks, which Moscow has blamed on Kiev. It also said that the Russian forces have repelled several attempts to retake the plant by Ukrainian saboteurs. Moscow has warned that the continued shelling of the nuclear site could cause a disaster that would eclipse the 1986 Chernobyl incident and affect many countries in Europe. Ukraine claims that Russia has turned the plant into a military base and that it’s striking it itself in order to pin the blame on Kiev. The Russian authorities have denied those accusations. After repeated calls by Moscow, a team of IAEA inspectors visited the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in early September. The UN nuclear watchdog has demanded that all attacks on the plant “be stopped immediately,” but refrained from identifying the party responsible for the shelling. On Sunday, the last working reactor out of six at the facility was shut down for security reasons. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye Region administration, said the plant could be restarted after the contact line between the Russian and Ukrainian forces is moved further away from it and the power liner that had been damaged by strikers are repaired.",4.404315741050948,5.859395258066182,-1.4550795170152337,9

The comment comes on the day when the bloc fully suspended its visa facilitation agreement with Russia. Talking to journalists, Grushko said “there is no rush” in taking retaliatory measures to what he described as “yet another [example of] stupidity” from the EU. The senior diplomat accused Brussels of attempting to divide Russian society into the “right and wrong” people, and of “undermining the principles of international cooperation.” “What kind of response can there be to stupidity? Let’s see how this will affect contacts between people. We have never been supporters of restrictions on contacts,” the deputy minister said. On Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said that Moscow considers it inappropriate to introduce retaliatory visa restrictions for citizens of EU countries. This echoed the remarks of the country’s President Vladimir Putin, who said earlier that tit-for-tat measures would be against Russia’s interests. Starting September 12, Russian citizens will have to pay visa application fees of €80 instead of the previous €35, and will have to provide significantly more documentation, endure longer processing times and be subject to much stricter rules for the issuance of multiple-entry visas.",4.849828978254487,2.6361732669258666,2.21365571132862,8

According to the ministry, the attack eliminated a depot storing 45,000 tons of ammunition near the town of Voznesensk in Nikolaev region. The statement also claimed Kiev’s losses as “more than 300 Ukrainian service members killed and up to 1,000 wounded” in the last 24 hours in this area. The Defense Ministry stated that its forces had also targeted Kiev’s military in the Kharkov region, where Moscow’s troops recently retreated from a number of settlements to regroup, amid a Ukrainian offensive. According to the statement, Russia conducted a strike on the nationalist unit Kraken, the 113rd Brigade of Territorial Defense and the 93rd Mechanized Brigade, killing up to 250 service members and eliminating more than 20 military vehicles. Russia has been repeatedly targeting Ukrainian ammunition depots since launching its military offensive on February 24, in an effort to destroy Western-supplied weapons and ammunition, as well as to reduce Kiev’s overall military capabilities. The new attacks come on the heels of an apparent advance of Ukrainian troops in the Kharkov region, with the nation’s president Vladimir Zelensky touting on Saturday the “liberation” of “2,000 [square] kilometers of our territory.” At the same time, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed Kiev’s five-day offensive both in the east and in the south of the country has cost it more than 12,000 casualties.

An estimated 50 million worldwide were trapped in slavery in 2021, including 28 million in forced labour and 22 million in marriages they had been forced into, the research published on Monday found. The paper, called ‘Global Estimates of Modern Slavery report’, was prepared by the United Nations’ International Labour Organization, the International Organization for Migration, and the Walk Free international human rights group. “The number of people in modern slavery has risen significantly in the last five years. 10 million more people were in modern slavery in 2021 compared to 2016 global estimates,” the study said. The study cited “compounding crises” as a reason for the dramatic increase. These included the Covid-19 pandemic, armed conflicts, and climate change. The crises “led to unprecedented disruption to employment and education, increases in extreme poverty and forced and unsafe migration, and an upsurge in reports of gender-based violence.” Women and girls make up 11.8 million and over 14.9 million of the total in forced labor and forced marriages, respectively, according to the authors’ estimates. More than 3.3 million of all those in forced labor are children, the study states. More than half of all forced labor takes place in either upper-middle income or high-income countries, and migrant workers are more than three times more vulnerable to forced labor than other workers, according to the paper. Stating that the problem “affects all regions,” the study noted that Asia and the Pacific region had the highest number of people in forced labor. The prevalence of both forced labor and forced marriage is highest in Arab states.",5.263648260088,3.2498430458210117,2.013805214266988,4
2022-09-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/562630-kherson-staged-assassination-ukraine/,‘Assassinated’ pro-Russian official rises from the 'dead',"Vitaly Gura, deputy head of the town of Novaya Kakhovka in Ukraine’s Kherson Region, has revealed that his death was staged by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) in order to save him from an assassination attempt by Kiev. Reports of the pro-Russian official’s murder emerged on August 6, with local authorities saying he was shot by Ukrainian forces near his home in Novaya Kakhovka, and died on his way to hospital. It appeared to be the latest in a series of attacks on officials and security chiefs in Russian-controlled towns and villages of Ukraine in recent months, which Moscow has blamed on Kiev. But on Monday, Gura, who was considered dead for more than a month, gave an interview to Russia’s Channel One, saying the FSB covert operation kept him alive. “In early August, law enforcement agencies approached me and said that an assassination attempt on me was being prepared. They provided recordings proving it,” he said. Gura, who is currently in hiding, under the protection of the FSB, insists he will return to his job in Novaya Kakhovka. “I want to tell everybody that I’ll be back. I’ll keep working. I’m not afraid,” he said. In early July, a similar staged assassination was used to get Novaya Kakhovka’s deputy police chief Sergey Tomka out of harm’s way, according to Channel One. The broadcaster claimed in its report that the operation started in mid-June with a grenade blast at a cafe frequented by members of the town’s administration. The perpetrator of the attack – which did not result in any casualties – was detained and agreed to cooperate with Russian counterintelligence. The would-be killer had apparently been communicating with Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU), via an officer identified as Ilya Bondarchuk, who offered money for killing Novaya Kakhovka officials. The targeted individuals were then put under FSB supervision. The news of what appeared to be two successful assassinations prompted Bondarchuk to provide his supposed agent with data on a cell of saboteurs preparing attacks in Crimea. All members of that cell were later detained, while Bondarchuk, who recruited assassins remotely, continues to operate in Ukrainian-controlled territory, Channel One said. “The SBU leadership decided to take the easy route. They use persons from among the nationalist youths, from the marginal circles. This places Ukraine in the same category as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS), which sees terrorist attacks as the only means of achieving its goals,” an unnamed FSB officer told the broadcaster.",3.729258592158858,3.6634676979037195,0.06579089425513862,0
2022-09-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/562629-peskov-comments-ukraine-retreat/,Kremlin says Putin fully briefed on Ukraine 'regrouping',"Russian President Vladimir Putin is receiving round-the-clock updates on the situation with Moscow’s military action in Ukraine, his press-secretary Dmitry Peskov said, after being questioned on Russian troops’ withdrawal from some areas to “regroup.” “Certainly, everything happening and all actions of the military during the special operation [in Ukraine] are being reported to the commander-in-chief,” the spokesman told the media on Monday. Putin can be in touch with Defense Minister Segey Shoigu and Russian military commanders “at any time of the day” as he is supposed to, Peskov added. Russian journalists were questioning Peskov over Putin’s awareness and communication schedule after Ukrainian forces conducted a successful offensive last week. Kiev’s troops managed to push Russian forces in northern Ukraine out of a number of settlements in the Kharkov region. The Russian Ministry of Defense made few remarks about the development, acknowledging only a retreat, which it described as necessary to “regroup” the troops. US Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia), who chairs the chamber’s Intelligence Committee, confirmed in an interview with CNN that the offensive had been prepared with the help of the US and British intelligence services. The assistance “kept the Russians, and Putin in particular, on their backheel,” he claimed. Commenting on what the setback meant for the outcome of the Russian military operation, Peskov reiterated that Moscow will continue it “until the goals that were set in the beginning are achieved.” The official was responding to questions about a social media post made by former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, now the deputy chair of the Russian national security council, who appeared to suggest that Moscow may up the ante in Ukraine. Responding to the refusal of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to talk to Russia due to its “ultimatums,” Medvedev said on Monday his country’s demands were just “a warm-up” compared to the “demands of the future.” He added that Moscow may seek “a total capitulation of the Kiev regime, on Russia’s conditions.”",3.5683424684406755,2.4792017023611304,1.0891407660795451,2

They have started repressive actions,” Vitaly Ganchev, the head of pro-Russian administration, said. Speaking to Russian media, he said local residents who managed to escape from the areas retaken by Kiev’s forces, described Ukrainian “mercenaries that are driving around and shooting people while filming it on camera.” “As I see it, they want to cleanse these towns, and to portray it as if the Russian troops are behind it, to allege that it was them who had committed these atrocities,” he said. He added that in many cases residents could no longer cross the Russia-Ukraine border due to the Ukrainian military presence, with many civilians forced into hiding. Nevertheless, according to Ganchev, more than 5,000 people have been evacuated to Russia in recent days, with local authorities doing their best to fast-track the process. Ganchev’s comments echo remarks made by Leonid Pasechnik, the head of the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), who claimed on Sunday that Kiev’s forces were cracking down on the civilian population in areas from which Russian forces had retreated. ""The Ukrainian authorities have confirmed their neo-Nazi nature. In Kharkov region, in a number of cases Ukrainian intelligence services set up purges and repressions against the civilian population"", he claimed. The comments came after Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigations said last week it would conduct a “filtration” of civilians in Balakleya, a town in Kharkov region that’s been retaken by Kiev’s forces. The purpose of these efforts is to “prevent the subversive activities of the Russians and their allies” and retaliate against those “who cooperated with aggressors,” the agency said at the time.

Zeman noted that there are other countries that would be better placed to direct peace negotiations between Moscow and Kiev. “Countries like China, Israel, Turkey could all be considered. They have a balanced position and will not be taken as biased by any party,” he explained. Since Russia launched its military campaign against Ukraine in late February, the Czech Republic has been a fervent supporter of the government in Kiev and has backed all the EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. It’s also been one of the top military donors to the Ukrainian army. However, Prague’s stance has contributed to soaring energy prices and inflation back home. This led tens of thousands to attend anti-government demonstrations earlier this month, demanding that Czech authorities take a neutral stance in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and secure direct contracts with natural gas suppliers, including Russia. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala dismissed the protesters' demands, implying that the demonstrations were being stoked by the Kremlin. “The protest on Wenceslas Square was called by forces that are pro-Russian, are close to extreme positions and are against the interests of the Czech Republic,” said Fiala, adding that “It is clear that Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns are present on our territory and some people simply listen to them.” Meanwhile, Russia has insisted that it remains open to negotiations with Ukraine and has urged Kiev to come to the table sooner rather than later, noting that the longer the conflict drags on the harder it would be for the two sides to come to terms. Kiev, on the other hand, has stated that it will only resume peace talks after it gains a “more favorable” negotiating position by recapturing territories.",2.739580564369967,3.2439548263293565,-0.5043742619593896,8
2022-09-12,https://www.rt.com/news/562615-germany-red-line-ukraine/,Germany has ‘crossed red line’ – Russia,"Germany has crossed a red line with Russia by sending arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador in Berlin said on Monday. The decision undermined decades of reconciliation since the end of World War II and the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the diplomat added. “The very fact that the Ukrainian regime is being supplied with German-made lethal weapons, which are used not only against Russian military service members, but also the civilian population of Donbass, crosses the red line,” Ambassador Sergey Nechaev said in an interview with Izvestia newspaper. He added that Berlin should have known better, “considering the moral and historic responsibility that Germany has before our people for the Nazi crimes.” “They have crossed the Rubicon,” Nechaev stated, using an idiom for passing the point of no return. Berlin discarded its longstanding policy of not sending weapons into zones of armed conflict to join the US and other NATO allies in providing weapons to Ukraine. The German government says it has a moral responsibility to back Kiev so it can defend itself against Russia. Germany also joined an effort by the EU to decouple the economies of member states from Russia’s. German businesses have been relying on cheap Russian natural gas for five decades, since before the Soviet Union collapsed. The German government “has unilaterally acted to destroy bilateral relations [with Russia] that were unique in scale and depth and had been built over decades,” the Russian ambassador noted. “In essence, the post-war reconciliation of our nations and peoples is being eroded,” Nechaev said. According to the diplomat, economic restrictions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine conflict have resulted in a sharp increase in utility bills, a surge in consumer prices, and a decrease in real incomes in Germany. Nechaev said the “sanctions war” against Moscow is being increasingly seen as “shooting yourself in the foot” in Germany, which has already faced protests over the cost-of-living crisis. The ambassador noted that Russia took no pleasure in seeing the damage, even if Berlin has itself to blame for it. “We believe the ongoing processes to be Germany’s domestic issue, in which we do not get involved,” he said. “And we certainly are not in the habit of delivering pompous lectures, the likes of which the West constantly makes about Russians.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

The Russian side also informed Macron of the steps Moscow is taking to protect the facility, while also urging the West to convince Kiev to immediately stop its attacks on the plant. A separate readout of the call from the Elysee Palace largely pinned the blame for the situation in Zaporozhye on Russia, adding that the “occupation” by Russian troops is putting the facility at risk. “[Macron] asked that Russian forces withdraw their heavy and light weapons from the [Zaporozhye plant] and that the [International Atomic Energy Agency’s] recommendations be followed to ensure safety at the site,” the statement read. Earlier, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu claimed that Moscow does not station heavy weaponry at or near the facility. At the same time, according to the Kremlin, both sides said they were ready to engage in a “non-politicized interaction” to address safety concerns at the facility with the participation of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which inspected the plant earlier this month. On Sunday, the last working power unit at the Zaporozhye facility, which has been under Russian control since March, was switched off.

The constantly changing mode in which the reactors and turbines were forced to operate because of the attacks created the risk of an accident, he said. On Friday, in the wake of the IAEA inspection of the plant, Rafael Grossi, the watchdog’s director, insisted that all attacks on the facility must cease, warning of a looming “nuclear accident.” To stop this from happening, he urged Moscow and Kiev to establish a kind of “sanctuary” at the plant by reaching a “simple protection agreement” that would see the two sides “agree in principle that the plant should not be attacked.”",4.949655937769857,2.9401350271896805,2.009520910580177,9

Kadyrov pledged to discuss the situation with top officials in Moscow should there be no changes to the strategic direction of the ongoing conflict. Over the past few days, the Russian military withdrew from multiple locations across the region in the wake of a massive offensive launched by Kiev. Its leadership has made some “mistakes,” Kadyrov said, expressing hope that “they will draw the necessary conclusions.” “The Ministry of Defense clarified the situation, because of which they left the towns of Izyum, Kupyansk, Balakleya in the Kharkov area. It was a forced measure due to military strategy in order to [avoid] loss of life,” Kadyrov said in a voice message, posted overnight to his Telegram channel. The Chechen leader then promised to “get all these towns back,” cryptically adding that “our people, guys specifically trained for such a job, are already there.” He added that “in the nearest future, we will reach [southwestern port city] Odessa and you will see concrete results.” At the same time, he called for changes to be made to Russian “strategy” in the ongoing operation. “If today or tomorrow no changes in strategy are made, I will be forced to speak with the leadership of the defense ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground to them. It’s a very interesting situation. It’s astounding, I would say,” Kadyrov stated. The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kharkov Region has been hailed by the Ukrainian leadership as a major success for the country. “To date, as part of active operations since the beginning of September, about 2,000 [square] kilometers of our territory have already been liberated,” President Zelensky said in a video address late on Saturday.

President Vladimir Zelensky has said the cause was missile attacks by Moscow on “critical infrastructure.” Full blackouts have hit Kharkov and Donetsk regions, Zelensky said in a social media post, apparently referring to the Ukrainian-controlled part of Donetsk People’s Republic. Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk, Poltava, Zaporozhye and Odessa regions have been hit by partial blackouts, according to the president, who blamed the incident on “Russian terrorists.” So, far Moscow has remained silent on the matter, neither confirming nor denying its involvement. Still, the incident has been preceded by a reported launch of multiple cruise missiles from Russian ships positioned in the Black and Caspian Seas. Footage circulating online shows the aftermath of the purported attacks, with firefighters trying to extinguish flames at what appear to be power plants. Another video, purportedly shot in Poltava, shows a trolleybus that caught fire, apparently due to a power surge in the grid. The blackout has affected the operations of Ukrainian railways, which reported delays across the country. It also brought the subway system in the eastern city of Kharkov to a halt the, footage circulating online purports to show. So, far, emergency services have managed to restore power supply only in Poltava, Sumy and Dnepropetrovsk regions, according to Ukrainian media reports.",4.817589100245599,3.3105566087372793,1.50703249150832,0

More than 4,000 Ukrainian troops were killed and another 8,000 injured between September 6 and 10 in the south and east of the country, ministry spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said during a daily briefing on Sunday. According to the official, Russian forces conducted “precision strikes” with missiles and artillery targeting pro-Kiev units in Kharkov region, from where Russian troops retreated earlier as part of what Moscow described as “redeployment.” Russia said its military has destroyed, among other things, numerous command posts and shot down a helicopter over the past few days. The Defense Ministry also accused Ukrainian troops of having shelled the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant 26 times since September 1. The Russia-controlled facility located in Ukraine’s southern Zaporozhye region was seized by Russian forces in early March, soon after Moscow launched its military operation. On Sunday, the last working reactor at the plant was switched off. According to a member of the region’s pro-Russian administration, the decision was made due to continued shelling of the plant by Ukraine and damage to the power lines. The constantly changing modes in which the reactors and turbines were forced to operate, because of the attacks, created the risk of an accident, Vladimir Rogov told RIA-Novosti. Kiev and Moscow have been accusing each other of targeting the power plant and risking a nuclear disaster for months now. In its Sunday briefing, the Russian Defense Ministry also alleged that the Ukrainian military was deliberately striking “energy infrastructure on liberated territories,” including in the Donetsk People’s Republic.",3.847914531111099,3.067922957235324,0.7799915738757748,9

An average Russian drank 15.7 liters of booze annually 13 years ago but, last year, this marker stood at only nine liters, Murashko said. This means that “alcohol consumption has dropped by almost 43% between 2008 and 2021,” he explained. The number of alcohol-related diseases and deaths has also gone down in Russia during the 13-year period, the minister added. He noted that drinking was the reason for various health complications, saying that “every second death from cardiomyopathy and myocarditis is associated with harmful alcohol consumption.” Liquor causes “pronounced changes to the human system that lead to dystrophic and sclerotic changes in muscles and internal organs, especially the liver and brain,” Murashko said. According to data from early 2022, the global average annual consumption of alcohol stood at 6.18 liters per person. The nation that drinks the most alcohol was the Seychelles, with an average resident there drinking almost 21 liters of booze every year. It was followed by the Czech Republic, where the consumption reached 14.45 liters per person.

The sixth reactor “was stopped at 3:45am. Now it doesn’t generate electricity,” Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye Region administration, told RIA-Novosti. The decision to shut down was made due to continued shelling of the plant by Ukraine and damage to the power lines, he said. The constantly changing mode in which the reactors and turbines were forced to operate, because of the attacks, created the risk of an accident, the official explained. According to Rogov, the unit had already been operating at minimum capacity for several days. Ukrainian state-owned company Energoatom has also confirmed the so-called ‘cold shutdown’ of the last unit, with the Zaporozhye facility coming to a complete halt. The largest nuclear power plant in Europe has been controlled by Russian forces since March, but is still operated by Ukrainian staff. Despite the shutdown of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, energy supply to the nearby town of Energodar is continuing as usual, the local authorities assured. The nuclear facility and Energodar have repeatedly sustained missile and artillery strikes in recent weeks, which Russia has blamed on Kiev’s forces. It also reported several failed attempts to retake the power plant by Ukrainian saboteurs. Moscow has warned that the continued attacks could cause a nuclear disaster that would eclipse the 1986 Chernobyl incident and affect many countries in Europe. Ukraine claims that Russia has turned the plant into a military base and that it is shelling the facility itself in order to pin the blame on Kiev.

Moscow will send cereals, foodstuffs, oil derivatives, and other much-needed supplies, as requested by Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati in May. Discussions on resuming direct flights between the two countries were also progressing, Nassar said, though Western sanctions on Russian carriers and attendant restrictions on surrounding airspace mean any potential routes must meet strict requirements. The aid package is separate from another package that Russian ambassador Alexander Rudakov said had been approved by Moscow to deliver to Lebanon. That proposal would supply 40,000 tons of wheat on a monthly basis through the end of 2022, but it has only received “preliminary approval” from Lebanon. US ambassador Dorothy Shea last month sought to one-up Russia and other countries like China and Iran that have offered to help Beirut with its multilayered economic crisis, instead offering a $29.5-million donation from USAID. While Lebanon previously imported about two thirds of its wheat from Ukraine, the war has seen a sizable portion of that country’s grain exports rerouted to Europe as barter for foreign aid dollars Kiev can never hope to repay. Even before the conflict escalated in February, over 2.2 million Lebanese were facing hunger, by some estimates. PM Mikati urged the UN to provide food aid in March, pointing to a constellation of crises, including an economic collapse that reduced the Lebanese currency to a tenth of its pre-2019 value, the explosion of Beirut’s main grain storage facility in 2020, and the presence of millions of Syrian and Palestinian refugees. Even if importers are able to find substitutes for the Ukrainian grain no longer bound for Beirut, many Lebanese won’t be able to afford them, trade syndicate president Hani Bohsali told UPI in March. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund to unlock a promised $3 billion in aid remain “ongoing,” according to Nassar, who said he expected the replacement of Mikati's caretaker government with permanent leadership would bring “confidence” to the talks. The IMF is reportedly frustrated with Hezbollah and other political factions holding out hope that offshore oil and gas fields could be the country’s financial salvation and is calling instead for the imposition of a standard debt repayment plan, fueled by the usual slate of austerity measures.",4.474627153869361,3.547033776697487,0.9275933771718736,7

2022-09-10,https://www.rt.com/russia/562521-mirotvorets-list-ukrainian-extremists/,Western media continues to ignore Ukraine's public 'kill list' aimed at those who question the Kiev regime,"This week, a number of international and Russian journalists convened in Moscow – with more joining by video link – to discuss the now-infamous Ukrainian Mirotvorets ""kill list."" Many of them are included themselves. While some don't take it seriously, the horrific car-bombing murder of Darya Dugina on August 20 and the subsequent marking on her Mirotvorets entry as “liquidated” makes it fairly clear the people behind the list do, in fact, want people dead. The same thing happened to the entry of Russian photojournalist Andrei Stenin and many others listed and subsequently killed, including the Italian Andrea Rocchelli. ""September 8 is observed as International Day of Journalists' Solidarity. On this day, the world commemorates members of the press who died in the line of duty...""*Oles Buzina was on Ukraine's kill list...https://t.co/OCIyC0UEWTpic.twitter.com/rXQvxdKep4 What it feels like to be on the list The head of the Foundation to Battle Injustice, Mira Terada, who convened the panel, noted that of the thousands of names entered on the site, 341 are journalists and, shockingly, 327 are minors. “Publishing personal data on minors is a crime. It’s like a menu for pedophiles or people doing human trafficking.” While her concern is for the children, journalists, activists, political figures and even ordinary Ukrainians who have somehow angered the Kiev regime and those behind the list, Terada now needs to exercise some caution after she herself was added to the database. An hour and a half after a July 21 press conference about children being placed on Mirotvorets, Mira found herself listed. “This changed my life. I have to be vigilant 24/7,” she said. Christelle Néant, a French war correspondent reporting from Donbass for the past six and a half years, mentioned to me before the panel began that some of the information on the site is not disclosed to the general public, and is password-locked. Néant, who said she’s been receiving death threats for years, spoke of how it impacts her: “Every time I use my car, I check underneath it for any unpleasant surprise,” referring to a potential car bomb. “I don't publish any photos with people I live with or love. I have to be vigilant at all times.” “I'm not a terrorist, not a criminal, I’m just a correspondent. This list must be closed and all of those involved must be held accountable.” German journalist Thomas Röper rightly noted that Western media outlets prefer to look the other way. “They could have reported on this, but they’re saying nothing.” He also pointed out the silence of the German government, even when asked at press conferences. “A state has a duty to protect its citizens, but I haven’t seen anything from my government to condemn the fact that Germans are on this list and one German national has been killed.” And, in fact, rather than protect German journalists, the government is persecuting them, as is the case with Alina Lipp, whose bank account, and that of her mother, was closed after the German government launched a criminal case against her for her reporting from Donbass. Russian journalist Veronika Naydenova, originally from Crimea but living in Germany, was added to the list in January, also after raising the inclusion of children, including 13-year-old Faina Savenkova, from the Lugansk People’s Republic. “The same day my article was published, I was added to the list. But this hasn’t stopped me, I’ve written many articles since.” She highlighted an additional, very real, threat: that of the refugees who’ve come to Germany from Ukraine, it isn’t possible to know who is merely a refugee and who holds Ukrainian nationalist extremist views. This is a very real fear for Naydenova, whose address is listed on Mirotvorets. Dutch journalist Sonya van den Ende likewise fears returning home. “I'm labeled an ‘enemy of the state’ now in the Netherlands. I cannot go back, it’s very dangerous for me to do so.” Janus Putkonen, a Finnish journalist who has been living in Donbass since 2015, pointed out how the risk extends globally. “Because the Mirotvorets kill list has not been stopped, people around the world are now in danger of falling victim to the state terrorism of Ukrainian Nazism, comparable to ISIS terrorism.” But, most of all, it threatens Ukrainians within Ukraine, something British journalist Johnny Miller emphasized. “If you're a journalist, blogger, political figure, or a citizen in Ukraine who wants to criticize extremism in Ukraine, which there is a lot of, or if you want to criticize Ukrainian government policies, most likely you're going to be put on that list. And be under serious threat of death.” Miller, who has reported from areas of western Ukraine, raised another important point: “There are so many people in Ukraine who want to push for peaceful negotiations with Russia. But if anybody in Ukrainian society wants to stand up and push this line, they’re most likely going to be put on that list. Mirotvorets is very much a symbol of the extremist elements in Ukraine at the moment.” For myself, I’ve been on the list since 2019, after going to Crimea and reporting from areas of the DPR where civilians were being terrorized by Ukrainian shelling, houses destroyed “street by street” as a local told me. Complicit media For various reasons, I haven’t been in my native Canada since February 2020, and at this point, don’t know what fate I would face were I to go back. Ottawa unconditionally supports the Kiev regime, including its war against the civilians of Donbass, which the country has abetted by sending money and weapons to Ukraine for years before Russia’s military operation began in February. Canada has spent nearly a billion dollars to train Ukrainian forces since 2014, including Neo-Nazi Azov fighters. ""...all Canadian Liberal governments have supported the Ukrainian Banderites since the beginning of WW2...Worse still, the current Canadian government is composed of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, flanked by a Banderite deputy, Chrystia Freeland.""https://t.co/m7ZMZ3ulMt But in addition to that, the Canadian government knows about Mirotvorets. The state-run Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in July ran a smear piece on me, using information apparently gleaned from my Mirotvorets entry, though it doesn’t mention the kill list by name. Some interesting things about this video.1. CBC almost certainly became aware of Grigoriev's Ukrainian war crimes tribunal after honest journalists of Maverick media contacted CBC about the kill list[see Maverick's interview w me: https://t.co/6OWigJMVIv ] How do I think I know CBC was aware of the kill list entry on me? Their producer emailed me for an interview (which I did not concede to), mentioning my April participation in a Moscow-based panel on Ukraine’s war crimes. Except it wasn’t April, it was on March 11. The only other source for my participation being in April was, you guessed it, Mirotvorets. Of course, there was no condemnation or call to shut down Mirotvorets (which independent Canadian media outlets previously interviewed me about and subsequently contacted the CBC about). Instead, they tried to spin my multiple reports on Ukraine’s war crimes in Donbass as a way to smear me as a Russian propagandist. And now, the CBC has flagged my name to Ukrainian Nationalists in Canada who might otherwise not have known of me, and to Canadians who went to fight in Ukraine, became radicalized and indoctrinated, and could commit Azov-style crimes against journalists like me who have been reporting from the other side. Journalists already have enough reasons to fear being targeted – one example is the August 4 bombing by Kiev’s forces of a Donetsk hotel that multiple journalists, including myself, were in. There is no conclusive proof that the hotel and the journalists were the intended targets, but given everything mentioned above, it’s certainly within the realm of possibility A terrorist database After the panel, I chatted again with Néant, who said she’d been appealing to international organizations about Mirotvorets for years. “I've written to organizations like the OSCE, Amnesty, etc. None reacted, even when I discovered that children are on this list.” All she got was an automated confirmation of receipt. During a Q&A after the panel, an American man in the audience suggested that Russia should have its own “hit force” going out and doing the same thing to the Ukrainian side. In reply, Johnny Miller noted: “When I tell people here in the UK about this kill list, one of the first things that people reply to me is, ‘Well, I’m sure Russia has a similar list.’ And I have to explain to them that, no, Russia does not have a list published on the internet with the names and home addresses of journalists and children and promote their killing. That’s the distinction between a civilized government and extremism and barbarism.” According to Mira Terada, her foundation transferred documents and the evidence it collected to Russia’s Federal Security Service and is asking the service to recognize Mirotvorets as a terrorist organization. Former US Marine and UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter likewise described Mirotvorets as “an instrument of terror” that “should be taken down at the insistence of the US Government.” Why is the website NOT shut down? Asking for the rest of humanity.Stay safe @EvaKBartlett and @lopatonok and others. https://t.co/UQrtMRkXuA Note the irony: We are listed as terrorists for the work we do to highlight the suffering of civilians under the Kiev regime’s actual terrorism.",4.701058007823534,3.6993985732364427,1.0016594345870908,5

The energy flow was “unilaterally stopped by Ukraine,” Rogov clarified, adding that the plant’s capacity to power areas under Kiev’s control remained. “They deliberately refrain from receiving electricity,” he said. The nuclear power plant, which is the largest in Europe, is currently providing energy only to the Russian-held territories in Zaporozhye and Kherson regions, according to Rogov. Seized by Russian forces in March shortly after the start of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, the nuclear facility and the nearby city of Energodar have repeatedly come under missile and artillery strikes in recent weeks. Moscow blames Kiev for the attacks, which it warned could cause a disaster that would affect many countries in Europe. It also said several attempts to retake the power plant by Ukrainian saboteurs had been repelled. The Ukrainian authorities have claimed that Russia has turned the plant into a military base and that it is shelling the facility itself in order to pin the blame on Kiev. Only one of the facility’s six power units is currently operational at the station, according to Rogov. Kiev is deliberately trying to disable the plant, despite it being especially harmful to the Ukrainian economy, he added. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose inspectors visited the plant in early September, issued a report on the security situation there on Tuesday. The agency demanded that all attacks on the facility “be stopped immediately” and called for a cessation of any military activity within or in the vicinity of the plant.

SBI agents will be checking for those who “may pose a threat to national security,” the agency said. “The purpose of the measures is to prevent the subversive activities of the Russians and their allies,” the SBI said on social media, adding it would “carefully process information about persons who cooperated with aggressors” and hold “collaborators and traitors strictly accountable.” “The time of reckoning has come,” the SBI concluded. Ukraine had charged the town’s mayor with treason in April, accusing him of collaborating with Russian troops and helping them distribute humanitarian aid. Balakleya is about 90 kilometers (55 miles) southeast of Kharkov, in the Izyum district. The town had around 25,000 residents before the conflict in Ukraine escalated in February. Russian troops took control of it at the end of March, but Kiev claims to have retaken it this week. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky shared a video of a Ukrainian flag flying over the town’s administration on Thursday evening. Kiev’s announcement of “filtration” comes just days after the US and its allies condemned Russia over its own alleged use of the practice. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians were “forcibly transferred” to Russia through a “vast and punitive” network of detention camps, the US State Department claimed on Wednesday. These claims were then echoed at the UN Security Council by US and Albanian diplomats. Russia was not conducting “filtration,” Moscow’s envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, replied, but documenting and registering the displaced persons from the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, as well as Ukrainians seeking refuge in territories under Russian control. “As far as we can tell, Poland and other EU countries are applying the same procedures to Ukrainian refugees, but I’ll let them explain themselves,” he told the Security Council, accusing the Western countries of projection.

Sources told the newspaper on Wednesday that the move was aimed at persuading London to drop the sanctions. “The bank would like, as one of the biggest private banks in Ukraine … to be an active player in recovering the Ukrainian economy after the war,” the supervisory board chair of the Alfa branch in Ukraine, Roman Shpek, told the outlet, explaining the funds could be used to help Kiev rebuild in areas like infrastructure, healthcare, and food and energy security. The company initially proposed the transfer in June to the National Bank of Ukraine, whose approval would be required before the matter could pass to the EU. Brussels would ultimately be responsible for allowing the funds to leave Europe, and Alfa’s Ukrainian subsidiary petitioned the Council of Europe on Fridman’s behalf last week. Fridman, who was born in the Soviet city of Lviv in western Ukraine, resigned as a director of Alfa’s parent company in March, days after the EU and UK sanctions came down. While he has not been personally sanctioned by the US, Alfa Bank is blacklisted by the Treasury Department, meaning other companies must cut ties with it or risk being sanctioned themselves, and UK entities have distanced themselves from him due to the personal sanctions there. Unnamed individuals familiar with the matter told the WSJ that Alfa’s proposal was an effort to convince London to lift the sanctions on Fridman’s assets, though he has denied making any such “quid pro quo” offer. The British Foreign Office responded that the UK “does not condone any sanctions avoidance.” Shpek insisted the donation was “a really important economic project,” stressing that the prospect of future sanctions relief had nothing to do with it.",3.4498060836378435,3.104837871721476,0.3449682119163673,7
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/562524-pentagon-ukraine-counteroffensive-claims/,Ukrainian counter-offensive had ‘some success’ – Pentagon,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has cautiously cheered battlefront developments after Ukraine said it had made advances during a counter-offensive in its southern and eastern regions. Russian officials on the ground acknowledged some setbacks but said Ukrainian forces were suffering “colossal” casualties. ""We see success in Kherson now, we see some success in Kharkov and so that is very, very encouraging,"" Austin told reporters on Friday during a press conference in Prague. Kiev claimed to have taken more than 700 square kilometers of territory in the Kharkov Region, advancing up to 50km into Russian-held territory and taking “more than 20 villages,” Reuters reported citing a Ukrainian general whom it did not name. Reports from the area confirmed heavy fighting around the city of Balakleya and west of Kupyansk, with civilians fleeing eastward to Russia. However, local officials say the Russian reinforcements are turning the tide. “The Ukrainian armed forces have pulled up all their reserves and now they are trying to claim victory on the corpses of their soldiers. They have colossal losses, in the thousands. They literally throw people into battle to be slaughtered,” military-civilian administration head Vitaly Ganchev told Russia-24 TV on Friday. Meanwhile, on the Kherson front, Ukrainian forces “made several unsuccessful attempts to attack” but “retreated after taking losses” of more than 270 men, three tanks and 11 armored vehicles, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday. Austin is in Europe to coordinate further deliveries of weapons and equipment to Ukraine. At the meeting of Kiev’s arms suppliers in Ramstein, Germany on Thursday, he announced the US would be delivering to Ukraine some $675 million worth of ammunition, along with armored cars and four howitzers. The US has given Ukraine more than $17 billion in military aid since the 2014 coup, and another $14.5 billion since the conflict escalated in February.",2.189847099682974,3.6603029120670945,-1.4704558123841203,2

In a statement on Friday, Grossi said a “serious situation” had developed at the plant, located in southern Ukraine, overnight when the power in the town where it's located was knocked out by shelling. “The power infrastructure feeding the city of Energodar, home to the NPP’s operators and their families, has been destroyed by shelling of the switchyard at the city’s thermal power plant,” Grossi explained, adding that the city was ultimately left with “no running water, no power, no sewage.” Given the “increased and continued shelling” of the nuclear facility, “there is little likelihood of re-establishing reliable offsite power,” the official warned. “The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again,” Grossi added, without assigning blame for the attacks to either Russia or Ukraine. “This is completely unacceptable. It cannot stand. I therefore urgently call for the immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area,” he said, reiterating his call for the creation of a “safety zone” around the plant. This dramatic development demonstrates the absolute imperative to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone now. This is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident. Seized by Russian forces early in the conflict, the nuclear power plant and the surrounding environs have repeatedly come under missile and artillery attacks in recent weeks. While Russia has placed the blame for the shelling squarely on Kiev, Ukraine and some Western officials continue to accuse Moscow of shelling the facility controlled by its own troops. Russia previously rejected a proposal by Kiev and its Western allies to withdraw the troops providing security around the Zaporozhye facility, insisting that Ukraine would only use this as an opportunity to seize the plant, rather than ensure its actual safety. The Russian Defense Ministry has claimed Kiev has repeatedly sent in saboteur teams to capture the facility amid the recent IAEA visit to the site.",3.7600689492259898,6.5457336543433655,-2.7856647051173757,9

The supplies will prioritize less well off and food-insecure nations. “We believe it to be right to ramp up deliveries to the poorest countries,” Putin said during a meeting of the Security Council on Friday. “In total, by the end of this year, we will supply some 30 million tons of grain and are ready to increase this volume to 50 million tons or more, because, thank God, we have a good harvest this year,” he added. Moscow is also ready to supply fertilizers to the poorest nations free of charge, the Russian president said. “Our producers – if I remember correctly, we’re talking about potash fertilizers – are ready to deliver them free of charge to developing nations that urgently need them,” Putin said, instructing the Russian Foreign Ministry to work on the plan. The president also touched upon the UN-brokered grain deal with Ukraine, reiterating his allegations that the goods have primarily been exported to the EU rather than the developing countries in Africa that need the food supply the most. “Of the 87 ships that left the Ukrainian ports with grain, 32 remained in Turkey. And I think that this is absolutely natural, because Turkey, the host country of this entire process, certainly has the right to do that,” Putin said. Another 30 vessels were sent to EU nations, while only two ships went to “the poorest countries for UN food programs,” namely to Yemen and Djibouti, Putin said. The vessels only carried around 60,000 tons of grain on board, constituting only around 3% of grain exported by Ukraine under the deal.",2.9802642315011414,1.3693382007897246,1.6109260307114168,7
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/news/562517-american-general-ukraine-victory-crimea/,Ukraine will retake Crimea in a year – ex-US general,"Ukraine could “restore full sovereignty” within a year, retaking all of its lost territory including Crimea, retired US General Ben Hodges told Newsweek on Thursday at the Tbilisi International Conference of the McCain Institute in Georgia. Hodges is now a lobbyist at the Centre for European Policy Analysis, a pressure group funded by NATO and US arms manufacturers. Western support for Kiev has resulted in a financial bonanza for these companies. “The Ukrainians saved their country,” Hodges gushed, declaring that “half a year after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion…the supposed second-best army in the world is now the second-best army in Ukraine,” with Russia’s “ability to conduct further offensive operations…all but exhausted.” Now, Hodges said, it was up to the US and NATO to step in and make sure the war is won, starting with a full-throated proclamation of support for Kiev. Washington should stop publicizing the cost of the military aid it sends overseas, he continued, suggesting the deliveries be framed in terms of the percentage of “what is needed for Ukraine to defeat Russia and regain their territory.” The retired general did not elaborate on how those numbers could be calculated. The administration of US President Joe Biden has poured over $44 billion into the war effort since February. While Ukraine and its Western backers have declared the Kherson counteroffensive a rousing success, boasting of recapturing several villages, Kiev has banned journalists from the front lines, making these claims difficult to verify. Russia has argued the initiative “failed miserably,” pointing to the loss of over 1,200 Ukrainian servicemen in a single day of fighting. Ukrainian MP Alexey Goncharenko echoed Hodges’ optimism in comments to Newsweek, declaring “next year will be the decisive year of the war” and that “with the help of the free world, Ukraine has an opportunity to win.” That will require a lot more weapons, he clarified, mentioning aircraft, air defense systems, and rockets superior to the HIMARS. Crimea became part of Russia in the wake of a 2014 referendum following the US-backed overthrow of the democratically-elected government of Viktor Yanukovich in Kiev. Ukraine and NATO consider it illegally annexed territory, and the US has reportedly given Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky the go-ahead to attack the peninsula. The Donbass republics of Donetsk and Lugansk declared their independence that same year and were recognized as independent states by the Kremlin this past February. Zelensky has vowed to retake all three regions, promising on Sunday that “Ukraine will return” to Donbass, Kharkov, Zhaporozhye, Kherson, and “definitely to Crimea.”",2.298872800126503,2.0223022569779703,0.2765705431485328,8

Peskov was asked to clarify President Vladimir Putin’s comments on Wednesday that Moscow would not be introducing any visa restrictions on foreign citizens in retaliation for similar measures imposed by the EU. “The main point that the president was trying to get across was that we will continue to do what suits our interests,” the spokesperson explained, adding that introducing mirror countermeasures against the West is not always in Russia’s interests. “Of course, illegal, criminal and raider attitudes towards our businesses will be met with reciprocal steps, but these measures will be reasonable and carefully calculated,” Peskov said, noting that Russia welcomes those who are willing to invest in the country. He added that Russia remains just as inviting to foreign tourists, including those from countries that Moscow considers “unfriendly.” “After all, people need to see our country and they need to understand that what they are shown and told about Russia in their home countries is a lie,” the Kremlin spokesperson stated, noting that the only way to explain this to people is by inviting them to Russia to see the country for themselves. Nevertheless, Peskov warned that any “inappropriate behavior” towards Russian diplomats or representatives of Russian foreign delegations would be met with mirror responses in accordance with the reciprocal rule of diplomacy. The Kremlin’s comments come as the European Council officially announced on Friday that it would be scrapping the so-called Visa Facilitation Deal between Russia and the EU, citing Moscow’s ongoing military operation in Ukraine. The agreement had simplified visa application procedures for Russian citizens. Starting Monday, however, Russians will have to pay visa application fees of €80, instead of the previous €35, and will have to provide significantly more documentation, endure longer processing times and be subject to much stricter rules for the issuance of multiple-entry visas. Meanwhile, countries such as Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have announced they would be closing their borders to all Russian tourists, even those with a valid Schengen visa.

2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/news/562507-stoltenberg-ukraine-nato-support/,NATO chief warns Ukraine could collapse,"Ukraine is heading for a tough winter, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on Thursday, urging Kiev to continue fighting against Russia. Otherwise, the country may “cease to exist” as an independent nation, he said. “If President [Vladimir] Putin and Russia stop fighting, then we will have peace. If Ukraine stops fighting, then Ukraine will cease to exist as an independent nation,” Stoltenberg told the AP on the sidelines of a US-led meeting in Ramstein, Germany that brought together foreign supporters of Ukraine. Stoltenberg avoided giving any time frame for how long the conflict might last but said it would end at some point with negotiations. So far, however, there has been “no sign” of Moscow giving up its objectives in Ukraine, the NATO chief said. Russia’s ultimate goal in the conflict is “taking control of Ukraine,” he claimed. “We need at least to be prepared for this winter,” Stoltenberg said, adding that the West must “continue to provide support,” including appropriate winter uniforms, generators and tents, among other things. “Winter’s coming, and winter’s going to be hard on the battlefield in Ukraine. We know that the size of the Ukrainian army is now roughly three times as big as what it was last winter,” Stoltenberg added. However, the NATO boss claimed the “war in Ukraine is approaching a pivotal moment,” asserting that the ongoing Russian offensive had “stalled” in Donbass and elsewhere. “We see that the Ukrainians have been able to fight back, to strike back and regain some territory,” he said. Moscow has repeatedly urged the US and other Western nations to stop “pumping” Ukraine with weapons and other military hardware. Top Russian officials insist that the continuous support of Kiev will only prolong the bloodshed without changing the ultimate outcome of the conflict. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",2.650699207406447,3.418073352083436,-0.7673741446769888,2
2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/562501-estonia-ban-russians-schengen/,Estonian MEP complains to EU about entry ban for Russians,"Estonian MEP Yana Toom has accused her own nation’s government along with those of Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland of violating the EU’s ‘free travel’ rules by imposing a “blanket ban” on Russian citizens holding valid Schengen visas issued by other EU members. The restrictions, which were announced by the four nations earlier this week, “constitute a breach of the Schengen Border Code and seriously undermine the European legal order,” Toom wrote in a Thursday letter to Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief for foreign policy and security. The Estonian lawmaker shared the document on her social media on Friday. The Schengen ‘free travel’ rules, which apply to most EU nations and four non-EU states, allow individual members to bar holders of visas issued by other participants from their territory. But such decisions must be taken on a case-by-case basis and for a limited number of reasons, the Estonian official argued, so a general policy against Russian citizens violated them. Toom asked Borrell when the European Commission was going to send a formal letter of notice to the four nations. The Baltic countries and Poland said they would no longer allow entry to Russian tourists holding Schengen visas starting September 19. The blanket ban makes an exception for travel on humanitarian grounds. The four nations argued that Russian citizens generally posed a threat to their national security. The Baltic states had previously stopped issuing tourist and business visas to Russian citizens. Toom has served as an MEP from Estonia since 2014 and is a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. As she published her letter to Borrell, she remarked that there was a backlash against her position in the Estonian media, with critics branding her as pro-Russian.",2.4223316402647144,3.8719929903997503,-1.449661350135036,8

2022-09-09,https://www.rt.com/russia/562438-what-west-forgets-when-talking/,Maxim Artemyev: The West took advantage of Russian weakness in the 1990s and is unable to understand the trauma it unleashed,"A series of articles published in the Washington Post in August about the events leading up to Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine, and its first stage of operation, raise a significant question. How realistically and objectively do people in the West perceive the situation? I’d like to point out several important things which often go unnoticed in the US and Europe. The roots of the current conflict go back to the years 1985-1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev pulled the USSR out of the arms race and ended the Cold War, a move which was seen as saving the world from potential nuclear apocalypse. As if that wasn’t enough, Gorbachev made a number of other unilateral steps which exceeded the wildest dreams of Western politicians. The Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, agreed to tear down the Berlin Wall and allowed the reunification of Germany. They also permitted the new country to become a member of NATO, withdrew Soviet troops from the East while allowing American troops to stay in the West, and disbanded the Warsaw Pact without a legally binding provision preventing its former members from joining the US-led military bloc. The Soviet Union also cut its support for anti-Western forces throughout the world, from Nicaragua and Angola to Cambodia and Ethiopia. On top of that, Gorbachev did what America would not have even dared to wish for – he disbanded the USSR by carving up much of what was historical Russian territory into 15 states, thus weakening Moscow dramatically and depriving it of 50% of its pre-reforms population. What did the new Russia, which emerged from the Soviet collapse, get in return? Simply put, nothing. There was no reciprocity. NATO remained, and the US did not give up an inch of its empire, neither letting Guam, Samoa, or Puerto Rico go, nor even returning Guantanamo to Cuba. On the contrary, the Americans used Russia’s temporary weakness to encroach on its historical territories. Washington extended NATO membership not only to Eastern European countries which had nothing to fear (like the Czech Republic or Hungary located in the middle of Europe), but also to the Baltic states, which had been mostly under Russian control since the early 1700s. The US did not stop there, and dangled the prospect of joining NATO in front of Ukraine and Georgia. Incidentally, the homelands of the two longest serving Soviet leaders: Leonid Brezhnev and Joseph Stalin. Since 1992, the US has been openly pursuing a policy of countering Moscow’s integration efforts in the post-Soviet space. Washington did everything it could to make sure Russia would never be reborn as a great power. And, of course, no significant financial aid was extended either to the USSR under Gorbachev or to Russia under President Boris Yeltsin, so it was a one-way street. Let me repeat, the West got everything, Russia got nothing. It was weakened and dismembered. However, none of the documents signed by the leaders of the US and USSR/Russia said Moscow was going to self-destruct. Back in August 1991, even George H. W. Bush, who was speaking in Kiev, called on Ukrainians not to tear the Soviet Union apart, as it was obvious to him that a step in that direction would lead to countless disasters. It’s true that most Soviet, and then Russian, politicians of the 1980s and 1990s were not of a high caliber. There is no mistake (or act of treason – whichever you prefer) they did not commit, in the eyes of many of their countrymen. Yet their Western and, more specifically, American counterparts could have acted more civilly given Russia’s sacrifices. They could have refrained from exploiting Moscow’s temporary weakness, but instead they tried to cash in. One should bear in mind that the USSR was not a defeated party like Japan and Germany after World War II, and did not sign any capitulation. It was under no obligation to cut itself up into 15 pieces. The collapse of historical Russia was the result of Gorbachev’s remarkably weak leadership and Yeltsin’s personal ambition, as the latter tried to consolidate power even if only over a smaller state. Nobody was thinking about the fate of a country which had taken centuries to form or, most importantly, of its people. Some are now saying that the dismemberment of ‘Russia’ was a key objective for the West even before 1991, and that the people of Belarus or Tajikistan were dreaming of independence all along. Such speculation sounds absolutely ridiculous to anyone who lived in the Soviet Union. Western politicians never broached the subject during their meetings with Nikita Khrushchev, Brezhnev, or Gorbachev. Poland, currently one of the most aggressively Russophobic nations, has firsthand knowledge of the trauma of a country’s breakup. However, Warsaw was generously rewarded after World War II by Stalin, who gave it control over Silesia, East Prussia, and Pomerania. However, nobody has compensated Russia’s losses. To put it into context, the Russian Federation today is Poland without not just Lviv, Grodno, and Vilnius, but also without Wroclaw, Szczecin, and Gdansk. For perspective, let’s imagine that Communists led by Maurice Thorez came to power in France after 1945 (not an unlikely scenario) and divided the country into national republics – Brittany, Alsace-Lorraine, Flanders, Corsica, Occitania, etc. – as happened in Russia after 1917. Now imagine that the French Communists’ rule collapsed in 1991 and those republics became independent states. Occitania started banning French and tearing down statues of Victor Hugo to replace them with monuments to Frederic Mistral, and the government in Marseille began demanding compensation from Paris for colonial suppression and the demise of the Occitan language. Perhaps every time Emmanuel Macron speaks in support of Ukraine, he should really be asking himself the question, what have I done for the freedom of Occitania? History never ends. As Russia fell apart so it may become whole again. It has happened twice before – the first time in the early 1600s during the Time of Troubles, and then after the 1917 revolution. It would be wrong to assume that this process is unidirectional. Germany and Italy were reunited after a thousand years of fragmentation. It took Israel two thousand years to be reborn. Now it has taken 30 years to reverse the trend set by the breakup of 1991. Who knows where it might lead?",2.902786636274477,3.041235861004531,-0.13844922473005417,6

Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita accepted her resignation. The prime minister criticized Cantaragiu during a government meeting on her failure to launch a service to help Moldovans buy firewood for the winter season. The web portal lemne.md and a phone hotline were supposed to be launched on September 1. Cantaragiu blamed unidentified “partners” involved in the development of the website for the delay and said it would be ready in two weeks. The prime minister observed that by that time the service would not be necessary. “Things must be done on time so that the information is useful. A volunteer could create the website in a day,” Gavrilita noted, as quoted by the local media. The minister was asked about the exchange during a press conference on the same day, with the media speculating that her resignation was looming. She said that falling behind the deadline was “absolutely normal” because “there are things outside of our control.” In early August, the national forestry agency Moldsilva warned that Moldova could face a shortage of firewood due to increased demand amid the global energy crisis. The Environment Ministry said the portal would help prevent price gouging. The proposal exposed the government to some mockery from citizens, who wondered if creating a website, the name of which means 'firewood' in Moldovan, was the best use of public funds.",1.8254705348336553,4.091791385741115,-2.26632085090746,7

The monument had been damaged by Ukrainian shelling during the 2014 battles with the militia of the Donetsk People’s Republic. “It is gratifying to know that this majestic complex has been restored with the utmost care,” Putin said in a video message recorded at the Kremlin, noting that its original obelisk and bas-relief have been complemented with an addition commemorating the “modern generation of heroes.” Our hearts bleed when we see some countries demolish monuments to Soviet soldiers who gave their lives in the service of the freedom of their people, mock history, and cynically let down their own fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers. For Russia, this is unthinkable. Putin added that Saur-Mogila is “hallowed grounds” for Russia, on the same level as Sapun Ridge outside Sevastopol and the monument to the defenders of Stalingrad at Mamayev Kurgan. “The reconstructed memorial to the defenders of Donbass, the courage of our soldiers, officers and militias is a warning to all who have renounced their ancestors and forgotten the lessons of history,” the Russian president concluded. Saur-Mogila is a dominant height on the Donets Ridge, rising to almost 300 meters above sea level. Soviet troops broke the German fortifications there in August 1943, as a massive tank battle raged near Kursk in the north. The city of Donetsk – then known as Stalino – was liberated on September 8. The monument built in the 1960s commemorated that victory. The entire memorial was heavily damaged in August 2014, during the weeks of fighting between the Ukrainian “punitive expedition” and the Donetsk People’s Republic militia. The DPR and neighboring Lugansk had declared independence from Ukraine following a US-backed coup in Kiev in February and the installation of a government that included neo-Nazis. The obelisk collapsed on August 21, 2014 after extended Ukrainian shelling, but the hill remained in DPR hands. Ten days later, the surrender of Ukrainian troops encircled at nearby Ilovaisk resulted in the first Minsk ceasefire.",3.7694997680167086,3.0004888237117044,0.7690109443050042,6

Kiev, along with some Western officials and media, however, have claimed that Russian forces themselves have been shelling the nuclear plant, despite the fact it is already under their control. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",5.608293059102747,3.8334649052355934,1.774828153867154,2
2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562456-ramstein-austin-pentagon-ukraine-arms/,Pentagon unveils new Ukraine weapons package,"Artillery ammunition, armored vehicles, and remote-launched mines make up the bulk of the new package of US military aid to Ukraine, which Washington values at $675 million, according to a list published by the US Department of Defense on Thursday. This is the 20th “drawdown” of equipment for Ukraine from US military stocks since August 2021 – months before the conflict escalated. According to the Pentagon, Kiev will receive ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and High-speed Anti-radiation missiles (HARM) – without specifying the quantities of either – as well as 36,000 105mm artillery rounds and four howitzers of the same caliber. In addition to 100 armored Humvee cars, Ukraine will get 1.5 million bullets, 5,000 anti-tank rockets, 50 armored ambulances, and 1,000 rounds of the 155mm Remote Anti-Armor Mine (RAAM) Systems, as well as some night vision devices, the Pentagon said. Speaking at the meeting of the “Ukraine Defense Contact Group” in Ramstein, Germany, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin boasted that Kiev has so far received 126 of the M777 howitzers since April, and a total of 26 multiple-launch rocket systems – including the US-made HIMARS – capable of firing long-range missiles. Austin claimed the weapons have “demonstrably” helped Ukraine in the conflict, but said it was time for NATO to “sustain Ukraine’s brave defenders for the long haul” by “moving urgently to innovate and to push all of our defense industrial bases” so they could supply Kiev on “the hard road ahead.” Of other countries that have chipped in, Austin singled out the UK for sending 2.3 billion pounds in military aid, and Poland for “serving as the linchpin of our efforts to support the Ukrainians,” including “generous donations” of tanks and artillery. By the Pentagon’s own admission, the US has committed “more than $17.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine” since 2014, and another $14.5 billion since February. Just this week, the US State Department pledged another $2 billion for long-term investments in military industry, half to Ukraine and half to 18 of its neighbors.

2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562428-belarus-military-exercises-defense/,Belarus begins exercises near Poland,"Amid heightened tensions with the West, Belarus has commenced military exercises, which will train troops to repel potential invaders, the Ministry of Defense announced on Thursday. “The exercise will allow to practice combat (special) operations meant to liberate the territory temporarily occupied by the adversary,” the ministry’s statement read. The drills will also allow soldiers to hone skills in “restoring control over the state border,” train close air support, implementation of martial law and fighting against an adversary’s commandos or illegal armed groups. The exercise is expected to last until September 14 and will take place in the Brest region bordering Poland and Ukraine, as well as in the Vitebsk and Minsk regions. Belarus also invited international observers to attend in order to demonstrate “maximum transparency” and the “desire to improve regional stability.” Belarus started planning the maneuvers after President Alexander Lukashenko claimed in July that NATO was preparing for a war in Eastern Europe, citing increased activity by the military alliance. “It seems the newly-minted ‘crusaders' from the North Atlantic Alliance suddenly decided that the time is ripe for another ‘Drang nach Osten,’ he said at the time, referring to a German idea of conquering lands in the East. In August, amid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Lukashenko called Kiev a threat to Belarus’ national security, accusing the Ukrainian leadership of stoking regional tensions and embracing policies “directed against its own people.” The drills come on the heels of the Vostok 2022 international military exercises hosted by Russia, in which Belarusian troops also took part.",2.986276792834528,3.2062501095076144,-0.2199733166730864,8
2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562307-ukraine-iaea-mission-zaporozhye/,It appears that Ukraine planned to use UN-appointed international nuclear experts as a tool for blackmail. The scheme failed.,"If at first you don’t succeed, then try, try again. This seems to be the mantra of the Ukrainian government as it seeks to blackmail the international community into helping it evict Russia from the territory encompassing Europe's largest Nuclear Power Plant. “The world is once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster,” Kiev's Energy Secretary German Galushchenko declared in a message posted to Facebook on Monday, September 5. “The last line connecting it with the energy system of Ukraine…separated due to the fire that occurred as a result of shelling. Any repair of the lines is impossible now – there are combat operations around the station.” Galushchenko’s warning came as the bulk of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission, dispatched late last week to inspect the safety of the Zaporozhye facility, and personally led by Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, departed the nuclear power plant. Kiev is insisting that the international community oversee the “demilitarization” of the Zaporozhye plant and surrounding environs. The removal of Russian forces, the Ukrainians contend, and their replacement with international “peacekeepers,” is the only way to ensure nuclear safety. Left unsaid is the fact that all the damage caused to the nuclear power plant is the result of Ukrainian military action, including the deliberate targeting of the nuclear reactors and their support buildings by Ukrainian artillery. The irony of the Ukrainian action is that IAEA Director General Grossi has now seen first-hand that the threat to the plant comes not from Russia, as Kiev wants to portray, but from Ukraine itself. More damning is that Grossi likewise is cognizant of the reality that Ukraine has been using the IAEA not as a guarantor of nuclear security, but rather a facilitator of Ukrainian policy, including military action that appeared to use the presence of IAEA inspectors at Zaporozhye as cover. By all appearances, Grossi undertook his mission to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in good faith. Since the attacks on the facility started in early August, he has been voicing his concerns and calling on forces on both sides to exercise the “utmost restraint” and avoid jeopardizing the safety of the plant “at all costs.” These calls were echoed by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. In mid-August, at an emergency session of the UN Security Council requested by Russia, Grossi called on Moscow and Kiev allow international experts to visit the power plant, and said he’d lead the mission himself. The United States, while backing his call, also demanded that a demilitarized zone be established in conjunction with any such visit, and said that any refusal by Russia to allow that was tantamount to nuclear blackmail. Russia refused to consider any requests to “demilitarize” the facility. It did, however, encourage the dispatch of the IAEA team, with one caveat – that it include ballistics specialists who would be able to evaluate the damage done to the plant with an eye toward determining the source of the attacks. Such professionals were included in the mission. On August 29, Grossi’s team travelled to Kiev, where the next day they met with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. Zelensky told Grossi that Ukraine believed it was critical for the IAEA to press home its demands for a demilitarized zone, which would enable Ukraine to take control of the plant. On September 1, Grossi and his team set off for the Zaporozhye facility. Prior to their arrival, they were stopped by Ukrainian officials, who warned Grossi that military activity in and around the facility had picked up that morning. According to Russian military sources, the Ukrainian army had attempted to seize the power plant in a commando raid that was thwarted by Russian forces. As Grossi’s 14-man team arrived at the power plant, the sound of nearby combat could be readily heard. The deteriorating security situation at the facility prompted Grossi to withdraw the bulk of his team later that day. A six-person sub-team was tasked with remaining on-site for a few days longer, after which four inspectors would depart, leaving behind a two-person element, who would provide a permanent presence, on a rotational basis, at the facility. Afterwards, Grossi stated that the mission had been valuable. “We knew a lot before too, but of course it is being inspected now. We are trying to do a thorough assessment of the current situation.” As to the security of the plant, Grossi noted that “[t]he physical integrity of the facility has been violated not once, but multiple times. This is by no means acceptable.” In addition to their personal observations, the team was presented with a petition signed by 20,000 residents from Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporozhye region demanding that the IAEA condemn the attacks on the nuclear power plant, which the signatories said were conducted solely by the Ukrainian forces. This was not the result either the Ukrainian government or its Western backers could have envisioned when they were pushing for the mission’s dispatch in mid- to late-August. The IAEA mission, it seems, was not aware that there was going to be a Ukrainian military operation designed to capture the site while the inspectors were en route. There can be no doubt, however, that the Ukrainian government was aware that this was going to happen, even as Zelensky met with Grossi and his team the day before. It is also highly likely that Zelensky’s backers, especially the United States, United Kingdom, and France, were aware of the pending military operation, if not its timing. Needless to say, using an international inspection team as cover for a military operation is a violation of everything the United Nations Charter stands for. While the goal of the operation appears to have been to capture the site, and then invite the IAEA inspectors to remain there permanently, prompting the need for the dispatch of an international peacekeeping force, this was not achieved. Worse still for Ukraine and its partners, the team has now been exposed to the duplicity of the Ukrainian government and, by extension, its Western backers in the United Nations, as well as to the reality that Russia had been telling the truth the entire time about the safety and security of the plant. There is no doubt that the ballistic experts accompanying Grossi’s team were able to gather more than enough forensic data to prove conclusively who was responsible for the ongoing attacks on Zaporozhye. On Tuesday, September 6, Director General Grossi submitted the findings of his mission as part of a larger periodic report on the IAEA’s work in Ukraine since the initiation of Russia’s special military operation. The report is technical in nature, focusing on the safety of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. This is the IAEA’s bread and butter, and based upon the contents of the report, the team accurately reflected what it observed while on the ground in Zaporozhye. A second, unspoken and ultimately more sensitive aspect of the report is the political ramifications of the mission. While accurately reporting the frequency and damage done by repeated artillery strikes on the territory of the plant, Grossi did not provide any conclusions about the origin of the shelling, despite being able to do so based on the data collected by his team. UN organizations, unless specifically mandated to do so, rarely provide attribution when it comes to who did what to whom. Instead, the report concluded that the safety and security of the nuclear power plant and its operators has been put at risk because of the ongoing military action, and encouraged all parties involved to cease such activity. The report likewise avoids any reference to the efforts of the Russian military to keep the team safe from attack while they were visiting the plant, thereby avoiding any indirect acknowledgement that the threat to Zaporozhye came from Ukraine, not Russia. What the team did do is speak of “an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” which could be achieved by the immediate establishment of a “nuclear safety and security protection zone.” Grossi declared that the “IAEA is ready to start immediately the consultations leading to the urgent establishment of such a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the ZNPP [Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant].” Grossi could have prepared a report that sought the UN Security Council’s condemnation of the perpetrators of the egregious actions observed by the IAEA team – evidence of ongoing Ukrainian artillery attacks, and the use of Grossi’s team as operational cover for a physical attack on the plant while the mission was underway. Grossi is part of the UN system, however, and in any event the Council cannot police itself; when three of the five permanent members are involved in facilitating the Ukrainian malfeasance, then the Council is paralyzed by its own moral corruption. Regardless, Grossi’s trip is a political defeat for Ukraine and its supporters, which had placed so much hope and effort (including the lives of soldiers who perished in the September 1 assault on Zaporozhye) in using the IAEA inspection as a facilitator for larger objectives, such as the dispatch of international peacekeepers to occupy the plant and its immediate environs. In a crass display of hubris-laced audacity, Ukraine has called for a new IAEA inspection mission to be accompanied by a UN peacekeeping force. “We need to draw conclusions from this mission {Grossi’s} on the ground,” Peter Kotin, the head of Energoatom, declared on September 5, 2022 – well prior to Grossi’s report being published. “These conclusions should resolve the whole situation by ending Russian control. If the mission does not produce that, then we must have some viable outcome.” Kotin proposed increasing the number of agency inspectors at the station, adding that “the presence of other international organizations, such as United Nations peacekeeping forces or other international missions from the European Union, will help provide an independent view of what is going on there, and ultimately remove the Russians from the station.” The chances of that happening are near zero. But the fact that Ukraine continues to push for this outcome virtually guarantees that the relentless shelling of the Zaporozhye plant will continue until such time as the Ukrainian military is pushed back, out of artillery range, or else Ukraine capitulates. In any event, the world will continue to be subjected to nuclear blackmail daily. The perpetrator of this global crime, however, isn’t Russia, but rather Ukraine, along with its Western supporters in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and elsewhere.",3.6304850969701357,4.417991374530295,-0.7875062775601589,9
2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562421-latvia-protest-russian-language/,Russian speakers protest ‘language genocide’ in Latvia,"Members of Latvia’s Russian-speaking community staged a peaceful protest in the country’s capital of Riga on Wednesday evening against a looming ban on teaching in Russian in educational institutions. Last month, the Education, Culture and Science Commission of the Latvian parliament, called the Saeima, supported amendments to education laws that would provide for a phased three-year transition to teaching only in Latvian, the state language, in kindergartens and schools. The transition period would commence next September. On Thursday, the bill is expected to be considered by the Saeima in its second reading. If it passes, it will progress for a third reading in both the commission and the parliament. Russian is officially considered a foreign language in Latvia despite the fact that, according to official statistics obtained by Sputnik, about 40% of the population identifies it as their native language. “In the context of the senseless fight against everything Russian declared by the government, the survival of the Russian language and culture in Latvia depends only on you and me. Therefore, today we will all say ‘NO’ to the destruction of the Russian language in schools!” the Latvian Russian Union political party, the organizer of the protest, said in a Facebook post. According to the news agency Leta, about 100 people took part in the protest, which was held in front of the parliament building. The demonstrators were seen holding posters with calls to end the “language genocide.” The speakers broached not only the country’s language policies but also the destruction of Soviet memorials, as well as the severing of ties between the Latvian Orthodox Church and the Moscow Patriarchate. Commenting in June on the proposed legislation in Latvia, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova warned the country’s authorities that such a policy might turn out badly for them. In her view, “mocking common sense, historical memory and everything that is sacred to their own citizens” signals inevitable “crisis changes.”",3.8375767460048436,3.6459882233880125,0.19158852261683101,3
2022-09-08,https://www.rt.com/russia/562349-moscow-is-aiming-ukraine/,"Dmitry Trenin: Six months into the conflict, what exactly does Russia hope to achieve in Ukraine?","Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to Ukraine as an “anti-Russian enclave” which has to be removed. He also said that the Russian soldiers taking part in the military operation there were fighting for their “own country.” These statements carry important implications. Over the last six-plus months, the mantra of the Russian officialdom has been that all aims of the offensive will be reached. On purpose, however, the specific objectives, such as how far Moscow’s forces plan move into Ukraine, have never been spelled out. This cannot but raise speculation about what the Kremlin is actually hoping to achieve. The only person who can authoritatively answer that question, however, is the president, and second-guessing him makes no sense. Yet, two things cannot escape close attention. One is the radicalization of Moscow’s position on Ukraine as a result of both Western policies and Kiev’s actions; two is the widening gap between the minimum result of the military campaign that Russia can be satisfied with, and the maximum amount of what the US and its allies can accept. For about six years after the second Minsk Agreement was signed in 2015, the Kremlin tried hard to get that accord implemented. It would have ensured the autonomous status of Donbass within Ukraine and given the region influence on national politics and policies, including in the issue of the country’s geopolitical and geo-economic orientation. From the very start, however, Kiev was unwilling to cooperate on the deal’s implementation, seeing it as a win for Moscow. Washington, in pursuit of a policy to contain Russia, encouraged such an obstructionist stance, while Berlin and Paris, formally the guarantors of the agreement (alongside Russia), had no leverage in Kiev and ended up embracing the Ukrainian position. Vladimir Zelensky’s election to Ukraine’s presidency in 2019 initially appeared to be an opening for peace, and President Putin made a serious effort to get the Minsk agreement off the ground. Kiev, however, soon backtracked and took an even more hardline position than before. Nevertheless, until mid-2021 the Kremlin continued to see as its goals in Ukraine a resolution of the Donbass issue essentially on the basis of Minsk, and the eventual de facto recognition of Crimea’s Russian status. In June of last year, Vladimir Putin, however, published a long article on Russian-Ukrainian relations which made it clear that he viewed the current situation as a major security, political, and identity issue for his country; recognized his personal responsibility; and was resolved to do something to strategically correct it. The article did not give away Putin’s game plan, but it laid out his basic thinking on Ukraine. Last December, Moscow passed on to Washington a package of proposals, which amounted to a list of security guarantees for Russia. These included Ukraine’s formal neutrality between Russia and NATO (“no Ukraine in NATO”); and no deployment of US and other NATO weapons and military bases in Ukraine, as well as a ban on military exercises on Ukrainian territory (“no NATO in Ukraine”). While the US agreed to discuss some military technical issues dealt with in the Russian paper it rejected Moscow’s key demands related to Ukraine and NATO. Putin had to take no for an answer. Just before the launch of its military operation, Moscow recognized the two Donbass republics and told Kiev to vacate the parts of Donetsk and Lugansk then under Ukrainian control – or face the consequences. Kiev refused, and hostilities began. Russia’s official reason for unleashing force was defending the two newly recognized republics which had asked for military assistance. Shortly after the start of hostilities Russia and Ukraine began peace talks. In late March 2022 at a meeting in Istanbul, Moscow demanded that Zelensky’s government recognize the sovereignty of the two Donbass republics within their constitutional borders, as well as Russia’s own sovereignty over Crimea, which was formally incorporated into the Russian Federation in 2014, plus accept a neutral and demilitarized status for territory controlled by Kiev. At that point, Moscow still recognized the current Ukrainian authorities and was prepared to deal with them directly. For its part, Kiev initially appeared ready to accept Moscow’s demands (which were criticized by many within Russia as overly concessionary to Ukraine), but then quickly reverted to a hardline stance. Moscow has always suspected that this U-turn, as on previous occasions, was the result of US behind-the-scenes influence, often aided by the British and other allies. From the spring of 2022, as the fighting continued, Moscow expanded its aims. These now included the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine, meaning not only the removal of ultra-nationalist and anti-Russian elements from the Ukrainian government (increasingly characterized by Russian officials now as the “Kiev regime”), but the extirpation of their underlying ideology (based around the World War Two Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera) and its influence in society, including in education, the media, culture and other spheres. Next to this, Moscow added something that Putin called, in his trademark caustic way, the “de-Communization” of Ukraine, meaning ridding that country, whose leadership was rejecting its Soviet past, of the Russian-populated or Russian-speaking territories that had been awarded to the Soviet Ukrainian republic of the USSR by the Communist leaders in Moscow, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev. These include, besides Donbass, the entire southeast of Ukraine, from Kharkov to Odessa. This change of policy led to dropping the early signals about Russia honoring Ukraine’s statehood outside Donbass, and to establishing Russian military government bodies in the territory seized by the Russian forces. Immediately following that, a drive started to de facto integrate these territories with Moscow. By the early fall of 2022, all of Kherson, much of Zaporozhye and part of Kharkov oblasts were being drawn into the Russian economic system; started to use the Russian ruble; adopted the Russian education system; and their population was offered a fast-track way to Russian citizenship. As the fighting in Ukraine quickly became a proxy war between Russia and the US-led West, Russia’s views on Ukraine’s future radicalized further. While a quick cessation of hostilities and a peace settlement on Russian terms in the spring would have left Ukraine, minus Donbass, demilitarized and outside NATO, but otherwise under the present leadership with its virulently anti-Russian ideology and reliance on the West, the new thinking, as Putin’s remarks in Kaliningrad suggest, tends to regard any Ukrainian state that is not fully and securely cleansed of ultranationalist ideology and its agents as a clear and present danger; in fact, a ticking bomb right on Russia’s borders not far from its capital. Under these circumstances, in view of all the losses and hardships sustained, it would not suffice that Russia wins control of what was once known as Novorossiya, the northern coast of the Black Sea all the way to Transnistria. This would mean that Ukraine would be completely cut off from the sea, and Russia would gain – via referenda, it is assumed – a large swath of territory and millions of new citizens. To reach that objective, of course, the Russian forces still need to seize Nikolaev and Odessa in the south, as well as Kharkov in the east. A logical next step would be to expand Russian control to all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River, as well as the city of Kiev that lies mostly on the right bank. If this were to happen, the Ukrainian state would shrink to the central and western regions of the country. Neither of these outcomes, however, deals with the fundamental problem that Putin has highlighted, that is to say, of Russia having to live side-by-side with a state that will constantly seek revenge and will be used by the United States, which arms and directs it, in its effort to threaten and weaken Russia. This is the main reason behind the argument for taking over the entire territory of Ukraine to the Polish border. However, integrating central and western Ukraine into Russia would be exceedingly difficult, while trying to build a Ukrainian buffer state controlled by Russia would be a major drain on resources, as well as a constant headache. No wonder that some in Moscow would not mind if Poland were to absorb western Ukraine within some form of a common political entity which, Russia’s foreign intelligence claims, is being surreptitiously created. Ukraine’s future will not be dictated, of course, by someone’s wishes, but by the actual developments on the battlefield. Fighting there will continue for some time, and the final outcome is not in sight. Even when the active phase of the conflict comes to an end, it is unlikely to be followed up by a peace settlement. For different reasons, each side regards the conflict as existential – and much wider than Ukraine. This means that what Russia aims for has to be won and then held firmly.",2.7350467863113157,2.7458885971347615,-0.010841810823445819,8

Though the building was damaged, there were no reports of injuries or deaths. ‘Together With Russia’ accused the Ukrainian government of a “terrorist act” after its headquarters on Lomonosov Street were damaged in the explosion. The group distributes humanitarian aid to residents of the Russian-controlled territories in Ukraine’s Zaporozhye Region and advocates for unification with Russia. “The leadership of the terrorist state refuses to abandon the tactic of terrorizing civilians, even though it has failed to work,” the group said in a statement. “All Ukraine can do is fire at civilians at night.” Melitopol is a community of around 150,000 residents in the central Zaporozhye Region. Nearby Berdyansk, also under Russian control, was targeted by drones and artillery on Wednesday. The city’s head of the military-civilian administration was seriously injured in a car bombing on Tuesday. Pro-Russian activists say this is a campaign of terror aimed at intimidating the residents, which overwhelmingly favor rule by the Russian Federation. A poll administered by a Crimean researcher last week showed 83% of the residents were willing to take part in a referendum on joining Russia, and 86% of them would vote in favor. Ukraine has not commented on the latest attack so far. Earlier, the country’s Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk, who is also in charge of the “reintegration of temporarily occupied territories,” said on Saturday that the percentage of people willing to take part in such plebiscites was “tiny, not even two percent.” Those who do take part, Vereschuk told the Ukrainian media, can be convicted for “collaboration” and punished with up to 12 years in prison and confiscation of their property. Kiev has already threatened penalties of up to 15 years in prison to those applying for Russian citizenship and even accepting humanitarian aid from Russia.",3.9918776424404414,4.205126914570834,-0.2132492721303927,0

Bardin was reported dead on Monday after his car was blown up in what the local authorities called a terrorist attack. Bardin was hospitalized in serious condition and the local authorities confirmed his death to journalists later on Monday. Miroshnichenko denied these reports by saying that the military governor is still alive as of Tuesday evening. The official also described the governor’s condition as “serious but stable.”The governor’s car was rocked by an explosion as it was parked near the city administration office. Three other civilian vehicles were damaged in the blast, Russian media outlets reported. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye Region administration, blamed the attack on the “terrorists of the Zelensky regime,” referring to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. No suspects have been officially identified so far. The city of Berdyansk was seized by Russian forces early in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev and has remained under Russian control ever since. Monday's attack was not the first one in the city. In late August, the deputy commander of the local traffic police, Aleksandr Kolesnikov, was killed in a similar incident. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that would never join any Western military bloc.

Three rounds struck inside the NPP, causing damage but no radiation leaks so far. The shelling happened after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited the facility and issued a report calling for the shelling to stop. “Regardless of the presence of IAEA representatives, the Kiev regime continues its provocations at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, with the goal of creating the threat of a man-made disaster,” the defense ministry in Moscow said, noting that 15 artillery attacks against the city of Energodar and the territory of the ZNPP have been observed over the past 24 hours. Zaporozhye is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Along with the nearby city of Energodar, it has been under Russian control since March. Artillery, drone, and rocket attacks began in July, however, damaging cooling systems, power lines, and other facilities. Ukraine has accused Russia of staging false-flag attacks on the plant, but last week admitted its forces have shelled Energodar. Of the 20 rounds fired by Ukrainian artillery from Marganets, due north of Energodar, three struck the nuclear power plant in the areas of reactors one and two, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Wednesday. The shelling reportedly interrupted power supply to Energodar. “Any military activity – such as shelling – within, or in the vicinity of, a nuclear facility has the potential to cause an unacceptable radiological consequence,” the IAEA said in its report on Tuesday. Shelling should be “stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities,” the UN nuclear watchdog demanded, proposing the creation of a “safety zone” around the ZNPP as the way to do this.

2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562387-putin-borrell-fascist-state/,EU's top diplomat would have backed fascists in 1930s Spain – Putin,"The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, would have likely backed the fascist coup in Spain in the 1930s, Russian President Vladimir Putin said while speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Wednesday. The Russian leader’s statement came in response to Borrell describing Russia as a “fascist” state. “He’s just grinding his tongue, he is a great specialist in that area,” said Putin, noting that Borrell’s recent calls for a military victory over Moscow on the battlefield are “strange” coming from the EU’s top diplomat. Putin went on to question whose side Borrell would have taken if he had lived in Spain in the 1930s and seen the signs for General Franco’s coup. “Would he take up arms and whose side would he be on? The democratically elected government of Spain or the putschists?” Putin asked. “In my opinion, he would be on the side of the putschists, because today he supports just the same putschists in Ukraine,” he added, noting that the primary source of Kiev’s power today is the Western-backed armed coup in 2014. “He supports them, and he would have been on the side of the Nazis back then for sure. That’s who is on the side of the Nazis,” Putin proclaimed. The Russian president went on to say that Moscow has long pointed out the neo-Nazi elements of the Kiev regime, but has often heard the response that many countries, including Russia, have neo-Nazis as well. “Yes, we have them. But neither Russia nor any other civilized country promotes Nazis or radical nationalists to the status of national heroes. That’s the difference. And Ukraine is doing precisely that,” he said. Putin stated that if Borrell had any idea who the likes of Bandera and Shukhevich actually were – Nazis that executed Russians, Jews, and Poles – he would have understood that real fascism is prospering in Ukraine and not Russia. “He should be given an opportunity to look reality in the eye and then we can listen to him. If he has even a drop of conscience, he must draw the right conclusions,” the Russian president said. Borrell’s comments about Russia also drew a response from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, who stated that the EU commissioner’s “disgusting remarks” about Russia being a fascist state should never be forgotten and that the diplomat should be permanently listed as a “non-handshaking creature without the right to pardon.”",3.2313239288580786,1.9711418837784207,1.260182045079658,8

Wednesday’s piece about plucky underdogs who just need more weapons, ammunition, and equipment appeared just ahead of a US-led meeting of Ukraine’s arms suppliers in Ramstein, Germany. Soldiers with “severed limbs, shrapnel wounds, mangled hands and shattered joints” told the Post about the “lopsided disadvantages” the Ukrainian army faces on the Kherson front. The Russians have more and better artillery, drones that can fly with impunity a kilometer high, and counter-battery radars that can call fire on Ukrainians’ heads within minutes, according to the US outlet. Russian troops even hack and hijack Ukrainian drones, which “drift away helplessly behind enemy lines,” the paper said. “We lost five people for every one they did,” Igor, a 30-year-old platoon leader with a back injury, told the Post. “When we turn on mobile phones or radio, they can recognize our presence immediately,” another soldier named Denis said. “And then the shooting starts.” “They were just hitting us all the time,” said Aleksandr, who had lost an arm in the fighting. “If we fire three mortars, they fire 20 in return.” After months of talking up a counter-offensive to retake Kherson and even Crimea, Kiev launched an attack last week. The Russian military estimates more than 15,000 Ukrainian troops are involved in the operation, but have already taken thousands of casualties. On Wednesday, Ukrainian troops “made no offensive actions” on that front due to losses, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a briefing. While Kiev claims it has taken several villages, its claims could not be verified because journalists have been banned from the front. According to the Post, some of its reporters came within five kilometers of Visokopolye on Monday, but were stopped by Ukrainian troops and “could not ascertain its status.” Kiev is “hoping that the Kherson counteroffensive will boost national morale and demonstrate to Western governments that their billions of dollars in economic and military assistance is paying off,” the Post said. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin flew to Germany on Wednesday, in preparation for the meeting of the ‘Ukraine Contact Group’ – a coalition of countries that pledged weapons, ammunition and other support to Kiev – at the Ramstein base on Thursday.",3.582952583241867,3.444053614610121,0.1388989686317461,2

Taking to Telegram on Wednesday, Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, commented on the succession of governments in the UK: “Out goes the freak guy, in comes the freak lady.” He described the new PM as “an incompetent and mediocre thermonuclear Russophobe who has no elementary ideas about politics, history, geography, but wants to defeat Russia in everything.” The former president added that Truss, the third female prime minister in British history, is trying to imitate the first, Margaret Thatcher, “without having even 5% of her abilities,” and hopes to address the energy crisis and rising food inflation, which are “the result of her own crazy sanctions exercises.” In her first statement at Downing Street, Truss claimed that the energy crisis was caused by “Putin’s war.” “She will quarrel with everyone, fail in everything, and leave in disgrace, like her predecessor, shaggy Boriska. It seems that in Britain, which is famous for its traditions, a new tradition has emerged,” Medvedev wrote. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed that the selection of Liz Truss as prime minister signals a “crisis of democracy,” and that her Tory leadership election victory had nothing to do with the will of the people, “since the system of indirect elections dominates the Anglo-Saxon duo.” Truss gained notoriety in Russia during her visit to Moscow in February, days before the launch of the military operation in Ukraine. Then-Foreign Secretary Truss confused the Russian regions of Voronezh and Rostov with Ukrainian regions, and told her counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that London would never recognize Russia’s sovereignty over these areas. According to reports, she was then allegedly corrected by Deborah Bronnert, the UK ambassador. Lavrov described the meeting with the foreign secretary as talking “to a deaf person.”",3.314420194546564,2.7023808874165374,0.6120393071300265,5
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562381-europe-faces-polar-winter/,Europe faces ‘polar winter’ – Serbian president,"Europe is facing a difficult winter this year, but next winter will be “polar,” Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Wednesday, commenting on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s speech at the Eastern Economic Forum. Among other things, Putin stressed that Russia would not supply energy to countries adopting measures in breach of supply contracts. He also said that amid the sanctions the EU imposed in response to Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, Russia no longer considers the bloc to be its main export destination. Although Serbia is not a member state, the country’s energy supplies transit through countries that are, meaning that any EU sanctions on Russia also affect Serbia. During a joint press conference with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Belgrade, Vucic admitted that he had listened only to a fragment of Putin’s speech but understood his message quite well. “This winter is going to be very cold for all of us,” Vucic said, adding that “next winter will be polar for all of Europe.” Expressing doubt that Russian forces can be easily defeated and noting that no one seems to be seeking a compromise, the Serbian leader said that Europe should “prepare well for both a cold and polar winter.” Erdogan, commenting on the same matter, said that “those who underestimate Russia are wrong” as this is “not a country to be taken lightly.” “Russia has stopped supplying gas, prices have gone up, and now everyone is looking for alternatives. Why didn't you think about it earlier?” he said. The Turkish president also added that now, when “everyone attacks” it, Russia “will use all means at its disposal.” Energy prices and bills have been skyrocketing over the last few months. A recent announcement by the Russian energy giant Gazprom that Nord Stream 1, a key gas route from Russia to the EU, would remain shut indefinitely due to sanctions-related maintenance problems drove wholesale gas prices up even further. Both Turkey and Serbia, however, made it clear that they would continue to rely on energy from Russia. Belgrade recently struck a deal with Moscow for additional volumes of natural gas.",3.774919801335502,1.4841542258812785,2.2907655754542233,7
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562377-nato-head-russian-threat/,NATO head warns of Russian threat,"The cost of providing support for Ukraine is high for the West, but it could be even higher if Russia expands its “aggression” to other countries, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said, claiming that “the war in Ukraine is entering a critical phase.” In an opinion piece, published by the Financial Times on Wednesday, Stoltenberg claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin had “clearly stated that he wants to wipe the country from the map and rewrite the European security order.” Therefore, NATO’s chief claimed, supporting Ukraine benefits the bloc’s own security. “Emboldened by any success, Russia could risk further aggression against other neighbors, and even an attack on NATO allies,” he explained. Since the launch of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine in late February, Baltic states and Poland have been asking the US and NATO for additional military support, citing the threat from Russia as the reason for these requests. Moscow, in turn, has been insisting that the bloc’s expansion towards its borders was one of the reasons for the offensive in Ukraine. In Stoltenberg’s opinion, the West has “a moral responsibility” to continue supporting Ukraine. “If Russia stops fighting, there will be peace. If Ukraine stops fighting, it will cease to exist as an independent nation,” he explained. Therefore, the secretary general said, the alliance members will continue to help Ukraine’s “transition from Soviet-era weapons to NATO-standard capabilities” and are now preparing “more than a dozen new projects” to help Kiev throughout the winter. The next six months, Stoltenberg stressed, will be hard not only for the Ukrainians but also for their supporters, who will “pay a price,” including by suffering from the energy crisis. “There are tough times ahead, but we have faced tough times together before,” Stoltenberg concluded. Moscow has been consistently arguing that by “pumping up” Ukraine with weapons, Western countries are only prolonging the conflict and increasing the number of unnecessary casualties. In May, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that none of the actions taken by NATO, the US, or their allies would be able to prevent Russia from fulfilling the goals of its military operation.",3.200359621266833,1.3404974535029497,1.8598621677638831,8
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562379-ukraine-hungary-geography-textbook/,Ukraine takes issue with Hungarian school textbooks,"Kiev has accused Hungary of including anti-Ukrainian falsehoods in its eighth-grade geography textbooks. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry is now demanding that the Hungarian educational authorities correct the information to align with Kiev’s position. A spokesperson for the ministry, Oleg Nikolenko, wrote on social media on Wednesday that Ukrainian diplomats had already held a meeting at the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, during which they “emphasized the inadmissibility of presenting unreliable and distorted facts about Ukraine” and demanded the correction of “false information” as soon as possible. The textbook in question is published on the National Public Education Portal. Among other things, it suggests that the only mountains in Ukraine are the Carpathians, thus omitting the Crimean Mountains. Ukraine insists on its sovereignty over the Crimean peninsula, which seceded from Kiev’s rule in 2014 to join Russia. Another part of the textbook states that the Russian and Ukrainian languages hold many similarities and notes that much of eastern Ukraine is inhabited by ethnic Russians and that nearly a fifth of Ukraine’s population speaks a mix of Russian and Ukrainian. The textbook points out that despite their similarities, the two ethnic groups “are often at odds with each other” and that this turmoil “provoked an armed conflict over the Crimean peninsula.” It then goes on to illustrate the struggle over Ukraine by featuring a satirical picture of the Ukrainian flag being torn apart by a bear wearing a Russian flag and two people with the symbols of the US and EU on their backs. The picture is accompanied by the question “who does Ukraine belong to?” In his announcement that Ukrainian diplomats had expressed their protest to the Hungarian government, Nikolenko linked to an article by the media outlet European Pravda, which insists that what is presented in the textbook repeats Russian propaganda narratives and are an effort to “program” schoolchildren to have a hostile attitude towards Ukraine.",3.9005245123076753,3.10172393446136,0.7988005778463152,5
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562371-russia-china-growing-partnership/,Petr Akopov: Russia and China’s growing partnership with the Islamic world spells trouble for the West,"With Covid quarantines no longer a hindrance, summits have returned to the diplomatic agenda. First, the West returned to face-to-face meetings – EU and NATO summits have been taking place for some time now – and now it is the turn of the East. Top Asian leaders have not met collectively for more than three years, but in a week’s time the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) will gather in the Uzbek city of Samarkand and will bring together all its leaders. Until recently, it was not entirely clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be coming, as some observers had assumed he would not leave Beijing before the Communist Party congress in mid-October. But it has since been announced that the Chinese leader will visit Kazakhstan next week, so a trip to Uzbekistan is also a foregone conclusion. The meeting between Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will be the second this year, but the first since the start of the military operation in Ukraine. Also, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will meet for the first time ever in Samarkand. For the two neighbors with a history of fraught relations, the SCO is becoming an important platform for dialogue. And the SCO itself is rapidly outgrowing its original format as a Russo-Chinese security alliance in Central Asia and involving just the Central Asian republics. The group now boasts four nuclear states – that is, virtually all of the non-Western members of the club (except North Korea). In Uzbekistan, the SCO ‘eight’ will turn into a ‘nine’ as the procedure for Iran's accession will be completed. However, the organization will not be limited to that number for long – it has already announced its intention to start the procedure to transfer Belarus from an observer to a full-fledged member. And it will not stop there. Several more countries, including some influential ones, want to join the SCO. In recent years, there have been four observers to the organization (as candidates for membership), but now Tehran has come on board and Belarus is starting the transition procedure, so that leaves Afghanistan and Mongolia. Whereas previously the main obstacle to Kabul’s inclusion was the presence of US troops in the country, this problem no longer exists, so its acceptance into the SCO will undoubtedly occur. This will not happen immediately, but rather once the situation in the country has stabilized and a full-fledged system of governance and law and order have been established (naturally, with the help of SCO countries). Mongolia could become a full-fledged participant at any time – none of the member states have any objections – but in the past it has been slow to do so, preferring to remain an observer. However, rising global tensions will also affect Ulaanbaatar's position, while the growing queue of aspiring SCO members may also prompt its leadership to step up. There had been aspirants to join the SCO before, but this year they have moved from words to deeds. And we are not only talking about the countries that were among the 'partners in dialogue' (another format of interaction). These aspirants comprise nine states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. The last three obtained the status of dialogues partners only a year ago but are already looking to upgrade to being able to join the organization in full. Syria and Myanmar also want to be involved, along with the United Arab Emirates, which seeks immediate accession. Although such a request cannot be granted, it is in itself a sign of the rapidly growing interest in the organization, which is driven by the Sino-Russian partnership. The reasons for this are clear: although the consolidation of the non-Western world has been steadily gaining momentum over the past decade, things have accelerated since the beginning of 2020. First, Covid and the resulting lockdowns led to a crisis of globalization, then the operation in Ukraine forced the West to insist that whoever does not go along with the blockade of Russia is for Putin. And then the provocation of the Taiwan issue hurt the prospects for normalizing relations between the West and the Middle Kingdom. The whole world is being forced to pick a side. Under these conditions, the optimal model for many influential countries in the Islamic world is to demonstrate their independence, which is seen as carving out a position equidistant from the two poles, i.e. Russia-China and the United States-EU. But how can US military allies such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia find this equidistance? By joining the SCO. While it is true that the SCO is not a military bloc, belonging to the organization clearly indicates an unwillingness to participate in any Western anti-Russian and anti-Chinese efforts. That is why Recep Erdogan will fly to Samarkand, and possibly Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as well. In this case, the SCO ‘nine’ will turn, albeit unofficially so far, into a club of 11, that is, a platform where Russia, China, India and the four most important countries of the Islamic world meet: Saudi Arabia, ‘the richest and most influential’; Iran, ‘the oldest and most passionate’; Turkey, ‘the most developed and ambitious’; and Pakistan, ‘the only nuclear one’. The SCO observers also include Egypt, ‘the main country in the Arab world’; and Qatar, ‘the information and propaganda giant’. These Islamic countries admittedly do not have the smoothest relations among themselves (especially Saudi Arabia and Iran), and in the past the West has actively used their discord. Russia and China, however, are not interested in pitting Muslims against each other but in involving them in building a new, post-Western world order. And if the three great powers – Russia, China, and India – manage to build strategic relations with the Islamic world in working out a new world order, it will be tantamount to a final verdict in the Anglo-Saxon bid for global domination. The Atlanticists are no longer betting on a quarrel between Russia and China but on pitting India and China against each other. And they are virtually certain that they will be able to keep the Islamic world in their orbit (and even use it against Beijing and Moscow). Therefore, the ‘Islamization’ of the SCO will be the most important challenge to the Anglo-Saxon project – and also a sign of its complete collapse.",2.2952242586776412,1.6418296281012417,0.6533946305763996,6
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562365-putin-zaporozhye-npp-report/,Putin comments on UN nuclear watchdog’s report,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can’t openly state that the attacks on the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) are being carried out by Kiev, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Wednesday, the Russian leader praised the agency as being a responsible international organization with a very professional leader, and stated that he trusts the IAEA’s latest report on the ZNPP. However, Putin noted that the agency is under pressure from the US and other Western nations, and therefore cannot directly accuse Kiev of attacking the nuclear plant. “But this is obvious. We control the station, our servicemen are stationed there. What, are we attacking ourselves?” Putin said, calling the notion completely absurd and adding that the area around the power plant is littered with the remains of HIMARS rockets and other Western munitions. Putin also addressed the IAEA’s request that Russia remove its military equipment from the premises of the ZNPP. He insisted that there is no such equipment at the plant and explained that the only forces stationed there are the Russian National Guard, which is protecting the perimeter and the premises of the station itself. “We can even call journalists there tomorrow, including European and American journalists, to see for themselves,” Putin said, noting that it is obvious the strikes on the power plant and the city of Energodar are coming from across the reservoir where Kiev’s forces are located. Putin further explained that Russia’s military equipment, which is engaged in counter-battery combat, is not located anywhere near the station and has in fact been moved quite far beyond the perimeter of the facility. The Russian leader also expressed his bewilderment at Kiev’s attempts to create a nuclear catastrophe by attacking the power plant, stating that “the Ukrainian side is creating threats to undermine nuclear security.” “Why they do this, I honestly don’t really understand. Just to draw more attention to their situation and create an additional crisis?” He also revealed that Kiev’s operatives have attempted to carry out terrorist attacks on Russian territory, targeting high-voltage power lines connected to Russian nuclear power facilities. “They purposefully work in this direction. What for? What is the point of creating a nuclear threat for the whole of Europe? I do not really understand, but they are doing this.” Putin’s comments come after the IAEA released a report on Tuesday regarding the state of the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. The agency demanded that all attacks on the facility “be stopped immediately” and called for a cessation of any military activity within or in the vicinity of the plant. The report did not identify those responsible for shelling the plant.",4.745358093775214,5.038698319168157,-0.29334022539294313,9
2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562367-putin-speech-vladivostok-highlights/,Deceiving West and 'detached' elites: Highlights of Putin’s speech at Eastern Economic Forum,"President Vladimir Putin delivered a lengthy speech at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, in Russia’s Far East. Among other things, he commented on the unfolding crisis in the global economy, which he attributed to the shortsightedness of Western elites. According to Putin, they are trying to cling to global power while it slips from their hands. Here are some of the key points Putin made in his address. Western dominance is dwindling The world is facing serious economic challenges, and unlike the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the current turmoil is the result of conscious decisions made by Western nations, Putin said. The West caught “sanctions fever” as it sought to impose its will on other nations.According to the president, though this is nothing new, the current situation is marked by special circumstances – the US is losing its dominance in the global economy and politics, a “tectonic shift” that Western elites are not willing to acknowledge. Elites are ‘lashing out’ “Western nations want to preserve the old world order, which benefits only them, to make everyone follow the ‘rules’ they invented themselves and which they regularly break or change to their benefit,” Putin said.Resistance from other nations “makes Western elites to ‘lash out’ and take shortsighted cavalier decisions affecting world security, politics, and economics” he added. Western leaders are ‘detached’ from their people The policies adopted by the leaders of the US and its allies run counter to the public’s interests, which they are supposed to protect – this shows the Western elites are “detached from their own people,” according to Putin.EU governments are a good example – they decided to decouple their economies from Russia, denying their businesses affordable energy and access to the Russian market, which makes them unable to compete, he said. Putin predicted that American companies would lead the charge to capture the market shares of businesses based in the EU as a result. “When [the Americans] pursue their interests, they don’t limit themselves or shy away from anything.” The West deceives poor nations The global economic crisis will hurt vulnerable nations worst of all, according to the president – for many people, it’s a life-and-death situation, as impoverished countries will have no ability to buy crucial products.Meanwhile, Western nations pretend they want to help while only doing what is in their own interests, as exemplified by the Ukraine grain export deal, according to Putin. Russia agreed to help ships loaded with grain to leave Ukrainian ports under an arrangement mediated by Turkey and the UN in July. However, most of the ships have gone to EU nations rather than struggling countries, the president said. “Just two ships out of 87 were loaded [in Ukraine] under the UN Food Program, which works to provide assistance to needy countries… just 3% that were sent to developing nations.”According to Putin, Western nations have decades and even centuries of experience in plundering colonies, and are using the same approach today. In order to prevent humanitarian disasters, Russia suggests limiting the destinations for Ukrainian grain to change the situation. Russia is weathering the sanctions Russia is dealing with the damage caused by the West’s “economic, financial and technological aggression” relatively well, Putin said. He noted that the country’s financial system had been stabilized, inflation is going down, and unemployment is at record lows.Some companies were indeed hurt, especially those whose business depended on Europe in some way, he said. The Russian government has mechanisms in place to support them. Asian nations want cooperation Most of the nations in the Asia-Pacific Region (APAC) reject “the destructive logic of sanctions” and seek to foster business ties and economic growth for the benefit of their people, Putin said. Russia appreciates players that share its attitude to national sovereignty. The abundance of countries like this in APAC is “its great competitive advantage” and a source of long-term development. Russia did not start the conflict in Ukraine When asked by the host for comments on how the crisis in Ukraine has affected Russia, he reiterated Moscow’s position that the conflict was forced upon it.“We did not start anything in terms of military action. We are trying to end it. Military action was started in 2014, following an armed coup in Ukraine by those who did not want normal development and sought to subjugate their own people, carrying out one military action after another, and subjecting Donbass citizens to genocide for eight years.” Russia decided to use military force eight years later. Doing so was a moral obligation to the people of Donbass, who Moscow could not protect through peaceful means, Putin said. In the end, Russia will emerge from the conflict stronger domestically and internationally, he added.",1.3123723808689736,1.4531807236759857,-0.14080834280701215,8

When asked about what Russia has gained and lost as a result of the military campaign launched in late February, Putin stated that Russia has not and will not lose anything. Instead, it has only strengthened its sovereignty, he claimed. “Yes, there is a certain polarization going on both in the world and within the country, but I believe this will only work to our benefit. Because everything unnecessary, harmful and preventing us from moving forward will be rejected,” Putin said, adding that Russia will inevitably “pick up the pace of development,” which he says can only be based on sovereignty. “All our steps are aimed at strengthening our sovereignty,” the Russian leader proclaimed. He went on to point out that he doesn’t consider Russia’s activities in Ukraine to be the beginning of the military action, but rather that the operation is Moscow’s attempt to end the hostilities in the region. “The military actions began in 2014 after the coup in Ukraine, when those who did not want peaceful development and sought to suppress their own people conducted one military operation after another and conducted genocide against the people of Donbas for eight years,” said Putin. Russia decided to carry out a mirror response after all attempts at a peaceful resolution to the conflict failed, he said, adding that Russia’s actions were “deliberate” and aimed at helping those who live in Donbas. “This is our duty and we will fulfill it to the end,” Putin stated, adding that “ultimately, this will lead to the strengthening of our country, both from within and from a foreign policy standpoint.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562342-russia-ukraine-grain-deal-exports/,Moscow sounds alarm over Ukrainian grain deal,"The grain deal with Ukraine which was supposed to allow Russia to deliver fertilizers and food products to global markets has failed to do so, Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, claimed on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters, Nebenzia revealed that not a single Russian vessel with grain has managed to leave port, despite an earlier UN- and Turkey-brokered agreement that unblocked Ukrainian grain shipments via the Black Sea in exchange for lifting restrictions on Russian exports of the product. The diplomat hinted that Russia could refuse to extend the deal, given that the provisions on its exports are not being fulfilled. “The agreement was concluded for four months. In other words, it ends in November. In a normal [situation], the deal should be extended. Given the results, or rather the lack of results, I do not rule out anything.” “We want to see the implementation of the Russian part of the agreement. So far, this hasn’t happened,” Nebenzia said. His comments echo earlier remarks from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who said on Tuesday that Western countries had not fulfilled their promise to lift secondary restrictions on Russian grain and fertilizers, impeding their access to the global market. The deal to unblock grain exports via the Black Sea was signed at UN-brokered talks in Istanbul in late July, aiming to maintain safe transit routes. In late August, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said there “are no problems” with Ukrainian grain shipments, adding that dozens of vessels have been able to pass through. Wheat deliveries from Ukraine, a major producer, were disrupted after Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring state in late February. The two sides traded accusations over who was responsible for the stoppage of cargo traffic out of the Ukrainian ports.

Asked by TASS whether Truss will be a disaster for Britain, Zakharova replied that if “shop owners are decorating the window in this way, then they believe this is the best item they have in stock today.” Sometimes, the spokeswoman claimed, countries with large populations and long-standing democratic traditions make you wonder if they really do not have anyone that can “adequately, professionally, and intelligently represent the various branches of government.” Perhaps the problem is in the crisis of British democracy, because this ‘result’ has nothing to do with the direct choice of the British people, since the system of indirect elections dominates the Anglo-Saxon duo. Truss, formerly the foreign secretary in Boris Johnson’s Conservative government, officially became prime minister on Tuesday. The day before, she was revealed as the winner of the Tory leadership election. She received 81,326 voters, while her competitor, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, was backed by 60,399. A YouGov poll published on the same day showed that half of the people in the UK are ‘disappointed’ about Truss taking over as prime minister, with one-third ‘very disappointed.’ Even among members of the ruling party, 54% do not have much confidence in Truss’ ability to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, and around one-third are ‘disappointed’ that she will lead the government. Truss’ visit to Russia in February – amid tensions in Ukraine in the run-up to the launch of Moscow’s military operation – was remembered by many for a gaffe made by the then-foreign secretary. Truss confused the Russian regions of Voronezh and Rostov with Ukrainian regions, and told her counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that London would never recognize Russia’s sovereignty over these areas. According to reports, she was then allegedly corrected by Deborah Bronnert, the UK ambassador. Lavrov described the meeting with the foreign secretary as talking “to a deaf person.” Zakharova later mocked what she called the “mind-blowing stupidity” of Truss.",2.5772821528250587,3.281460267995313,-0.7041781151702544,8

The unfolding global economic crisis was triggered by “Western elites, who would not, or even cannot acknowledge objective facts” about global changes, he said during a speech at an economic event in Russia on Wednesday. Leaders in the US and their allies are seeking to preserve “the world order that benefits only them, forcing everyone to live under the rules, which they invented and which they regularly break and constantly change depending on the situation,” he added. Facing opposition from nations that don’t want to bend to their will, the US and its allies “lash out” and take shortsighted decisions that hurt not only the dissenters, but also their own nations, Putin stated, noting a “growing detachment” of Western elites from the common people. The Russian president cited surging inflation in the EU as the most telling example, noting that standards of living in the bloc were being sacrificed to American interests. “The EU authorities are denying European businesses accessible raw materials, energy and markets” by the decision to decouple from Russia, Putin said. It will be no surprise when the market shares of European businesses, both in the continent and globally, will be taken by their American patrons. When they pursue their interests, they don’t limit themselves or shy away from anything. Meanwhile Russia, the target of Western “sanctions fever” and other forms of unfair competition, is doing relatively well, Putin said. The country enjoys a relatively low level of inflation that is going down, record-low unemployment and other factors of macroeconomic stability, he commented. Sure, Russian businesses that depended on the EU were hurt, but overall, the country managed to deal with the Western “aggression”, Putin said.

2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562332-west-deceived-poor-nations-grain-putin/,West deceived poor nations with Ukraine grain deal – Putin,"Western nations lied when they claimed Ukraine needed access to sea shipping to alleviate surging food prices and the risk of famine in poor countries, Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted. Most of the cargoes that came out of Ukraine under a Turkey- and UN-brokered deal with Russia went to the EU, Putin stated in a speech at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia on Wednesday. He added that he terms of the arrangement should probably be changed. Putin made the remarks in reference to the arrangement allowing civilian ships to enter and leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports to deliver grain cargoes. The scheme was put into action in late July, with Turkey hosting a center that coordinates the deliveries. The Russian leader noted that the deal was touted as a way to curb the surging global prices and help the most struggling nations. In practice, almost all of the grain shipped from Ukraine went to wealthy EU nations, he said. Many European nations acted in decades and centuries past as colonizers, and they act in the same way today. They simply deceived developing nations once again. And they keep up the deceit. With an attitude like this, problems with food availability will only grow worse, Putin warned. On August 30, the UN Food Program reported that it had sent a second shipment with food assistance from Ukraine. The ship was carrying 37,000 metric tons of wheat grain to Yemen. Putin stressed that just two ships out of more than 80 that left Ukraine were actually traveling on hunger relief missions. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Western nations of failing to remove secondary restrictions on the export of food and fertilizers from Russia after the Ukraine deal was reached. The UN, which co-signed the agreement with Turkey, pledged to use its clout to have the restrictions lifted. The economic forum hosted by Russia is an annual event focused on regional cooperation in Asia.

2022-09-07,https://www.rt.com/russia/562079-ukraine-military-coup/,"Alexander Nepogodin: As the media speculates about plots to oust Zelensky, how secure is Ukraine's Western-backed leader?","As fighting rages on in Ukraine, President Vladimir Zelensky seems determined to consolidate power. It's part of a process that began long before Russia launched its military offensive in February. The Western-backed leader has suppressed criticism and clamped down on the opposition; beyond that, he is purging the political arena of allegedly ‘disloyal’ people who, until recently, had appeared to be close associates and allies. For example not long ago, Prosecutor-General Irina Venediktova and the head of Ukraine’s Security Service Ivan Bakanov, a childhood friend of Zelensky, were both fired from their posts. However, it appears that the president remains deeply vulnerable to political intrigues within the country’s elites. In light of recent developments, both Western and Ukrainian media often claim Kiev's military is dissatisfied with the situation in the country. Journalists have even named a possible post-conflict successor to the ‘Ukrainian Churchill,’ as Zelensky is sometimes called – namely, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Valery Zaluzhny. Zelensky himself dismisses these claims as speculation, an attempt to promote hostile narratives and ‘rock the boat.’ Here, RT explores the reasons behind the escalating tensions between Zelensky and Zaluzhny, and explains why Ukraine appears to be drifting toward dictatorship. There's a rumor circulating in the media that Zelensky is willing to remove Zaluzhny. The Telegraph portal speculates that he will probably be replaced by Commander of the Ground Forces Alexander Syrsky. Meanwhile, Zaluzhny, whose popularity with the Ukrainian people is growing rapidly, is likely to be appointed minister of defense, the story goes. Formally, this would be a promotion for the incumbent commander-in-chief, but in reality it means losing control and influence over the army, because, according to Ukrainian law, the minister of defense must be a civilian. Another possible, widely publicized, scenario is that the current Minister of Defense, Aleksey Reznikov, will head the government while Zaluzhny takes over defense and the present Chief of Defense Intelligence, Kirill Budanov, will replace Zaluzhny as commander-in-chief. The Telegraph suggests the motive behind such potential machinations is jealousy. “It’s not about ratings. Zelensky and Zaluzhny have perfectly fine relations, but you see, the victory can only be ‘fathered’ by one man,” a Ukrainian MP told the news portal. Zaluzhny reportedly doesn’t welcome any such changes but despite this, rotations in the country’s military leadership could take place as early as this month. A conflict between the Ukrainian president and his military commanders has become a topic for discussion in Russia as well. In response to projections in several Western media outlets about conflict-resolution scenarios, the Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev shared his own vision of the situation. He believes there is but a “one and a half scenario” – “a military coup in Ukraine followed by recognition of the special operation’s results.” Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has recently joined the chorus of voices discussing a possible conflict between Zelensky and Ukraine’s top military commanders led by Zaluzhny. “Ukraine is being carved up, and a conflict is brewing between the president and the military. They are the only ones who can slam their fists on the table and say, ‘Let’s reach agreement, otherwise Ukraine will be wiped off from the face of the earth.’ The outcome is close. The president can’t say a word there any longer, nothing depends on the president in Ukraine now, but on the military,” Lukashenko said. Both Zelensky and Zaluzhny deny the existence of any conflict between them. Ukraine’s administration asserts that these rumors are nothing more than hostile propaganda, deliberately spread to sow dissent within the country’s top military apparatus. Zelensky himself has publicly stated that Zaluzhny and the team are doing their job well. “No, I have no plans to reassign him to a different position (...). We’ve got a team. Is the team doing its job well? As you can see, we are still holding strong. So, yes, they are doing a good job. And once we are victorious, I’ll be the first to praise them,” said Zelensky in response to a question from the media. The press interpreted these statements in their own way: rumors quickly began to spread that Zelensky had refused to replace Zaluzhny, fearing a blow to his own reputation. Many believe that the Ukrainian President's Office wants to suppress the narrative about Zaluzhny becoming a viable opponent to Zelensky, an ‘inconvenient’ ally. Essentially, Zelensky wants to create a scenario in which his top military man could be removed from the political scene: it is much harder to fire Zaluzhny when his name is all over the internet. Ironically, it could be social media that ‘insures’ the commander-in-chief against a potential discharge. Curiously, speculation about the conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny is blamed not on external, but domestic forces. Back in early August, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) uncovered a clandestine ‘bot farm’ involved in domestic propaganda, which the media linked to affiliates of former President Pyotr Poroshenko. One of its media campaigns was said to be aimed at “spreading information about a conflict between the leadership of the Office of the President of Ukraine and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine”. It was alleged that there was also a campaign to discredit the First Lady. In light of these findings, an adviser to Zelensky, Aleksey Arestovich, accused the opposition, and specifically the European Solidarity party run by Poroshenko, of pursuing its own political ambitions that would “drag Ukraine again into a political crisis that will lead to a military defeat.” According to Arestovich, media operations run by the ‘bot farmers’ slowed down weapons deliveries to Ukraine and promoted the narrative of a brewing conflict between Zelensky and Zaluzhny. “The people in the opposition fail to realize that this sort of work could cost more for Ukraine than direct attacks by Russian troops. A lack of unity between the government and the army, between the government and the people, is a sure path toward statelessness and defeat (...). This is a purely domestic hoax, circulated in the media since April or so. Russian propaganda has picked up these fakes and spun them to their advantage. They benefit from advancing this narrative,” he said. Whatever the case, as open hostilities continue in Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny finds his popularity steadily growing, and not only among Ukrainians. Recently, major stories have been published in Western media glorifying the man, calling him ‘the iron general’; they also predict that he could take over as president after Zelensky. The German newspaper Bild, for example, published an article saying that “the general gives Ukraine hope” and is a hero not only for the soldiers, but also for a large part of the population. “Observers believe that the acclaimed general will replace current President Vladimir Zelensky once the war is over,” writes Bild. The newspaper also hints at potential tensions between the president and the general, noting that “incumbent President Zelensky is not particularly happy about the speculations that he may one day leave the presidential residence.” Bild is not the only Western media outlet to have praised Zaluzhny. Earlier, the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza published an extensive piece about the general, calling him “the first ataman (meaning ‘chieftain’) of Ukraine.” Essentially, the newspaper bestowed on him the title once held by Semyon Petliura – head of the Directorate of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in 1919-1920 and an ally to the Poles. “If Michelangelo were to carve a figure of General Zaluzhny based on his publications on the Internet, the result would be a mix between David and Moses,” the newspaper writes, noting that ordinary Ukrainians view the general as a celebrity figure. While glorifying Zaluzhny, Western media started to pillory Zelensky. A series of articles were published bashing the president. The German newspaper Die Welt, The New York Times, Sky News Australia all accused Ukraine’s president of being uncooperative in the international arena, of abetting corruption within Ukraine, exhausting the country's armed forces, and launching a ‘draconian’ mobilization effort. Amid all this, Zaluzhny became more and more concerned with his own political image. As Bild published its complimentary article about the general, he released a lengthy video message to his compatriots in celebration of Ukraine’s Independence Day – at the same time as Zelensky published his own address to the nation. The video consisted of Zaluzhny’s quotes interspersed with lines from Ukraine’s servicemen. “How do you know you are truly independent?” asks Zaluzhny. “Our independence was gifted to us. Real independence is earned in blood,” answers a soldier in the video. “Those who fight for it know what it tastes like. It tastes of earth, of blood and death that permeates the air,” Zaluzhny says. The soldiers in the video talk about the importance of unity for the sake of victory; they talk about strength, resilience and of their willingness to defend their homeland. As rumors spread about the removal of Zaluzhny, Ukrainian media has become flooded with reports of an imminent reshuffle in the government. High-ranking sources of the popular Strana.ua (banned by Zelensky) claim that, although the Office of the President of Ukraine has not yet finalized the list of new appointments, they are expecting some high-profile resignations: there is a strong possibility that some ministers will be fired and even [Prime Minister] Denis Shmigal’s government will be dissolved. Back in late July, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Alexei Danilov announced that firing Venediktova and Bakanov was just the beginning. “I’ve heard some names, but I prefer to work with actual documents. Most likely, these were not the only people to be removed, and we will see some more developments soon,” Danilov commented. Removing Bakanov and Venediktova was the most high-profile sacking since the start of the military operation. Zelensky said his decision was motivated by the large number of traitors in the SBU and the prosecutor-general’s office. According to the president, more than sixty SBU agents remained in territories occupied by Russian troops and started working against Ukraine’s interests. Overall, local law enforcers are investigating hundreds of cases of alleged treason and collaborationism. One of the loudest investigations is against the former head of the SBU Crimea Office, based in Kherson, which Ukraine lost control of back in March. Local government spokesman Aleksandr Samoilenko accused the branch of treason, saying its officers had betrayed Ukraine by revealing a network of minefields to Russia and providing assistance to its air force. Similar charges were brought against former SBU internal security chief General Andrey Naumov, who fled Ukraine but was detained in Serbia in June. Bakanov and Zelensky were partners in a television production studio, Kvartal 95. He later headed Zelensky’s electoral staff and was the leader of his party Servant of the People. Venediktova had been Zelensky’s ally well before his presidency and also headed Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigation. However, it seems that even close personal connections to the president could not help the two avoid the boot. At the same time, the SBU launched a criminal investigation into former deputy secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Major General Sergey Krivonos, recently criticized by Zelensky for commenting on the military leadership. Notably, Krivonos is a somewhat popular figure in Ukraine. Back in 2019, he registered as candidate for the presidency, but he later withdrew in favor of Poroshenko. Krivonos believes the persecution against him was ordered by Zelensky, on account of the major-general’s popularity, especially with the military. “The top leadership of the SBU were frank about it when they told me: Supreme Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Zelensky issued an illegal order to revoke my enlistment into the military so as to prevent Valery Zaluzhny from appointing me to senior positions. Zelensky views me as a rival. Before the war, I was dismissed from the army over my criticism of Zelensky’s inaction in the defense sphere and the failure of the Office of the President and the Ministry of Defense to prepare Ukraine for Russian aggression,” Krivonos claimed. He said that in the early days of Russia’s military operation, Zaluzhny had verbally instructed him to defend Kiev’s Zhuliany airport and then issued a personal order confirming Krivonos’s authority to do so. But in late March, it turned out that the order to enlist Krivonos had been canceled. “I found out from the army leadership that this was done by order of Commander-in-Chief Zelensky. My sources told me plainly: ‘The people at the top believe that victory is at hand, and that after the war there should be only one war hero – the Supreme Commander. He thinks you will get in his way,’” Krivonos said. However, so far, Zelensky’s popularity, having now firmly established his image as the ‘Ukrainian Churchill,’ continues to remain high: more than 90% of Ukrainians trust him. Moreover, the country’s population is not against bolstering authoritarian tendencies. According to a survey from the Kiev International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), 58% of Ukrainians believe that having a strong leader is more important for the country than democracy. Only 14% of respondents think democracy is still more important. At the same time, 62% of respondents say that, in the current situation, even constructive criticism of the Ukrainian government should not be allowed, and all parties and political forces should unite to support Zelensky. All this provides Zelensky with great opportunities for consolidating power – a trend that began long before the outbreak of hostilities. The process of tightening the screws began back in 2020, when pressure was brought to bear on political opponents, and continued with bans on media outlets outside of the government's control, including pro-Russian ones. This was accompanied by a campaign against shadow economic elites and organized crime gangs, as well as various kinds of smugglers. Then Zelensky began to mop up potential internal challengers. This is evidenced, for example, by the resignation of Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, in the fall of 2021. In parallel, all of Zelensky’s key opponents in government have had problems with law enforcement agencies. These include Yulia Tymoshenko, Pyotr Poroshenko, Vitali Klitschko, Viktor Medvedchuk, and Anatoly Shariy. In October of 2021, Dmitry Razumkov was removed from his post as Speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada. There were strategic motives behind this move from the very beginning, namely, eliminating competitors for Zelensky’s second term. Razumkov could have become a potential ‘new Zelensky,’ or might at least have split the current team during new presidential elections. It was Razumkov who had long been second inside the party in power, in terms of ratings and position in the political system. Personal relationships also play a part in this situation. During the last year before his dismissal, Razumkov refrained from supporting the decisions of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (NSDC), the president’s advisory agency, and, instead, came out with his own initiatives on key issues: The Constitutional Court of Ukraine, land reform, illegal enrichment, and de-oligarchization. In other words, Razumkov had his own position and proposals, and they were often the ones that passed through parliament, and not ones Zelensky wanted to accept. This ended up spoiling their relationship. The campaign against the opposition has led to significant changes in Ukraine’s political processes, with the center of power shifting towards the executive branch and even the law enforcement sector. In particular, most decision-making authority has moved to one specific body – the NSDC – whose composition Zelensky personally determines and whose decisions are put into effect by his decree. And thanks to the law ‘On Sanctions,’ which allows economic restrictions to be imposed on any Ukrainian considered a threat to ‘national security,’ the NSDC’s powers have become nearly limitless. All accounts and assets of a person falling under such sanctions are blocked, and it becomes impossible for them to conduct financial activities. If we add to this the draft law ‘On Media,’ according to which even unregistered media outlets that distribute objectionable information are subject to blocking, a curious picture emerges. Zelensky is rigidly and uncompromisingly centralizing power, and decisions bypass the existing – albeit not ideal, but functioning – legal system. And in this sense, the answer to the question of what changes may occur in Ukraine’s top echelons of power during Russia’s military operation is unambiguous. Anything is possible. After all, as the history of Zelensky’s relations with his inner circle demonstrates, the Ukrainian president believes that he is the sole power in the country – he is the team, and others are just his assistants. All this resulted in an internal political crisis back in 2021. The fact that the West’s honeymoon with Zelensky appears to be nearly over also increases the likelihood that a large-scale crisis looms on the horizon, at a crucial moment for Ukraine as an independent country. There has been more and more criticism of Zelensky as of late, and the search for new heroes has become more active. Another power struggle likely lies ahead.",3.3292079306566,4.8596768895661935,-1.5304689589095934,5

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi personally led a team of inspectors to the Russian-held facility last week, and witnessed an artillery attack firsthand. However, the IAEA report on the visit, published earlier on Tuesday, made no mention of who was shelling the Zaporozhye NPP, even though the Ukrainian General Staff has publicly admitted to targeting nearby Energodar. “I cannot make that determination,” Grossi told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “We do not have the means to do that. As you know, you would need to be looking or monitoring the military operation in the region and all its vastness, which is not only beyond the mandate of the IAEA, but would require enormous capabilities.” Nebenzia, who has previously provided evidence of Ukrainian culpability to the UN, said the watchdog’s reluctance was regrettable. He also noted that Kiev made a “monstrous attempt” to capture the power plant during the IAEA team’s visit. Grossi’s proposal to demilitarize Zaporozhye is “not serious,” Nebenzia told journalists in New York, explaining that Russian troops are providing security to the plant and withdrawing them would allow Ukraine to seize it. “It is not militarized, anyway,” the Russian envoy to the UN said, adding that “there is no artillery there, only trucks used to transport the guards” who protect the facility. The IAEA report mentioned this as well. UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres has called on both Kiev and Moscow to “not engage in military activities” in and around the nuclear power plant. Grossi told CNN he wasn’t calling for “demilitarization” but something “more modest,” calling it a “nuclear safety and security protection zone” that would get a “commitment from all sides to avoid any aiming at the plant, any shelling at the plant.” Russian troops secured Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in early March, and it functioned normally until mid-July, when Moscow says Ukrainian forces began attacking it with drones and US-supplied artillery. Kiev had claimed that Russia was staging false-flag attacks to make Ukraine look bad, while stationing heavy weapons inside the facility.

Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that would never join any Western military bloc.

The commitment was part of a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey and signed in Istanbul in July to unblock Ukraine’s grain exports and ease a looming global food crisis. Lavrov stressed that “artificially inflated” Western claims that Russian actions in Ukraine had undermined the stability of the global food market are “absolutely not the case.” “On the contrary, our Western colleagues are not doing what we were promised by the UN secretary general, namely, they are not making a decision to remove logistical sanctions that prevent free access of Russian grain and fertilizers to world markets,” the minister pointed out at a joint press conference with his Thai counterpart, Don Pramudwinai.

The agency’s report on the situation in Ukraine, published on Tuesday, stopped short of identifying the culprits targeting the Russian-held facility. “Any military activity – such as shelling – within, or in the vicinity of, a nuclear facility has the potential to cause an unacceptable radiological consequence,” the IAEA report said, adding that the “seven pillars” of nuclear safety “have all been compromised at the site.” “The IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities, for the safety of the operating staff and to maintain the physical integrity to support safe and secure operation,” the agency said, adding that this would require “agreement by all relevant parties to the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP.” Zaporozhye is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Along with the nearby city of Energodar, it has been under Russian control since March. Artillery, drone, and rocket attacks began in July, however, damaging cooling systems, power lines, and other facilities. The Russian military has named the specific Ukrainian artillery units carrying out the attacks and provided their locations to the UN. Kiev has accused Moscow of using the plant as a base for heavy artillery and equipment, but also denied responsibility for the shelling, calling it a Russian false-flag operation to make Ukraine look bad. Last week, however, the Ukrainian General Staff admitted to targeting Energodar and claimed that all Russian “military equipment” had been relocated from the ZNPP ahead of the IAEA’s visit. The inspectors contradicted this, saying they had observed Russian “military personnel, vehicles and equipment at various places at the ZNPP,” providing security. Kiev and its Western backers had previously demanded the establishment of a 30-kilometer demilitarized zone around the Zaporozhye NPP, but Moscow rejected this as unacceptable, pointing to continued Ukrainian artillery attacks on the site. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi personally led the mission to Zaporozhye, dubbed ISAMZ, on September 2. The facility came under artillery attack during the visit, while Ukrainian commandos attempted to seize the plant after crossing the Kakhovka Reservoir by boat, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.",6.425156097588837,3.5626145683973953,2.8625415291914416,9

The official explained that Ukrainian strikes targeting a thermal power plant in the city of Energodar hit a fuel oil tank, which leaked into a channel supplying water to the Zaporozhye NPP. He stated that specialists are now working in the area to stop the leak. Energodar officials also said that Kiev’s forces continue to carry out strikes on the plant despite the presence of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors at the facility. The UN’s nuclear watchdog visited the Zaporozhye NPP last week to conduct an inspection of the plant and assess its condition. After being shown the facility and conducting interviews with both Russian and Ukrainian personnel on the ground, the delegation left the facility on Monday leaving behind two of its members. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said the agency would “establish a continued presence” at the plant. While Grossi has publicly confirmed that the power plant had been damaged as a result of shelling, he has so far refrained from assigning blame to any one side. A report by the agency is expected to be published on Tuesday. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev’s forces of attacking the plant, warning that further shelling could trigger a nuclear catastrophe on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Kiev, however, denies targeting the plant and insists that it is Russian forces that are shelling the area while stationing military hardware there.",5.286754229377297,5.164503841532684,0.12225038784461262,9
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562302-putin-donbass-visit-peskov/,Kremlin explains when Putin could visit Donbass,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will certainly pay a visit to Donbass, but the date for such a trip hasn’t been set yet, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov has said. “As for the president's trip [to the People’s Republics of Donetsk (DPR) and Lugansk (LPR)], I have no doubts that when the right time comes such a visit will take place,” Peskov told the newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday. He also said that Moscow has “vast plans” in terms of rebuilding Donbass, which has ended up being the main battlefield in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “You can see that construction is underway, and new facilities are being commissioned. Vigorous efforts are being undertaken in order to restore all essential utility systems. Those are water pipelines, energy supply, social facilities. Hard work is underway, and many many thousands of people are involved in it,” the spokesman pointed out. The most high-ranking officials from Moscow to visit Donbass so far have been Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, who inspected the Russian troops in both the DPR and LPR in July, and parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who traveled to Lugansk the same month with a group of MPs. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

The war games have involved over 50,000 servicemen, including more than 2,000 visiting troops. A total of 15 nations are taking part in the drills, which are being held between September 1 and 7 in Russia’s Far East. The exercise includes general staff training for military commanders and maneuvers in the field for troops. Nine of the foreign participants have sent soldiers to train alongside the Russian forces. The main goal of the high-profile event is “to create a coalition force that would plan and implement a special military operation aimed at ensuring peace and security in the region,” Major General Vladimir Omelyanovich said on Tuesday, according to a video released by Zvezda TV, the official media outlet of the Russian Defense Ministry. Gen. Omelyanovich, who served as the head of the general staff of the coalition force, complimented all members for doing their jobs in a timely and professional manner. “Despite quite difficult weather conditions, all military contingents taking part in the strategic exercise acted laudably and completed their tasks in full,” the senior official told journalists against the backdrop of a downpour of cold rain. Vostok 2022 is part of a series of exercises that the Russian military stages each year in various parts of the country. This year’s event involved a large number of foreign participants.

It’s being waged in hybrid forms, in all areas,” the diplomat said, apparently referring to the lavish military and financial aid provided to Ukraine by the US, EU and other countries amid its conflict with Russia, as well as the harsh sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West. “The degree of animosity of our opponents – of our enemies – is enormous, extraordinary,” Ryabkov pointed out. Moscow has warned on many occasions that foreign help to Kiev only escalates the fighting in Ukraine and puts Russia on a collision course with the US-led NATO bloc. However, the deputy FM offered the reminder that “Russia has always, throughout its history, proved that it passes the most difficult trials with honor and emerges from them even stronger.” According to Ryabkov, “this will be case this time as well.”",3.868490576380476,1.6359647496128302,2.232525826767646,8

Nor would he link Biden’s statement to the recent visit of inspectors from the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency to the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. Two US senators – Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) – had previously urged Biden to endorse such a move in order to ramp up pressure on Moscow. The status would entail, among other things, certain controls over exports of dual-use items, and a number of financial restrictions. Only four countries are currently designated as state sponsors of terrorism: North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and Syria. Moscow has warned that such a step would mark “a point of no return” in relations between the two countries. In August, Aleksandr Darichev, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s North American Department, signaled that the label would entail “the most serious collateral damage for bilateral relations, up to downgrading of their level and even severance of all ties.” The US State Department is also apparently against the idea. In August, Politico reported that the agency quietly approached congressional offices, warning that the designation could derail the Ukrainian grain deal and impact Washington’s remaining economic ties with Moscow.",2.556484357826709,2.051414314348303,0.5050700434784061,8
2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562276-bastion-exercise-kuril-islands/,Russia showcases freshly-deployed anti-ship missiles (VIDEO),"Russia’s Bastion anti-ship missile system has now been used in a live-fire exercise on the Far Eastern island of Matua, the Defense Ministry has reported. The system was tested during recent drills on an island chain that has long been the center of a territorial dispute with Japan. Matua is part of the Kuril Archipelago, a group of islands stretching from Russia’s Kamchatka to the Japanese island of Hokkaido. Last December, the Russian Defense Ministry reported boosting anti-ship defenses in the area with Bastion launchers stationed on Matua. Tuesday’s training exercise was the first time they were reported to have been used. According to the synopsis of the exercise released by the Defense Ministry, the launchers were moved into attack positions to fire at a simulated foreign warship that had violated Russian territorial waters in an attempt to land troops on one of the Kuril Islands. Once the ship moved “into a critical range,” it was engaged with an Oniks missile, which Bastion launchers carry. The Matua drill was part of the multilateral Vostok 2022 strategic military exercise. Asian powerhouses India and China are among the participants of the Russia-hosted military maneuvers. Japan contests Russian territorial claims to the four Kuril Islands that are located closest to its territory. The dispute, which stems from World War II, is the reason why Russia and Japan never signed a peace treaty. Moscow has previously ruled out relinquishing the islands to Japan, with one of the considerations being that Tokyo could militarize them. The long-running diplomatic spat was exacerbated this year after Japan joined the US in imposing anti-Russian sanctions over its operation in Ukraine. This week, Moscow scrapped a 1999 agreement with Tokyo that had allowed Japanese citizens to visit two of the disputed islands under a simplified procedure. The Russian Foreign Ministry also reported a full suspension of talks on the status of the islands and on projects to develop them economically together with Japan.",3.7609962583111156,2.7673654124840357,0.99363084582708,6

Johnson, who led his party to a landslide election victory in 2019, stepped down as Conservative leader on July 7 after more than 50 members of Parliament resigned from his government within 48 hours. It followed a series of high-profile scandals. Already on shaky ground over the parties held at Downing Street in violation of Covid-19 rules, the prime minister had no other option but to resign after it was revealed that he had appointed as his deputy chief whip an MP with a known record of alleged sexual misconduct. Speaking before a crowd of journalists and officials, Johnson listed what he considers to be the main achievements of his tenure, including supplying weapons to Ukraine, which he said: “may very well have helped change the course of the biggest European war for 80 years.” “We have and will continue to have that economic strength to give people the cash they need to get through this energy crisis that has been caused by Putin’s vicious war,” he added. Moscow has argued that the skyrocketing energy prices were caused by the sanctions on Russia and other policies of Western leaders, rather than the military operation in Ukraine. Johnson promised that the “compassionate Conservative government” of his successor will take all possible measures to get the country through the crisis, adding: “And if Putin thinks that he can succeed by blackmailing or bullying the British people, then he is utterly deluded.” Thank you Boris. pic.twitter.com/iNZxWK0u7N The outgoing prime minister, who will formally offer his resignation to Queen Elizabeth later today, hinted at the forced nature of his resignation, but offered “the most fervent support” to Truss’ government, while calling on fellow Tories to do the same – giving the example of his dog Dilyn and Downing Street cat Larry. “And I’ll just say to my party: if Dilyn and Larry can put behind them their occasional difficulties, then so can the Conservative Party,” Johnson said. Regarding future plans, Johnson said he is “like one of those booster rockets that has fulfilled its function.” The speech was followed by a storm of applause which continued until Johnson and his wife Carrie left Downing Street by car.",3.011253743572333,2.682470274785125,0.3287834687872082,8

Nobody needs a meeting for the sake of a meeting,” Peskov pointed out in an interview with Izvestia newspaper on Tuesday. For Putin and Zelensky to get together or “for the very idea of such a meeting to be on the agenda, a lot of work needs to be done and the foundation for those agreements that can be formalized at the highest level needs to be laid,” he said. “There’s no talk about it at the moment,” the Kremlin spokesman clarified, referring to the meeting of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. Peskov spoke on the same issue on Sunday, telling the Rossiya 1 TV channel that Moscow was ready to talk with Zelensky only “on how our demands are going to be fulfilled” by Kiev. As for Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, it’s “running its course; all of its goals will be achieved,” he assured.

2022-09-06,https://www.rt.com/russia/562217-gorby-report/,'My grandmother used to pray to him on TV': Russia's muted farewell to Mikhail Gorbachev,"Mikhail Gorbachev, the first and last president of the Soviet Union, died at the age of 91 last week. On Saturday, his farewell ceremony was held in Moscow. One of the last political giants of the last century, Gorbachev was a symbol of his era, but reaction to his death revealed the controversial nature of his legacy. He was given only some elements of a state funeral, and Hungary's prime minister was the sole Western leader to attend his farewell. Even in the Russian capital of around 20 million people, only a few hundred went to say goodbye in person. RT explains how an uncomfortable symbol of a long gone era was sent on his final journey. Many passed by the open casket containing Gorbachev’s body: Hundreds of ordinary Russians, individual celebrities from the country’s politics and culture, and ambassadors from EU states and the US. Gorbachev’s supporters, long since departed from politics, did not view his physical departure as a disaster – but symbolically, his farewell was still an opportunity to recall the end of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the new Russian state. Hundreds of people stood in line to say goodbye to Gorbachev. Perhaps, some of the excitement was due to the fact that the most recent funeral of someone of his stature was held as many as 15 years ago. Then, at the age of 76 and in the same Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow, the first president of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, died. However, it can hardly be said that the majority of post-Soviet Russians view Mikhail Gorbachev positively. Local government from Gorbachev’s home region of Stavropol, where he served as head for almost ten years, did not find it necessary to commemorate their compatriot on a large scale. Only in the village of Privolnoye, Gorbachev's birthplace, was a mourning portrait placed in the local administration building. Those gathered in the center of the capital on that weekend morning repeated to journalists and each other that they were uniting around common Perestroika values, remembering their lost youth, or an alternative future “according to Gorbachev,” which had not come to pass. Of course, the figure of the last general secretary himself was also important – primarily symbolically. The general mood of those who came to say goodbye to Gorbachev seemed to be calm; it would be a stretch to call it gloomy. Gorbachev had long been absent from political life in the country, and his sympathizers had stopped counting on any return. Thirty years ago, however, hopes were still alive and well. In the early 1990s, Gorbachev hinted at unexpected scenarios in his biography: “Charles de Gaulle returned to rule the country when he was 68. And I am only 61.” In 1996, he ran for president – and received less than 1% of the vote. The farewell ceremony was held in the Hall of Columns. The building was erected in the first half of the 18th century for Prince V.M. Dolgoruky-Krymsky. After October 1917, noble balls and concerts by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Richard Strauss, and Franz Liszt were replaced by New Year’s parties for Soviet children and the World Congress of Soviet Friends. After the collapse of the Soviet state, the House of the Unions “had new directions of activity, corresponding to the course of democratic transformations in the Russian Federation.” Among the building's modern functions were funeral ceremonies. From the early hours of Saturday, September 3, people began lining up to say goodbye to Mikhail Gorbachev. The Moscow authorities introduced security measures and restricted pedestrian movement along some central city streets. To see the general secretary for the last time, a visitor had to wait their turn in the street, then go up the stairs of the former Noble Assembly House and walk among the three-tiered chandeliers and high columns of the solemnly decorated Column Hall. Slowly, one by one, people bade farewell to the politician – with and without flowers. His face could be seen a few yards from the symbolic fence. Those born after Gorbachev stepped down as president and those who experienced the ups and downs of Gorbachev’s rule in their teens also came to bid farewell. A 23-year-old political science student named Ivan said Gorbachev “did all the democratic stuff and stepped aside."" “I think on the whole it turned out pretty well. There were problems, and my parents told me a lot about them, and they told me today too, when I was going to say goodbye. They didn't discourage me, of course, I explained to them that it wasn't a demonstration or anything like that. But we disagreed with them on this subject. I have great respect for Gorbachev, first of all, for open borders, for freedom. Without him, we wouldn't have had it. And I travelled around the world with my parents thanks to his views, his steps. That is why I am here.” Alexei, a 50-year-old lawyer, spoke about the religious significance of Gorbachev to his family: “My grandmother used to pray to him on TV. And my great-grandmother used to cry on every anniversary of Stalin's death. In front of the same TV, by the way. They both didn't live to see it [the Soviet collapse], but I'm grateful to Gorbachev, of course. For what? I've lived and seen everything. I've been to a lot of places. It's that simple. We took this course at the time.” Ivan, Alexey and many others in the crowd would later learn that the US, German, British, and French ambassadors to Russia – John Sullivan, Geza Andreas von Geir, Deborah Bronnert, and Pierre Levy, respectively – also walked past the open casket of the last general secretary. The next day, Sullivan ended his tenure and left Moscow, apparently due to the death of a close family member. Saying goodbye to Gorbachev was apparently the last significant ceremony of the diplomat's Moscow tenure. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also laid flowers. Orban personally offered his condolences to Gorbachev’s family and later wrote that the politician was “needed by Central Europe to free itself from communism peacefully, without loss of life or bloodshed.” Orban was the only head of state at the ceremony. Neither Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Poland, nor any other country that gained independence as a result of Gorbachev's foreign policy, found it necessary to pay tribute to the man who stood at the origins of their freedom. Perhaps their current disagreements with Russia are far more important to them than Gorbachev's role in their history. Nor did leaders or representatives from post-Soviet states – from the Baltic and the Transcaucasus to Belarus and Central Asia, not to mention Ukraine – attend the funeral. These countries often speak negatively of the Soviet period, but they do not speak well of Gorbachev either. Of the foreigners, Germans were most interested in saying goodbye to Gorbachev – the last Soviet general secretary was personally responsible for the reunification of West and East Germany into a single state. There were many journalists at the ceremony from the country. In good Russian with a distinctive accent, they asked those attending what the last general secretary meant to them personally. Just two months before Gorbachev’s death, a letter to the Soviet president from Dresden was published on his foundation’s website. “I am writing to you to express my heartfelt gratitude for everything you have done for me, for the people of Germany and for the world.” The author of these words, Thomas Bottrich, born in the GDR in 1955, later “participated in church peace initiatives and in the 1980s wrote letters to Helmut Kohl and Erich Honecker, urging them to support the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Germany.” Bottrich was at first opposed to Kohl’s desire to unite Germany quickly, but he soon changed his mind. Gorbachev’s daughter Irina, who organized the funeral, also lives in Germany with her children. Sociologist Igor Chubais was born in Soviet-occupied East Berlin in 1947 and came to the funeral ceremony; Igor is the elder brother of the reformer, former finance minister, and former head of the Russian presidential administration, Anatoly Chubais, living in exile since the start of the conflict in Ukraine. Elena, a middle-aged Czech translator who attended the ceremony, says she essentially owes her profession to Gorbachev: “It so happened that when I entered MGIMO [a higher education institution that has trained staff for the Soviet and then Russian Foreign Ministry since the 1944], they didn’t ask us who wanted to learn what language. I was allocated Czech. Well, at that time it was quite prestigious and it was really possible to go there. Before the collapse [of the USSR] I visited three or four times. I studied the country’s history, regional studies, the history of our relations with them, everything as it should be. And we had different periods – something they loved us for, something they can remember us for. And they remembered me personally. Now there is hell in the sense of Russophobia – although you probably know about Theresienstadt [a Nazi concentration camp established in the Czech Republic in 1941], so they must understand once and for all that you must not behave this way. Nevertheless, Gorbachev somehow managed to reconcile us to the Czech Republic, at least temporarily. This is partly the reason why I translated a lot of things and achieved a lot in my narrow field. And I say thank you for that. I will lay flowers for him. Here’s the reason.” The Czechs themselves do not remember this rapprochement of their country with Russia – there were no representatives from Prague at the ceremony. Not far away, behind rows of reporters and cameramen, a woman in a wheelchair, the same age as Gorbachev, was hiding. Suzanne Massie, 91-years-old and a former adviser to the 40th president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, she is a longtime student of Russian history and no stranger to the personal and political relationships between the two leaders of the 1980s. Massie told RIA Novosti that Gorbachev “revealed to us [Americans] the Russians.” Less than a year ago, Massie herself became a Russian citizen. The procedure for burying state officials in Russia is regulated by several laws. Presidents of Russia and their Soviet equivalent should be buried with different honors. But if you look at it from the point of view that the Russian Federation is officially the legal successor of the USSR, there is technically no difference between Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev. In 2007, Yeltsin was bade farewell in the country’s main church, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. It was open for a whole day so that everyone who wished to say goodbye to the former president could do so –some 25,000 people. National mourning was declared, and the current president, Vladimir Putin, attended the funeral in person. There was nothing of the sort at Mikhail Gorbachev’s farewell. His farewell and funeral were far more modest than those of Evgeny Zinichev, the head of EMERCOM, who died last year, or even the opera singer Dmitry Hvorostovsky, who passed away in 2018. Perhaps this was again due to the ambiguous legacy of the first and last president of the USSR. There was no sign of President Putin at Gorbachev’s farewell – the Kremlin attributed this to his busy schedule. Nevertheless, Putin did find an opportunity to say goodbye to the Soviet president: Last Thursday, he stopped by the Central Clinical Hospital and laid flowers at his coffin before traveling to Kaliningrad Region. In Putin’s absence, the highest-ranking Russian politician who attended Gorbachev’s farewell service was former President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. At 11am on Saturday, Medvedev wrote on Telegram that Gorbachev’s funeral would take place that very day, but his post was not about him or about the “root causes of the collapse” of the USSR. Medvedev said: “For all the difference in assessments of the behaviour of the top leaders of the USSR and Russia at the time, it should be noted that they had the good sense not to allow the giant nuclear arsenal of the Union to be divided up by the newly formed national states. The consequences could have been swift and disastrous for our small earthly world. The entire strategic nuclear arsenal then remained in our country. And we maintain it at a very high level. And this is the best guarantee for the preservation of Great Russia.” The ceremony was also attended by figures from Russian culture, journalism, and the clergy. They included Alla Pugacheva, People’s Artist of the USSR, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and journalist Dmitry Muratov, and Father Alexey Uminsky, Rector of the Holy Trinity Church in Khokhly. It cannot be said that these people are not ""in favor"" with the current Russian authorities, but society is extremely ambivalent about them, especially since the start of the military operation in Ukraine. The streets outside the House of Unions on the weekend morning seemed empty. Muscovites, strolling by the luxury clothing shops came across the event. In private conversations, they shared their bewilderment. Not everyone seemed to be aware of the reason for the crowds. An exception to this were two well-informed men: An older man in a leather jacket and a younger man wearing a hoodie with a Z emblem and a sign reading ‘We do not abandon our own’. The former stubbornly argues to the latter that Gorbachev did more good than harm. Among the arguments are the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 1989, the prohibition of alcohol, and Glasnost and Perestroika, which have entered the English language along with the earlier ‘sputnik’ and ‘pogrom’. The man in the hoodie agrees that the anti-booze campaign was positive, but in response to the other points, he shakes his head. At around 1pm, the megaphones start announcing that entry into the Hall of Columns would cease, but some latecomers with bouquets were still allowed in. At about 2pm, the ceremony came to an end. Gorbachev’s body was taken to Novodevichy Cemetery. There, he was buried next to Raisa Maximovna, the former first lady, who has often been compared to her contemporary, Nancy Reagan. People gradually leave the scene, and there are no obstacles to walking around the center of Moscow. Nor are there any reminders of the farewell ceremony that has just concluded.",2.7011184912842876,3.4305245314809953,-0.7294060401967077,4

According to the ministry, the missile was fired from the Gremyashchiy, a multipurpose corvette and the lead ship of its class. It traveled a complex path to avoid natural obstacles while staying at a low altitude before hitting the target in the Sea of Okhotsk. The Russian military released footage of the exercise, including the moment the missile hit the decommissioned ship that was used as a target. The live-fire exercise was part of the Vostok 2022 multinational military drill currently underway in the Russian Far East. Last week, the Gremyashchiy took part in joint maneuvers with warships from China. The two nations also trained in anti-submarine warfare in the Sea of Japan. The Kalibr is the workhorse missile system for the Russian Navy. It can be launched from submarines or ships and is normally used to hit ground targets, but some types have guidance systems designed for attacking enemy vessels. Targets in the sea tend to drift and are harder to hit from a longer distance. The Russian military previously reported successful Kalibr strikes on naval targets at more modest ranges.",3.74729335427827,3.8730338312841597,-0.12574047700588986,0

The blast occurred not far from the entrance to the Russian embassy in the Afghan capital and killed 25 people, including two embassy staff members. The terrorist group claimed that the attack was carried out by a foreign fighter. According to some reports, the attack was launched by a local Islamic State offshoot, ISIS-K. It is the first attack on a diplomatic mission in Afghanistan claimed by ISIS since the 2021 Taliban takeover. Earlier, the Russian Investigative Committee confirmed that an assistant secretary and a security guard – both Russian nationals – were killed in the blast. According to media reports, most victims were Afghans queuing for visas. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that security at the mission was enhanced in the wake of the attack. The killed embassy staffers were also mourned with a minute of silence during Lavrov’s talks with his Tajik counterpart Sirojiddin Muhriddin in Moscow. Russia has been among the few nations to maintain a diplomatic mission in Kabul since the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan a year ago. Afghanistan has repeatedly seen terrorist attacks since the 2021 takeover, which the Taliban has blamed on ISIS-K.

2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/news/562239-nato-winter-uniform-ukraine/,NATO struggling to supply winter uniforms to Ukraine – Der Spiegel,"NATO members have been scraping the barrel in their efforts to supply Ukraine with sufficient winter uniforms and field camp equipment, Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported on Monday. Kiev has apparently called on the bloc to urgently provide the necessary equipment before the cold weather sets in. According to Der Spiegel, Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov wrote a letter to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg back in late July, calling on the military alliance to provide cold-proof field tents along with clothing for as many as 200,000 Ukrainian soldiers. The uniforms and equipment should be delivered as quickly as possible, the minister added, according to the magazine. Several NATO nations have since been searching their warehouses for the needed supplies. The organization confirmed to Der Spiegel that it is in contact with member states on the issue. According to reports cited by Der Spiegel, so far the US and Canada, as well as Sweden and Finland, which are yet to join the military grouping, have together promised deliveries that could cover up to 50% of Ukraine’s demands. Military officials from various NATO members argue, though, that most of their nations’ stocks are reserved for the national armies, Der Spiegel says. The defense alliance has reportedly offered to replace the uniforms and equipment member states hand over to Kiev, using the so-called NATO trust fund, amounting to $40 million. Germany also reportedly plans to join the effort, although it had earlier struggled to equip its own troops with the necessary gear, Der Spiegel says. By sending winter clothing and field camp equipment, Berlin could make “an important contribution” to Ukraine’s defense ahead of the approaching winter, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said. According to Der Spiegel, the German military is “quite critical” of the idea of handing over its equipment to Ukraine. Lambrecht herself repeatedly stated earlier that the German Armed Forces – the Bundeswehr – are about to reach the limits of what they can give away when it comes to weapons.",2.665104397057753,2.2995405441362813,0.36556385292147153,7

The appeal was posted to Twitter on Monday by an adviser to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. Mikhail Podoliak urged “residents of the occupied territories, including the Crimean peninsula, to follow the officials’ recommendations during de-occupation measures.” Furthermore, people should “prepare a bomb shelter, stock up on a sufficient amount of water and charge power banks right now.” Podoliak concluded his warning with the line “Everything will be Ukraine.” The warning comes after Podoliak announced last week that Ukrainian authorities are developing evacuation routes for Ukrainians living in Crimea “who want to leave the island during the active de-occupation.” Kiev has repeatedly insisted that it considers Crimea, which became part of Russia following a referendum in 2014, to be an “occupied territory” and has vowed to seize the peninsula “by any means necessary.” The US-led NATO alliance also considers Crimea to be “illegally annexed” Ukrainian territory, and has demanded that Moscow return the region to Ukrainian control. A US official told Politico last month that Washington had given Ukraine its blessing to strike targets of its choosing in Crimea.

Pyotr Vrublevsky’s apology was reported by a spokesman for the ministry, who described the remark as “unacceptable” and said a formal complaint had been issued to the Ukrainian diplomat. “He apologized and stated that he was speaking while experiencing serious emotional tension, because there is a war in his home country,” the spokesman, Aibek Smadiyarov, said during a briefing, as cited by local media. He added that Vrublevsky was on a break from work at the moment. The Ukrainian envoy sparked controversy after being interviewed by a local blogger last month. When asked about the situation in his country, he said: “What can I say… We are trying to kill as many [Russians] as possible. The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to. That’s it.” The remark elicited anger in Kazakhstan, which has a significant ethnic Russian minority. The Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan (APK), a presidential advisory body, accused Vrublevsky of hate speech and questioned his capacity to serve as a diplomat. The Ukrainian diplomatic corps has included some controversial individuals over the years. In 2018, Kiev recalled its consul in Hamburg, Vasily Marushchinets, after he was accused of sharing anti-Semetic messages on social media. He was also photographed celebrating his 60th birthday with a cake featuring the title of Hitler’s book Mein Kampf, according to leaked images. The current Ukrainian envoy in Germany, Andrey Melnik, has also courted controversy on several occasions, including in late June, when he denied war crimes committed by Ukrainian nationalist forces during World War II, claiming there was no evidence for them.

Safronov worked for the Russian newspapers Kommersant and Vedomosti before becoming an adviser to the head of Roscosmos. He was arrested in July 2020 and charged with two counts of state treason for cooperation with the intelligence agencies of Germany and the Czech Republic.

The move comes in response to a petition that collected the required 25,000 signatures for the issue to be considered by authorities. Commenting on the initiative on Friday, Zelensky signaled that he had tasked Prime Minister Denis Shmigal “to process the issue raised in the electronic petition… and inform its author about the results of consideration.” Zelensky noted that the national Constitution grants Ukrainian citizens the right to freedom of thought, speech and expression. However, this provision is limited, among other things, by a law on the Protection of Public Morality, which prohibits production and distribution of explicit materials. The author of the petition, Taras Syromskyi, said that Ukrainian legislation in this area has many gaps which “give room for its interpretation” particularly regarding how eroticism is actually defined. “The legislation does not explain well where eroticism is in art, and where eroticism is porn,” he writes. The author also said banning porn could also promote corruption. At the same time, the legalization of porn presents “an ideal opportunity to bring money to the Ukrainian budget,” he said. Zelensky’s response to the petition comes after he urged the prime minister to consider legalizing same-sex marriage following another petition last month. He noted at the time, however, that the Constitutional provisions on marriage could not currently be changed due to the martial law announced on February 24, the same day Russia began its military offensive in the country.",1.9316108383761503,2.8020115016884155,-0.8704006633122652,3

2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562213-novaya-gazeta-metia-license/,Russian court revokes license of long-running liberal newspaper,"The media license of Novaya Gazeta, one of the oldest liberal papers in Russia, has been revoked by a Moscow court. The outlet suspended its print version in late March, saying it would not resume circulation while Russia conducts its military operation in Ukraine. On Monday, the Basmanny district court in the Russian capital granted a request by media regulator Roskomnadzor to revoke the paper’s license. The watchdog’s case against the publication was based on its failure to file paperwork after a change of ownership in 2006. The newspaper argued that the reshuffle was not significant enough to warrant a mandatory submission of its new corporate charter, as required by Russian law. Novaya Gazeta was originally fully owned by its newsroom, but in 2006, it sold a 49% stake to former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and then-lawmaker Aleksandr Lebedev, best known as part-owner of prominent British newspapers the Evening Standard and The Independent. The two men pledged to invest their personal wealth into the paper’s operation. The deal was widely believed to be motivated by politics rather than business interests, when it was announced, as both Gorbachev and Lebedev were outspoken supporters of the opposition media in Russia. The newspaper suspended circulation in late March following two notices of violation sent by Roskomnadzor over the paper’s refusal to use the “foreign agent” label for organizations branded as such by the government. Novaya Gazeta had previously criticized the Russian labeling rules for foreign agents, calling them an assault on journalism. In March, the paper declared its intention to publish online only, as long as the Russian military campaign in Ukraine continues. Part of the newsroom has since split to start a new Europe-based project, which shares the name of the newspaper, but is formally not connected to it. Dmitry Muratov, Novaya’s editor-in-chief, who has been part of the project since its creation in 1993, was co-awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his “efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace”.",2.455299400465353,2.4431751524256815,0.012124248039671492,5

2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562168-55-years-since-rehabilitation-of-crimean-tatars/,"From Stalin's wrath to Khrushchev's gift to Ukraine: Crimea's Tatar minority has faced death, misery and deportation","Crimean Tatars play an important role in the story of the peninsula's reabsorption by Russia. One of Ukraine's main propaganda tools is to accuse Russia of violating their rights. At the same time, Turkey is also a factor – through its cultural ties with what it sees as the ""brotherly"" Turkic people. However, the Tatars themselves seem to be split into two camps after the events of 2014, when their home area returned to Moscow's control. One of the main reasons why at least some Crimean Tatars seem to contest the legitimacy of the reunification goes back to the 1940s when, during the Soviet Union’s involvement in World War II, a decision was made by the Georgian-born Joseph Stalin to deport them to Central Asia by force. RT looks back at these tragic events. The formation of the Crimean Tatars as an ethic group occurred between the 13th and 17th centuries, uniting Cumans, also known as Polovtsy, a Turkic nomadic people who appeared in the area during the tenth century, with others who had inhabited the peninsula since ancient times and gradually underwent Tatarization. Following the disintegration of the Mongolian Golden Horde, a large Chingisid-founded empire that at its peak extended from Siberia and Central Asia to parts of Eastern Europe, a number of smaller khanates were formed. The Crimeans frequently mounted raids into the Danubian principalities, Poland–Lithuania, and Muscovy to enslave people. This trade, as well as the ransom business, were the backbone of the khanate’s economy. In the 18th century, after a series of successful anti-slavery and military campaigns, as well as through diplomacy, the Russian Empire incorporated Crimea. While some of the local upper class entered into an arrangement with the new rulers, others chose to leave the peninsula and join the Ottoman Empire across the sea. After the formation of Soviet Union in 1921, the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Hitler had a special place for Crimea in his future plans for the Third Reich after the expected victory in World War Two. The peninsula was to be vacated of its current inhabitants for the arrival of an Aryan population. Despite the fact that this project wasn't implemented, Crimea remained under Nazi occupation for a sum total of almost two years, and that had been hard enough. Nazis excelled in the art of ruling the occupied territories by actively applying the “divide and conquer” principle to the local ethnic groups and nations. Thus, they relied on Ukrainian collaborators to do all their dirty work in Belarus, and used Cossacks to crush the uprising in Warsaw in 1944. In Crimea, their allies were the so-called ‘Tatar national committees,’ organized by German intelligence organs in order to influence the local population, spread propaganda and recruit volunteers who were often used to infiltrate the rear of the Red Army with spies and saboteurs. It can’t be said to have been exactly a win-win deal, though. Nazi Germany wasn’t really interested in supporting the hopes of Crimean Tatars to carve out an ethnic Crimean Tatar mini-state on the peninsula, and the German authorities on site made it abundantly clear. Thus, while some of the Crimean Tatar collaborators were used to infiltrate the rear of the Red Army and police the occupied territories, others were tasked with promoting the Nazi ideology. Some were so eager to oblige that they even filed proposals with their Nazi bosses to exterminate all Russians on the peninsula. Red Army commanders and partisans kept records of all crimes committed by the Crimean Tatar collaborators against the civilian population and prisoners of war during the occupation. Sometimes the situation was so absurd that Germans had to intervene and protect the civilians and POWs from their overzealous helpers. “On July 4, I was taken captive. We were escorted by some Tatar traitors. They kept beating the medics with clubs. After a while in a Sevastopol prison, we were forced to march through the Belbek Valley that had been mined. Many POWs from the Red Army and Navy were killed. Then they crammed us into tiny prison cells in Bakhchysarai. Three days later, we had to march to Simferopol. We were escorted by Germans and a number of Crimean Tatar traitors. I saw one Tatar cut off a seaman’s head,” a Red Fleet seaman, Yanchenko, described the cruelty of some Crimean Tatar collaborators in his letter dated 1942. Most of them, however, were less bloodthirsty and chose to collaborate more for reasons of trying to survive and to obtain money and land deals under the Nazi rule. By assessments, up to 20,000 Crimean Tatars could have been recruited in 1942 for prisoner control and counterinsurgency operations, as well as for other ‘volunteer’ jobs. They were also a formidable force in the Crimean Mountains, as they knew the land very well, and many partisan detachments fighting on the Red Army’s side suffered at their hand. The number of Crimean Tatars in the Red Army was only slightly larger than in the collaborationist detachments, and they were represented quite modestly in the partisan detachments in Crimea. However, in 1943, a mass desertion of collaborators began, as they switched to the side of the partisans. Nevertheless, many stayed with Hitler until the end. Several battalions of collaborators were defeated in the spring of 1944. Those who managed to retreat with the Germans subsequently formed the Tatar Mountain Jaeger brigade of the SS. In the spring of 1944, the Russians defeated the German 17th Army and liberated Crimea. At that point, the country’s leadership was faced with ‘the Tatar question.’ In May of 1944, another Georgian Lavrenty Beria – the chief of the USSR’s political police, the NKVD – reported to Stalin that more than 5,000 collaborators (not only Tatars) had been arrested in Crimea and about 6,000 firearms had been seized on the peninsula. Beria stressed that a “significant part” of the Tatar population had collaborated with the Nazis. It was Beria who proposed evicting the Tatars from Crimea and sending them to Uzbekistan for use in agriculture. Literally the next day, on May 11, 1944, the USSR State Defense Committee adopted a resolution to forcibly evict the Tatars. They were allowed to take personal belongings, clothes, household equipment and food with them, but their land, cattle, and other property were seized by the state. NKVD units carried out the operation within three days. Some 180,000 people were loaded into 67 trains and sent to Central Asia. At the same time, the military seized about 12,000 more weapons, including mortar launchers and machine guns. Frontline soldiers who had taken part in the Crimean Soviet underground and their families managed to avoid deportation on request, as well as some women who had married men of other nationalities. However, these literally amounted to several hundred people. The living conditions at the point of arrival were extremely difficult. Apart from natural mortality, modern researchers believe that at least 13% died in the fall of 1948. It is worth noting that a significant portion of these people fell victim to the last mass famine to afflict the USSR, which occurred immediately after the war. However, for the Crimean Tatars the situation was complicated by the seizure of their property, the difficult living conditions in the new place, and an unfamiliar climate. Although the authorities allocated building materials, land, and loans for construction, people were forced to settle in Uzbekistan essentially from scratch. In the coming years, the Tatars were branded with the status of ‘special settlers,’ which included a significant loss of rights – most importantly, the right to leave their area of residence. The situation did not change for a long time, even after Stalin’s death. The turning point was the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR ‘On Citizens of Tatar Nationality Who Previously Lived in Crimea.’ In particular, it stated: “The facts attesting to the active cooperation with the German invaders of a certain part of the Tatars living in the Crimea were unreasonably attributed to the entire Tatar population of Crimea. These sweeping accusations against all citizens of Tatar nationality who lived in Crimea should be dropped, especially since a new generation of people has entered society’s workforce and political life.” Then there was an instruction to cancel the orders containing accusations against the Tatars. However, legal nuances contained in the same decree, in fact, limited their ability to move back to Crimea. The mass return began only in 1990, shortly before the collapse of the USSR. Since the Soviet Union was already in its death throes, and the Tatar question was a third-rate issue for the authorities of both Russia and Ukraine, a new problem arose when Tatars took it upon themselves to seize land plots on returning to Crimea. From their point of view, they were simply reappropriating what they had lost in 1944. The Crimean Tatars are one of the numerous peoples whose fate took a dramatic turn in the 20th century. Again in the 1950s when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, himself raised in Eastern Ukraine, handed over the territory to Kiev, apparently without consulting anyone. However, in the late USSR era, their situation stabilized and the fate of the Tatars generally coincided with that of the rest of Crimea’s inhabitants. By the time, Crimea rejoined Russia the bulk of the peninsula’s population was made up of ethnic Russians (Russians living in Crimea, but not Russian citizens), whose mass rejection of the Western-backed Kiev 'Maidan' coup set the stage for its return ""home."" Tatar activists were initially active on the side of Ukraine, and the first victims of clashes in Crimea were two Russians who died when pro-Moscow and pro-Kiev Tatar rallies collided. As a result of the events of 2014, the Tatar community split. The pro-Ukrainian part is represented by the ‘Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People,’ an organization that claims to represent the group. In fact, it is rather a virtual entity capable of fielding a total of several hundred activists, which is not even currently located in Crimea. Its attempt to form a combat wing in the form of a pro-Ukrainian volunteer battalion yielded zilch. In reality, the influence of the ‘Mejlis’ consists mainly in calling for the destruction of Crimea’s infrastructure, in particular, the bridge between the peninsula and the rest of Russia. The organization’s activities have been banned in the Russian Federation. Moscow has learned from the mistakes of the Soviet Union and has demonstrated much more flexibility in its ethnic and language policies regarding Crimea than was seen back then. The ethnic-cultural autonomy of the Crimean Tatars is recognized within Russia, and the region’s official languages include Russian, Ukrainian, and Crimean Tatar.",3.032053280866498,3.482715788392256,-0.4506625075257582,6

He did so on Sunday night after an intense campaign by pro-Kiev activists, who accused him of ignorance. Ukrainian Ambassador to Australia Vasily Miroshnichenko was among the public figures who lashed out at CTO.

Over the weekend, the diplomat shared some altered versions of the mural on social media. One, which was made by an Australia-based anti-Beijing cartoonist from Hong Kong, showed the Russian soldier stabbing the Ukrainian one in the back. Another depicted the soldiers as a Nazi and a Jewish person marked for extermination. 1.

The death toll has reached 25, with many more injured, according to Al Jazeera. The blast occurred when an embassy employee went outside to people waiting in line, a source told RIA-Novosti news agency. Reuters earlier reported that compound guards were able to spot the suicide bomber and fired shots at him. Russia’s Investigative Committee said that, according to preliminary data, the slain embassy workers were an assistant secretary and a security guard. Speaking after the incident, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said security has been tightened at the mission in Kabul, with additional Afghan intelligence and counterintelligence forces deployed. ““Let’s hope that those who perpetrated that attack, those who executed this attack will be held responsible in the nearest future,” Lavrov added. Russia is among the few nations to have maintained an embassy in Kabul since the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan a year ago. Despite not officially recognizing the Taliban government, Moscow has been in talks with the group on a deal to supply gasoline and other commodities to the country, which has been slapped with harsh international sanctions.",2.3843849122651113,3.3208605714421315,-0.9364756591770202,0
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562179-iaea-nuclear-plant-departure/,IAEA mission leaves Zaporozhye nuclear plant – media,"A delegation from the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has left the Russian-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant (NPP) in Ukraine, TASS reported on Monday. Renat Karchaa, a Russian nuclear expert who accompanied the mission, says two of its members will remain at the facility. Last week, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, who also inspected the plant, claimed that the agency would “establish a continued presence” there. According to the Russia 24 TV channel, the IAEA will publish its findings on Tuesday. “All their conclusions will be reflected in the report, which, as preliminary information suggests, is planned for release for tomorrow, when Rafael Grossi will deliver his remarks,” the outlet said. The mission left the facility earlier than expected. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-controlled military-civilian administration, told RIA that IAEA experts would continue working at the facility throughout Monday, before leaving on Tuesday, saying that they may even extend their mission. At the time, he said that the delegation “has been provided with all possible assistance. We are interested in an objective and balanced assessment of the situation at the NPP”. The main goal of the IAEA mission at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was to assess the state of the facility and speak to both Russian and Ukrainian personnel on the ground. During the inspection, Grossi confirmed that the plant, which has been under Russian control since March, had sustained some damage. However, he refrained from assigning blame. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the plant, while warning that further shelling could trigger a disaster on a par with Chernobyl. Kiev insists, however, that it is Russia’s forces who are shelling the area while stationing military hardware there. On Thursday, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, Ukraine launched a raid in an apparent bid to capture the station prior to the arrival of the IAEA delegation, but the attack was thwarted. Later, according to the ministry, Moscow prevented another raid by Kiev’s special forces and foreign mercenaries, who tried to land on the coast of the Kakhovka reservoir not far from Energodar, the city where the nuclear plant is located.",7.746117976866173,6.8038083675256384,0.9423096093405343,9
2022-09-05,https://www.rt.com/russia/562174-kremlin-putin-telegram-channels/,Kremlin reveals if Putin reads Telegram,"Russian President Vladimir Putin does not follow any Telegram channels personally, but his regular intelligence briefings may sometimes include a review of noteworthy posts, particularly from military correspondents, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov has said. “Putin doesn’t read Telegram channels, but receives reviews,” Peskov told Tass on Sunday, noting that the head of state needs to have full access to all available information and intelligence, in addition to official reports and bulletins. Unlike the majority of world leaders, the Russian president has almost no online presence, apart from a handful of official Kremlin accounts, including a Telegram channel, as he doesn't have free time to waste on posting, scrolling and clicking, his spokesman previously explained. Last year Peskov also said Putin would never set up a personal social media account and delegate the job to an adviser, because “he considers it wrong” for someone else to manage a public profile on his behalf. In fact, Putin doesn’t even have a cellphone to post or follow anyone, because, as Peskov once noted, “using a smartphone means voluntary exhibitionism” and a “total information transparency,” which is unimaginable for any world leader. Putin himself said that while he can always borrow an aide's phone if needed, he prefers to use an old-style government line to instantly get in touch with anyone. While former US president Barack Obama was once touted as the “first social media president,” his successor Donald Trump took it to a whole new level, attributing a large part of his election victory to social media. Trump is estimated to have tweeted more than 25,000 times during his presidency, before tech giants banned him for allegedly inciting the January 6 Capitol riot.",2.2702873187960866,2.2613582078794594,0.008929110916627181,8
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562172-moscow-accuse-estonian-incite-violence/,Russia accuses Estonia's FM of inciting ‘violence’,"The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned on Sunday what it called the “heinous logic” of Estonia's top diplomat, Urmas Reinsalu, accusing him of inciting violence in Russia. The Baltic nation’s foreign minister earlier told the local Postimees newspaper that if some Russians had “taken cobblestones into their hands,” the situation in Russia would have been different. “Has Mr. Reinsalu gone insane?” the Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, wrote in a Telegram post. “What is he calling for? Violence?” Zakharova described the minister’s words as “the heinous logic of an Estonian ignoramus” and accused him of advocating “unacceptable methods.” The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman also warned that by making such statements, Western officials are “destroying” one of the pillars of their own statehood, the “infeasibility of physical altercations and violence.” Reinsalu's remarks came before the EU foreign ministers’ meeting in Prague, where they were expected to discuss travel restrictions for Russians. Estonia was one of the most vocal advocates of a total ban on Schengen visas for Russians, except for certain “humanitarian” reasons. Speaking to Postimees in late August, Reinsalu said such a ban would have a “moral nature,” and “exert pressure on the Russian society.” The Estonian foreign minister called the Russian military operation in Ukraine “not just Putin’s war but that of the Russian nation, which includes not just the government and the territory but the population as well.” “There must always be someone, who would take a stone in his hand,” the minister argued, adding that “if just one percent of the Russian population had taken cobblestones in their hands, it would have caused some changes.” Sanctions should send a “signal” to the Russians that “their life cannot go on as normal,” Reinsalu added. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked. The US and its allies in Europe and elsewhere reacted to the February developments by sending arms to Kiev and slapping Moscow with unprecedented sanctions targeting its finance and banking sectors as well as aviation and space industries and later oil exports. Kiev and the Baltic States as well as some Eastern European nations also demanded a Schengen visa ban for Russians, but the measure was opposed by other EU members including Germany, France and Greece. Eventually, the bloc agreed to suspend the 2007 visa facilitation agreement instead of banning visas completely.",3.5184132753181174,2.0182118498117236,1.5002014255063938,2
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562170-moscow-focus-talks-kiev/,Moscow reveals focus of possible talks with Kiev,"Moscow remains ready to engage in talks with Kiev, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has confirmed. However, fulfilling Russia’s demands would be the only topic on the agenda, he said on a TV show on Sunday. When asked whether Russia has anything it could discuss with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Peskov said: “Yes, of course, [we can talk] about how our demands will be met.” Zelensky has recently threatened to abandon the very idea of talking to Moscow on a number of occasions. In late August, he cited a potential public “tribunal” for members of the infamous Azov regiment in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) as one of the red lines that would make any talks impossible. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state.

Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked. The two sides haven’t sat down at the negotiating table since talks in Istanbul in late March. Moscow was initially optimistic about the prospects for a peace deal but later accused Kiev of torpedoing the talks. Russian officials subsequently warned that their demands would be more extensive if talks were to resume. The Kremlin then signaled its readiness to strike a peace deal with Kiev in early August. Peskov said at the time that the two nations were close to settling their differences in a way that was acceptable to Russia back in spring. He also said Russia would still achieve the goals of its military operation even if Kiev refuses to end the conflict in a diplomatic way. In mid-August, Ukraine ruled out any negotiations with Russia, arguing that talks would not serve Kiev’s goals. “The opportunity to win this war is much more important than any situational pause,” Zelensky’s aide, Mikhail Podoliak, said at the time.",4.029672750726053,3.043443767555196,0.9862289831708564,2
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562154-europe-moscow-asia-pivot/,"Timofey Bordachev: Russia is a European country, but the West's hybrid war has forced it to turn to Asia","For Russia, with its unique geopolitical position, it is fundamentally difficult to determine the geographical priorities of its external relations. All the more so because the country's enormous natural wealth and ability to fully support itself with resources make it unnecessary in principle to consider external relations as a vitally important part of its own development strategy. There is no dispute that all of Moscow's foreign policy declarations over the last two decades have contained a ritual indication that the goal of foreign policy is to ensure the country's economic development. However, in practice, the foundations on which the Russian state structure stands mean the sincerity of these assurances should be taken with a pinch of salt. In reality, Russia – like its main geostrategic adversary the US – is one of only two countries in the world that can survive, at least in the basic senses, by relying entirely on its domestic resources. Despite assurances about the importance of foreign economic relations, Moscow sets the true priorities of its foreign policy based not on which opportunities the external environment can provide, but rather on the dangers it can pose to its ability to manage this bounty. The result is a foreign policy oriented towards repelling threats in the first instance, and seizing opportunities in the second. And it has to be admitted that it is this insurmountable problem that has confronted many of Russia’s diplomatic undertakings throughout recent years, foremost among which is the pivot to the East, a strategy formulated a decade ago by domestic thinkers and backed up by statements at the highest level. The purely materialistic nature of this policy initially had great difficulty interacting with the Russian foreign policy tradition and, more importantly, the system of prioritisation. Attempts to convince elites of the need to intensify relations with Asian countries on the basis that this would bring substantial material benefits, faced an objective obstacle – there was no need to try hard in the western direction. This was because material benefits from there came easily, by comparison, relying on the links established over hundreds of years with other major European players. As a result, as of 2019, about 80% of investments in Russia’s Far East were of domestic origin. This region, which is larger than the European Union, has only about 7 million people and is politically centred on the cities of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. Perhaps because of its economic limitations, the eastward pivot strategy in concrete terms has not progressed beyond establishing truly strong ties with China, with which Russia has now begun to address the really crucial issues of the international order. In all other respects the Eastern pivot has remained an important rhetorical but weakly realised field for the Russian state. Over the past ten years, however, Moscow has significantly expanded its presence in various Asian international formats, increased its level of participation in various intergovernmental forums, and begun to think more about the East and understand its place in its own foreign policy system. In turn, ties with China are also difficult to see solely as a product of intensified interactions on the Asian front in the last ten years. The relationship between Moscow and Beijing is strategic in nature, with a shared vision of a more equitable international order that is not dominated by a narrow group of states. Also, Russia and China share responsibility for the stability of a vast part of Eurasia. Bilateral trade and economic relations are developing with the understanding that at some point the two states will indeed have to jointly oppose attempts by the US and its allies to regain control of the global economy and politics. While acknowledging that this is the closest interpretation of the nature, content and results of Russia's turn to the East, we cannot ignore the potential impact on policy of the ongoing political and military conflict in Europe. Moreover, since its first weeks, most observers have argued that a de facto break with the West would inevitably lead to a strengthening of Russia's ties with non-Western states, of which the Asian countries are the most important in terms of economy and development. Against the backdrop of massive economic warfare measures launched against Moscow by Western countries in 2022, it is Asia that has emerged as the most important buyer of traditional Russian exports, a source of technological products and a priority trade and economic partner. Many have even said that developing ties with China and the rest of Asia should ""replace"" Russia’s traditional partnerships in the West. In other words, the conflict – in fact, hybrid warfare – between Russia and the US along with its European allies, could be seen as a condition that would make the pivot to the East no longer a choice but a necessity, forcing Moscow to take it truly seriously. This is a rather new situation and discussion for Russia, as it has never in its history had to address the dependence of internal sustainability on interaction with one or another of its external partners. The extent to which this is actually the case remains to be seen. But several assumptions can already be made that are directly related to the significance of Russia's relations with Asia in the coming years. First, relations with China and (especially) other Asian states are not the way to solve existential problems, even taking into account that cooperation with partners outside Europe in the field of energy will be an important factor in the future sustainability of Russian budget revenues, and maintaining Russia's presence in the global economy, from which the US and its allies are trying to exclude it. This is all the more likely given that countries such as Japan and South Korea are much less likely to be pressured by the US not to trade with Russia, compared to their European equivalents. Given the growing confrontation with China, it is not in Washington's interest to weaken its Asian allies or to make them too dependent on American aid. Secondly, the key tasks of national development will have to be solved by Russia itself, without the kind of reliance on external sources of technology we have seen previously, let alone finance. The coming era will require a much greater degree of de facto sovereignty and, in a sense, a capacity for limited autarky. For all the importance of links outside the West, therefore, Russia cannot consider simply reorienting itself from one direction to another while retaining its historically established strategy of dependence on external sources of development. To give an example, it will have to start building its own long-haul aircraft again, instead of relying on finished products from Boeing and Airbus. Thirdly, it should be taken into account that even the most active ties in Asia cannot supplant relations with the states of the Islamic world, neighbouring countries and even within Europe, where also not everyone is determined to erect walls on its eastern border. Russia's geopolitical position cannot be changed by a single military-political conflict in one direction. Not to mention that from a historical and cultural point of view, it will always be difficult for Russia to build engagement in Asia similar in scale and spirit to that in the South and the West. To summarise, in the current context, relations with Asian countries are becoming a necessity rather than a choice. However, this doesn’t mean choosing a complete change in the most important aspects of national foreign and foreign economic policy. Rather, it has an important tactical value and, with due diligence on our part, could further lead to a more significant Russian presence in world affairs, the centre of which is increasingly shifting to the east.",2.1513795982231563,2.3008560385218173,-0.14947644029866103,8

He warned, however, that Moscow will be ready to defend its interests when that moment arrives. Western nations “have made too many mistakes and will have to pay for them,” he said on the Rossiya 1 TV Channel. “Any confrontation is followed by détente and any crisis situation is resolved at the negotiating table… this is what will happen this time as well,” the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said, adding that it’s unlikely to occur “soon.” When such talks materialise, Moscow will not hesitate to defend its interests, Peskov added. Russia has acquired “priceless experience” of dealing with the West in recent years and will use it to “conduct dialogue… in such a way that our interests are by no means hurt.” The Kremlin official listed what he sees as Western errors, citing Germany’s “horrible” decision to send weapons to Ukraine for use against Russian soldiers. He also criticized European nations for supporting a government that allows “Nazis” to openly demonstrate their symbols and stage torchlit processions, calling it “no less horrible.” Peskov also blamed the energy crisis in Europe on “absurd” decisions by European politicians, who have refused to service equipment sold by Western firms to Gazprom. The Russian state energy giant “spent decades” earning its reputation of a reliable natural gas supplier, and has so far done nothing to tarnish it, the Kremlin spokesman claimed. “This is not Gazprom’s fault, this is fault of those politicians, who have taken the decision on sanctions,” he said, referring to the Russian company’s recent decision to indefinitely suspend gas transit through its Nord Stream pipeline, due to technical issues. Since the start of Russia’s offensive against Ukraine in late February, gas prices have climbed to record highs in Europe, driving up overall inflation. Moscow has cited technical issues caused by Western sanctions as the reason for the gradual decline in gas deliveries.

He added that Germany itself is acting like Russia’s “enemy.” Germany “has imposed sanctions against Russia and its citizens,” Medvedev wrote in a Telegram post on Sunday, adding that Berlin also “supplies Ukraine with lethal arms used against our armed forces.” Such actions amount to nothing less than a “hybrid war,” the ex-president said. The comment came in response to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had earlier said Berlin no longer sees Moscow as a reliable oil and gas supplier. “Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,” the chancellor told a news conference as he announced additional measures worth €65 billion ($64.7 billion) aimed at protecting German consumers and businesses from soaring inflation caused by the energy crisis. Berlin’s move came as Russian state energy giant Gazprom announced it would indefinitely suspend gas transit through the Nord Stream pipeline, citing technical issues caused by Western sanctions. The EU has accused Russia of weaponizing its energy exports. Germany has supported Kiev since the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine in late February.

2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562148-kiev-spreading-propaganda-fear/,Kiev spreading ‘propaganda by fear’ – French ex-presidential candidate,"A former French presidential candidate has accused Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky of using ‘war propaganda’ as a tool to obstruct the peace process. Veteran politician Segolene Royal also called on the UN and media associations to fight against such tactics. Royal’s suggestion, that some of the “war crimes” Kiev blames on Russian troops were part of ‘propaganda,’ has made her a target for widespread criticism. Speaking to BFMTV earlier this week, Royal said that “everyone knows that there is war propaganda by fear.” As an example, she cited the alleged shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol – the story which made headlines in Western media in early March. Zelensky blamed Russia for the incident that, as local authorities claimed, killed three people, including a child. The Russian military denied targeting the medical facility and insisted the whole thing was a “completely staged provocation” by the Ukrainian side. “You can imagine that if there had been any victim, any baby with blood, in the age of cell phones we would have seen [their photos],” Royal stressed. The authenticity of the photos presented by Kiev as proof of the claimed Russian attack were questioned by many online. Marianna Vyshemirskaya, one of the pregnant women featured in the images that appeared on the front pages of many major outlets, later claimed that there had been no Russian airstrike on the hospital. She insisted that she told AP journalists about this, but they decided not to mention it in their reportage. Royal, who used to be a long-term partner of France’s former president Francois Hollande, also commented on the events of April in the town of Bucha near Kiev, after which Zelensky claimed that negotiations with Russia became impossible. Ukrainian authorities accused the Russian forces of multiple atrocities against civilians in the town, including the rape of children. Moscow firmly denied the allegations of war crimes, insisting it was “yet another provocation” by Kiev. “The stories of child rape for seven hours under the eyes of the parents: but it’s monstrous to go and spread things like that only to interrupt the peace process,” the veteran French politician stated, without elaborating She also claimed that Zelensky used accounts of alleged torture of Ukrainian soldiers by Russian troops – which Moscow also vehemently denies – not only to impede any peace process but also to “remobilize” troops. She argued that as “there’s been enough horror of war and casualties” and that “Ukrainian propaganda” should be stopped “under the aegis of the UN and media organizations.” After BFMTV tweeted a fragment of her interview with a caption “Segolene Royal questions certain war crimes in Ukraine,” the politician responded that this was “false,” as she’d “never denied war crimes.” On Saturday, Royal published the final part of her remarks which, as she said, was cut by the television network. In this fragment she says that “there is a form of one-upmanship in the description of the horror, to encourage arms deliveries and to refrain from setting up negotiation and peace processes.” “To plead for peace is to act for the end of the suffering of the Ukrainian people and of Russian aggression,” she wrote in a caption to the video. Royal’s interview was condemned by some politicians as well as by many social media users. The Stand With Ukraine group representing the victims and the families of victims of “Russian aggression” even announced that it was considering filing a complaint against Royal in order to defend “the honor of disappeared.” Meanwhile, the president of the party The Patriots, Florian Philippot, criticized “the aggressive and crazy reactions” to Royal’s remarks and said that she “has every right, and an intellectual duty” to question war propaganda.",2.6701583481371833,2.5916477454772426,0.0785106026599407,5

Indonesian President Joko Widodo insisted last month that both Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping had promised him that they would personally attend the gathering of leaders from the world’s biggest economies, which will be held on the resort island of Bali. However, Peskov clarified on Sunday that the Kremlin had yet to make a decision regarding Putin’s attendance at the summit in two-and-a-half months’ time. The spokesman was asked by Rossiya 1 channel if it could be dangerous for the Russian leader to travel to Indonesia in light of the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev, in which the West has overwhelmingly supported the Ukrainian side. “In deciding on the format of our participation... all factors will be taken into account, including security factors, of course,” he replied. However, Peskov confirmed that “there is an invitation at the highest level [for Putin to attend], for which we are grateful to the host country of the upcoming summit.” Moscow confirmed Putin’s participation in the summit in Bali in July, but said it wasn’t yet clear whether he would attend in person or via video link.

All it could take to cause a major disaster, of this sort, is continued fighting on the ground around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in a Ukrainian town. RT explains the dangers of shelling the Zaporozhye NPP and considers the likelihood of a new Chernobyl. Russian forces took control of the Zaporozhye plant back in March 2022. A major fire broke out nearby in the same month, after which the plant was shelled several times, but it was only the beginning. Recently, the volume of alarming news about the facility has been growing. Russia claims that the Ukrainians are deliberately targeting the hazardous site. The last attack attempt was made by Ukrainian troops on Thursday when representatives of the IAEA mission were at the station, Moscow insists. Over 40 motor boats, divided into two groups and carrying more than 250 Ukrainian special operations troops and foreign mercenaries, reportedly tried to land on the coast of the Kakhovka reservoir not far from Energodar, where the nuclear power plant is located. The assailants were quickly spotted and targeted by Russia’s Su-30 jets and Ka-52 attack helicopters. Those strikes sank some 20 boats, while the rest turned and retreated. The remaining Ukrainian troops were than targeted by Russian artillery as they tried to come ashore, the Defence Ministry in Moscow said. As a result of the attack, only one reactor out of six was operational for most of the day, officials have explained. The first four reactors were forced to shut down even earlier. On August 25, Energoatom reported an unprecedented complete cutoff of the NPP from the Ukrainian grid. The military-civilian administration of Zaporozhye Region explained that it was caused by the emergency protection system, which automatically disconnected the main units. “A strike by Ukraine’s forces on high-voltage power lines in the area of the Zaporozhye NPPresulted in a fire in the security zone of the 750 kV power line. The fire caused a short circuit. The emergency protection system turned off two power units followed by a power outage in the whole of the Zaporozhye Region,” Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the Zaporozhye administration, wrote. He says the units which were shut down last week are currently working at 60% and 80% of their capacity respectively. At the same time, the Zaporozhye plant remains a part of Ukraine’s power grid and is run by Ukrainian staff. It supplies electricity to nearby regions through three 750 kV lines and one 330kV line. Apparently aware of the questionable logic behind accusing Russia of shelling its own positions, the Americans and their western allies have so far refrained for laying the blame squarely on Moscow. Bonnie Jenkins, the US Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security, said she could not give any confirmation as to where the shelling was coming from. But, she added, “we would not be in this situation if Russia would simply withdraw and give the site back to Ukraine.” A joint statement by 42 countries called on Moscow to do so in mid-August. What the international community has been able to achieve so far is to agree on dispatching an emergency IAEA mission, which arrived at the Zaporozhye NPP on September 1. The team includes experts from Poland, Lithuania, Serbia, China, France, Italy, Jordan, Mexico, Albania, and North Macedonia. Given fears that fighting in the area – which has damaged power lines and caused fires – could lead to disaster, the mission intends to inspect the condition of the NPP and measure radiation levels, the Wall Street Journal reports. They have also brought critical spare parts for the plant. Nuclear energy expert Valentin Gibalov says the IAEA’s main objective is to conduct an inventory of radioactive and nuclear materials, as the agency lacks the power to influence the fighting, let alone stop it completely. “They are coming to count new fuel assemblies at the power plant, take a look at the control systems, etc. They can say what they think, of course, suggest a safer way to move forward, but IAEA representatives can’t stop the military action,” he told RT. Indeed, the source of the problem is not going away. The Russian Defense Ministry claims Kiev continues to stage provocations in order to create the threat of a major nuclear disaster in Zaporozhye. Ukraine responds with accusations of Russian actions. Mikhail Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the Office of the President, has alleged that Russian troops targeted the corridors used by the IAEA mission to get to the power plant. The decision to build the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant was passed by the Council of Ministers of the USSR in 1977. It has 6 VVER pressurized water reactors, generating a total of about 6,000 MW, which makes it the most powerful in Europe. The first of its six reactors was put into operation in late 1984, less than 18 months before the infamous Chernobyl disaster. According to Valentin Gibalov, the 40-year-old plant is considerably more vulnerable to external threats than a modern facility. But even today, 100% guaranteed protection from military strikes would be unrealistic, he says. “It’s true that the possibility of a terrorist attack is considered when nuclear power plants are designed today, but one almost never expects the facility to be resilient to artillery fire or aerial bombs, and the military can always find ways to inflict substantial damage on any plant. Massive attacks on the ZNPP could result in a Fukushima-sized nuclear emergency. “This mainly applies to the two units which remain online. The reactors which are in ‘cold shutdown’ are less disaster-prone, but some leakage can still occur if the containment building is damaged or the energy supply or cooling systems are completely disabled. This, however, would require a deliberate large-scale attack,” Gibalov says. Sergey Mukhametov, an assistant professor at Moscow State University’s Faculty of Geography, says a nuclear power plant is, hypothetically, supposed to to capable of withstanding the impact of a plane crash. “The Fukushima plant easily survived a major earthquake. It was then hit by a tsunami wave higher than the level it had been designed for, but even that wasn’t critical. What caused the meltdown was seawater flooding the emergency generators powering the pumps and the resultant loss of reactor core cooling. That led to overheating and the release of radioactivity. “However, a nuclear power plant will inevitably be crippled by sustained shelling. It is a sophisticated facility, which could be compromised by disabling the cooling systems, for instance. It requires other resources as well. The reactors must obviously be shut down in a safe manner, but it’s a highly complex process. On top of that, many cities rely on the ZNPP, which is the largest in Europe, for power. Not Kiev itself, but we’re talking about almost half of Ukraine, which this [Ukrainian] government is apparently no longer interested in,” he said. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the military-civilian administration of the Zaporozhye Region, reported on August 29 that a Ukrainian strike had penetrated the roof of Special Unit 1, which, according to Rogov, is used to store fresh fuel for the reactors. Valentin Gibalov says such incidents do not pose an immediate threat. “A special unit of a nuclear power plant is a place where medium- and low-activity radioactive waste accumulates in the course of work, such as contaminated clothes or wastewater left after equipment deactivation. Just a hole in the roof is no big deal. If youdestroy the whole unit, you will end up with a local contamination which may affect the neighboring area, but nothing more than that,” he explained. He added, however, that the Zaporozhye NPP also has a dry cask storage facility for spent fuel, where the level of radioactivity poses a much bigger threat. “A direct hit by a 155 mm shell, for example, could destroy this storage. But you really need a very high level of precision. If you just strike close to it, nothing will happen,” he said. Incidentally, 155 mm howitzers are supplied to the Ukrainian armed forces as part of foreign aid. “A more dangerous scenario would be the destruction of the reactors’ containment buildings. This absolutely can’t be done by accident, this would have to be a deliberate operation to create a radioactive disaster. I hope that neither side wants to see the events take a catastrophic turn. But one can only hope,” Valentin Gibalov said. According to Sergey Mukhametov, if a reactor were to blow up, the local authorities would have to resort to the practices used to manage the Chernobyl accident. “Depending on the scale they would have to impose a new exclusion zone, destroying everything in the area. No scenario can be ruled out. It’s obvious to everybody that the best solution is to leave the Zaporozhye NPP alone, but this is not what’s happening. I’m sure it’s obvious to the military commanders as well, but they have their own goals and priorities,” he added. The impact of a possible meltdown at Zaporozhye will depend on where exactly radioactivity will be released into the air or water. Sergey Mukhametov says all countries around Ukraine may be affected. “Talking about air masses, the bad news for Russia is that the ZNPP is located at a latitude where western disturbances prevail, which means that west winds prevail over other winds, and we get air masses blowing in from the Atlantic towards the Ural mountains. Admittedly, on a given day, the wind may be blowing in the other direction, towards Europe. As we remember, back in 1986, Geiger counters were clicking all across Europe even before the USSR reported about the Chernobyl accident,” he said. Radioactive dust will not stay airborne forever but will settle on the territories is sweeps over. This is the reason why, as some data suggest, the USSR deliberately produced radioactive precipitation after the Chernobyl disaster so that contaminated substances would settle before reaching densely populated cities. “Radioactive rain can happen naturally. But you must remember that rainwater brings radiation down onto the ground where it contaminates the soil and then percolates into underground water. The area of contamination can thus spread over time,” Mukhametov explained. A release of radioactivity into water presents a different scenario. “Any nuclear reactor needs cooling, unless the plant, like Fukushima, is located on the coast,” Mukhametov says. “Special ponds are built to hold water that circulates around the plant cooling it. It’s like a car engine. If water from these ponds seeps into the Kakhovka Reservoir, which is located close to the ZNPP and Energodar, it will then make its way into the Dnieper and go downstream. The problem is that further down the Dnieper is the North Crimean Canal, which was reopened after the start of the special military operation. It is used for agriculture and will need to be sealed immediately in case of an accident.” One should remember that the Dnieper flows into the Black Sea, an area of powerful cyclones which turn water flows anticlockwise. “If contaminated water makes it to the Black Sea, the spot, mixed with other water, will move along the Odessa coast and float past Romania and Bulgaria until it reaches the Bosporus and possibly enters the Sea of Marmara. The Black Sea, which survived the Chernobyl disaster fairly easily, will hardly be affected much. And it’s less important for the Russian fishing industry than the eastern and northern seas. The issue is, however, that we don’t know exactly the scale of a possible disaster at the ZNPP,” he said.",4.2367226074219575,3.647456803597554,0.5892658038244036,9
2022-09-04,https://www.rt.com/russia/562138-ukraine-nato-negotiations-wsj/,Better for Ukraine to ‘negotiate now’ – retired US general,"Sustaining the conflict in Ukraine is becoming increasingly difficult for NATO, so Kiev must think about negotiating with Moscow, retired US Army brigadier general Mark T. Kimmitt has said in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal. Washington’s latest military aid package to Kiev last month included “older and less advanced” systems, which “may indicate that battlefield consumption rates have outpaced production to a point where excess inventories provided to Ukraine are nearly exhausted,” Kimmitt pointed out in his article on Thursday. Dealing with “dwindling stocks of leading-edge weapon systems” in NATO countries would likely mean a prolonged conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Such a scenario could result in “more pressure from supporting nations, sustained inflation, less heating gas, and falling popular support” in the West, he wrote. Kimmitt, who served as assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs in 2008-09, suggested four ways to speed up the resolution of the conflict, which has now been underway for six months. The first option is to “dig deeper” into NATO stockpiles and send arms to Kiev that have so far been withheld by members due to their own national defense requirements, the retired general suggested. That’s something EU countries may be willing to do as it’s “better to use these weapons in Kherson than Krakow,” he added. The US and its European allies could also try ramping up production of the systems that are required by the Zelensky government, Kimmitt said, acknowledging that such a move would unlikely have an immediate effect on the situation on the ground. The third option is “to step up the conflict” by providing Ukraine with longer-range systems, such as ATACM missiles, F-16 jets, and Patriots, and “broaden the rules of engagement to attack targets in Crimea and possibly Russia,” he wrote. However, the retired general warned that such escalation would definitely face a “response from Moscow” and create the risk of conflict spilling into Europe. The final available solution, according to Kimmitt, is for Ukraine to “push for an interim diplomatic resolution without (or with) territorial concessions.” “There is little incentive to negotiate” at the moment, but Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky “must recognize that diminishing resupplies would have a disastrous effect on his army, not merely for battlefield operations but for the message of declining outside support it would send to the people of Ukraine,” he insisted. “Beginning the diplomatic resolution would be distasteful, and perhaps seen as defeatist, but as there is little chance of climbing out of the current morass, it may be better to negotiate now than later,” the retired general said. The two sides haven’t sat down at the negotiating table since talks in Istanbul in late March. Moscow, which had initially been optimistic about the prospects for the peace process, later accused Kiev of backtracking on all the progress that had been achieved in Turkey and said it had lost all trust in the Ukrainian negotiators. Russian officials warned that Moscow’s demands would be more extensive if talks were to resume.",2.2407944917405582,2.883504365880475,-0.6427098741399169,8
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562131-kadyrov-hints-at-resignation/,Chechen leader says his time ‘has come’,"Ramzan Kadyrov, who has led Russia’s Chechen Republic for 15 years, has claimed he deserves “an indefinite and long vacation,” after holding his position for too long. Kadyrov shared a video address on his Telegram channel on Saturday, giving his thoughts on becoming the main “long-liver” among the heads of Russian regions. He quipped that probably the “time has come” for him to consider resigning, before he is “kicked out.” The Chechen leader said his youth is gone and ""we will try to leave on time.” “I myself noticed that I’ve been holding on for too long. I think that I fully deserved an indefinite and long vacation,” he commented in his video. Kadyrov cited a Chechen proverb as an example. “We have a saying in the Caucasus, no matter how long-awaited a guest is, it’s nice when he leaves on time.” Kadyrov made similar statements in November 2017 and February 2016, hinting at an impending departure. Kadyrov took charge of Chechnya in 2007, and has remained at the helm ever since.

2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562129-us-rules-out-russia-visa-ban/,US rules out Russia visa ban,"Washington won’t restrict the visas for all Russians as a punishment for Russia’s actions in Ukraine, said John Kirby, US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, in an interview with the Dozhd TV channel that was released on Saturday. The US has introduced visa restrictions for individual Russians whom it considers to be “regime supporters,” Kirby said. However, Washington doesn’t believe that “holding all Russians accountable” is a productive measure, as the US’ decisions shouldn’t be turned into a war with the entire Russian people. It is not the Russian people who should be blamed, but “president [Vladimir] Putin and his cabinet,” he explained. On August 31, the foreign ministers of the 27 EU countries decided to suspend the visa facilitation agreement with Russia, which means reducing the number of visas issued and making it more difficult to obtain them. The details remain unclear, yet it’s certain that the introduction of the ban will result in more difficult, longer and more expensive procedures for Russians to obtain a Schengen visa. Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",3.4298700026928524,4.573187597903796,-1.1433175952109433,2
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562119-ukrainian-boy-rocket-launcher/,Ukrainian boy shoots rocket launcher at his brother,"A live munition went off during an arms show in the east Ukrainian city of Chernigov on Saturday, injuring at least five people including four children, some of them seriously, according to the prosecutor general’s office. Local media have reported a higher tally, saying four adults and four children were injured. The incident occurred during an open-air “weaponry exhibition” held by a local museum. According to media reports, a 10-year-old boy was playing with an anti-tank weapon, believed to be a Soviet-made RPG-18 single-use rocket-propelled grenade. The boy reportedly aimed the weapon at his 12-year-old brother and discharged it, injuring his sibling and several bystanders, including a 2-year-old child. All the injured were apparently hit only by the weapon’s exhaust, as the munition itself blasted away, striking the roof of a house, according to local authorities. It was not immediately clear whether the boy was able to ready the grenade launcher on his own or if the weapon was put on display in its battle-ready state. RPGs of that type need to be unfolded before use, and once in that state, have no safety features. Ukrainian officials have provided conflicting accounts of the incident and the exact nature of the arms show. According to prosecutors, the event was staged by a local territorial defense unit, displaying its own armaments. The head of the local military-civilian administration, Vyacheslav Chaus, claimed the origins of the “dangerous exhibits” were unclear and the whole event was organized to provide an “interactive” experience for children. However, the Chernigov city council insists it was not aware of the event, and did not provide permission to hold it.

The incident occurred on Saturday, when a group of dozen tourists was at an altitude of around 4,150 meters, according to the statement by the agency. “According to preliminary data, five people have died after falling from great height,” the investigative committee said, adding that another person has been severely injured and remains unconscious. One of the guides who accompanied the tourists also fractured his leg, with his colleague calling for help via a satellite phone, the statement read. The investigative committee announced that it has launched a criminal case on inflicting death by negligence over the incident. The emergency ministry said that it has sent its rescuers to the Klyuchevskaya Sopka. With the altitude being too high for the helicopter to reach, they would have to walk to the site of the accident by foot from 3,300 meters. The tourists in the ill-fated group had arrived from different parts of Russia, including the capital, Moscow, their climb being organized by a firm from the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. At 4,649 meters in height, Klyuchevskaya Sopka is the tallest active volcano in Eurasia.

2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/561994-ukraine-conflict-paid-bloody-sport/,How some Western 'fans' of Ukraine are turning the conflict into a paid-for blood sport,"For many Westerners, watching the conflict in Ukraine is a lot like watching a spectator sport. It’s a mindset exacerbated by the bombardment of pro-Ukrainian propaganda in the media, through the mythmaking of fictional Ukrainian superheroes and the dehumanization of Russians – including civilians. And now, that indulgence in violence has taken on a new level, becoming almost like an interactive video game in which far away observers can become indirect participants in the conflict. Those who’ve bought into the narrative proudly sport the team colors of the blue and yellow and indulge themselves in the merchandise promoting their team – all from the safety of their monitors. From Zelensky bobblehead dolls and custom Lego figures to “Saint Javelin” stickers, war profiteers (who call themselves “volunteers,” of course) are now selling messages on artillery shells that land in residential neighborhoods in Donbass, as detailed by the Washington Post. People can now participate in the bloody spectacle by paying money to put their slogans on bombs and drones directed at Russians and the Russian-speaking population of Donbass. Thousands of Westerners not directly affected by the violence are happily playing this interactive video game, sponsoring messages like “Hey Ruskie! I hope you like Ukrainian heavy metal,” to the less subtle “F**k Russians!,” which the Western government-funded ""Kyiv Independent"" has happily cited as examples. It’s a practice made easy by dehumanizing every Russian-speaking person in Donbass by calling them “orcs” or comparing Russian forces to the medieval Mongol hordes, aided by the creation of fictional heroes like the “Ghost of Kiev” and the Ukrainian troops who surrendered on Snake Island – false narratives eagerly promoted by tabloids and cheerleaders like US Congressman Adam Kinzinger and professional Russophobe Malcolm Nance. There’s a certain level of audacity required to be so involved in a conflict between two countries, one of which (the one you are rooting for) many couldn’t even identify on a map six months ago. Those who indulge in the commodification of real-world suffering aren’t just wishing for the deaths of people they don’t know, but happily pay to become indirect participants. One of the non-profits responsible for penning the messages eagerly admits that it harnesses “hatred of Russians” into getting people to pay for it. “Some volunteers take orders right on the front line, writing messages on shells with a permanent marker. Others take a more professional approach, painting the shells in advance and delivering the already branded ammunition to soldiers,” the Kyiv Independent reported. It’s a business, if a bloody one – adding slogans to artillery shells can come as cheap as $10 for generic lines to as much as $500 for more elaborate custom designs. Those who pay for their messages to be written on bombs are told that the money is used to buy fuel, food, and munitions for Ukrainian troops in the front lines. The more you contribute, the more accomplished you feel – not that there’s any way to track where your money’s going. The question as to why the Ukrainian military would need donations when it’s being bankrolled by Western governments – through taxpayer money, of course – isn’t one that even seems to cross the minds of anyone immersed in this new form of interactive entertainment. Writing messages on bombs isn’t anything new – it’s a well-documented practice that’s been done since the Second World War – but commodifying it for a global audience tuned in to real-time bloodsport is a wholly new development made possible with the rise of social media. It’s bread and circuses for the 21st century bourgeoisie – folks who want to feel like they’re accomplishing something while ignoring the social collapse happening all around them. And in case you’re wondering – no, you’re not allowed to cheer for the opposing team. Don’t question it. If Russians ran similar campaigns to write “F**k Americans” on IEDs used by the Taliban against US forces in Afghanistan, there would be Congressional pushes to declare war on Russia and no end of pearl-clutching in the media. As long as there’s a demand for entertainment, someone will provide it, and the propagandists will justify it – no matter how terrible the costs are for the civilians on the receiving end of those bombs.",2.441180979059036,3.6521524828354615,-1.2109715037764253,3

Over 40 motor boats, divided into two groups and carrying over 250 Ukrainian special operations troops and foreign mercenaries, tried to land on the coast of the Kakhovka reservoir not far from Energodar, host city of the nuclear power plant, a ministry statement said on Saturday. The attackers were quickly spotted and struck by Russia’s Su-30 jets and Ka-52 attack helicopters. Those strikes sunk some 20 boats, while the rest turned around and retreated. The remaining Ukrainian troops were than targeted by the Russian artillery as they tried getting ashore in the Ukrainian-controlled territory, the ministry said. According to Moscow, the failed attack on the nuclear power plant saw 47 Ukrainian service personnel killed, including ten foreign mercenaries, with at least 20 others wounded. Kiev’s special forces attempted to storm the facility despite the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) being there, the defense ministry stressed. Ukraine attempted a similar attack ahead of the arrival of the IAEA team at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant on Thursday. It was also repelled by Russian troops, with the Ukrainian assault force suffering heavy losses. Moscow has suggested that Kiev’s plan was to capture the nuclear plant and then use the staff of the UN nuclear watchdog as “human shields” to maintain control over it. Russia has been insisting on international inspectors coming to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant as it accused Ukraine of repeatedly shelling the facility in recent weeks and of risking a disaster that could affect many countries in Europe. Ukraine claims that the Russian forces who have been in control of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March have turned it into a military base and that they’re striking the station themselves in order to pin the blame on Kiev. IAEA chef Rafael Grossi, who headed the team of inspectors at the facility, has confirmed that the physical integrity of the plant “has been violated several times,” but added that it was impossible to determine if the damage was deliberate or accidental.",5.151654422860828,4.335435071024776,0.8162193518360521,9

2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562104-german-ex-chancellor-ukraine-crimea/,German ex-chancellor weighs in on Crimea,"There is no prospect of Ukraine retaking Crimea by force, as the vast majority of the local population are ethnic Russians, former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has claimed in an interview. Speaking to Spain’s ABC newspaper last Saturday, Schroeder said: “the idea that President Zelensky could reconquer [Crimea] militarily makes no sense.” Schroder, who led Germany from 1998 until 2005, pointed out that it was Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev who made Crimea part of the then-Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, thinking the USSR would “last as long as the Catholic Church.” Schroeder mentioned his own repeated condemnation of Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine, describing it as a “mistake of the Russian Government.” However, he expressed doubt as to whether distancing himself personally from Russian President Vladimir Putin “would do any good.” “There must be concessions on both sides” if the parties in the conflict are serious about peace, the ex-chancellor insisted. However, according to Schroeder, such negotiations cannot succeed without the consent of the US as “this conflict is part of a larger geopolitical confrontation.” The former chancellor believes Washington is anxious as it knows it is losing its global hegemony, with China being the main rival. Russia, however, is not on a par with the US economically, and is therefore not a serious competitor, Schroeder opined. The 78-year-old veteran of German politics said that “Beijing is acting in this conflict in an extraordinarily rational way,” buying Russian oil and gas at a discount. European nations, by contrast, might be making a big mistake by relying too much on the US, and could end up losing their autonomy. However, there is currently no threat to the existence of the European Union in Schroeder’s eyes. He described as a “positive step” Sweden’s and Finland’s decision to join NATO.

2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/news/562097-ukraine-raid-speedboats-energodar/,Kiev attempts new raid near Zaporozhye nuclear plant – local official,"Ukrainian forces launched another attempted raid on the Russian-held town of Energodar shortly after midnight on Saturday, after shelling the area in the vicinity of Zaporozhye nuclear plant, according to a top local official. Several sabotage groups used at least 15 speedboats in an attempt to cross the Kakhovka Reservoir, local military-civilian administration member Vladimir Rogov claimed. The groups were allegedly seeking to land in three different locations – the nuclear city of Energodar itself, and the nearby towns of Vasilyevka and Dneproprudnoye. The first unverified reports of multiple speedboats moving out from the Ukraine-controlled shore of the reservoir emerged around midnight, coinciding with allegations of renewed shelling of the city of Energodar. After receiving and confirming information about the swarm of boats, Russian forces allegedly deployed Ka-52 attack helicopters and successfully repelled the attempted assault, Rogov said in a follow-up Telegram post around 2:45am. The Russian Defense Ministry is expected to share more details about the engagement soon, he added. The alleged new botched raid comes just two days after Kiev forces reportedly attempted to seize the Zaporozhye NPP shortly before a team of experts with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – including the organization’s head, Rafael Grossi – arrived at the plant for an inspection. The failed September 1 operation was aimed at capturing the nuclear plant and using the personnel of the UN nuclear watchdog as “human shields” to maintain control over the facility, the Russian military suggested. The renewed attacks come after the departure of the main IAEA mission, even as Grossi said that six of the agency’s experts stayed behind in Energodar. Four of them will return after the weekend, while two will remain to keep a “permanent presence” at the NPP. Energodar and the Zaporozhye facility have been under Russian control since early March, and functioned without problems until drone and artillery attacks began in July. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, there have been 29 attacks against the Zaporozhye facility since July 18, involving 120 artillery projectiles and 16 kamikaze drones. Kiev has argued that the shellings were false-flag operations carried out by Moscow to make Ukraine look bad, but also that Russia was using the plant as a base for heavy artillery and equipment. On Friday, the Ukrainian General Staff admitted for the first time that Kiev’s troops have targeted the area of the nuclear power plant, allegedly attempting to strike Russian artillery systems. Moscow has consistently denied the accusations, saying that only lightly armed guards were deployed at the facility to ensure its security.",5.281750915543019,3.863144198883636,1.418606716659383,9
2022-09-03,https://www.rt.com/russia/562096-husband-murder-beauty-queen/,Husband sentenced for Russian beauty queen murder,"A Russian man found guilty of murdering his wife, a former beauty pageant star, has been sentenced to more than a decade in prison by a Moscow court, after horrific details of the case shocked the nation. The Sherbinsky District Court of Moscow convicted Alexander Popov for the murder of his wife Kseniya Popova (née Sapozhnikova) on Friday, handing down a 12-year prison sentence for the grisly crime. “After examining the evidence presented by the parties, evaluating the case materials, the court delivered a guilty verdict, according to which Alexander Popov was found guilty of the murder of his wife … and sentenced him to imprisonment for a term of 12 years,” the court said in a statement on Telegram. Popov initially went to the police in January to report his wife missing, claiming she had gone on a trip overseas and never returned. However, law enforcement soon grew suspicious of the man and made him their prime suspect, finding that Popova never left Russia, while interviews with her relatives revealed that they had received odd messages from her which did not fit with her usual mannerisms. Further doubts about Popov’s story were raised when officers discovered he had sent his daughter away to a friend’s house sometime in August 2021, after which he was seen hauling large trash bags out of his home. Popov eventually confessed to the murder after contacting the police, reportedly admitting to killing his wife and even showed the investigators where he disposed of her body. While he later retracted some of confessions, he was nonetheless convicted based on the evidence against him, though the court noted he still has a chance to appeal within 10 days of his official guilty verdict. As a young adult, Popova was a well-known beauty queen, and was crowned the winner of the ‘Miss Kuzbass’ contest in 2010. Born in the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, she also sought to compete in the ‘Miss Russia’ 2011 contest. She moved to Moscow with her husband in 2020, after Popov found a job working for the Moscow Metro. He had previously served as a government official in their hometown.",3.982306881672845,5.850438945936207,-1.8681320642633623,5

The attack comes after Ukraine’s military admitted to bombing the area for the first time, and follows a failed attempt by Kiev’s commandos to seize the plant while UN inspectors were visiting. Four rounds impacted the area of the Zaporozhye NPP, Rogov said on Telegram shortly before midnight on Friday, with at least one heavy projectile allegedly landing between reactors two and three, while three struck about 400 meters to the east. The shelling has cut the main power line along the Dnieper river, so the ZNPP is having to divert power for its own operational needs, he added. The power plant had returned to normal operation by 2 am local time, with two of the reactors running, RIA Novosti reported citing local officials. However, around 20 explosions were heard in Energodar again. The renewed attack comes after the departure of the main International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission, which visited the facility on Thursday. However, IAEA director Rafael Grossi told reporters on Friday that six of the agency’s experts stayed behind in Energodar. Four of them will return after the weekend and two will remain as a “permanent presence” at the NPP, Grossi said after landing in Vienna. “If something happens or if any limitation comes, they are going to be reporting it to us. It’s no longer a matter of A said this and B said the contrary,” Grossi said. “For those who may have intentions on the plant, knowing that international inspectors are there, witnessing and informing immediately what is happening, has, I think, an inherent very important stabilizing effect.” Meanwhile, the Ukrainian General Staff admitted for the first time that Kiev’s troops have targeted the area of the nuclear power plant. In an official briefing on Friday they claimed to have destroyed three Russian artillery systems “in the areas of the settlements of Kherson and Energodar.” Previously, Kiev claimed that Russian troops stationed in the vicinity were staging false-flag attacks to make Ukraine look bad. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, there have been 29 attacks against the Zaporozhye facility since July 18, involving 120 artillery projectiles and 16 kamikaze drones. On Thursday, as the IAEA mission approached the plant, a group of Ukrainian commandos landed in Energodar using boats and tried to take over the compound. Both the initial wave and their reinforcements were eliminated by Russian troops, Moscow said. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky complained on Friday that Grossi had not demanded the demilitarization of the Zaporozhye NPP and its surroundings, calling it “the key security point of our agreements.” Meanwhile, his adviser Mikhail Podolyak told Ukrainian media that no international organization, including the IAEA, ought to be trusted.",4.721439628965934,3.8128138696168423,0.9086257593490914,9

Previously, Kiev had claimed that Russian forces used the plant as a military base; now it says all troops have relocated due to the visit by IAEA inspectors. “In the areas of the settlements of Kherson and Energodar, accurate strikes by our troops destroyed three enemy artillery systems, as well as an ammunition depot and up to a company of personnel,” said the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the daily briefing. The military also claimed that, due to the arrival of the IAEA inspection team, the Russian “occupiers removed all military equipment from the territory of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. About 100 units moved to the plant ‘Atom Energomash’ and the rest were dispersed in the nearest settlements.” Energodar and the Zaporozhye facility have been under Russian control since early March, and functioned without problems until drone and artillery attacks began in July.

On Friday, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Ukrainian claims that Moscow was using the facility to attack Ukrainian positions “with long-range artillery systems” were “blatant lies.” “I state with confidence that we do not have heavy weapons at the territory of the nuclear power stations and in adjacent neighborhoods,” Shoigu said at a meeting in Moscow, adding that he hoped the IAEA inspectors would testify to this as well. Shoigu also said there have been 29 attacks against the Zaporozhye facility since July 18, involving 120 artillery projectiles and 16 kamikaze drones.

Mirotvorets, or ‘Peacemaker’, is a public database of individuals, whom anonymous moderators consider a threat to Ukrainian national security. Gorbachev is now listed among such people. After he passed away on Tuesday at the age of 91, the Ukrainian website updated his profile, adding the date of death and stamping the word “liquidated” in red letters across his photo. Though the term implies state assassination, the treatment is the same that Mirotvorets uses for all supposed enemies of Ukraine that it reports as dying, regardless of the cause. Gorbachev was added to the Mirotvorets blacklist over a May 2016 interview with the British newspaper The Sunday Times, in which he said: “I’m always with the free will of the people and most in Crimea wanted to be reunited with Russia.” He was referring to the referendum held in the former Ukrainian region after breaking from Kiev in the wake of the 2014 Maidan coup. The people of the Crimean peninsula voted overwhelmingly to reunite with Russia, which Moscow granted. Kiev and its allies described the plebiscite as conducted “at gunpoint” and refused to acknowledge its outcome. Mirotvorets is technically a private enterprise, but is widely believed to be connected with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. Anton Gerashchenko, who was a ministerial advisor at the time the website was launched, was a vocal promoter of the database and indicated that he had input on its content. Gorbachev’s interview put him at odds with the new authorities in Kiev in a more direct way too.

They look extremely ineffective, extremely cowardly and extremely unprofessional,” Mikhail Podolyak said in an interview on Thursday evening. This applies “not only to the IAEA”, but also to the UN, Amnesty International, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Ukrainian official claimed, adding: “By default, you should not trust them.” Podolyak’s remarks came as he criticized the IAEA mission to the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, which arrived earlier in the day. He expressed his low expectations from the mission, based on the positive remarks that Director General Rafael Grossi made after touring the facility in Ukraine. The Ukrainian official said he was willing to give the IAEA inspectors the benefit of the doubt and wait for them make an official report that would “show the depth of their inner destruction”. He explained his concerns, citing several aspects of Grossi’s visit. They include its relatively short duration, which Podolyak assessed was too short for a proper fact-finding mission. He also criticized the willingness of the IAEA chief to talk to a representative of the Russian atomic energy body Rosatom, who, Podolyak said, “delivered a strange long speech” to the UN official. The IAEA experts arrived at the station from Kiev despite continued military action in its vicinity. Kiev and Moscow have accused each other of being behind the shelling and of trying to derail the inspection. Some members of the mission stayed behind to monitor the situation, while Grossi and others left. Podolyak said the IAEA should blame Russia for attacks on the plant, and if their report fails to do so, only stating that inspectors witnessed evidence of strikes, his opinion about the organization will be vindicated. President Vladimir Zelensky too has expressed skepticism about the IAEA visit to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. In a video statement on Thursday evening, he accused Grossi of failing to secure access to the station to “independent journalists”, who wanted to visit with the inspectors. Russia has accused Kiev of trying to send intelligence agents under the guise of the press. The visit was covered by Russia-vetted journalists, whom Zelensky branded “a crowd of propagandists.”",3.5271897678004764,3.387993331189758,0.13919643661071834,9

On Tuesday, Russia’s Defense Ministry issued a statement claiming that its troops had killed over a thousand Ukrainian service members as well as “foreign mercenaries” and destroyed dozens of tanks and armored military vehicles in just one day. A day earlier, officials in Moscow proclaimed that the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson region had “failed miserably.” The Ukrainian government has been talking about a counteroffensive in the south of the country for several months now.

The ongoing mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will hopefully verify this, he added. Speaking during a working meeting, Russia's top defense official reported that since July 18 there have been 29 attacks against the Ukrainian plant, which is located in the city of Energodar. Some 120 artillery projectiles and 16 kamikaze drones were used, he added. Shoigu dismissed as “blatant lies” Ukrainian claims that Russia was using the facility to attack Ukrainian positions “with long-range artillery systems”. “I state with confidence that we do not have heavy weapons at the territory of the nuclear power stations and in adjacent neighborhoods,” the minister said. “I hope [members of] the IAEA inspection will confirm it with their own eyes.” The delegation of the UN’s nuclear watchdog arrived at the station on Thursday for a long-awaited on-site inspection. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky claimed that Russia was trying to turn the mission “into a fruitless excursion” and accused IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi of failing to secure access to the station for a group of “independent journalists” who’d wanted to travel with the inspectors from Ukraine. “We hope that the mission will make objective conclusions from the situation at the plant nevertheless,” Zelensky said in a video address on Thursday evening. He added that Ukraine’s goal was “demilitarization” of the Zaporozhye site. Moscow previously said it would not accept a full pullout of troops away from Energodar because it didn’t trust Kiev to do the same. On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry reported thwarting a Ukrainian attempt to capture the power station through an amphibious commando operation. Kiev claims that Russia is the party that has been launching attacks on the plant, with a purported goal of smearing Ukraine’s reputation. It also reported that Russian heavy weapons were present at the facility. During the Friday meeting, Shoigu stressed that Kiev risked a nuclear disaster by attacking the Zaporozhye site. He accused the US and the EU of “hushing up” Ukraine’s role and in doing so “encouraging” Kiev to launch more strikes. “All responsibility for possible emergencies caused by possible future provocations will lay on the Ukrainian authorities,” he warned.",3.3433198197186833,3.1055685886034063,0.23775123111527696,9

Earlier this week, the bloc suspended an agreement with Moscow that previously allowed Russians to receive travel visas to the Schengen Area under a simplified procedure, as part of sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. However, Brussels stopped short of introducing a full visa ban, despite calls from some member states, including Finland and Estonia. Shmygal told Germany’s DPA news agency that he believes harsher measures should be implemented against Russian travellers. “Unfortunately, this is not just Putin’s war,” he said, citing polls that reveal large public support in Russia for the military offensive in Ukraine. “It’s impossible to divide the Russians into good and bad ones,” he added. It is “unbearable” for the Kiev government that while the conflict continues, some Russians can “make a nice life in the West, go on vacations, live la dolce vita,” the premier insisted. “There should be a cold shower for the Russian society in the form of a visa ban for tourists and students,” Shmygal added. Similar pleas have come from Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who told the Washington Post last month that he wanted the Russians to be barred from the West for at least a year. They should “live in their own world until they change their philosophy,” he said. Moscow earlier said that the idea of a visa ban was “Russophobic” and resembled the policies pursued by Nazi Germany in mid-20th century. Russia sent troops into Ukraine in late February, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

Shortly before the UN inspectors arrived, Russia accused Ukraine of shelling the area and sending a commando team to seize the plant. “We are finishing our long-awaited visit to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant,” Grossi said in a short video posted on Twitter. “I have just completed a first tour of the key areas that we wanted to see in this first approach to the whole facility.” “Of course, there is a lot more to do. My team is staying on, and more importantly – most importantly – we are establishing a continued presence by the IAEA here,” he added, against the backdrop of the Reactor 3 building. Grossi personally led the IAEA mission to inspect the plant, which traveled through Kiev and the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporozhye before arriving in Russian-held Energodar on Thursday. After a delay at a Ukrainian checkpoint, they toured the facility for several hours, before heading back to Ukrainian-controlled territory. According to RT’s Alexey Repin, who was on site, the IAEA team also inspected the damage from Thursday morning’s Ukrainian shelling. They also chose to tour the facility on foot rather than drive, as originally expected. Zaporozhye is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, and has been under Russian control since early March. Russia has called for an IAEA visit since June. In August, the nuclear site was targeted by regular artillery and drone attacks, which Moscow and Kiev blamed on each other.

The Russian president made the remarks on Thursday during an open class held for Russian schoolchildren called the “Important Talk.” “Everyone believes that some kind of aggression on the part of Russia is happening today. No one understands or knows that after the coup d’état in Ukraine in 2014, the people of Donetsk, Lugansk, Crimea – a significant part of them, in any case – did not want to recognize the outcome of this coup,” Putin said.

An anti-Russian enclave is being created in the territory of present-day Ukraine, which is threatening our country. Putin also touched upon the state of and approach to school education in Ukraine, telling schoolchildren about what Russia’s Minister of Education Sergey Kravtsov witnessed during his recent visit to Donetsk and other territories liberated during the ongoing conflict.

The botched raid came shortly before a team of experts with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – including the organization’s head, Rafael Grossi – arrived at the plant for an inspection. According to the Russian military, multiple Ukrainian “saboteur groups” crossed the Kakhovka Reservoir in speedboats and barges near the plant early in the morning, but were intercepted and destroyed by Russian troops and National Guard forces. “Obviously, if the operation of the Kiev regime to seize the station was a success, the head of the IAEA, [Rafael] Grossi, and the experts of the mission would become a ‘human shield’ for Ukrainian saboteurs to prevent any attempts to destroy them by the Russian armed forces,” the Russian MoD said in a statement. The operation aimed at capturing the nuclear power plant appears to have been “planned in advance by Zelensky’s regime,” the Russian military suggested. Moreover, the delay in Grossi’s visit to the installation, originally planned for August 31, stemmed from the Ukrainians’ need for more time to get ready for that “military provocation,” it alleged. The ultimate goal of the operation was seizing control of the plant, while the presence of the IAEA team would have allowed the “saboteurs” to not only take cover from any potential Russian actions, but also to cement the new “status quo,” the military said. The success of the operation would have likely been reinforced by a “new wave of loud statements from Washington and European capitals, calling upon Russia to establish a ‘demilitarized zone’ around the nuclear plant, with IAEA observers guarded by Ukrainian troops,” it asserted. “In this regard, we fully understand the complete silence of all Western sponsors of the Zelensky regime, which de-facto confirms their tacit participation in the preparation of today’s provocation at the Zaporozhye plant,” the military concluded.",3.428350645966774,4.444702000190415,-1.0163513542236413,9

Speaking on Thursday during a virtual class for all Belarusian school and university students, Lukashenko said that “Ukraine is being divided” and that a “conflict is brewing between the president and the military.” According to the Belarusian leader, the Ukrainian army is the only power in the country that can “pound the table and say: let’s talk or else Ukraine will be wiped off the face of the earth.” Lukashenko argued that the country's military, which has first-hand experience of what is actually happening on the frontline, “sees that it’s hopeless.” Meanwhile, he warned that the conflict in the neighboring country could spiral into the “most dreadful confrontation” involving the use of weapons of mass destruction. He also stated that “Russia cannot suffer a defeat there,” adding that Minsk stands firmly by its ally, Moscow. Lukashenko went on to call out those who describe Russia and Belarus as “aggressors.” He argued that Moscow’s military operation was pre-emptive in nature, helping to avert an imminent Ukrainian missile strike on the southern regions of Belarus, including against Russian forces that had not yet been withdrawn from the country after military drills. He also alleged that the Russian military took out Ukraine's missile units half an hour before President Vladimir Putin announced the start of Moscow’s offensive in late February. Lukashenko suggested that the West – and the US in particular – had been behind the preparation for the planned attack against Belarus, claiming those powers would still “do everything to bring Russia to its knees.” “And Russia cannot kneel,” he concluded.",2.5491048050018663,3.547750213657765,-0.9986454086558987,8

The top diplomat made the remarks on Thursday as he met students and staff at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO). “If [NATO] bases are created on the territory of Finland and Sweden, or rather, if they decide to create these bases for them – I am convinced that the Americans will have the key word ... Depending on how all of this materializes, of course, we will make a decision to strengthen our capabilities in Russia’s northwest,” Lavrov stated, without providing any further details. In any case, launching NATO bases in the territory of the two Nordic nations would “radically” expand the “line of contact” between Russia and the alliance, the minister added. Finland and Sweden scrambled to join the US-led bloc earlier this year, citing the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While formally keeping a neutral status for decades, the two Nordic nations have been closely cooperating with the military alliance for a long time now. The accession process ran into a deadlock after a major NATO country, Turkey, objected to the plans to accept Sweden and Finland. Ankara accused the two countries of functioning as “guesthouses for terrorist organizations” and hosting members of outlawed Kurdish groups it deems to be “terrorists.” The deadlock was ultimately resolved in June during the NATO summit in Madrid after a series of intense negotiations. Turkey agreed to formally back the accession of Stockholm and Helsinki to the military bloc on the condition that they crack down on groups Ankara deems to be “terrorists” and address other bilateral issues, such as an arms embargo.

That's according to the country’s former president, Viktor Yushchenko. He told newspaper Ukrainska Pravda that t the tone changed significantly after Kiev accused Russian troops of committing war crimes in Bucha and other towns outside of Kiev in the spring. “I will not name any names, but presidents and prime ministers were arriving from Europe in groups with one message for President Zelensky: ‘Sit at the negotiating table, and we will figure something out later,” Yuschenko insisted. “But after seeing Bucha, Gostomel, they began to understand that the Ukrainian people will not grant the authorities permission … to sit down for negotiations and say, ‘Let’s pay for the peace with some part of the national sovereign territory.’ No one would even have such an idea!” Russia launched its military operation in the neighboring country in late February, taking large chunks of lands in southern Ukraine under its control and gradually pushing Ukrainian troops out of Donbass. Moscow denies that its soldiers have committed war crimes and maintains that its troops only strike military targets. Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine effectively broke down in late March, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the negotiations. Ukrainian and Western officials have since argued that talks with Moscow would only make sense if Kiev gains the upper hand on the battlefield and can negotiate from a position of strength. “The Russian authorities will surely offer negotiations to us if they see the strength of the world that supports Ukraine,” Zelensky said on Monday.",4.280113605202139,4.777357061216009,-0.49724345601386943,2

In one incident, two separate “sabotage groups” with a total strength of up to 60 troops used seven speedboats to cross the Kakhovka Reservoir and land about three kilometers from the nuclear facility to the northeast early in the morning, according to the claim. The Ukrainian commandos were presumably hoping to capture the station from the Russian troops who are guarding it, but were blocked, the ministry indicted. The Russian military deployed attack helicopters to support the plant’s guards, it added. A separate engagement took place about an hour later to the west of Energodar, which hosts the power plant, Moscow explained. Russian forces attacked and sank two watercraft that were carrying Ukrainian amphibious tactical teams, the statement said. The ministry also claimed that about two hours after the landing of the commando units, Ukrainian artillery began shelling a specific location near Energodar. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who are on their way to visit the facility, are scheduled to pass by the area, according to the report. “The provocation of the Kiev regime is aimed at derailing the arrival of the IAEA mission to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant,” the ministry said. The plant and the city have been under Russian control since March. In August, the nuclear site was targeted by regular artillery and drone attacks, which Moscow and Kiev blamed on each other. Ukrainian officials also claimed that the Russian military was using the plant as a military base, stationing heavy weapons there. Moscow denied the accusations, stating that it only had lightly armed guards defending the facility. The IAEA mission was dispatched this week after several delays. Moscow and Kiev both welcomed the visit and pledged to facilitate it, while each accused the other side of attempting to prevent inspectors from reaching the target. The UN’s nuclear watchdog is expected to assess the situation on the ground, inspect the safety of the power plant, and verify that non-proliferation measures remain in place. The Zaporozhye facility is the largest of its kind in Europe and stores dozens of tons of enriched uranium and plutonium in its reactor cores and storage facilities, according to IAEA figures. Energoatom, the Ukrainian nuclear operator, claimed on Thursday that Russia launched mortar strikes at the plant, causing the shutdown of one of its two currently operating reactors. Russian-allied local authorities also reported the shutdown, citing unconfirmed reports, but said it was Ukraine that attacked the facility.

A Russian couple with a London address have rented the villa for the month of August, paying the princely sum of €50,000 ($50,237), the newspaper reported. The villa, located in the seaside town of Forte dei Marmi, was bought by Zelensky for four million euros while the Ukrainian leader was still an actor, the report added. Photos posted on social media by the couple confirmed that they were staying in Zelensky’s property, Il Tirreno stated. Corriere Della Serra, another Italian newspaper, contacted the realtor managing the property, who said that “The tenants weren’t Russian, but I can’t say more because privacy prevents me.” However, the paper said that the tenants are likely of Russian origin, “but have long since had their residence and perhaps English citizenship.” Ever since Russian forces entered Ukraine in February, Zelensky has urged the EU to deny visas to Russian visitors. The Russian people, he told the Washington Post earlier this month, “should live in their own world until they change their philosophy.” Back in March, Zelensky specifically called on the Italian government to “block all [Russian] real estate, accounts and yachts, from the Scheherazade to the smallest ones,"" referring to a 140-meter (460 ft) superyacht allegedly belonging to a wealthy Russian individual that was moored at the Italian port of Marina di Carrara. All flights between the EU and Russia have been halted since the earliest days of Moscow’s military operation, and the bloc suspended a bilateral visa facilitation agreement with Russia on Wednesday.

Russia reserves its right to take any necessary retaliatory steps, should they “be symmetric, asymmetric or some other that the EU would not expect,” Grushko added, suggesting that the visa decision will ultimately do the bloc more harm than good. If Brussels decided to shoot themselves in the foot again, that’s their own choice. Earlier in the day, the EU’s foreign ministers agreed to “fully” suspend the visa facilitation agreement with Russia. Announcing the decision, EU top diplomat Josep Borrell said the move would “significantly reduce the number of new visas issued by the EU Member States” to Russian nationals. “Until now, it was partially suspended for special collectives, groups of people – officials, entrepreneurs – and now it is fully suspended,” Borrell said, without providing any timeframe for the move to actually get implemented. At the same time, the bloc will continue to issue visas for “specific groups” of Russians, such as those who seem to oppose the current political leadership of the country. “There is a common understanding that this will allow for visas to be granted on an individual basis [after] a thorough assessment of each individual case, and especially for specific groups of people,” Borrell explained, insisting that the EU did not want to “cut” itself off “from the Russian civil society” and “from those Russians who are against the war in Ukraine.”",4.341846037638353,3.974210618484212,0.3676354191541411,8

Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev of shelling the nuclear facility. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi made his remarks on Wednesday at a press briefing in Kiev, before inspectors traveled to Zaporozhye. The Zaporozhye facility is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, and was seized by Russian troops several days after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in February. As it continued to operate with local staff under Russian control, the facility has come under artillery and drone attacks, with Russia blaming Kiev for the strikes. Ukraine has alternated between blaming Russia for the shelling, and accusing the Russian military of using the plant as cover for its soldiers. While the US has accused Russia of firing from the plant, a senior military official admitted on Monday that “there’s probably a likelihood” that Ukrainian forces have bombarded the nuclear facility. Moscow insists that it does not keep heavy weapons, including artillery, stationed at the plant. Grossi’s remarks were welcomed by Russia’s permanent representative to international organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov. In a series of posts to Twitter, Ulyanov said that Moscow has supported the IAEA’s mission “from the very beginning,” and wished the inspectors “productive work on the site.” Shortly before the IAEA delegation arrived at the plant, an official in the Russian-allied administration of Zaporozhye Region, Vladimir Rogov, said that a group of would-be saboteurs were arrested in the nearby city of Energodar.

The total volume of what was stolen amounts to 22 sea transport containers, 389 freight train cars and 220 trucks, Shevchenko claimed. The activist named several senior officials in Zaporozhye Region as suspects and shamed them for posing as Ukrainian patriots while profiting at the expense of the country. Shevchenko is a controversial figure in Ukraine. He emerged from the radical wing of the so-called Maidan protests of 2013-2014 and made a name for himself as an associate of militia commander and former MP Konstantin Grishin, who prefers to be called by his nom de guerre Semyon Semenchenko. Last year, Shevchenko and Semenchenko were arrested on allegations of involvement with an illegal militia. The arrests came after Shevchenko had accused the office of President Vladimir Zelensky of derailing an intelligence operation aimed at luring a group of Russian security contractors to Ukraine and detaining them. Shevchenko believes that his arrest and that of Semenchenko were an act of revenge by Zelensky’s chief-of-staff, Andrey Ermak. In his post about the raids in Zaporozhye Region, he linked the suspects with the president and the head of his office, pointing out that the officials targeted had been appointed by Kiev.",3.4214157246683263,4.1823400466550975,-0.7609243219867712,5

The report says the alternative form of administration could provide enhanced protection for the lungs. On Wednesday, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology and the Russian Direct Investment Fund announced the publication of an article on the nasal version of the Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine in the international peer reviewed medical journal Emerging Microbes & Infections. The piece details the tests conducted by Russian researchers on mice and Goeldi’s marmosets to determine its efficacy. According to the article, not only did the nasal form elicit a powerful and lasting immune response, comparable to that seen in the intramuscularly administered vaccine, but also provided especially strong protection to the nasopharynx and the lungs. This effect, if replicated in humans, could come in particularly handy in the fight against new Covid-19 strains, which typically enter the body via the nose and affect the lungs, the researchers said. The piece also stated that the nasal form of Sputnik V is as effective in minimizing fatality rates in patients as its conventional, intramuscular version.",3.4621375981508513,2.3629125335999888,1.0992250645508626,6

Gorbachev passed away at the age of 91 on Tuesday. “Mikhail Gorbachev was a politician and statesman who made a profound impact on the course of world history,” Putin wrote in a condolence letter to Gorbachev’s family. He led our country through a period of difficult, dramatic changes, and large-scale external, economic and societal challenges. He understood deeply that the reforms were necessary and strived to offer solutions to urgent problems. After becoming the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, Gorbachev launched sweeping reforms aimed at the liberalization of the economy and public life. His tenure saw the fall of the Berlin Wall and end of the Cold War. He resigned at the end of 1991 with the breakup of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990.",3.215052980634875,3.199822619429272,0.01523036120560306,4
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561868-zakharova-eu-unity-dissent/,Russia points to cause of Western divisions,"Russia does not pursue a foreign policy aimed at dividing the West, or the EU in particular, despite claims to the contrary, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova explained. However, the bloc could benefit from being more tolerant of dissenting voices, considering how much it has hurt itself with its ‘united’ approach to Russia, she outlined in a radio interview on Wednesday. Zakharova compared the EU to the group of blind men in the painting ‘The Blind Leading the Blind’ by Dutch Renaissance artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder. “They are united. No one in this group, who are being led towards a ditch, voices any doubt, objects, asks questions or protests,” she said. Brussels’ approach towards Russia is similar, the spokeswoman suggested, noting the “strange suicidal initiatives that are attributed to the EU, but are actually imposed or planted” by an outside force. She added that when it comes to Russia, the bloc does not tolerate dissenting voices – which is surprising, given that the EU claims to cherish democracy, a system in which opinions that differ from the dominant line of thinking are supposed to be appreciated. While many Western politicians claim that Russia wants to divide the bloc with its policies, this is not the case, Zakharova said. “If anything, our goal is to return common sense into international relations.” Her remarks came during a discussion in the radio interview on the EU’s proposed ban on visas for Russians. The plan is promoted by Ukraine and some Eastern European member states, but Western European nations such as Germany and France believe less radical restrictions should be adopted. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki suggested this week that an implosion within the EU could occur unless all member states follow the hardline Russia policy that Warsaw has adopted.",2.9724808211819855,2.4187045010441084,0.5537763201378771,8
2022-08-31,https://www.rt.com/russia/561858-iaea-ukraine-nuclear-mission-zaporozhye/,UN inspectors head to Zaporozhye NPP,"A delegation of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has left the Ukrainian capital for the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant on Wednesday in order to assess the state of the facility amid fighting between Russia and Kiev’s forces. Before heading off, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told reporters that the inspectors intend to spend “a few days” at the plant and will report back afterwards. On Tuesday, however, the pro-Russian local authorities said that the IAEA mission in Energodar – the city where the NPP is located, and which is in the part of Zaporozhye Region controlled by Moscow’s forces – is expected to last one day. “The program of the visit is designed to last one day. They will have to review the plant’s operations in one day… So far it has been stated that [the purpose of the mission] is ‘to familiarize with the plant operations’. We see that as a vague concept,” Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russian military-civilian administration, told Interfax news agency. He went on to say that the delegation is supposed to enter the territory controlled by Russian forces via Vasilyevka, a town east of the NPP and not far from the frontline. According to Balitsky, the experts could inspect two working reactors, the spent fuel storage area, and the cooling system. He also said the authorities intend to show the experts the damage caused by Ukrainian artillery attacks. “We are ready to show where the shells hit. We’re ready to show shell fragments; the Soviet-made [shells] fired by [MLRS] Grad and Uragan differ very much from those from the M777 howitzer. [We’re ready] to show the drones, who produced them, where and how they fell,” he added. Earlier, Grossi said the goal of the mission is to find out what is happening at the plant, assess its integrity, speak to both Russian and Ukrainian staff, and establish a permanent presence on the ground. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the plant, which has been under Russian control since March, while warning that the shelling could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the Chernobyl incident. Recently, the local authorities also claimed that Ukraine tried to torpedo the IAEA mission to the plant by shelling the city of Energodar. Kiev insists, however, that it is Russia’s forces who are shelling the nuclear power plant while stationing military hardware there.",5.446980166626413,6.046783631589993,-0.5998034649635802,9

Born in 1931, Gorbachev became the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985. He sought to reform the USSR through a series of economic (perestroika) and governance (glasnost) policy changes, and became its first elected president in 1990. Though the attempted coup against him in August 1991 failed, Gorbachev’s authority did not survive for long.

2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/558272-gorbachev-dies-soviet-leader/,Mikhail Gorbachev dies at 91,"Mikhail Gorbachev, the first and only president of the Soviet Union, has died at the age of 91, in Moscow. His death was reported on Tuesday night by the Central Clinical Hospital, which said in a statement that “Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev died this evening after a serious and prolonged illness.” According to the news agency TASS, Gorbachev was hospitalized at the very beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, at the request of his doctors, and had been under medical supervision ever since. Gorbachev will be buried in Moscow’s Novodevichy Cemetery next to his wife, Raisa, who died in 1999, TASS revealed, citing a source familiar with the family’s wishes. A divisive figure, supporters credit him with having played a key part in bringing about an end to the Cold War, while opponents accuse him of aiding in the fall of the Soviet Union and a major loss to Moscow’s prestige and global influence. Born in 1931 into a peasant family in southern Russia, in his teens Gorbachev operated combine harvesters on collective farms. His party career started early in his student years, when he studied law at Lomonosov Moscow State University. His ascent through the ranks was relatively rapid, and in 1985 he became the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, making him the highest ranking official in the USSR. During his time in office, Gorbachev aimed to re-energize the stalled Soviet economy, which was riddled with inefficiency, overblown defense spending and creeping corruption. He called for urgent reorganization and modernization, but soon expanded his reform to the political and social structure of the whole nation. The policy of ‘perestroika’ was announced in 1986 as an attempt to reorganize the economy. More of a political movement, the “restructuring” aimed to give more independence to ministries and large state-owned enterprises. It also introduced some free market-style reforms. In 1988, Gorbachev permitted establishing private enterprises in the country for the first time since Vladimir Lenin’s “New Economic Policy” of the 1920s. Another policy proclaimed was ‘glasnost'. Gorbachev aimed to bring transparency into society, ease the Communist Party’s control over the media and release political prisoners. This was a radical change, since control over public speech had previously been an essential part of the Soviet regime. Gorbachev also proposed a constitutional change to move to a presidential system and created a new political body called the Congress of People’s Deputies. The 2,250 members were elected in the Soviet Union’s first semi-competitive parliamentary election. On March 15, 1990, following a vote in the Congress of People’s Deputies, Mikhail Gorbachev became president of the USSR. Gorbachev’s foreign policy, also known as the “new thinking,” marked a period of significant improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries, replacing the era of Cold War hostilities. In 1986, he announced plans to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan, but it took three more years to complete the pullout. The Soviet-Afghan war was a major point of criticism for the West. It also cost the Soviet Union at least 15,000 casualties, put additional strains on an already creaking bureaucratic planned economy and filled the country with veterans suffering from combat stress disorders. The reengagement with the West paved the way for several key disarmament treaties to be signed. Moscow and Washington agreed to dismantle their intermediate-range conventional and nuclear missiles – the very precise weapons that could tempt the military into using nuclear weapons on a limited scale, but still trigger global mutual annihilation. Under Gorbachev, Moscow unilaterally stopped all nuclear tests. Moscow’s relations with the Eastern Bloc countries also underwent a radical change. Earlier, Soviet troops always served as the final argument, should one of the countries of the Cold War-era Warsaw Pact try to shift its allegiance. But Gorbachev’s liberalization included the right of self-determination for those nations. This was jokingly called the “Sinatra doctrine” after the singer Frank Sinatra, alluding to his song, 'My Way', as countries were allowed to determine their own internal policies. A string of revolutions in 1989 ousted European Communist regimes, and in 1990 West and East Germany reunified as one country. For his efforts in easing international tensions, Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990. In a statement accompanying the award, the Nobel Committee said that the president of the Soviet Union had played a “leading role” in the international peace process. Gorbachev is also well-known for having played a key role in the fall of the Berlin Wall, the symbol of a split Europe and divided world in the times of the Cold War. After the fall of the Nazi regime as a result of World War II, Germany had become two separate countries by 1949. The Federal Republic of Germany (or West Germany) was run by the Western Allies, while the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was controlled by the Soviet Union. Berlin was located inside East Germany, but it was shared by both West and East Germany, with the Berlin Wall dividing the territories of the two states. Built in 1961, the wall separated families and loved ones for 28 years. It was eventually toppled on the night of November 9, 1989. During a visit to West Germany earlier in 1989, the Soviet leader declared that every nation can “freely choose its own political and social system” and that Moscow would “respect for the right of all peoples to self-determination.” The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the dawn of a new age – the end of the Cold War and the bipolar world – and it paved the way for Germany’s reunification in 1990. The partial democratization of Soviet society under Gorbachev led to a surge in nationalist and anti-Russian sentiment in most of the 15 Soviet republics. But this drive for independence was not always peaceful. On several occasions, Moscow ordered the use of force against violent riots, as the nationalist course in certain regions was seen as capable of spawning much greater violence in the future if the government failed to act. However, the use of force only caused bigger protests. The frozen conflicts in ethnic enclaves around the country, such as Nagorno-Karabakh and Trans-Dniester, as well as the 2008 war in South Ossetia, are the legacies of those events. Amid growing tensions within the USSR, Gorbachev attempted to draft a new union treaty. However, a group of hardline Soviet top officials, who called themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency, attempted to stage a coup and to remove Gorbachev from power to prevent the signing of the new union treaty. The coup failed, but it prompted Gorbachev to dissolve the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and to resign as the party’s General Secretary, as well as to dissolve all party departments within the governmental structures, thus effectively ending Communist rule in the USSR and eliminating its primary unifying political force. The Soviet Union collapsed with dramatic speed during the latter part of 1991, as one Soviet republic after another declared independence. In December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus met near the Belorussian town of Brest and signed the Belavezha Accords, which formally declared the Soviet Union effectively dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place. Gorbachev initially denounced the move as illegal, but later in the same month acknowledged it and announced his resignation as president. Gorbachev’s policies made him popular in the West, but in his own country he remains a controversial figure to this day. He is praised by many for his disarmament initiatives, the unification of Germany, instigating the fall of the Iron Curtain and ending the Cold War, as well as for granting Eastern European countries the right to self-determination. However, the former Soviet leader also faced significant criticism, mostly at home, from those who believe that his policies weakened the Soviet Union and its successor, Russia, and were the major cause of the collapse of the USSR. Some critics particularly say that, by moving forward with his disarmament initiatives, including the unilateral ones, he undermined the military and industrial might of the Soviet Union, while others accuse him of failing to prevent NATO from expanding further eastwards and eventually reaching Russia’s borders. After his resignation, Gorbachev created the International Non-Governmental Foundation for Socio-Economic and Political Studies (The Gorbachev Foundation), which is both a research center and discussion platform, as well as an NGO overseeing humanitarian charity projects. In 1993, at the initiative of the representatives of 108 countries, Gorbachev established Green Cross International, a non-governmental environmental organization, which now has offices in 23 countries around the world. In 1999, he also became one of the initiators of the Nobel Peace Laureates Summit, which meets every year to discuss global threats, such as violence and wars, poverty, crisis situations in the world’s economy, and the environment, according to the Gorbachev Foundation website. Between 2001 and 2009, Gorbachev also co-chaired the St. Petersburg Dialogue, an annual Russian-German forum held alternately in both countries and attended by politicians, entrepreneurs, and young people. The former Soviet leader had also visited around 50 countries since 1992 and been given more than 300 awards, diplomas, certificates of honor, and honorable distinctions, according to the Gorbachev Foundation. Gorbachev also wrote dozens of books, which have been published in 10 languages. “I was doing my best in bringing together morality and responsibility to people. It’s a matter of principle for me. It was high time to put an end to the rulers’ wild cravings and to their highhandedness. There were a few things I have not succeeded in, but I don’t think I was wrong in my approach,” he wrote in his political article of faith, published by the Gorbachev Foundation.",2.0877693020812993,3.4072050321321115,-1.3194357300508122,4

In a post published on the airline’s Telegram channel on Tuesday, it announced that S7 employees can now sport visible tattoos, have beards, and dye their hair vibrant colors. “Standard airline rules do not always justifiably regulate the appearance of flight attendants, pilots and employees at the airport. It’s time to update them!” the airline said, adding that it supports their workers’ right to express themselves and believes that tattoos and other superficial features have no impact on an employee’s professional traits. “If an individual style does not prevent a person from doing his job 100% and ensuring safety on board, we see no reason to keep these outdated traditions in place,” S7 wrote, going on to list certain things that will now be permitted on board. They include tattoos on visible parts of the body – as long as they are not offensive – bright colored hair dye, ballet flats or loafers instead of heels for female flight attendants, and beards for all male employees, as opposed to just pilots or airport workers, as was the case before. The airline notes that some restrictions – such as long nails or piercings on open parts of the body – will remain in place due to safety concerns. S7’s decision comes amid an industry-wide shift in which a number of airlines around the world have started relaxing appearance guidelines for crew members. Earlier this year, Virgin Atlantic became one of the first British airlines to allow flight attendants to display tattoos, which previously had to be covered up. Latvia’s AirBaltic airline also joined in on the trend earlier this month, permitting most tattoos, hairstyles, and piercings for uniformed staff. The first major international airline to allow tattoos for staff was Air New Zealand, which in 2019 announced that its employees would be permitted to sport traditional 'ta moko' Maori, as well as non-offensive tattoos on visible parts of the body while wearing their uniform or normal business attire.",2.405022120456004,3.7539440943785425,-1.3489219739225384,7

A statement added that officials believe the failerd operation was mounted at the personal order of President Vladimir Zelensky. “The effective actions by the Russian forces destroyed 48 tanks, 46 infantry fighting vehicles, 37 other armored combat vehicles, eight pickups with heavy machine guns and more than 1,200 Ukrainian servicemen in one day,” they outlined. The Ministry added that Kiev sustained these losses during a botched offensive whose directions led to Nikolaev, Krivoy Rog, and other cities in southern Ukraine. The ministry went on to say that Moscow’s forces routed the units of the 128th Ukrainian Mountain Assault Brigade, which had been redeployed from western Ukraine to take part in the operation. “Five service members from this brigade laid down their arms and gave in,” the ministry added. Russian forces also wiped out “more than 200 militants, including about 40 foreign mercenaries” as well as more than 20 armor units, according to the military. The Russian Defense Ministry’s statement comes after its claim on Monday that the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson had “failed miserably.” At the time, the ministry put Kiev’s losses at 26 tanks, 23 armored fighting vehicles, nine more armored vehicles, two jets and at least 560 troops. Kiev has been talking about a “Kherson counteroffensive” all summer, while soliciting more weapons and ammunition from its Western backers. In a video address to the people on Sunday, Zelensky vowed that “Ukraine will return” to Donbass – as well as Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Kherson, and “definitely to Crimea.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",6.146522574532521,8.021678619574915,-1.8751560450423943,2

If it does, Russia will retaliate in a way that protects its citizens, he added. Speaking to journalists about the proposed EU restrictions on Tuesday, Peskov said the Russian government believed it to be within the realm of possibility that such a policy would be introduced. “Brussels and individual European governments have repeatedly shown an absolute lack of sense … when it comes to anti-Russian impulses,” Peskov said. He remarked that EU policies directed against Russia tended to benefit the US at the expense of their own people. Moscow has been monitoring media reports indicating that some visa restrictions may be negotiated this week during an EU ministerial meeting in Prague. If a policy change comes out of the gathering, it cannot be left without a response by Moscow, the spokesman said. “We will retaliate in a way that best serves our interests and the interests of our citizens,” Peskov assured, adding that the exact response can only be formulated if and when the EU acts. Ukraine and its most hardline EU supporters have been calling for an almost full ban on visa issuance to Russian citizens, with exceptions only on humanitarian grounds. The measure is touted as a proportionate response to Russia’s attack against Ukraine and the failure of its people to oppose their government’s policies. Some nations, such as Estonia, have claimed that banning Russian visitors was necessary for national security. However, countries such as Germany and France are reportedly advocating to other members of the bloc to take a less restrictive approach, arguing that a collective punishment of the Russian people would only alienate them from the West and boost domestic support of the country’s government.",2.8055143418128807,3.5938473156265585,-0.7883329738136777,8

Nevertheless, Peskov noted that Russia’s relations with Iran are “developing dynamically” and would continue to do so. The response comes after the Washington Post published an article on Monday stating that Iran had sent a shipment of drones to Russia, citing anonymous US and allied officials.

In July, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made similar claims, stating Washington had “clear evidence” that Iran was preparing to deliver “several hundred” drones to Russia, “including weapons-capable UAVs,” and that the sale would be conducted on an “expedited timeline.” Later that month, the White House toned down its allegations. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby admitted that Washington did not actually see any evidence of a deal. “We’ve seen no indications of any sort of actual delivery and/or purchase of Iranian drones by the Russian Ministry of Defense,” Kirby said. Tehran has rejected claims of any drone deals with Moscow, insisting that it would not take a side in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and would continue to push for a peaceful resolution.",2.843851746133513,3.6261701610616592,-0.7823184149281461,8

Prosecutors have also requested a 500,000-ruble ($8,200) fine for Safronov, who is believed to have handed over confidential information regarding Russia’s military interests. According to Russian law, state treason can carry a sentence of between 12 and 20 years in prison, as well as a fine. Safronov, who once worked for Russian newspapers Kommersant and Vedomosti and later became an adviser to the head of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, was arrested in July 2020. He is accused of two counts of cooperating with the Czech and German intelligence services. Prosecutors believe Safronov was recruited by members of the Czech special services in 2012 and leaked information to them related to Russia’s military-technical cooperation in Africa and the Middle East – the ultimate recipient of this classified intel being the US. They also claim that he was paid $248 in 2015 for providing information on the activities of Russia’s armed forces in Syria, which was sent to representatives of Zurich University in Switzerland and the German intelligence services. Investigators claim this information could have been used to analyze the actions of Russian troops in Syria. Safronov and his legal team have denied the allegations and have refused to reach a settlement with prosecutors, arguing that the defendant is being punished for his journalistic work.

2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561753-russia-china-new-world-order/,Dmitry Trenin: This Russia-China founded bloc represents half the world’s population and will help forge the new world order,"Over 20 years after it began as an attempt at cooperation between five-Russian led post-Soviet states and an emerging China, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has become a major global institution, representing close to half of the world’s population. From September 15-16, Samarkand, one of the ancient centers of human civilization, will host the annual summit of the group. The Uzbek presidency’s priorities include strengthening the SCO’s capabilities in assuring regional security and stability; promoting friendship and good-neighborliness; raising its global profile; countering threats in the information and ideological spheres; expanding parliamentary links; energizing economic interaction; enhancing connectivity; intensifying cultural and humanitarian contacts; and raising the general effectiveness of the collective and its mechanisms. All of this looks impressive, but quite anodyne, and the documents to be formally approved at the summit do not promise any major sensations – beyond the long-expected admission of Iran as the SCO’s ninth member state. Yet the environment in which the Samarkand summit will be held differs greatly even from last year’s gathering in Dushanbe. Russia’s military operation in Ukraine has led to a proxy war between Moscow and Washington. Meanwhile, Sino-US relations, already confrontational, have become palpably strained over the recent visit to Taiwan by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. NATO’s new strategic concept adopted last June in Madrid describes Russia as the most significant and direct threat, and China – for the first time – as a challenge to Western interests, security and values. As a result, the international community has moved visibly closer to a Cold War-style division between two camps in an intensifying rivalry over the world order. That said, the SCO is unlikely to become the non-West’s version of NATO. While the US-led bloc is now more united than ever in its effort to preserve the order built and developed in the heyday of its global dominance, non-Western nations do not display anything similar to that sort of unity, hierarchy, and internal discipline. Russia and China, although they both reject US global hegemony, pursue very different grand strategies and – despite their public declarations of a cooperation that “knows no limits,” and a partnership that is “more than an alliance” – are careful not to damage their other important connections – e.g., China’s with the US and EU; and Russia’s with India – as they cooperate with each other. Moreover, China and India, not to mention the latter and Pakistan, while all members of the SCO, view each other as major security threats. Despite such diversity and complexity, however, the SCO, at the start of its third decade, is not only still in business, but is steadily getting more active and becoming more attractive to others. In 2001, it started at six; after 2017, the membership expanded to eight, with another 20 countries or so listed as observers, dialogue partners, or in the process of joining. Iran’s accession this year is spurring the interest of Turkey and a number of Arab countries, notably the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Qatar. The SCO community could potentially include much of the Eurasian continent between Belarus and Cambodia. Such enlargement carries obvious risks in terms of even wider diversity of interest, conflict, and frictions between the countries that aspire to join. Yet, the example of China and Russia; India and Pakistan finding the SCO useful to their interests is a convincing argument for accession. In fact, the SCO’s lack of a single leader; its consensus-based decision-making procedures; its emphasis on national sovereignty and non-interference is a welcome contrast to the US-dominated NATO or like-minded groups such as the G7. Being in the SCO does not mean following Beijing’s or Moscow’s guidance. So far, so good. Yet, to flip the coin, what can the SCO actually give its members, observers, and partners? The general answer is: security in their mutual relations and stability across the continent. The organization, after all, originated from talks on border and military security issues between China on the one hand, and Russia and the Central Asian states on the other. Membership itself does not guarantee that there will be no conflicts, but it provides for means to prevent or manage them. Thus, it provides a unique platform for regular high-level and top-level contacts between Delhi and Beijing. Anti-terrorist cooperation – for all the differences in defining ‘terrorism’ – is another obvious bonus. After last year’s US withdrawal from Afghanistan, SCO member states have stepped up their efforts to bolster stability in the region. Economic development has long featured as one of the key areas of SCO cooperation. China’s Belt and Road Initiative has been followed by the North-South corridor linking Russia, Iran, the Arab countries, and India. Peace in the South Caucasus could be cemented by restoring connectivity within the region and its links to the north and the south. The unraveling of ‘Chimerica’ and the EU-Russia decoupling in the wake of the Ukraine war signal the replacement of globalization with regionalization. Asian and Eurasian countries which for the past couple of centuries were much more closely involved with distant Western powers than with their own neighbors are now focusing on opportunities in their dynamic neighborhood. Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia are also opening doors much wider to Asian and Middle Eastern investment in Russia and trade with it. A new impetus for Eurasian interaction has been created in the post-Ukraine environment by the seizure by the West of half of Russia’s currency reserves. The central issue that has entered a number of countries’ strategic calculus is the reliability of the US dollar-based global financial system. Increasingly, national currencies of the SCO member states and observers, such as the Chinese yuan, the Indian rupee, the Turkish lira, the Iranian riel, as well as the Russian ruble are being used in trade between these countries. In parallel, national payment systems of these and other countries are becoming connected, allowing them to conduct transactions directly, rather than via Washington or its allies. At this point, the mechanisms are still cumbersome, but therein lies the beginning of a new international financial system which is free from diktat by a hegemonic outside power. The sanctions imposed on Iran, and now on Russia, could in the future be slapped on other nations that find themselves in conflict with the US. The international system as it emerged from the end of the Cold War is going through a deep crisis which will take a long time to resolve. The present system is founded on organizations either rooted in or inspired by the Cold War – like NATO or AUKUS, or heavily dominated by Western powers, like the international financial institutions, the OSCE, and the UN system as a whole. It is doubtful that the prime beneficiaries of the existing situation will do more than budge a little to make room for emerging players; they will certainly do their best to retain control over the system that they have devised and operated. While the future of the world order is being decided in the ongoing major power competition, a practical way of altering the situation to better serve the interests of the growing number of autonomous players is through developing organizations such as the SCO – independent, non-hegemonic, and inclusive. Potentially, the SCO could become a model for the 21st century order in the world’s most important regional space.",2.409149085147391,4.312353400798896,-1.903204315651505,6
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/news/561788-eu-visa-ban-russia-sanctions/,EU states oppose full Russian visa ban – Politico,"EU member states are expected to reach a deal to slow the issuing of visas to Russian nationals and to make the process more expensive, rather than introducing a full ban, Politico reported on Monday, citing an internal document. According to a memo obtained by the outlet, ahead of informal talks of EU defense and foreign ministers in Prague, Germany and France argued that a visa ban would only alienate Russian people from the West, while driving a wedge between some members of the bloc. “While limiting contacts with regime representatives and authorities to areas of vital EU interest, we need to strategically fight for the ‘hearts and minds’ of the Russian population – at least the segments not yet completely estranged from ‘the West,’” Paris and Berlin reportedly stated. This position has apparently frustrated a number of EU states that insist on stricter measures against Russia amid the conflict in Ukraine. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told Politico that visa restrictions would hurt Russia, not the EU. The ban is “something that Russia is afraid of” because it affects the elite, she said. However, the debate on visas is still far from over, with a coalition of Russia hawks reportedly intending to hold talks before the Prague meeting. According to two of Politico’s sources, the jury is still out on how aggressive their stance will be. Germany and France spoke out against a strict approach in the memo, saying they “wish to maintain a legal framework that allows in particular students, artists, scholars, professionals – independent of whether they are at risk of prosecution on political grounds – to travel to the EU.” On Sunday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a full visa ban for all Russians is unlikely to receive unanimous support in the bloc. “I think that we have to review the way that some Russians get a visa, certainly [not] the oligarchs. We have to be more selective. But I am not in favor of stopping delivering visas to all Russians,” he stated at the time. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that EU member states plan to back a suspension of the 2007 EU-Russia visa facilitation deal, which will make the process of applying for all EU visas more complicated, expensive, and protracted. A number of countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Latvia, have already stopped issuing visas to Russian citizens. Commenting on the visa ban proposals discussed at the EU level, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said these types of initiatives “don’t smell too good,” while expressing hope that common sense would eventually prevail.",2.423736472964692,4.277910772998736,-1.8541743000340434,8
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561791-un-nuclear-inspectors-arrive-kiev/,UN nuclear inspectors arrive in Kiev – CNN,"Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) dispatched to assess the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant have arrived in Kiev, CNN reported on Tuesday. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, which sits on the conflict frontline in southern Ukraine. Reports of shells and missiles landing dangerously close to the facility have sparked fears of a possible nuclear disaster, similar to the one at Chernobyl in 1986. CNN said its reporters have seen the inspectors at their hotel in the Ukrainian capital. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi announced the mission’s long-awaited trip on Monday. The plant was seized by Russian troops days after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. The facility continued to operate with local staff under Russian control. It was briefly completely taken off the grid last week, but later resumed operation. Ukrainian and US officials have accused Russia of using the facility as cover for its soldiers. Moscow, meanwhile, insists that it does not keep heavy weapons, including artillery, stationed at the plant.

2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/news/561780-russia-afghanistan-us-economy/,US must ‘pay the bill’ for Afghanistan – Russia,"The US should focus on compensating the Afghan people for the 20 years of “pointless occupation” rather than accusing others of not chipping in, Russia’s envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, has said. The US sent troops into Afghanistan in 2001 to fight the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and other Islamist groups as part of its global War on Terror declared after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in America. The Taliban, however, seized Kabul and overran Afghanistan last year during the final stage of the withdrawal of the US and other Western forces. At a UN Security Council meeting in New York on Monday, US envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield suggested that Russia was not doing enough to help Afghanistan’s economy. “Russia argued, as others have in the past, that Afghanistan’s problems are the fault of ‘the West,’ and not the Taliban. Really?” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Here is my question: What are you doing to help other than rehash the past and criticize others? If you are concerned that Afghan women and children are dying, how are you helping them?” The US envoy went on to say that Russia contributed “nothing” to the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan this year, and called China’s contributions “similarly underwhelming.” Nebenzia hit back at Thomas-Greenfield, arguing that Washington should bear the burden, given the nearly two decades of US troops in the war-torn country. “The cynicism of such statements is simply shocking: We are being asked to pull out our wallet to rebuild the country whose economy was virtually destroyed by the 20 years of occupation by the US and NATO,” Nebenzia said. “Instead of admitting one’s mistakes and trying to fix them, we are now being chastised for not wanting to pay for the bills of others. It’s an unusual proposition.” “No, dear former Western partners, it is you who must pay for your mistakes,” he added. We have helped and will continue to help Afghanistan, and we recommend that you focus on compensating… the Afghans for the 20 years of senseless occupation that destroyed Afghanistan and [threatened the survival of its people] In response, Thomas-Greenfield said: “Let me just state that if the Russian Federation believes that there was an economy in Afghanistan to be destroyed, it’s been destroyed by the Taliban.” Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun said, “the fiasco of the past 20 years [in Afghanistan] has once again proved that military intervention and power politics are not the right way,” and “the tragedy in Afghanistan should never be allowed to repeat.” The UN has warned that the current level of foreign aid to Afghanistan is not enough. “You can’t use humanitarian relief to patch up what has been a completely collapsed economy,” Kanni Wignaraja, assistant secretary general and regional director of Asia-Pacific at the United Nations Development Program, said this month.",2.9845346413271736,3.1804347638427592,-0.19590012251558564,7
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561775-ukraine-shelling-un-iaea-zaporozhye-nuclear/,Ukraine accused of targeting possible route of nuclear inspectors,"Ukrainian forces are shelling a route that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection mission could take to reach the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant this week, local authorities claimed on Tuesday. Zaporozhye Region council member Vladimir Rogov told RIA Novosti that “Ukrainian nationalists are targeting locations that could be visited by the IAEA mission in Energodar,” where the plant is located. He added that “[Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky’s regime also started a military operation in the south of the country,” which raises concerns for the safety of the IAEA mission. Rogov also said Kiev’s forces have shelled the NPP’s resort house that could accommodate the IAEA delegation. On Monday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi announced that an expert group would visit the NPP this week to assess the damage sustained by the plant and check the safety and security systems. Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant has been under Russian control since March. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the plant, while warning that the shelling could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the Chernobyl incident. Kiev insists, however, that Russian forces are shelling the site while stationing military hardware there. On Sunday night, Ukrainian forces shelled Energodar, the city where the plant is located, local officials said. They claimed that the attack, which injured nine people and deliberately hit a number of residential houses, was meant to torpedo the upcoming IAEA mission. “This provocation by Kiev-controlled militants is aimed at derailing the visit of the IAEA chief to the Zaporozhye NPP,” they said at the time. Also on Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that Kiev’s forces attempted a counter-offensive in Kherson in southern Ukraine, but “failed miserably.” The ministry went on to say that the Ukrainian army had attempted to attack in three directions, but made no gains and suffered “great losses,” which included dozens of tanks and armored fighting vehicles.",6.766505504990947,4.464486737756573,2.302018767234374,9
2022-08-30,https://www.rt.com/russia/561769-pentagon-ukraine-nuclear-shelling/,Pentagon admits ‘likelihood’ of Ukrainian shelling near nuclear plant,"A senior US military official admitted on Monday that Ukrainian forces may have struck the area around the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, but insisted that this was only in response to Russian fire allegedly coming from the area. Earlier in the day, the Russian authorities said a Ukrainian artillery shell damaged the roof of the building storing reactor fuel. “What I know for sure is that the Russians are firing from around the plant,” the unnamed official told reporters during a background briefing at the Pentagon. “I also know that there are rounds that have impacted near the plant.” The official said it was “hard to explain, I guess” how the US was monitoring the situation around the nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest. “And I don't want to say that the Ukrainians haven't fired in that vicinity either because I think there's probably a likelihood that they have, but in good – in a number of cases, it's returning fire of the Russians who are firing from those locations,” he said. Russian forces established control of the Zaporozhye NPP in early March. National guard and nuclear protection specialists secured the site while the Ukrainian staff continued to operate without hindrance. The government in Kiev claims that Russian forces turned the plant into a military base from which they were attacking Ukrainian targets, but also that Russian troops were shelling themselves in a false-flag ploy to make Ukraine look bad. The US official claimed “the Ukrainians are very aware of the potential impacts of striking the nuclear power plant and they're going out of their way not to do that.” Moscow has provided evidence to the UN of repeated Ukrainian attacks on the Zaporozhye NPP and the nearby town of Energodar since July, using kamikaze drones and even US-supplied artillery. The latest attack came on Monday, when a round breached the roof of a building where fresh reactor fuel was being stored, a member of the local administration said. On Sunday, a drone was shot down over the plant, while Ukrainian artillery strikes on Energodar injured nine civilian residents. Kiev has demanded that Russia hand the Zaporozhye NPP back over to Ukrainian control, or at least demilitarize a 30-kilometer area around it. On Monday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also urged demilitarization, as well as a shutdown of the reactors. The US has previously echoed Kiev’s accusations that Moscow wants to “steal Ukraine’s electricity” by shutting down the plant or disconnecting it from the Ukrainian grid. According to Russian nuclear experts, the biggest danger is not a reactor meltdown, but Ukrainian artillery striking the open-air spent fuel storage, which would result in a radioactive release. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi is personally leading the mission that is supposed to visit the plant this week.",4.561659757187913,3.6576802723506403,0.9039794848372726,9

There were a lot of strikes, something exploded.” According to Leontyev, there were hits reported both within the city limits and at the nearby hydroelectric power plant. While the exact extent of the damage had not been established yet, the attack has crippled the city’s water and power supply. “The fires are still burning and we are still hearing explosions,” Leontyev said around 10:45pm local time. The city’s hospitals had all been issued emergency generators and the authorities plan to start water deliveries in the morning, he added. Novaya Kakhovka had been on the receiving end of Ukrainian shelling all day. Earlier, Leontyev told the media that about ten salvos, each including at least six rockets, damaged many civilian structures, including a market. The official said Ukrainian forces were using US-supplied HIMARS systems to harass the city. Kiev claimed on Monday to have launched a counter-offensive in the Kherson Region, where Novaya Kakhovka is located. Natalia Humeniuk, Ukraine’s southern command spokeswoman, told state media that Kiev’s troops had breached the “first line of defense” of the Russian forces, but declined to give any details of the operation. By Monday evening, however, the Russian Defense Ministry said the Kherson offensive had “failed miserably,” with Ukrainian forces routed after suffering heavy losses.

A resident of St. Petersburg identified only as Yuri was returning from a business trip to Serbia via Finland. He was driving back to Russia on Saturday evening when he was stopped at the border. When asked if he had any money with him, Yuri showed the customs officials €1,390 ($1,390) in cash. The man said he brought all of it from Russia and did not acquire any additional money abroad. He also had rubles and Serbian dinars, but the customs officials were apparently only interested in the euros. “They took only euros,” Yuri told Fontanka, adding that he was told he was “prohibited from taking the money to Russia.” The customs officials said he could either give all of his euros to “someone entering Finland” through the same border crossing, or hand it over to customs and get it back the next time he is in Finland. The man agreed to hand the money over, provided there was no time limit on when he could get it back. According to Fontanka, Yuri is not the only Russian who has been subjected to these restrictions, which were introduced due to the conflict in Ukraine. Other travelers have reportedly shared similar stories on the outlet’s Telegram channel. Finnish Customs officially warns on its website that “exporting banknotes of official EU Member State currencies to Russia is prohibited,” but says there are exceptions for money needed for diplomatic purposes and the personal use of those traveling to Russia. The Russian-language version of the website specifically states that “taking unused cash to Russia by an individual living in Russia and returning home” does not count as “personal use.” The measures are described as “export sanctions” related to the conflict in Ukraine, and it is not clear when they were introduced.

2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561763-un-save-wwii-monument-latvia/,Baltic state destroyed WWII monument despite UN warning,"The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) attempted to stop the destruction of a Soviet monument commemorating the liberation of Latvia and its capital, Riga, from the Nazis in World War Two. However, the memorial was still destroyed last week as Riga claims the UN failed to inform it about its decision to introduce temporary protection measures. The OHCHR asked Latvia to stop the dismantling of the monument – a process that was already in full swing – last week and preserve the already demolished parts, Latvian officials have confirmed to local media. An OHCHR official, Vivian Kwok, told the Sputnik news agency that the UN body had registered a complaint about the planned demolition and sought a temporary reprieve for the memorial. This decision was made after the OHCHR had received a complaint from five people alleging a violation of the UN’s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the Latvian authorities. Latvia’s Foreign Ministry claimed, however, to have received the UN body’s decision only on August 26, a day after the last remaining part of the monument – a giant 79-meter-high obelisk – had already been destroyed. The fact that it arrived so late made the UN body’s decision unenforceable, the ministry maintained. Riga also stated that the OHCHR is “not a court” and its opinions are “not legally binding,” even though a nation recognizing the OHCHR authority should take its opinions into account and rectify shortcomings “in good faith.” The OHCHR itself told the news agency RIA that it had not made a final decision on the complaint yet. The demolition of the 1985 monument dedicated to the ‘Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders’ led to protests in the Latvian capital last week. Local police detained 14 protesters last Tuesday for disobeying orders to disperse. After Latvia gained independence following the dissolution of the USSR, the country’s authorities increasingly began seeing the memorial as a symbol of Soviet oppression and the question of taking it down was repeatedly raised. In May, the Baltic state’s government voted to remove all Soviet-era monuments by a November 15 deadline, citing the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Moscow has offered visas to those who were attempting to defend the monument. Meanwhile, Latvian President Egils Levits has said that people of Russian heritage whose loyalty to the government could raise questions should be “isolated from society.” Ethnic Russians comprise around 25% of the Baltic country’s population.",3.6359758813661265,3.3831460290941067,0.2528298522720198,4

The lone holdout against Latvia’s crusade to demolish Soviet memorials is Daugavpils, a city in the south near the border with Lithuania and Belarus. Riga has “repeatedly” demanded that Daugavpils Mayor Andrejs Elksninas plan and implement measures to “dismantle objects glorifying the occupation,” minister Arturs Toms Pless told reporters. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development (VARAM) has been keeping a tally of the city’s refusals, he added. “If you have received a yellow card several times, a red card may appear at some point,” said Pless, according to the state news agency LETA. “The laws must be followed regardless of whether someone personally agrees or disagrees with them.” Citing the conflict in Ukraine, the Baltic state’s government voted in May to remove all the Soviet-era monuments by a November 15 deadline. An obelisk memorializing the Red Army troops who liberated Riga from Nazi occupation in 1945 was destroyed last week. Meanwhile, Latvian President Egils Levits told the state broadcaster LSM that ethnic Russians whose loyalty to the government was suspect should be “isolated from society.” Ethnic Russians make up some 25% of Latvia’s total population. VARAM has given Elksninas a 20-day deadline to submit a report providing “extensive, detailed information” on measures taken to dismantle the monuments so far and going forward. Two out of three Soviet monuments in Daugavpils are marked for destruction: a Red Army memorial and a monument to the 360th Rifle Division, which liberated the city. The third monument, in Dubrovina Park, has been spared destruction so far because several officers are buried there. The territory of present-day Latvia was ruled by the Russian Empire from 1795 to 1920, with Riga becoming the empire’s largest port. After the Bolshevik revolution, Latvia declared independence with the support of Germany and Poland. During the Second World War, Nazi Germany raised two Waffen-SS divisions in Latvia. The period from 1945 until 1991, when Latvia seceded from the USSR, was later designated by Riga as “Soviet occupation.”",3.685305916433769,4.773193284782512,-1.0878873683487433,4

Kiev and Moscow should cease the hostilities and return to the negotiating table, he told Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper in an interview published on Sunday. Although he supports the idea of Ukraine “returning to [its] borders of 1991,” including Donbass and Crimea, Trukhanov maintains that these disputes should be resolved at the negotiating table, not the battlefield. “The lives of millions of people are at stake,” therefore “it is necessary to negotiate step by step, to seek compromises gradually, to avoid confrontation,” the mayor said. He argued that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has made “many” mistakes while in office. Trukhanov criticized the government for concentrating too much power in Kiev at the expense of the regions. “[Zelensky] should have left more autonomy to regions and municipalities,” he said, adding that had the president listened to his suggestions and those of others, “the country would work better.” Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status and broad autonomy within the Ukrainian state, was one of the reasons cited by Moscow when it launched its military operation in Ukraine on February 24. The Odessa mayor noted that Ukraine and Russia are “deeply connected by history, culture, language, religion, traditions.” Nevertheless, Trukhanov condemned Moscow’s military operation, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a “monster” who could even go as far as to drop a nuclear bomb on Ukraine. However, he does not believe that Putin intends to bomb Odessa. The mayor also criticized the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities aimed at tearing down statues and monuments to Russian historical figures in Ukraine. “I am against taking down the statues. Even if we destroy the monuments, history does not change,” Trukhanov said, adding that removing statues of 19th-century Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin, and the first Soviet cosmonaut, Yury Gagarin, simply “does not make sense.” The Kremlin signaled its readiness to strike a peace deal with Kiev in early August. President Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said at the time that the two nations were close to settling their differences in a way that was acceptable to Russia back in spring, but the draft agreement prepared during a meeting in Istanbul was torpedoed by Ukraine. Moscow warned that if Kiev refuses to end the conflict in a diplomatic way, Russia will still achieve the goals of its military operation. In mid-August, Ukraine ruled out any negotiations with Russia, arguing that talks would not serve Kiev’s goals. “The opportunity to win this war is much more important than any situational pause,” Zelensky’s aide, Mikhail Podoliak, said at the time.",3.74070825459734,3.7244171993397743,0.016291055257565468,8

Ukrainian forces had attempted to attack in three directions on orders of President Vladimir Zelensky but made no gains, Moscow explained. Russian troops caused “great losses” to the Ukrainian attackers during the day’s battles, a statement read. Kiev saw 26 tanks, 23 armored fighting vehicles, nine more armored vehicles, and two SU-25 ground-attack jets destroyed, while more than 560 troops were lost, according to the summary. The enemy's latest attempt at offensive actions has failed miserably. Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian outlet Suspilne quoted Southern Command spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk as saying that “offensive actions in various directions” had begun, “including in the Kherson region.” She offered no details, however, saying only that “any military operation needs silence.” By Monday evening, however, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine mentioned only a Russian attack near the village of Potemkino. Kiev has been talking about a “Kherson counteroffensive” all summer, while soliciting more weapons and ammunition from its Western backers. In a video address to the people on Sunday, Zelensky vowed that “Ukraine will return” to Donbass – as well as Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Kherson and “definitely to Crimea.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

According to Morgan Libby, a former IAEA official, the agency’s mission may end up being the most important since the 1986 Chernobyl incident. “Everything else pales in comparison,” he told the paper. On Monday, Rafael Grossi, the watchdog’s chief, announced that the agency had formed an expert group to visit the NPP, which has been under Russian control since March but is largely still operated by Ukrainian personnel. “The day has come, IAEA’s Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporozhye (ISAMZ) is now on its way. We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” he wrote on Twitter. Grossi said the delegation would assess the damage sustained, check safety and security systems and speak to both Russian and Ukrainian staff on the ground. A New York Times report released on Saturday said that the IAEA’s team consists of 14 experts from “mostly neutral countries.” Neither the US nor Britain will reportedly have any representatives in the group given that Russia had dismissed those countries as “unfairly biased” over their support for the government in Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the nuclear plant, while warning that the shelling could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the Chernobyl incident. However, Kiev insists that it is Russian forces who are shelling the site while stationing military hardware there. On Sunday, Kiev shelled Energodar, the city where the plant is located, injuring nine people and hitting three residential houses with artillery fire, local authorities said, claiming that “the provocation” was aimed at “derailing the visit of the IAEA chief to the Zaporozhye NPP.” In early August, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov noted that “targeting of the territory of the nuclear power plant by the Ukrainian armed forces is potentially extremely dangerous activity,” which may lead to catastrophic consequences.",3.7408279017593657,2.2724528289790737,1.468375072780292,9

The roof of the building has been damaged as a result of the attack, Vladimir Rogov, the spokesman for Zaporozhye Region’s administration, said on Telegram. He also posted a photo of a hole in the roof that was supposedly caused by the strike. The affected storage facility holds fresh nuclear fuel for the reactors of the plant, which is the largest in Europe. Russia said earlier that a Ukrainian drone targeting the nuclear facility had been shot down. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev's forces of targeting the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant – which has been under Russian control since March, but operated by Ukrainian staff – with artillery and ‘kamikaze’ drones. It warned that those attacks could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the 1986 Chernobyl incident. Radioactive material could potentially reach Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, Belarus, and even Germany in a worst-case scenario. Ukraine, meanwhile, has claimed that the Russian forces have turned the nuclear plant into a military base and that they’ve been shelling the facility themselves to pin the blame on Kiev. Russia has repeatedly denied those accusation and urged for international inspectors to visit the site to assess the situation for themselves. Earlier on Monday, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi announced that such a mission will take pace after all, with IAEA specialists expected to arrive at the Zaporozhye plant this week.",4.138234778507389,2.5670598420898534,1.5711749364175356,9

Germany and many other Western countries have been arming Ukraine following the launch of Russia’s military operation in the neighboring state in late February. The EU should organize “a long-term and reliable division of labor between all partners of Ukraine,” Scholz said in a speech at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic on Monday. “I can, for example, imagine that Germany will assume special responsibility in terms of building up Ukraine’s artillery and air defense capacities.” Scholz stated that Germany will supply Ukraine with “new state-of-the-art weapons, such as air defense and radar systems, and reconnaissance drones.” “Our objective is a modern Ukrainian Armed Forces that are able to defend their country on a permanent basis,” the chancellor added. Germany had previously been reluctant to send weapons to conflict zones, mostly for historical reasons dating back to World War II. However, Berlin has recently “undergone a fundamental change of heart on this issue,” Scholz said, adding that Germany will “keep on supporting [Ukraine], reliably and, above all, for as long as it takes.” The German government announced last week that it would supply Kiev with an additional €500 million ($499.6 million) worth of arms. Berlin previously delivered Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers, and Gepard anti-aircraft gun tanks to Ukraine, among other weapons. EU defense ministers are set to discuss further military aid for Ukraine at an informal two-day gathering in Prague, which started on Monday.

Many civilian objects were damaged by them,” including a city market and a driving school in the city center, the Kakhovka district’s head, Vladimir Leontyev, told the media. He said Ukraine was using US-provided HIMARS rocket launchers to harass the city, which is located on the left bank of the Dnepr River and hosts a hydroelectric power plant. Ukrainian forces are stationed on the opposite side of the river. A Ukrainian military spokesperson claimed on Monday that Kiev’s forces have launched an offensive in the south of the country, which includes Kherson Region, where Novaya Kakhovka is located. Natalya Gumenyuk, who spoke on national TV on behalf of Ukraine’s southern command, declined to offer any details about the purported operation, only claiming that Kiev’s forces breached the “first line of defense” of the Russian forces. Ukrainian officials have for months teased a looming offensive to retake the city of Kherson and push Russian forces back from Kherson Region. But earlier this month, Mikhail Podoliak, an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, explained that these types of promises should be considered part of information warfare against Russia. “Certainly, all public comments are part of information warfare. We need to demoralize the Russian army,” he told the BBC in an interview. Sergey Aksyonov, the head of Russia’s Crimean Republic, which borders Kherson Region, dismissed Gumenyuk’s words as “fake news, like the previous ones.” He suggested that the claim was made for Kiev’s “Western masters who need to be shown action.” In reality, Ukraine’s forces are suffering significant losses on the southern front, Aksyonov claimed.",2.4525734769065726,3.1471657867943024,-0.6945923098877298,0

The statement came hours after International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi announced that IAEA experts would visit the nuclear plant this week to assess the security situation and establish a permanent presence at the facility. “We’ve been waiting for this mission for a long time. We believe it to be necessary,” the Kremlin spokesman said, adding that Moscow was ready to cooperate with the UN atomic agency. He assured that Russia would provide the necessary security to the IAEA inspectors once they reach the plant from Ukrainian-held territory. Peskov also commented on a suggestion by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the crisis at Europe’s largest nuclear power station could be resolved by setting up a demilitarized zone around the perimeter. “No, there’s no talk about it,” the Kremlin press secretary said when asked about the proposal. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of targeting the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and the nearby town of Energodar with artillery and drones, warning that it could trigger a disaster that would eclipse the 1986 Chernobyl incident. Ukraine, meanwhile, has claimed that Russian forces have turned the nuclear plant into a military base and that they’ve been shelling the facility themselves to pin the blame on Kiev. Moscow, which has denied those accusations, has been insisting on a visit by the IAEA to the site.

2022-08-29,https://www.rt.com/russia/561719-estonia-visa-ukraine-property/,Thousands of Russians could lose property in EU country,"A visa ban could lead to thousands of Russians losing their property in Estonia, the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Veiko Kommusaar, warned on Monday. Tallinn has barred access to the country for Russian citizens with Schengen visas issued by Estonia from August 18, due to Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. The Baltic nation’s banks have stopped accepting money transfers from Russia as part of earlier EU sanctions. This has made paying utility bills increasingly complicated for Russians who own real estate in Estonia but live in their home country. Russians who accumulate debt over unpaid utility bills due to the sanctions could eventually lose their property in Estonia, Kommusaar said in an interview with the ERR website. “Indeed, if it becomes impossible for a person to find ways of dealing with their real estate – extreme consequence may come. We currently don’t see how Estonia can make any concessions in this area,” he said. Around 12% of Russians (4,500 people) who own property in Estonia are under threat because of the visa ban, according to the deputy secretary. Interior Ministry data reveals that Russians possess 41,351 properties in total in the country. But most of them will be unaffected by the entry restrictions as they have residence permits and live in Estonia. Kommusaar also said it is dangerous for the country of 1.3 million that such a large amount of real estate is concentrated in Russian hands. “Of course, there are those critical places where owning a property is an immediate threat to our security. There are certainly other places, in the form of single apartments, where the problem isn’t that serious.” The official suggested that Estonia must work to limit the possibility of non-EU citizens acquiring real estate in the country.",4.5287495198367065,3.7889125276422733,0.7398369921944332,3

The drone was shot down by small arms fire and fell on the roof of one of the buildings at the nuclear site, the Russian Defense Ministry said during a daily briefing. The building in question serves as storage for nuclear fuel and waste, it said. The crash didn’t cause any significant damage, the statement added. The incident was described as part of a pattern of Ukrainian attacks against the Russia-controlled facility and the city of Energodar, which hosts it. Ukrainian artillery launched at least eight large-caliber shells at the city on Sunday, with two of them landing near the nuclear power plant, according to the report. The Ukrainian staff at the facility “ensures the technical condition and operation” of the Zaporozhye plant, the Russian ministry added. It said there was no evidence of radiation leaks from the site. On Sunday, city officials reported a strike on a residential area by a Ukrainian 'kamikaze drone' and said another unmanned aerial aircraft was shot down by Russian air defense. The Zaporozhye plant has been subjected to regular artillery and drone attacks for weeks, with Moscow and Kiev accusing each other of launching them. The Ukrainian government has also claimed that Russia has used the captured facility as a military base to host heavy weapons and from which to launch artillery strikes at Ukrainian positions. The Russian military has denied such claims, saying that there are only lightly-armed guards at the plant. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors are expected to visit the Zaporozhye plant this week to ascertain what state it is in, verify the security of fissile materials in the reactors and storage facilities, and generally assess the situation.

The daughter of the well-known philosopher and ‘Eurasia’ advocate Aleksandr Dugin, was killed in a Moscow car bombing earlier this month. Tsiganenko allegedly helped the primary suspect, Natalya Vovk, obtain a fake Kazakhstani passport and assemble an improvised explosive device, which she later used in the crime, according to the statement. The suspected 42-year-old bombmaker entered Russia from Estonia in late June and left a day before the bomb attack on August 20, the FSB said on Monday. The IED was made at a rented garage, the agency added. The FSB believes that the two acted together as members of a “Ukrainian sabotage-terrorist group.” The agency released images and footage said to show Tsiganenko traveling with Vovk in her car, receiving falsified car plates for the vehicle, and entering and leaving Russia. The statement also provided new details about the assassination itself. The FSB released footage showing Vovk surveilling Dugina at a parking lot of the family festival where she presumably planted the bomb. The Ukrainian woman followed her target in her car and set off the explosion, which killed Dugina on the spot, according to the FSB. Dugina was a vocal critic of the government in Kiev and a supporter of Russia’s military action in Ukraine. She was also the daughter of controversial philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, who Western media has long described as a secret influencer of Russian foreign policy. After Vovk was identified as the primary suspect in the case, Russia accused Ukraine of masterminding the assassination. Kiev has denied any involvement.

The proud and glorious Ukrainian Donetsk was humiliated by the Russian occupation and robbed. But Ukraine will return. For sure. Life will return. The dignity of the people of Donbass will return.

The US may be helping Ukraine prepare for an impending counteroffensive against Russia, the Washington Post claimed in a piece published this week, pointing to the type of weaponry making up the latest batch of military aid pledged to Kiev by the Pentagon. Last month, a number of top Ukrainian officials suggested that the country’s military would launch a counteroffensive in the south of the country in August to retake the city of Kherson. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/561695-dugin-moscow--car-bombing-target/,Dugin names target of attack that killed his daughter,"Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin believes his daughter, Daria, was the target of the car-bomb attack that took her life last week, he has told journalists. The murder generated a lot of speculation about whether the killers intended to assassinate Dugin himself or his daughter. “It was no mistake,” he said. “Every effort was made to kill her… she was the target,” he told a documentary titled “Why was Daria Dugina killed?” that is to be aired by Russia’s Channel One. Dugina, 29, was driving her father’s Toyota SUV when it exploded, prompting Russian law enforcement and authorities to assume that the philosopher himself might have been the target of the attack. According to Dugin, his daughter was targeted because she championed the “Russian idea… the idea of great power statehood; security for our people and our nation.” A conservative firebrand and rather fringe figure at home, Dugin himself has been dubbed ‘Putin’s brain’ and ‘Putin’s Rasputin’ by the western media that claimed he supposedly exerted influence on President Vladimir Putin’s worldview. In Russia Dugin is mostly seen as a marginalized figure with no real influence. Earlier, Dugin had called his daughter’s murder a “terrorist act” and blamed “the Nazi Ukrainian regime” for the killing. He also said that he wanted Russia’s “victory” in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine rather than revenge. Kiev has denied any official involvement in the car-bomb attack. The Russian security service, the FSB, identified the suspect behind the bombing as Ukrainian national Natalya Vovk, 43. Vovk, under the surname Shaban, appeared on the list of Ukrainian National Guard personnel that was published in April on the Russian internet. The doxx claimed she was associated with the “Azov” neo-Nazi regiment. However, neither Russia nor Ukraine officially confirmed this information. Earlier this week, the UN called for a probe into Dugina’s killing. An investigation is needed to “establish the facts” behind the incident, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, told reporters on Monday. Pope Francis called Dugina a “poor girl” and, in public comments this week, lamented that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was claiming innocent lives on both sides. His remarks angered Kiev, which went as far as to summon the Vatican’s envoy to lodge a formal complaint over the Pope’s words.

2022-08-28,https://www.rt.com/russia/561683-ukraine-us-sea-weapons/,US expands weapons deliveries by sea to Ukraine – WaPo,"The US has significantly expanded deliveries of weapons to Ukraine by sea amid the conflict with Russia, Pentagon officials have told The Washington Post on Saturday. The Pentagon mainly relied on cargo planes to send ‘lethal aid’ to the Ukrainian government at the start of the Russian military operation in the neighboring country. It began using the sea routes for some of the items a few weeks after the outbreak of the fighting in late February. But the American maritime operation was “significantly broadened” later in spring when Washington began sending howitzers and other heavy weapons, which require a lot of large-caliber ammunition, to Kiev, according to the paper. “Once we started to provide them howitzers, we knew that we were going to need more ammunition,” Army Col. Steven Putthoff, the deputy director of operations at US Transportation Command, said. “So, we could plan ahead a little bit more, and then we could start to use more sealift to provide that support and to get it there, sometimes even ahead of the request.” Planes are much faster in getting the weapons from the US to Europe, but ships can carry a lot more cargo, the paper pointed out. The switch in the Pentagon’s delivery methods signaled the new phase in the conflict as “Ukraine and its partners settled in for what is expected to be a grinding war that could continue for months more and possibly years,” the Washington Post said. US defense officials declined to detail the specific routes used by the Pentagon to deliver weapons to Ukraine, it added Washington has been the prime backer of Kiev amid its conflict with Russia, providing it with billions of dollars in military and financial aid, as well as intelligence data. The US deliveries to the Ukrainian military have included thousands of anti-aircraft Stinger missiles and Javelin anti-armor missiles, as well as such sophisticated hardware as HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, M777 howitzers and combat drones. The latest military aid package of $2.98 billion – the largest so far – was announced by US President Joe Biden mid-week. Russia has been critical of weapons supplies to Kiev by the US and its allies, arguing that they only prolong the conflict and increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Moscow and NATO.",3.4266012888591795,2.578282119145572,0.8483191697136077,7

In response to Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, several member states have actively been lobbying for either a ban or heavy restrictions on the number of Russian citizens entering the bloc. “It is inappropriate for Russian tourists to stroll in our cities, on our marinas,” a senior EU official told the newspaper. “We have to send a signal to the Russian population that this war is not OK, it is not acceptable.” The suspension of the agreement would make the process of applying for all EU visas more complicated and expensive, as well as increasing waiting times. “We are in an exceptional situation and it requires exceptional steps. We want to go beyond suspending the visa facilitation,” an EU official was quoted as saying. The official stated that additional restrictions could be adopted by the end of the year, according to the FT. Countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Latvia have already stopped issuing visas to Russian citizens. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said this week that Russian tourists pose a security threat to the country, and that a travel ban could incentivize some Russians to “pressure” the Kremlin. Others, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell, spoke out against a full ban on Russian travelers.

According to the outlet, the delegation includes Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA chief, and 13 other experts from “mostly neutral countries.” The report also reveals that neither the US nor Britain have any representatives on the team, given that Russia had dismissed those countries as “unfairly biased” over their support for the government in Kiev.

2022-08-28,https://www.rt.com/news/561664-ukraine-us-resistance-concept/,Ukraine following US blueprint to fight Russia – CNN,"During its conflict with Russia, Ukraine has been relying on a US-developed doctrine that involves both the military and civilians taking part in defensive activities, CNN reported on Saturday. The Resistance Operating Concept (ROC), which is said to provide a blueprint for smaller states to counter larger powers, was developed in 2013 in response to Russia’s conflict with Georgia in 2008. It was further enhanced after Crimea’s “nearly bloodless” reunification with Moscow in 2014, which “stunned Ukraine and the West,” CNN said. The ROC represents “an innovative and unconventional approach to warfare and total defense,” and guides the actions not only of the Ukrainian military, but also the civilian population. “It’s all hands on deck in terms of the comprehensive defense for the government of Ukraine,” explained retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, who was in charge of Special Operations Command Europe during the development of the concept. “They’re using every resource and they’re also using some highly unconventional means by which to disrupt the Russian Federation military.” Schwartz said it was “just incredible to watch… despite the unbelievable loss of life and sacrifice, what the will to resist and the resolve to resist can do.” Explosions at Russia’s military facilities in Crimea – far from the front line in Donbass – earlier in August were signs that the ROC had been in play, claimed Kevin D. Stringer, a retired army colonel who led the development team for the concept. Kiev never officially confirmed its involvement in the incidents, but CNN said it saw a Ukrainian government report confirming that it was behind them. Russia said the blasts at its Saki airfield in western Crimea were the result of an accident, while an ammunition depot in the north of the peninsula had been targeted in an “act of sabotage.” “Since you can’t do it conventionally, you would use special operations forces, and those [forces] would need resistance support – intelligence, resources, logistics – in order to access these regions,” Stringer said, explaining the alleged actions by Kiev. Civilian resistance under the ROC includes nonviolent actions such as boycotting public events, labor strikes, and even using satire and jokes as means of resistance. Violent actions, like using Molotov cocktails, arson and putting chemicals in gas tanks to sabotage enemy vehicles, are also part of the concept. Generally, the doctrine calls for a major PR campaign to control the narrative of the conflict, preventing the dissemination of the other side’s message, and keeping the population united. Video footage showing destroyed Russian hardware and edited to catchy tunes forms part of the strategy, along with clips of Ukrainian troops rescuing stray animals, and daily addresses by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky – “whether intentional or not,” CNN claimed. At least 15 countries have taken part in some form of training on the Pentagon’s resistance doctrine over the past decade, Nicole Kirschmann, a spokeswoman for Special Operations Command Europe, revealed. The program isn’t universal. It’s being tailored in accordance with each country’s population, resources and terrain. CNN’s report mentioned Estonia, Lithuania and Poland as nations that have expressed enthusiasm for the ROC.",2.6978346405273754,3.5154448191512944,-0.8176101786239189,0

Russian cinema has been around for more than a century. The first screening of a domestic film took place back in 1908 under Emperor Nicholas II. But despite its long and rich history, its birth only began to be celebrated relatively recently – in 1980. The date has shifted many times, and only in 2001 did it finally come to rest on August 27. It was on this day in 1919 that a decree on the nationalization of the USSR’s film department was adopted. Russia’s eventful history has left a big mark on cinema. Pre-war films, as well as those made during the ‘thaw’ period, were full of optimism, while in the 1970s there was more realism. After the collapse of the USSR, priorities changed and new filmmakers appeared to speak on their own topics. Despite the global changes in the country and society, Russian cinema did not stand still and tried to find new ways to communicate with its audiences. Finally, we can safely say that, in the last decade, the art form has been rejuvenated Modern Russian film preserves the traditional features and motifs of the national culture but works with them more carefully. Traditional time-tested dramatic devices are no longer the sole basis of a particular movie, but serve to complement the overall picture, imbuing it with the same ‘Russian soul.’ Time does not stand still, and cinema must develop, so attempts to shoot something in the spirit of the Soviet era are doomed to failure. The filmmakers bring a new language, new techniques, and new meanings to their works, even if we are talking about historical cinema. After all, it must first of all resonate with today’s viewer. At its best, modern Russian cinema is skillfully shot and technically sound, while TV serials raise important issues and speak to modern viewers. There are many new Russian filmmakers who have received wide recognition both at home and abroad. If you follow the winners of prestigious international film festivals, you’ll see that Russian films appear on the list every year. In the 21st century, several high-profile directors appeared in Russia at the same time, whose premieres aroused increasing interest. These include Yuri Bykov, Kirill Serebrennikov, Andrey Zvyagintsev, Kantemir Balashov, Ivan I. Tverdovsky, and others. These are all very different filmmakers, each with their own signature. What unites them is their ability to hook the viewer and ask the right questions. Andrey Zvyagintsev has long been the object of worldwide fame. His 2003 feature-length debut The Return won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Leviathan (2014) and Loveless (2017) were nominated for Oscars, and the latter won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Perhaps Zvyagintsev’s most famous work remains Elena. The picture received a special prize in the Cannes Film Festival’s ‘Un Certain Regard’ program. And the American magazine Rolling Stone included Elena in a list of the best 50 films from the second decade of the 21st century. Despite being released in 2011, the film has not lost its relevance today and, perhaps, has even acquired new meanings. This is a subtle and precise study of class stratification based on two people who entered into an unequal marriage. Anti-capitalist sentiments are very popular in the West now. Almost every Hollywood film either directly or casually criticizes capitalism. But many films lack a sense of proportion, containing banal slogans that often cannot be applied to the lives of ordinary people. Therefore, they resonate little with viewers on a personal level. Zvyagintsev’s story is simple and understandable yet has depth and encourages viewers to seek different meanings. Zvyagintsev does not criticize capitalism directly. He does not say things openly, but this is the attraction of Elena – the viewer can easily put himself in the place of the protagonists and, with the help of images and hints, grasp the main idea of the picture. Where to watch Elena: iTunes, Amazon Prime, KanopyWhere to watch Loveless: Amazon PrimeWhere to watch Leviathan: Amazon Prime Kantemir Balagov, a student of leading Russian cinema figure Andrei Sokurov, perhaps best shows what cinema is like in modern Russia. Balagov’s full-length debut Closeness was a great success as part of the 2017 Cannes Film Festival’s ‘Un Certain Regard’ program. The president of the screening, Thierry Fremaux, even said that Closeness represented a “revival of the film industry” in Russia. Fremaux, of course, was exaggerating a bit, as many good films had been shot in Russia before 2017, but his reaction can be understood. Closeness is shot in a genuinely new Russian film style, the search for which has long been discussed by many film critics. Balagov’s second film, Beanpole, was already a much-anticipated event and, naturally, became one of the best Russian films of 2019. The picture tells the story of a friendship between two women in post-war Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) in 1945. The first thing that catches your eye is the maximum respect given to frontline soldiers. The war has just ended. The siege of Leningrad had been broken just a year and a half before. People in the city are still suffering from huge spiritual trauma but trying to start a new life in peacetime, which seemed completely unattainable not so long ago. But with all this, Balagov did not fear vivid visualization. Beanpole has a distinctive palette that cannot be confused with that of any other movie. The delicate balancing of the semantic load, the narrative’s difficult subject, and the most beautiful video sequence is the film’s main attraction. In 2020, former US President Barack Obama even included Beanpole in his annual list of best pictures. It is not surprising that after such success, Balagov was invited to the USA to shoot the pilot of the series The Last of Us, which is based on the Sony video game of the same name. Where to watch Closeness: Amazon Prime, KanopyWhere to watch Beanpole: Amazon Prime, Kanopy Kirill Serebrennikov launched his filmmaking career back in the 1990s though his major breakthrough came after “Playing the Victim” was released in 2006. The monologue about Russian football delivered by Vitaly Khaev’s character quickly became a source of popular quotes. Since then, Serebrennikov has turned into a popular theater director, has made more movies, and has become the creative force behind a trendy Moscow venue. Two of his more recent films, “Summer” and “Petrov’s Flu,” are an important achievement in his career. “Summer” is a biopic dedicated to the Leningrad underground rock scene in the early 1980s and, more specifically, to Viktor Tsoi, the frontman of Kino and one of Russia’s most iconic musicians, who died in a tragic accident on August 15, 1990, at the age of 28. Just eight years had passed since his first album was released, but those years had made Tsoi a true legend. Even today, his fans gather in the center of Russia’s biggest cities to mark important dates in his life by singing his songs and celebrating his legacy. While being fully aware of the singer’s tragic fate, Serebrennikov made a movie brimming with optimism, even though every viewer knows where and when the main protagonist’s story will come to an end. “Petrov’s Flu” transports its viewers to Yekaterinburg in the 1990s following the Petrov family, who come down with the flu as the country is going through a tumultuous period after the collapse of the USSR. This multilayered film uses magic realism to create, quite counterintuitively, an authentic depiction of the times. Suffering from the flu, the characters sometimes have trouble telling reality from feverish hallucinations, and this approach, teetering on the brink of surrealism, may well be the most accurate depiction of 1990s Russia. Where to watch “Summer”: Kanopy Yuri Bykov burst onto the movie scene in 2013 with “The Major.” The director succeeded in making the tragic story of a police officer who tries to hide a crime he committed really relatable. In 2018, Netflix released “Seven Seconds,” a miniseries based on “The Major’s” plot, which enjoyed a positive critical reception and allowed Regina King to win an Emmy award as an outstanding lead actress. Nearly all of Bykov’s movies focus on “the ordinary man,” a well-known phrase for any Soviet or Russian school student, who will have heard it many times in literature classes covering 19th century Russian literature. And it’s true that Bykov’s creativity is deeply rooted in Russian culture, as he manages to give very convincing cinematic expressions of Russia’s trademark brand of melancholy, sense of doom, and fatalism. By putting traditional themes in the context of the country’s present-day realities, however, Bykov has reinvented the language of Russian cinematography. His work is geared towards a younger audience but resonates well with lovers of classical literature. “The Fool” follows a plumber’s struggle against bureaucracy and small-town corruption. “Guard” reminds us that warring criminal gangs are still around, if you just look outside the major cities. These topics have a universal appeal for almost anyone on this planet. Everywhere you have people abusing power, however limited, you have criminals, and you have everyday problems which you often cannot resolve, so you just have to accept reality and get on with your life as best you can. “The Method,” an expensive police crime drama, stands out from the rest of Bykov’s work. It tells the story of a unique detective who uses a mysterious method to catch the most elusive and dangerous serial killers. “The Method,” which at the time of its release in 2015 had very little competition in Russia, foreshadowed the era of high-quality Russian TV shows. Where to watch “The Major”: Amazon Prime (you might also like the American remake “Seven Seconds” on Netflix)Where to watch “The Fool”: iTunesWhere to watch “Guard”: NetflixWhere to watch “The Method”: Netflix With HBO premiering “The Wire” in 2002, a success later followed by “Lost” and “Mad Men,” the TV series boom in Hollywood predated the golden age of Russian shows by a decade. Bykov’s “The Method” demonstrated that a TV drama in the world's largest country could be intelligent and beautifully shot. A major boost for the quality of Russian shows was the rapid emergence of Russian streaming services, which put fewer constraints on directors’ creativity than typical producers of movies shot for the silver screen. Boris Khlebnikov followed his hugely successful 2017 drama “Arrhythmia” with “An Ordinary Woman,” a TV series starring Anna Mikhalkova. The protagonist appears to be a simple person, who owns a small flower shop, raises two kids, and takes care of her husband, a surgeon. Soon enough, however, we find out that all this is a cover for her prostitution racket. The show was a revelation both for audiences and critics. A bold idea and an unusual take on dealing with social issues have made “An Ordinary Woman” one of the most prominent achievements of Russia’s TV series industry until this day. “To the Lake” is a major post-apocalyptic thriller about a group of people who are trying to survive a terrible plague which turns everyone into zombie-like creatures. Released towards the end of 2019, shortly before the coronavirus pandemic, the series quickly became a meme, first in Russia, then everywhere else after Netflix bought the first season. November 2020 saw the premiere of “Dead Mountain,” the most unorthodox Russian show yet in terms of both form and content. Released on a streaming platform, the series was a sensation. It masterfully balances two parallel narratives – one about the death of young tourists in the mountains and the other about the investigation of the incident. The execution of the first story line is immaculate. The director used angles and lighting typical of the late 1950s and early 1960s to transport audiences back in time in a veritable time machine. “Central Russia’s Vampires” is another brilliant attempt at trying to uncover Russia’s true identity. The movie is a dazzling mixture of sci-fi, mysticism, comedy, everyday life, love drama, and even a quest for the human soul. While at first you may be tempted to see “Central Russia’s Vampires” as a tribute to Taika Waititi’s “What We Do in the Shadows,” this feeling quickly goes away after the show takes quite a different turn. The story arc is built around a family of vampires who have been living in the Russian city of Smolensk for hundreds of years. The patriarch, who has been around since the Middle Ages, has been adding family members by converting people who were facing imminent death into bloodsuckers. The appeal of the show is in small details such as the characters’ personal traits, gestures, and seemingly inconsequential remarks. The important and popular idea behind “Central Russia’s Vampires” is that what makes us human is how we act, so that a vampire may be more humane. Another key concept is the love for the place we’re from. Given their vast experience and longevity, these ancient creatures could have easily become billionaires and moved to Moscow to enjoy a fancier lifestyle, yet they choose to reside in a humble house in Smolensk because they really enjoy the connection to their hometown. Last year, 153 Russian movies were released – a significant achievement for a country where 15 or 20 films per year would have been a lot 20 years ago. The Russian movie industry is experiencing a renaissance, which has seen the arrival of new writers and directors and the release of many series made by budding filmmakers. All in all, there is healthy competition. The films mentioned in this article are just a handful of Russia’s cinematic offerings, and many more original creations deserving of the highest respect can be found if you do a little research.",4.013276063559882,4.054710826991311,-0.041434763431428934,6
2022-08-27,https://www.rt.com/news/561644-medvedev-nuclear-weapons-ukraine/,Ex-Russian president names condition for using nukes,"Moscow would only resort to nuclear weapons in four scenarios, all of which present an existential threat to the Russian state, former president Dmitry Medvedev told French media on Friday. Speaking to the TV channel LCI, Medvedev was asked whether Russia’s military doctrine allows for using tactical nuclear weapons. The former president responded that Moscow’s nuclear posture has been made public, and there is nothing secret about it. “There are four reasons for the use of nuclear weapons. For the sake of interest and for the French public, I will name them: the launch of nuclear missiles, the use of nuclear weapons, attacks on critical infrastructure that controls nuclear weapons, or other actions that threaten the existence of the [Russian] state,” he said, adding that none of the above has happened so far. Commenting on the possible use of tactical atomic weapons, or arms containing depleted uranium, the former president noted that Russia has never put those into action, unlike some Western countries. “Over the past 20-30 years, the NATO states have used them quite actively both in Yugoslavia and Iraq. There is some uncertainty around this topic, with very tragic consequences. So, in this sense, we must first look at what Western countries have done in certain situations,” Medvedev said. The former president stressed that Russia’s response “will be consistent with the size of the threats this country is facing,” and that Moscow’s military offensive in Ukraine, which started in late February, is a defensive measure. According to Medvedev, one of the reasons for the attack was a statement by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who said at one point that Kiev does not rule out restoring its nuclear potential. “Apparently, he wanted to scare us, but in the end he created an even heavier atmosphere, which ultimately forced the Russian Federation to launch a special military operation,” he said. Last week, Ivan Nechaev, deputy press secretary of the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated that Moscow has no need to use a nuclear option in Ukraine, and that Russia is a responsible nuclear power, which will only use its atomic arsenal if its very existence is under threat.",2.8163554659710823,3.4206752294941407,-0.6043197635230584,8
2022-08-27,https://www.rt.com/russia/561637-un-us-nuclear-talks/,UN comments on US-Russia nuclear arms talks,"Russia and the United States need to resume talks on replacing the landmark New START nuclear arms reduction treaty, a senior United Nations official said on Friday. Speaking at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), Izumi Nakamitsu, UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, was asked when she thinks Moscow and Washington should start negotiating a potential successor to New START. “I think as soon as possible,” she said, stressing that the treaty, which sets limits on the US and Russian nuclear arsenals, must be replaced before the 2026 expiry date. “Otherwise, the world will have no restraints, and we’re saying that this will be a very dangerous situation,” Nakamitsu added. The UN believes that both Russia and the US have no objections to negotiating a successor to New START. “We’ve been calling on both parties to resume their engagement as soon as possible,” the official noted. The UN official’s comments come after Andrey Belousov, the deputy Russian representative to the UN and other international organizations in Geneva, revealed on Thursday that US-Russia contacts on strategic arms reduction have not been interrupted. However, US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins said further discussions on the New START treaty were not yet taking place. “Discussions between the US and Russia about the next steps in relation to the New START treaty are not happening right now because of the situation we're dealing with. And these talks will continue in the future when the situation for that is right,” she noted. In early August, US President Joe Biden claimed that Washington was ready to negotiate “a new arms control framework to replace New START when it expires.” Following this statement, however, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that no proposals on the matter had been made by the US.",1.6365218106716206,4.042657279495534,-2.406135468823914,8
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561625-amnesty-warning-donbass-trial/,Amnesty issues warning about Donbass tribunal,"Amnesty International is against putting Ukrainian POWs on trial for alleged war crimes, insisting that Russia and Donbass are in no position to do so. Describing the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as “Russian-backed armed groups,” the organization called the upcoming tribunals “illegal and abusive.” The organization also blasted the decision to set up the trials in the city of Mariupol, captured by Russian and Donbass forces during the ongoing conflict, saying it was “a further act of cruelty against a city.” “Any attempts by Russian authorities to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in so-called ‘international tribunals’ set up by armed groups under Russia’s effective control in Mariupol are illegal and unacceptable,” Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Marie Struthers, said in a statement on Friday. The remarks echoed those recently made by top Ukrainian officials, including Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who threatened to cut any potential negotiations with Russia should Ukrainian POWs, primarily fighters of the notorious neo-Nazi Azov regiment, be placed on a “show trial.” “If this despicable show trial takes place … This will be the line beyond which any negotiations are impossible. Russia will cut itself off from any negotiations,” Zelensky said in a video address on Monday. Zelensky’s call, however, has been promptly snubbed by top Russian and Donbass officials, with the head of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, stating such threats will have “no effect” on the tribunal plans. “The data on 80 counts of crimes committed by the Azov has been collected, 23 people have been arrested and are in custody,” Pushilin stated. Russian Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin issued a darker warning in response to Zelensky’s threats, suggesting the public hearings will expose Kiev’s crimes, which is why the Ukrainian president rightfully fears them. “He and the Kiev regime have reasons to be afraid,” Volodin said. “He and his inner circle ordered to bomb, shoot and kill peaceful citizens: the elderly, women, children. That is why Zelensky is doing everything to prevent the tribunal.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",5.319654047579163,4.185536824277646,1.1341172233015167,2
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561627-un-ukraine-resolution-support/,Only one in three UN members back new anti-Russia resolution,"Ukraine’s latest proposal to condemn Russia has attracted the backing of just 58 out of 193 UN member states, a far cry from the number that symbolically supported Kiev in the General Assembly in March. Kiev’s envoy to the UN Sergey Kislitsa heralded the proposed resolution on Wednesday, following the Security Council meeting convened on Ukraine’s independence day. The session featured a video address by President Vladimir Zelensky, for which the council had to override protocol requiring in-person appearances, and a series of statements by Western governments denouncing Russia. Moscow’s envoy Vassily Nebenzia provided the counterpoint by introducing evidence of Ukrainian atrocities into the record and even naming Kiev’s western backers as accomplices in specific instances. Kislitsa’s resolution also fell short of the support Kiev had back in March, right after the start of the Russian military operation. At the March 2 General Assembly session,141 member countries – or 73% of the UN – voted for a nonbinding resolution to condemn Moscow. This week, however, that support stood at 30%, with no African, Persian Gulf or BRICS countries on board – and only two Latin American governments, Colombia and Guatemala, standing with Ukraine.",2.053254267312312,3.41694176856995,-1.3636875012576377,8

The city was seized by Russian forces early in the ongoing conflict and has remained under their control ever since. The blast occurred at a local holiday house, which is currently used to accommodate temporarily displaced people and refugees, primarily from Mariupol, local mayor, Alexander Saulenko, has said. The explosive device, filled with pre-made shrapnel, was affixed to a tree some three meters above ground, he added. Kolesnikov’s service vehicle was in the blast zone, while shrapnel also pelted a playground nearby. “During the explosion, miraculously, there was no one on the playground where children could play and be, none of the children were injured,” Saulenko said, blaming the incident on Ukrainian authorities. “There is a Ukrainian trace of the Kiev terrorist regime, which is trying to fight the peaceful population in such fashion, which indicates that they do not think about the victims among children and civilians,” the mayor said.

2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561618-orthodox-church-exorcism-rules/,Russian church to ‘streamline’ exorcisms,"The Russian Orthodox Church has finalized a draft of rules to regulate the practice of exorcism, in the making since 2021. If the draft becomes part of canon law, banishing demons will be a free service, and only priests and bishops will be allowed to practice it, to prevent abuses. Exorcism can be performed “only in cases of demonic possession,” and not for persons with mental disorders or diseases or those who “feign possession,” says the draft document, published on Thursday on the website of the Moscow Patriarchate. The clergy are instructed to become familiar with basic psychiatry so they can make the appropriate judgment. “The performer of the rite of exorcism can only be a bishop, or a priest who has received the blessing of the ruling bishop for this,” the document adds. “The Church expects a high spiritual life from the performer of an exorcism. Neither the exorcist nor his hierarchs should expect payments for performing the rite.” Instructions for the rite itself take up two pages of the seven-page document, while the rest is dedicated to explaining the Russian Orthodox Church’s position on exorcism, a historical examination of the practice both in Russia and other Orthodox nations, and problems associated with exorcism. The draft has been published to solicit public comment, with the commenting period open through the end of October 2022. The church previously said the hierarchs have spent close to three years working on the document. Its necessity was explained by the fact that sometimes “sick people are subjected to humiliation or psychological violence” during mass “cleansings” captured on video, which then result in “false possession” reports and “mass hysteria.” In late 2020, church spokesman Bishop Hilarion of Volokolamsk said that believers should not perform exorcisms by themselves. At least two exorcism-related deaths have been reported over the previous decade. A nine-year-old boy was gagged and whipped during a 2019 ritual, and choked to death. In 2011, a 25-year-old woman in Voronezh also died after her parents attempted to exorcize her. Orthodoxy is one of the four officially recognized religions in Russia, followed by Islam, Buddhism and Judaism.

2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561609-nuclear-plant-shelled-again/,Artillery hits Zaporozhye nuclear dump,"Four artillery projectiles fired from Ukrainian positions struck the fuel storage site of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant on Friday, authorities in the Russian-controlled city of Energodar claimed. They added that radiation levels remain normal, suggesting that they inflicted no damage. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was seized by Russian troops in early March, soon after Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine. Since then, Russian National Guard and specialist troops have been guarding the site, while the Ukrainian staff continued operations. Russian and local officials have accused Ukrainian forces of repeatedly attacking the Zaporozhye NPP with drones, artillery and even US-supplied weapons. Kiev has rejected the accusations and claimed Russia was using the facility as a military base and shelling its own troops to make Ukraine look bad. On Thursday, shelling started a wildfire south of Energodar and forced a shutdown of the power plant to prevent a meltdown. While the reactor building is designed to withstand a lot, the plant’s support systems are far more vulnerable. The area where hundreds of barrels of spent fuel are stored is particularly problematic, as any breach could lead to a radioactive release. Russian ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia has shown evidence of Ukrainian culpability in the shelling to the Security Council, including naming the units involved and giving their precise location. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he personally intended to lead a mission to inspect the Zaporozhye NPP “within days.” Moscow has repeatedly called on the IAEA to come inspect the facility, but the mission has been delayed by Ukraine’s insistence the inspectors must travel through Kiev. The Ukrainian government and its Western backers have accused Russia of a plot to “steal Ukrainian electricity” and demanded Moscow hand the Zaporozhye plant back to Kiev’s control, or set up a 30-kilometer (18-mile) demilitarized zone around it. Moscow has rejected the demands as unacceptable.",6.310594503375731,5.2950996832156605,1.0154948201600709,9

The present came from Taiwan, the newspaper said on its Russian-language social media on Thursday. The claim was widely repeated in Ukrainian media. The drones are made by the Taiwan-based firm DronesVision, which also makes anti-drone equipment. The Revolver model is a quadcopter design that carries a package of eight 60mm mortar shells weighing over 10kg, which can be released by the operator, according to the producer. The package looks like the rotating barrel of a revolver, giving the weapon its name. This kind of delivery system was developed and widely used by militant groups in Syria, who modified commercial drones to drop explosives.

2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561595-ukraine-de-russification-danger-risks/,Ukraine may come to regret 'de-Russification'– Politico,"Eradicating Russian linguistic and cultural influence amid the ongoing conflict is understandable but risks future trouble for Ukraine, as it will not only “give fodder to Kremlin propagandists” but also will make it harder for Ukrainians to live together peacefully, Politico has claimed. “Ukrainians’ firmer sense of nationhood and identity, fueled by fury at what is befalling them, risks becoming less inclusive and more Russian-hating,” Jamie Dettmer, opinion editor at Politico Europe, wrote in a piece published Friday. While blaming Moscow for “laying the groundwork” for what could become a long-running “ethnic conflict,” the author admits that de-Russification in Ukraine needs a “cool-headed examination.” “The process of removing Russian cultural and linguistic influence from the country is not an easy – or necessarily equitable – thing to do, when around a quarter of Ukrainians still identify as Russian speakers,” Dettmer, who previously worked as foreign and war correspondent for Voice of America, pointed out. This process – that had often merged with de-communization – started well before Russia launched its military operation in late February, the author noted. Back in 2015, for instance, Kiev banned Soviet symbols, including flags, street names and monuments commemorating Communist leaders. Since 2016, Dettmer wrote, all information on notice boards at railway stations and airports could only be given in Ukrainian and English but not in Russian. In January this year, the Politico editor recalled, Human Rights Watch raised concerns about “the lack of protections” for Russian speakers after a new law on language entered into force. The legislation, he explained, required media outlets registered in Ukraine to publish only in the Ukrainian language “or to provide an accompanying Ukrainian version, or equivalent in content, volume and method of print, when publishing in another language.” However, while exceptions were made for other minority languages, none were provided for Russian, Dettmer explained. According to the journalist, there are “risks in rejecting all things Russian.” First, he stated, it “gives fodder to Kremlin propagandists.” And, second, “aggressive de-Russification will make it even harder for all Ukrainians, regardless of their traditions and pasts, to reconcile and live together peaceably,” he claimed.",3.508806760440244,2.2660423832173953,1.2427643772228487,3
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561592-us-embassy-drunken-guard/,Russia releases video of ‘drunk’ US embassy worker,"Russia’s foreign ministry has, in jest, advised the US Department of State to remunerate more generously its staff working in Moscow, for their tough working conditions. The suggestion is accompanied by a video apparently depicting a drunken US embassy employee trying to make it to his work early in the morning. On Thursday, the ministry published a post on its Telegram channel reading: “We call on the US Department of State to raise the pay for the employees of the American embassy in Moscow for unbearable working conditions.” The message went on to suggest that “fighting us is a tiring activity.” Accompanying the ‘advice’ is a three-minute-long video clip, which features CCTV footage apparently captured early in the morning on July 10 this year in the vicinity of the US embassy in Moscow. It starts out with a caption reading “An employee of the US Embassy in Moscow is fighting the Regime… as hard as he can.” The clip then shows a man staggering across a street and then along a sidewalk, with a gait resembling that of an intoxicated person. At one point, the man tumbles to the ground, struggling for some time to get up again. The man is then seen entering the diplomatic mission’s grounds, the back of his shirt visibly wet and dirty after his fall. The video goes on to show the man attempting to open a door, though without much success. Eventually a policeman comes to his rescue. The two are seen talking, then the man shows what looks like an ID card and walks away from the door. The clip ends by quoting a Washington Post article dated December 3, 2021, saying: “The embassy is so shorthanded that many staff have had to take on extra jobs. U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan, for example, learned how to mix solutions to clean the restrooms and also how to work a floor buffer…” According to Russian media, the man in the video is an embassy guard, US marine Navarro Nicholas Stormy. The US government has accused Moscow of effectively paralyzing its embassy’s work by expelling most of its staff. Russia, in turn, insists the expulsions were ordered in response to Washington booting out Russian diplomats.",3.498660461974064,2.166176931024581,1.332483530949483,0
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561594-belarus-warplanes-nuclear-weapons/,Belarus delivers on nuke promise to Putin – Lukashenko,"Belarus has finished preparing some of its military aircraft for the possible deployment of Russian nuclear weapons, President Alexander Lukashenko revealed on Friday. “You remember [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and I said we will modify Belarusian Su jets so that they could carry nuclear weapons. Did you think we were blabbing? It’s all done!” he said, as quoted by national news agency Belta. The remark came as he was discussing NATO’s military deployments near Belarus’ borders. Lukashenko was referring to his meeting with the Russian president in late June, during which the Belarusian leader shared concerns over Poland’s requests for the US to deploy American tactical nuclear weapons on its soil. The Poles “are training to deploy nuclear warheads. Could you please at least help us modify warplanes that we have… so that they could carry nuclear weapons,” he said at the time. He later estimated that the necessary modifications could be complete within a couple of months. The US has been training non-nuclear NATO members like Poland how to use its tactical nuclear weapons for decades. Moscow has long called such exercises a violation of Washington’s non-proliferation commitments, which the US has denied. During the meeting with Lukashenko in June, Putin offered help to modernize Belarusian warplanes at Russian military factories, and to train its pilots to alleviate Minsk’s concerns about NATO.",3.6073546525947466,2.8600329484554186,0.7473217041393281,8
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/560965-ukrainian-mirotvorets-website/,'Peacemaker' of death: This Ukrainian website threatens hundreds of thousands with extrajudicial killings — some are Americans,"For the last eight years, a group of publicly unknown activists in Ukraine have been compiling lists of ‘enemies of the people’ with impunity. Hundreds of thousands have been declared criminals without trial. Among them are not only Russian citizens, but also Ukrainian opposition figures and bloggers, European politicians, and US citizens. At the very least, being added to this list is a stigma that makes life difficult in Ukraine, but it can also serve as justification for imprisonment or, in some cases, even being killed. This is exactly what happened last weekend to Daria Dugina, daughter of world-famous Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin, who’s name also can be found on that list. RT explains what is behind the Mirotvorets, or ‘Peacemaker’, website, whose creators seek to bring ‘peace’ to their country with the help of extrajudicial killings, and why the Ukrainian authorities have done nothing about this despite condemnation from the international community. The main page of the Ukrainian Mirotvorets website proclaims that the outlet represents a ‘Center for Research of Signs of Crimes against the National Security of Ukraine, Peace, Humanity, and the International Law’. It claims to have been created by a group of academics, journalists, and other specialists. However, their names are known to no one, and the outfit itself has never even been officially registered in Ukraine. Nevertheless, this organization has been in operation for nine years, since August 2014. And although it positions itself as “independent, non-state media,” government officials still had a hand in its creation. In fact, the website emerged at the initiative of Anton Gerashchenko, a former adviser to the Ukrainian minister of internal affairs. Mirotvorets’ activities boil down to publishing personal information on people who the site’s administrators consider a threat, in one way or another, to Ukrainian statehood. The site’s owners urge the country’s law enforcement agencies to take note of the personal data and activities of the people it lists. However, street radicals sometimes also take heed of Mirotvorets’ lists. And every time someone unlucky enough to have had his or her home address or other personal data revealed turns up dead, the site is updated: the name of the deceased now appears in bright flickering letters reminiscent of a Las Vegas casino, and the person’s photo is crossed out with the callous inscription: ‘liquidated’. For example, the current Mirotvorets’ web page design displays this way the data of the Russian journalist Darya Dugina, daughter of the philosopher Aleksandr, who was brutally killed last weekend in her own car. Despite the accusations from the Russian FSB, Ukraine denies any involvement in that murder. On Mirotvorets, however, Dugina’s death is described with a brief, dehumanizing commentary, along with a conspiracy theory: “Liquidated by the special services of fascist russia (sic) due to interspecies disagreements.” According to the site’s administrators, “the sources of information used by the Mirotvorets Center for ongoing academic research are publicly available materials that are printed and posted on social networks, web publications, private web pages, and specialized forums and blogs, as well as radio and TV broadcasts.” However, it’s not that simple. In 2017, the site launched its IDentigraF facial recognition system, which was funded by donors from 40 countries, according to the center’s editorial board. This database contains more than 2 million images of “persons who have committed crimes against Ukraine and its citizens.” In addition, up until 2016, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), and other law enforcement agencies in the country were among Mirotvorets’ partners. One can’t help but conclude that the personal information of the people who ended up in ‘Purgatory’ – a section of the site where personal information, including addresses, phone numbers, and documents, is published – were not obtained solely from social networks and newspapers. As of 2019, when the latest Mirotvorets report was published, the site contained data on “more than 30,000 Russian war criminals”, “more than 70,000 terrorists, militants, mercenaries, members of illegal armed formations and private armies controlled by the Russian aggressor”, “about 40,000 flagrant violators of Ukraine’s national borders”, “more than 44,000 traitors to the Motherland”, “more than 6,000 anti-Ukrainian propagandists”, etc. In total, nearly 200,000 people have been declared ‘criminals’ over the five years. However, these figures are far from complete since the site continues to collect personal information on a daily basis. Recently, participants in Russia’s Special Military Operation to demilitarize Ukraine, as well as Russian politicians, have been added to the list – although to an insufficient extent, according to the website’s creators, who support the official government in Kiev. Mirotvorets’ creators claim that the center “carries out its activities in strict accordance with the current legislation of Ukraine and international legal acts ratified by our state.” As an example, they refer to Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine, which obliges citizens to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. In legally justifying its activities, Mirotvorets refers to laws on information, terrorism, and privacy, as well as the ‘Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automated Processing of Personal Data’ adopted in 1981. However, the articles cited in the above-mentioned pieces of legislation have been chosen very selectively, with an emphasis on “protecting the security of the state.” Legally speaking, the Mirotvorets’ approach is very controversial. First of all, one of the basic principles of justice is the presumption of innocence, which is reflected, in particular, in the Council of Europe’s ‘Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms’. Among the crimes for which Mirotvorets collects data are “impingement on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”, being a “traitor to the Motherland”, “aiding militants and terrorists”, disseminating “war propaganda”, “inciting ethnic hatred, fascism, or anti-Semitism,” etc., which are included in the Criminal Code of Ukraine. However, only a court can find a person guilty of such acts, whereas Mirotvorets has no such authority. Mirotvorets not only accuses people of committing ‘crimes’ but also includes more abstract offenses in its lists, such as producing “anti-Ukrainian propaganda” and “participating in anti-Ukrainian propaganda events.” The list even has a section for “agents of influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine.” However, such areas are regulated by articles 9-11 of the ‘European Convention on Human Rights’, which concern freedom of expression, conscience, religion, thought, assembly, and association. The Mirotvorets center’s administrators are essentially seeking to deprive people whose opinions and beliefs do not suit them of their right to expression. In addition, in the site’s ‘On Interaction and Cooperation with the Center’ section, there is a sample form for reporting personal information on ‘criminals’ and their relatives, which includes fields for addresses, phone numbers, photos, links to social network profiles, and their ‘crime’ (i.e., categorization as ‘militant’ or ‘terrorist’), all without trial or investigation. The ‘criminals’ on public display, along with their wives, children, and parents, don’t even know they’re in ‘Purgatory’, let alone given a chance to defend themselves or cross-examine witnesses and confront their accusers. As long as Mirotvorets was limiting itself to publishing information on Ukrainian citizens living in Crimea and Donbass, Ukrainian opposition politicians and journalists, and Russian residents and officials, the odious organization went unnoticed in the ‘civilized world’. But a scandal erupted in 2016, when Mirotvorets published information on employees of a host of media outlets, including the BBC, Reuters, Al Jazeera, AFP, Le Monde, the Guardian, Le Figaro, France 24, El Mundo, CBS News, CNN, Sky News, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, Cheska Televize, Radio France, Channel 9 Australia, the Associated Press, Japan TV, the Daily Mail, Die Welt, the Washington Post and New York Times, as well as representatives of Human Rights Watch and many other organizations, for “cooperating with a terrorist organization"" (i.e., the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics). US State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau noted at the time that the US was “very concerned about the hacking of a database and publication of personal information about journalists in combat areas.” “It is simply unacceptable for journalists to be threatened for what they say or write. Governments should do everything possible to ensure the safety of journalists. A wave of online threats against journalists worsens the situation,” said Dunja Mijatovic, OSCE representative on Freedom of the Media. In addition to journalists and human rights defenders, politicians have also made it into Mirotvorets’ database. The website published information on German Bundestag deputies who visited Crimea, a list that includes Evgeny Schmidt, Rainer Balzer, Gunar Lindeman, Harold Latch, Nick Vogel, Helmut Seifen, and Blakes Christian. Ten US citizens, as well as French actor Samy Naceri, were relegated to ‘Purgatory’ for the same ‘offense’. According to the website, the Greek ‘enemies of Ukraine’ include former Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, cartoonist Stathis Stavropoulos, retired Air Force Lieutenant General Pavlos Hristou, and ‘Russian Athens’ editor Pavel Onoiko. While former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras also visited Crimea, he was removed from the database after expressing support for Petro Poroshenko. Top-tier politicians are also represented in Mirotvorets’ lists. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder can be found there, while Croatian President Zoran Milanovic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have also been recently added, as has authoritative American diplomat Henry Kissinger. Inclusion in the Mirotvorets list has been used as a justification for threats directed not only against ordinary citizens and journalists, but politicians as well. As the infamous and recently recalled Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnyk, wrote, ""an irresponsible trip of several would-be deputies can carry very, very unfortunate legal consequences for them. It is a pity that our warnings are still not taken seriously. Well, we’ll see.” In turn, Benjamin Moreau, deputy head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, stressed that the problem is moving from a purely legal to a practical one: some banks refuse to issue loans to persons included in the Mirotvorets database. The uproar involving the murders of opposition politician Oleg Kalashnikov and journalist Olesya Buzina after their addresses were published in the Mirotvorets database is widely known. Of course, the word ‘after’ does not necessarily mean ‘due to’, but the creators of the notorious center played along. In commenting on these murders, they wrote: “Agent 404 has distinguished himself again. He has been granted a short-term leave for the successful completion of today’s combat mission.” There have been repeated demands to shut down the website. In 2018, Germany joined the chorus of journalists and human rights activists protesting Gerhard Schroeder’s inclusion in the database. According to the Cabinet of Ministers, “the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany most definitely condemns Mirotvorets and demands that the Ukrainian government and authorities assist in its removal.” In February of 2021, the European Parliament approved a resolution stating: “The EP regrets that the political climate in the country has deteriorated when intimidation, hate speech and political pressure are widely used for political purposes; urges the authorities to strongly condemn and ban the activities of extremist and hateful groups and websites, such as Mirotvorets, which create tension in society and misuse the personal data of hundreds of people, including journalists, politicians and members of minority groups.” But so far, calls for the closure of Mirotvorets have, in fact, been limited to a chorus of journalists, human rights defenders, and parliamentarians, who lack the power to make legally binding decisions with respect to Ukraine. This issue is not included among the list of requirements put forth by the Council of Europe or the European Commission that Kiev must fulfil in order to implement the EU Association Agreement. Allocation of European and American assistance to Ukraine for carrying out reforms has not been made contingent on closing down Mirotvorets, nor have measures been taken to pressure the Kiev authorities to respect privacy and the presumption of innocence. With the Western authorities turning a blind eye, the Ukrainian government has been able to ignore the activities of the scandalous site and dismiss demands from international human rights defenders by coming up with various pretenses. For example, in response to demands by the UN for it to be shut down, Dmitry Razumkov, the ex-speaker of Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, said that the Rada does not have the authority to close media outlets. Nevertheless, when the Ukrainian authorities want to shut down certain media outlets, they do not hesitate to do so. For example, the National Security and Defense Council granted Zelensky the ability to close the 112 Ukraine, NewsOne, and ZIK opposition TV channels, and subsequently First Independent and UKRLIVE, as well as an online publication called Strana, among other media outlets. The Mirotvorets site is still up and continually updated with new data to this day.",3.228688604361974,3.3206478359932667,-0.09195923163129294,5
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561566-pope-killing-russian-journalist/,Not even Pope Francis is safe from Kiev's wrath: Holy Father is latest subject of Ukraine’s fiery judgment,"After mentioning the death of Darya Dugina, a young Russian journalist and political activist, Pope Francis has faced the anger of Kiev, which apparently thinks it has the monopoly on “innocence.” For the past six months, Kiev has lashed out at various government leaders and international organizations, like Amnesty International, for example, which reported on Ukraine’s violations of international law on the battlefield. So it was just a matter of time before the Catholic Church got an earful, too. And that’s what happened this week when Pope Francis, addressing a congregation in the Vatican, mentionegd the death of Darya Dugina, whose life was cut tragically short by a car bombing. But before uttering the name of the deceased Russian woman, the Pope acknowledged the innocent victims on both sides of the conflict. “Whether they are Ukrainians or Russians … I think of so much cruelty, of the many innocents who are paying for the madness, the madness of all sides because war is madness,” Pope Francis told his flock. “I think of the poor girl (Darya Dugina) who was blown up by a bomb under her car seat in Moscow. The innocent pay for the war.” That seems to be a fair assessment of the horrors of warfare that few could find fault with. While government leaders are ultimately responsible for leading their people into the “madness of war,” it is the “innocent” people – from soldiers on the frontlines to civilians back home – who suffer the brunt of the consequences. Yet, like a true politician, Ukraine’s Vatican ambassador Andrey Yurash politicized the Pope’s words, saying it was impossible to call Dugina “innocent” when she – together with her prominent father, the political philosopher Aleksandr Dugin – advocated on behalf of Moscow’s special military operation in Ukraine. Today’s speech ofPope was disappointing& made me think about many things: can’t speak inSame categories aboutАggressor &Victim, Rapist and Raped; howPossible To Mention 1of ideologists of🇷🇺ImperialismAs innocent victim?She wasKilledBy russiansAsSacredVictim &isNowOn Shield ofWar pic.twitter.com/GvvM7zJDCa There are several problems with Yurash’s peculiar brand of moralizing, the first one being that he, much like the Western world in general, conveniently fast-forwarded past eight years of bloodshed in Donbass that has caused millions of people – not just “political ideologues” – to support Russia’s intervention in eastern Ukraine in the first place. I’m not sure what Mr. Yurash was tweeting about in 2014, but somehow I doubt it had anything to do with the unprovoked attacks on Russian speakers in Donbass that have killed thousands. Second, it was telling how the Pope’s use of the word “innocent” when applied to Darya Dugina triggered such a powerful response from someone who calls himself a diplomat. What’s more, in his tweet, Yurash went on to apparently insinuate that it was the Russians themselves that killed her in order to make her a martyr. In any case, perhaps the diplomat’s response was to be expected since, as the anti-Russian narrative goes, there are no ‘innocent Russians’ to be found on the planet. They are simply extinct, and in fact may have never existed in the first place. Simply being Russian means guilt through association, that is, association with oneself. Just ask Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas who, in an effort to spare the European continent from those treacherous Russian tourists, is calling for a full visa ban to mitigate the “security threat.” In fact, all things considered, it was akin to a miracle to hear Pope Francis, the main religious leader of the Western world, not only mention Dugina’s assassination, but to go so far as to call a Russian citizen “innocent.” The entire world should seriously heed the Pope’s words, which I believe were spoken quite deliberately. The Bishop of Rome may have his faults, but he has been one of the few voices of reason throughout the last six months of “madness.” In June, Pope Francis challenged the Western narrative that says Russia is to blame for the hostilities in Ukraine, full stop. He did this by alluding to a conversation he had with a “very wise man” who he declined to name. This person told him: “They [NATO] are barking at the gates of Russia. They don’t understand that the Russians … can’t have any foreign power getting close to them.” The individual continued: “We do not see the whole drama unfolding behind this war, which was … either provoked or not prevented.” What lessons can we take away from this? Perhaps the most applicable one comes straight from Holy Scripture, which says, ‘May he who is without sin cast the first stone’. Those words should silence many people on both sides of the conflict.",2.289543568695923,3.9153088647804046,-1.6257652960844817,1
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/news/561589-us-weapons-watchdog-ukraine/,Pentagon watchdog doubtful Kiev tracks US weapons,"The Pentagon’s acting Inspector General Sean O’Donnell told Bloomberg on Thursday that his office will test the effectiveness of the system that tracks US weapons shipped to Ukraine as part of the Defense Department’s multi-billion dollar military assistance program. “As far as we can tell, right now, everything that is supposed to shoot and go boom, they are using every bit of it,” the official said, adding that the system needs to be double-checked as the Ukrainians use “hand receipts” to trace supplied arms. “I don’t think they have much fidelity” as to where it ends up, O’Donnell said. The IG’s office will be looking into the weapons shipments to ensure that they are not being diverted to the black market, according to the report. Concerns over such risks have been voiced by various European and international law enforcement agencies, following evidence that at least some easier-to-smuggle Western arms have ended up in the hands of gunrunners offering them to clients online. American and Ukrainian officials have given assurances that all Western weapons sent to Kiev are traced and used as intended to fight Russia. Reports to the contrary tend to be harshly criticized by Kiev and its allies. CBS News this month agreed to remake a documentary about corruption in Ukraine and how it affects foreign aid. The film originally featured remarks by the founder of an organization that has been sending various items to Ukrainian soldiers for years. He said getting equipment to the frontline in Ukraine required navigating a network of “power lords, oligarchs [and] political players,” trying to capitalize on the supplies. The Pentagon has in the past been caught failing to properly account for the vast scale of its assets. The department has failed multiple attempts to pass a financial audit since 2017, when the first such check was launched. After the latest failure in 2021, US military officials said they hoped to pass the test for the first time by 2027.",2.1080471818497046,4.1204746585073,-2.0124274766575954,7
2022-08-26,https://www.rt.com/russia/561584-kiev-protest-pope-dugina/,Ukraine summons Vatican envoy,"Kiev has summoned the Vatican’s representative in Ukraine to lodge a formal complaint over remarks made earlier this week by Pope Francis on the killing of a Russian journalist in Moscow. Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said during a media briefing on Thursday that Archbishop Visvaldas Kulbokas had visited the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry earlier in the day. Kiev was “disappointed” with remarks made by the Pope in response to the assassination of Darya Dugina, a Russian journalist and political commentator. She was killed by a bomb planted in her car. Moscow identified a Ukrainian woman as the primary suspect and accused Kiev of masterminding the murder, but Kiev has denied any involvement. Pope Francis called Dugina a “poor girl” and lamented that the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was claiming innocent lives on both sides. In response, Kiev claimed that the head of the Roman Catholic Church had made a false equivalence between “the aggressor and the victim.” The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said it could not understand why he mentioned the death of “a Russian citizen on Russian territory that had nothing to do with Ukraine.” Dmitry Kuleba also said “Ukraine’s heart was torn by the Pope’s words”, calling them “unjust”. Kiev’s ambassador to the Vatican, Andrey Yurash, earlier criticized the Pontiff on Twitter. He branded Dugina an ideologue of “Russian Imperialism” rather than an innocent person, and claimed that she was killed by “Russians”. Dugina was the daughter of controversial Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, who advocates Russian exceptionalism. Western media have portrayed him for years as a secret influencer of Russian foreign policy. Darya Dugina shared some of his political views and was a fierce critic of the current Ukrainian government. The bombing happened last weekend as the two were leaving a family party together near Moscow. According to initial reports the father was supposed to travel with the daughter in the bomb-rigged car, leading many to believe that he was the intended target. Russian investigators later said the suspect rented an apartment in the block where Dugina lived, indicating that the daughter may have been the target.",2.236719829394055,3.7769210426479156,-1.5402012132538605,1
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561567-gorlovka-donetsk-chemical-attack/,Ukraine strikes chemical plant – DPR,"Ukrainian rockets loaded with cluster bombs damaged a chemical plant in the Donetsk People’s Republic on Thursday and caused an electrical fire, according to local officials. The “Stirol” factory halted operations but there was no chemical release and the fire was eventually put out, authorities in the city of Gorlovka said. The plant was struck on Thursday afternoon by two missiles from Ukrainian “Uragan” multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), Gorlovka Mayor Ivan Prikhodko said on Telegram. The rockets were allegedly loaded with cluster munitions, which exploded and started a fire at the electrical substation inside the “Stirol” plant and on the roof of the nearby “Transammiak” factory. “Stirol” director Vasily Agarkov told local media that the factory halted operations until the fire was extinguished. Agarkov said that about 40 cluster bombs were scattered inside the factory, but that there was no risk of a chemical release. There were no reports of casualties. Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) emergency services said they received a fire call shortly after 6 pm local time, and it took the firefighters until 7:45 to localize the blaze. This was the second artillery attack on “Stirol” this month. On August 12, Ukrainian shelling, as claimed by DPR officials, also caused a fire at the plant, hitting a warehouse with construction materials. Gorlovka is located northeast of Donetsk city, with heavy fighting currently going on north and west of the city between Russian and DPR forces on one side, and Ukrainian troops on the other. Before the conflict, “Stirol” used to be one of Europe’s largest producers of mineral fertilizers, accounting for 3% of the global export of ammonia and related compounds. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561532-medvedev-military-coup-kiev/,Russian ex-president envisions military junta in Kiev,"Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has predicted that the Ukrainian military may stage a coup in Kiev to do what the civilian government refuses to do – negotiate peace with Russia. Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of the Russian National Security Council, outlined the scenario as one of two options that he believes to be viable for Ukraine. The other was if the government of President Vladimir Zelensky changed its tune and agreed to Russia’s terms for ending hostilities. Either way, Russia will get what it wants from Ukraine, the official said. Moscow declared the demilitarization and ‘denazification’ of Ukraine as the goals of its military operation in the country. Kiev initially appeared willing to accept a neutral status, but was later emboldened by Western military aid. Zelensky now insists that defeating Russia on the battlefield and retaking all the land that was under Kiev’s control before 2014 is the only possible option for his country. The assessment by Medvedev apparently came in response to a Wednesday article in The Guardian, which made predictions for how the Ukrainian crisis could develop over the next six months. Dan Sabbagh, the British newspaper’s defense and security editor, offered five predictions that he considers likely. The expectations included a deadlocked conflict and a reduction in the intensity of hostilities, a campaign of sabotage by Ukrainian special forces and a renewed refugee crisis during winter. The Russian official said that any scenario for the conflict that would predict a victory for Kiev was “crystal-clear lies and demagoguery.”",2.1814079996284206,2.780583816623262,-0.5991758169948413,8

Ryazan Region, which is located some 150 kilometers southeast of Moscow, has been hit by some of the worst wildfires experienced in recent years. The ministry reported this week that flames had engulfed almost 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of forests. The first blaze in the region was detected on August 7. In ten days, the wildfires had spread so much that the smoke from them could be smelled in the capital. Firefighters tackling the disaster are also dealing with hot weather and fast winds, which make their job more difficult, the minister explained. “At the moment I assess the situation as difficult, but it is fully under control,” Kurenkov told journalists. Russian law enforcement is currently on an alert for possible saboteurs seeking to damage the country on behalf of Ukraine. On Thursday, the domestic security agency FSB reported apprehending a Russian citizen who’d allegedly plotted “terrorist attacks” in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The suspect was described as a local resident and a supporter of Azov, a Ukrainian National Guard unit, whose members have a record of supporting far-right ideology. Moscow considers it to be an international terrorist organization. The FSB claimed that the man wanted to attack targets belonging to Russia’s Baltic Fleet and Khrabrovo Airport, which is used by both civilian and military aircraft.",3.7267994589036335,3.5378795826351057,0.1889198762685278,0
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561535-security-systems-activated-zaporozhye-nuclear/,Security systems activated at Zaporozhye nuclear power plant – officials,"Security systems have been activated at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant after a power outage, which temporarily left the facility without electricity, members of the Russia-backed administration in the Ukrainian region have claimed. The plant has since been connected to an alternative source of power, according to officials. The blackout is said to have been caused by massive wildfires in the area, which were started by Ukrainian shelling, theу said. Fires, which have engulfed parts of the steppe and woods surrounding the city of Energodar, led to short-circuits in the local grid, leaving not only parts of Zaporozhye region without power, but also the neighboring Kherson region. The head of the pro-Russian military-civil administration of Energodar, Yevgeny Balitski, has been quoted by media as saying: “according to preliminary information, because of massive shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces, which has continued since last night, fields and undergrowth caught fire. This led to a short-circuit in the grid.” Meanwhile, Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom company, which is the operator of the power plant, has issued a statement saying Russia’s actions have “resulted in the complete disconnection of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant from power supply – for the first time in history.” The Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant is the largest facility of its kind in Europe. It was seized by Russian forces in early March, soon after Moscow launched its military offensive against Kiev. Since then, the country’s National Guard and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense Troops have been guarding the site, with Ukrainian staff continuing to operate the plant. Over the past month, Russia has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the nuclear power plant, damaging some of the equipment and buildings. Moscow has warned that Kiev is risking a nuclear incident on a similar scale as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster or even worse. Ukraine, in turn, strongly denies its military is targeting the facility, and accuses Russian troops of deliberately shelling the plant to frame pro-Kiev forces. Moreover, Ukrainian officials and some of their Western supporters claim that Russia is using the plant as a military base, hiding its personnel and hardware on its grounds. Russian officials, for their part, have repeatedly called on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to send inspectors to the facility, saying that such a mission would corroborate Moscow’s version of events.",3.7044681198680904,5.680933290675946,-1.9764651708078556,9
2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561520-danilov-ukraine-preparation-war/,Kiev was gearing up for military conflict since 2019 – security chief,"A top Ukrainian security official has said that Kiev had been gearing up for hostilities with Russia since as early as December 2019. The Russian military had earlier reported uncovering classified Ukrainian documents indicating a planned offensive against Donbass rebels. The revelation about Kiev’s military preparation was made by Aleksey Danilov, who chairs Ukraine’s national security council, in an interview with the Polish daily Wyborcza on Tuesday. “We were actually preparing for the war from December 2019, and all the claims that we were not dealing with it are absolutely out of touch with reality,” he was quoted as saying. “If we did not prepare for war, today Russian tanks would be in Warsaw, Prague, Tallinn and Vilnius.” Danilov was apparently deflecting criticism directed at President Vladimir Zelensky. The Ukrainian leader admitted in an interview with The Washington Post last week that he’d intentionally downplayed US warnings about a possible Russian attack to prevent a mass exodus of Ukrainians. The newspaper called the admission the first serious messaging failure by Zelensky due to a furious domestic backlash he faced. In the interview, the security chief stood by the president’s decision, calling it correct in the long run. When Russia justified its late February attack against Ukraine, it cited the threat that Ukrainian forces posed to rebel militias and civilians in Donbass. In March, the Russian Defense Ministry published what it claimed to be classified Ukrainian documents proving that a Ukrainian operation in the east was in the pipeline. The Russian military assessed that Kiev would have launched an offensive in Donbass sometime in March, were it not for the Russian intervention. Moscow recognized the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics as sovereign states days before sending troops into Ukraine. Russia demanded a withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the lands claimed by the two republics, which Kiev rejected. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the two regions special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.”",3.5925887703056647,3.237356672053412,0.35523209825225255,2

The diplomat claimed the woman was not an innocent victim, and her murder was orchestrated by “Russians.” Dugina was killed on Sunday, when a bomb planted in her car exploded. The Pope condemned the incident, calling the woman “a poor girl” and lamenting that innocent people die on both sides during wars. The Ukrainian diplomat, Andrey Yurash, called the remarks “disappointing” in a tweet on Wednesday, saying the “aggressor” and “victim” cannot be spoken about in “the same categories.” He wrote that Dugina was not an innocent party, as she was an ideologue of “Russian Imperialism,” and went on to claim that she was killed by “Russians,” supposedly to rally domestic support for the military operation against Ukraine. Today’s speech ofPope was disappointing& made me think about many things: can’t speak inSame categories aboutАggressor &Victim, Rapist and Raped; howPossible To Mention 1of ideologists of🇷🇺ImperialismAs innocent victim?She wasKilledBy russiansAsSacredVictim &isNowOn Shield ofWar pic.twitter.com/GvvM7zJDCa Dugina was the daughter of controversial Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, whose works promote Russian exceptionalism, and who has been widely described in the Western media as a behind-the-scenes architect of Russian foreign policy. Darya shared some of his beliefs and was a vocal supporter of the Russian military action against Ukraine. Russian investigators have identified a Ukrainian woman as the prime suspect in Dugina’s murder. According to the FSB security agency, she rented an apartment in the building where the victim lived and fled from Russia to Estonia right after the bombing.

2022-08-25,https://www.rt.com/russia/561422-dugins-daughter-daria-alexandrovna/,"'A vile, cruel crime': How Darya Dugina, daughter of philosopher Aleksandr, died and what it means for Russia","Last weekend, a brutal murder stunned Russia. A young woman got into her car and drove home after a busy day at a literature and musical festival. She was on the highway when a bomb went off and her SUV caught fire. She died at the scene. Darya Dugina's devastated father, who was in a friend’s car right beside his daughter’s, watched as the rescue services extracted the burned body from the wreck. The attack immediately became a matter of national importance. Leaders of political parties and top Russian officials attended her funeral, while the president posthumously decorated her with a state award. RT explains why the death of Dugina may become a symbol of Russia’s external political struggle, and what the Kremlin will do next. On Tuesday, hundreds gathered at the Ostankino broadcasting center in Moscow to pay their last respects to the journalist and political scientist. On the night of August 20, Darya was heading home with her father from the ‘Tradition’ cultural festival near Moscow. Around 9pm, the car with Dugina at the wheel exploded on Mozhaisk Highway, where she died. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation has opened an investigation into what it calls a “murder committed in a socially-dangerous manner.” It is still uncertain who the actual target was – Darya or her father Aleksandr Dugin, one of the founders of the concept of ‘Eurasianism’, who is seen as a controversial advocate of ‘the Russian world’ in Ukraine and some Western countries. His political studies have focused on the creation of a Eurasian superpower through an association of Russia and former Soviet republics. The car belonged to Darya, but Russian media outlets say her father had used it quite often in the last six months. According to one version, they had planned on going together, but Aleksandr changed his mind and took a friend’s car at the last moment. Darya may also have been the target of the attack. She had followed in her father’s footsteps and became a proponent of Eurasianism. At home, she is well known for her work as a journalist for RT and the Zvezda and Tsargrad TV channels, as well as political commentary for other Russian media. Darya publicly supported the military operation in Ukraine and was placed under sanctions in the summer of 2022. The US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand accused her of spreading disinformation. She had also reported from Mariupol, which is now liberated by the joint forces of Russia and the Donbass republics. In the autumn of 2022, a chronicle about the Russian military that she co-authored is set to be published – ‘Book Z’. On Monday, two days after the terrorist attack, the FSB security agency announced it had solved the crime and blamed the special services of Ukraine. According to the FSB, the assassination was organized by Natalya Vovk, a Ukrainian citizen who came to Russia from Ukraine along with her teenage daughter, Sofia Shaban, in July 2022. Some sources claim Vovk once served in the Neo-Nazi Azov Battalion. After the explosion, Vovk and her daughter left Russia and entered Estonia through Pskov Region. Ukraine denied any involvement and called the FSB’s findings “propaganda.” Estonia refused to provide details about Vovk’s border crossing. Tallinn said the country’s Police and Border Guard Board had not been approached by Russia with a request for this information. Urmas Reinsalu, the country’s minister of foreign affairs, went as far as to dismiss the conclusions drawn by the Russian special services as a provocation. “We regard this [the FSB statement] as [a] provocation … by the Russian Federation, and we have nothing more to say about it at this moment.” In Russia, the journalist’s murder is seen as nothing if not political, with Telegram channels and other media abuzz with discussions about the implications of this incident for the country’s policies. President Vladimir Putin described the crime as vile, in a telegram addressed to the parents of the deceased journalist, which was published on the Kremlin’s official website. “A vile, cruel crime cut short the life of Darya Dugina, a bright, talented person with a true Russian heart, kind, loving, sympathetic and open. Journalist, scientist, philosopher, and war correspondent, she honestly served the people and the Fatherland, and proved by deed what it means to be a patriot of Russia,” The murder reverberated well beyond Russia’s borders, prompting US State Department spokesman Ned Price to say that Washington “condemns the intentional targeting of civilians anywhere.” Remarkably, the Americans have struck a rather ‘neutral’ tone in their comments. “The U.S. Department of State’s reaction to Darya Dugina’s assassination and the evidence of Ukraine’s involvement provided by Russia discredit the United States’ human rights protection efforts. Washington has no moral right (or, needless to say, any legal grounds) to judge the human rights situation in remote parts of the world since the murder of a journalist does not even receive a comment from this perspective, apparently so important to US officials. They simply ignored the fact that the incident involved a public figure,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram. The names of those attending the funeral on August 23 spoke volumes about the political nature of the tragedy. Among those present were State Duma Deputy Chairman Sergey Neverov, the head of the nationalist LDPR party, Leonid Slutsky, businessman Evgeny Prigozhin, novelist and political activist Zakhar Prilepin, the leader of the political party ‘A Just Russia’, Sergey Mironov, and other politicians. Signs reading ‘Funeral Service/ Farewell Ceremony for journalist Darya Dugina’, with black arrows, provided directions, guiding the mourners through the corridors and staircases of the Ostankino Television Center. Police cordons were lined up a couple of kilometers from the television center, and the entrance to the building was protected by metal detectors and guarded by armed policemen who performed triple security checks on everyone waiting to get inside. Officers used under car inspection mirrors and explosive detection dogs. The line of mourners holding bunches of lilies, roses, and carnations – in even numbers, as is traditional for funerals in Russia – were gradually admitted into the building and joined those gathered in the ceremony hall. The farewell ceremony brought together hundreds of people – young men and women wearing T-shirts with an eight-pointed star, a symbol of Eurasianism, as well as older men in similar attire. There were war correspondents and servicemen in military uniform, some of whom had DPR shoulder patches. There were Darya’s journalist colleagues, her fellow students from MSU’s philosophy department, as well as representatives of Russian media outlets. The microphone set up for those who wished to pay tribute to the deceased was claimed in turn by Darya’s friends and family, representatives of the president, the church, and state media, while people in the mourning procession approached the coffin one by one and crossed themselves as they placed flowers. Some expressed their condolences to Darya’s grieving father who was sitting close to the coffin. “For those of you who have been affected by her tragic death, her personality, and her integrity, she would have one wish: ‘Don’t remember me! Don’t glorify me! Fight for our great country! Defend our faith, our holy Orthodoxy, and love our Russian people!’ Because she died for the people. She died for Russia. She died on the frontlines – because the front is right here. It’s not there [in Ukraine] but here. It’s with each of us,” Dugin said at the ceremony. State Duma Vice Speaker Sergey Neverov said Dugina’s death will unite the people of Russia even more. “I have no doubt that not only the executors, but the organizers will pay in full. The path of light that Darya led unites us even more for the liberation of Russian cities in the fight against fascism and that hateful regime,” Neverov said at the ceremony. Sergey Mironov called Dugina a “true patriot and, however strange it may sound, a fighter for independence and sovereignty.” The young woman was in an open casket, and, if not for the ‘venchik’ (a ribbon with the images of Jesus, Mary, and John the Baptist placed on the deceased person’s forehead according to Orthodox tradition), she might have been mistaken for someone who is peacefully asleep. Darya Dugina was not a well-known public figure, but her death has become symbolic, according to the director of the International Institute for Political Expertise, political analyst Evgeny Minchenko. And this symbol only grows stronger as the reactions to the untimely death of the journalist continue to come in from Ukraine. “There are very different, opposite reactions. On the one hand, quite understandably for any normal human being, people acknowledge the tragedy; on the other – some inexplicable happy celebratory giggles are heard from the other side of the frontlines [reactions from Ukrainian media – RT]. I believe this mix has made this symbol even stronger,” he told RT. Minchenko believes that this tragic event will give impetus to Russia’s internal political struggle, rather than provoking harsh foreign policy decisions. “When people keep saying you have to play harder, what is it that has not been done yet? They start demanding some mythical response targeting the decision-making center. Well, where are these centers? I would ask. Do we know exactly where the decisions are being made, where the secure bunkers are that accommodate the leaders? Some are calling for the entire area along Bankova Street [in Kiev] to be bombed, but, you know, it has residential buildings in addition to government [buildings],” Minchenko said. He also believes that we should not expect a wave of strict measures against dissenting voices in domestic politics, since Russia already has “very clearly defined laws” regarding these matters. Nevertheless, a political discussion on the domestic scene is bound to be stirred up. As for the Russian government, it intends, as statements from officials indicate, to find those behind the assassination, both the masterminds and the operative, and deliver justice. “I believe it’s a barbaric crime, and there can be no mercy to those behind it. As far as I am aware, the Federal Security Service has already established the facts, and investigation is underway, so once it’s complete, there is no doubt that all the involved parties from those who had ordered it to those who carried it out will pay the full price,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an official statement on August 23, 2022.",3.3456944949687633,2.5385391812883022,0.807155313680461,1
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561496-zelensky-soldier-nazi-symbol/,Zelensky praises Neo-Nazi soldier on social media,"Ukraine's president has posted a picture of a soldier wearing the insignia of a notorious Nazi SS division to his official Instagram account. The post, part of a series celebrating Ukraine’s Independence Day, was not the first piece of Nazi iconography he has shared. Zelensky posted the image on Instagram early on Wednesday. In it, a Ukrainian soldier carrying a rifle displays the standard of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, also known as the 1st Galician division. Comprising predominantly Ukrainian volunteers from the Galicia region (which spans what is now southwestern Poland and western Ukraine), the division is known for committing war crimes against Polish civilians during the course of World War II. A post shared by Володимир Зеленський (@zelenskiy_official) The Ukrainian soldier, identified by Zelensky as ‘Mikhail,’ also wears the patch of the 49th Rifle Battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is named after the nationalist ‘Carpathian Sich’ militia of the 1930s. Most of the Carpathian Sich’s members were also members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, led by Nazi collaborator and war criminal Stepan Bandera. Bandera is considered a hero by Ukrainian nationalists, and is openly celebrated by top Ukrainian officials. Zelensky’s post also includes a picture of Sergey Volynsky, also known as Volyna, who commanded a marine unit attached to the Azov regiment in Mariupol earlier this summer. The Azov regiment, a neo-Nazi militia folded into the Ukrainian military in 2014, was destroyed after a proctracted siege at the Azovstal steel plant in the coastal city and its members either killed or captured. Volynsky is currently in custody. Zelensky has posted images of his soldiers wearing Third Reich insignia before. In a post across multiple social media platforms celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, the Ukrainian president included a picture of one of his troops wearing the ‘death’s head’, or ‘totenkopf’, insignia of the 3rd SS Panzer Division. This division was heavily staffed by former concentration camp guards and was responsible for numerous massacres of French civilians and Polish Jews. Ukraine is the only country in the world that has integrated openly neo-Nazi militias into its national military, and while these militias were once described by Western media outlets as “neo-Nazi,” they are now referred to as “far-right groups.” Since Russian troops entered Ukraine in February, stashes of Nazi paraphernalia have been found in the houses and bases of these militia members, and social media accounts run by the Ukrainian government have also posted images of soldiers wearing Nazi and far-right symbols.",3.314277064486109,3.343553061914025,-0.02927599742791598,5

The protesters taped images of the mines to the sidewalk around the embassies. The stickers featured a QR code leading to a website explaining what the PFM-1 mines are and accusing Ukraine of dropping them on cities. The munitions regularly maim civilians, according to the website, which shows photos of some of the victims. The demonstration in front of the American embassy included activists lying immobile on the ground, apparently as a symbol of the casualties inflicted by the mines, according to images from the scene. The PFM-1 is designed to deny access to an area to enemy foot soldiers and is usually deployed in large quantities. The munitions are generally either dropped from an aircraft or disbursed from a ground-fired cluster projectile. They scatter while gliding down and become armed after hitting the ground. Each mine contains a pressure-activated fuse and a small explosive charge, which can blow off a person’s foot or hand. The design was reportedly influenced by the US-made BLU-43 Dragontooth mine, which works the same way and was used during the Vietnam War. The Soviet version is nicknamed ‘petal’. Ukraine has large stockpiles of Soviet weapons, including an estimated six million PFM-1 mines as of 2011. The country was supposed to dispose of its stocks of the mine to comply with its international obligations. However, Kiev has allegedly deployed a portion of the remaining mines to harass cities such as Donetsk, the capital of the Moscow-allied Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). Ukrainian officials have denied using the mines and have accused Russian troops of dropping them. DPR officials regularly post warnings on social media, instructing civilians to look out for the maiming munitions and to call demolition experts upon finding them.",3.929950206586462,2.501266126299757,1.428684080286705,0

2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561488-nebenzia-un-zelensky-crimes/,Barely audible Zelensky dodges Russian response at UN,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky hastily left a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday before Russia's representative responded to his claims. Appearing by video link, Zelensky had argued that that the freedom of the world depended on Ukraine’s independence and accused Russia of threatening a nuclear disaster at the Zaporozhye power plant and being responsible for inflation, hunger and high energy prices. His speech was barely audible and he closed his connection before Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called out his government and its Western backers for being the principal threat to Ukraine’s independence. An exception was made to the usual in-person-only rules to facilitate Zelensky's remote participation. Russia had objected to this breach of protocol. It was the second time the Security Council has voted to override its own rules and allow Zelensky to deliver a video address; it was also done in June, also over Russian objections. Nebenzia noted the technical problems that made about a quarter of Zelensky’s speech impossible to understand. The Russian envoy also chided the Security Council for turning Wednesday’s sessions into a series of declarations by Western powers of their unconditional support for the government in Kiev, and disagreed with their argument that Russia threatens Ukraine’s independence. The main, the only threat to the independence of Ukraine is the current government in Kiev. Ukraine’s woes began with the illegal 2014 Maidan coup, he argued, with Western governments ever since turning a blind eye to actions by Kiev that they would never tolerate at home. Kiev’s militants burned dissenters alive in Odessa and bombed the people of Donetsk and Lugansk in a “senseless crusade against itself,” Nebenzia argued, which resulted in the loss of Crimea and the independence of the Donbass republics. A war that lasted almost eight years could have ended at any point had Ukraine carried out its obligations under the Minsk agreements, the Russian envoy pointed out, but neither Kiev nor its Western backers were inclined to do so. Ukrainian troops continue to shell the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and civilian infrastructure, not just in the Donbass republics but in territories until recently under their control. “Our former Western partners, instead of condemning their Ukrainian wards, continue to send them new weapons, letting Kiev reach places it was not able to target before. This makes them accomplices to crimes against civilians,” Nebenzia told the UN. He also noted that, according to Ukrainians themselves, American advisers are involved in selecting targets for US-supplied weapons such as HIMARS rocket launchers, which were used to kill Ukrainian prisoners held in Yelenovka. “We know Zelensky is well aware that the Ukrainian forces are behind this crime, even though he falsely accused Russia of it today,” Nebenzia said. The Russian ambassador also called out Ukraine’s bombing of civilian areas, use of its own civilians as human shields, deploying banned landmines against civilians – he even held up a ‘petal’ mine as evidence – and an “unprecedented campaign of lies” against Russia, “not seen since the Nazi propaganda of [Joseph] Goebbels.” Nebenzia also pointed out that the current US President Joe Biden had blackmailed Ukraine into firing a top prosecutor, and how the State Department’s Victoria Nuland discussed the composition of the government in Kiev with the US ambassador – not Ukrainians – in the infamous intercepted phone call. Just about all Ukrainian government agencies now have embedded Western advisers, he added. “If this is independence, what does dependence look like?” he asked the Security Council.",2.337882471756871,2.6765038426676697,-0.3386213709107988,8

After seizing control of the power station on March 4, Russian forces have detained 26 violators of access control to the plant – the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the National Guard revealed. The facility continues to operate with local staff, while Russian troops patrol the premises and check for explosive devices and unexploded munitions, the National Guard said. They noted that “Specialists of the nuclear, biological and chemical defense of the National Guard, together with colleagues from the Ministry of Defense, daily, several times a day, monitor the situation by measuring radiation levels at control points along the perimeter of the facility.” In recent weeks, the nuclear power plant and the nearby city of Energodar have been repeatedly shelled by Kiev’s forces. The attacks damaged multiple buildings on the premises of the plant, causing fires and power outages, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Moscow has warned that the continuing attacks could ultimately render the power plant inoperable and might even result in a major disaster similar to the one in Chernobyl in 1986. Kiev and some Western officials, however, have accused Russia of shelling the plant, despite the fact that it is controlled by Russia’s own troops.",5.989672365725318,4.342134773002082,1.6475375927232365,9
2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561478-boris-johnson-visit-kiev-ukraine/,Boris Johnson visits Kiev as UK donates more weapons,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrived in Kiev on Wednesday, marking Ukraine’s Independence Day with his third visit to the city since the start of Russia’s military campaign in February. Urging Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to ignore calls for negotiations, Johnson outlined a new $63 million arms shipment for his military. After a press tour through the streets of Kiev, Johnson appeared in a joint news conference with Zelensky, in which he urged the Ukrainian leader not to “advance some flimsy plan for negotiation” with Russia. While it is unclear which specific plan Johnson was referring to, British officials have publicly called on Kiev not to enter talks with Moscow on numerous occasions since Russia sent its troops into Ukraine in February. “The United Kingdom is with you and will be with you for the days and months ahead, and you can and will win,” Johnson told Zelensky. Johnson also used his appearance in Kiev to announce a new package of military aid to Ukraine worth £54 million ($63 million). According to a Downing Street press release, the package will include loitering munitions – commonly known as suicide drones – and 850 Black Hornet micro-drones – helicopters around the size of a mobile phone which feed back video and still images to their operators. In total, the UK has given Ukraine more than £2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) in military aid since February, and is currently training Ukrainian military recruits on British soil. The training program was announced by the UK last month, shortly after Zelensky admitted that his military was losing between 100 and 200 soldiers per day, not counting those wounded, on a battlefield described by the Ukrainian president as “hell.” August 24 marks six months since Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began, and 31 years since Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union. In Washington, US President Joe Biden used the day to announce a new arms package worth nearly $3 billion, the largest US weapons tranche for Ukraine to date. For Johnson, the trip to Kiev will be his last as prime minister. Johnson will leave office in two weeks, after resigning in July amid multiple scandals.

The embassy “has started issuing Russian visas to citizens who had been detained these days near the monument to the liberators of Riga,” Ambassador Mikhail Vanin told Russian television on Wednesday. This will allow them “to flee Latvian territory and find asylum in Russia, should they need it,” he added. Latvian police reported detaining 14 people who were demonstrating on Tuesday against the government’s move to demolish the World War II memorial. Law enforcement said the demonstrators were taken into custody for their refusal to disperse when ordered. The monument has long served as a flashpoint for tensions between Latvia’s government, which brands the historic period when Latvia was part of the Soviet Union as an “occupation,” and the country’s ethnic Russian community, which seeks to preserve some parts of the Soviet legacy. Latvian nationalist forces have long sought to rid the country of all Soviet symbols. This campaign gained impetus amid the rift between Russia and Western nations over the conflict in Ukraine. The government announced earlier in August that the monument in Riga, which had served as a place for commemorating World War II victims, would be torn down and recycled. The promise was carried out on Tuesday, but the move sparked protests. The Russian embassy called the removal of the monument “an act of vandalism by the state” and accused Riga of mislabeling people who disagree with the decision as a national threat. The protesters “get roughly detained by the police, while leaders of the state voice various threats against those people, from expulsion and revocation of permanent residency permission to criminal prosecution,” the statement said. Latvian President Egils Levits said in an interview on Wednesday that Russians in Latvia who are not loyal to the country’s government should be “isolated from society.”",1.9443937548444359,2.359188676229224,-0.4147949213847879,4

The bounties have been placed on 28-year-old Konstantin Nemichev and 26-year-old Sergey Velichko, who have served as commanders in the Azov regiment. The unit was declared a terrorist organization by Russia’s Supreme Court in June. Both of the fighters have been put on the international wanted list, as well as Russia’s 'ten especially dangerous wanted criminals' list. “The leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has decided to offer a reward for assistance in detaining the commanders of the Ukrainian nationalist battalion Konstantin Nemichev and Sergey Velichko, accused of committing a crime under Article 317 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation,” the ministry’s press service wrote, adding that one million rubles (~$16,600) will be paid out for information on each individual. The ministry previously called for the arrest of the two Azov commanders back in May after Russia’s Investigative Committee had identified them as being responsible for “causing multiple bodily harm, including with the use of firearms” to at least eight Russian servicemen, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Both Nemichev and Velichko are currently part of the Kraken regiment operating near the city of Kharkov, which primarily consists of Azov veterans and other neo-Nazi fighters and volunteers. The regiment describes itself as a special reconnaissance and sabotage unit under the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, operating separately from the Armed Forces. Last week, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that Kraken forces had executed some 100 fellow Ukrainian soldiers who had abandoned their positions amid a Russian breakthrough in the Kharkov region. According to Moscow, the executions were carried out to “suppress panic and intimidate the personnel of the Armed forces of Ukraine.”",2.982617433669128,3.144661092213704,-0.16204365854457592,5

On Tuesday, a number of mainstream media outlets cited anonymous US officials as describing the impending announcement of a $3 billion package of military aid to Ukraine. If confirmed, it would be the largest of its kind so far. Washington is by far the biggest supplier of military hardware to Ukraine as it fights against Russia. However, some of the promised equipment “will not be in the hands of Ukrainian fighters for months or years,” according to NBC News, one of the outlets that reported the upcoming package. Included in the package are advanced weapons that are still in the development phase, it explained. The same caveat was cited by the Associated Press, which said that it may take “a year or two” for the arms to reach the battlefield, according to its sources. Washington expects Ukrainian forces “to fight for years to come,” US officials told the AP. The AeroVironment Switchblade 600 drone is an example of a weapon system that was promised to Ukraine months ago but has yet to be delivered. Defense News said this week that the Pentagon plans to sign the contract necessary for sending 10 of the so-called “kamikaze drones” within a month. Last month, Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov called on foreign suppliers of arms to use his country as a testing ground for new weapons.

2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561451-latvia-monument-protesters-arrested/,Latvia detains protesters after destruction of Soviet monument,"Latvian police detained people protesting on Tuesday against the dismantling of a Soviet monument commemorating the liberation of Latvia and its capital, Riga, from the Nazis, in World War Two. Local authorities stated that of the several dozen who showed up at the site, 14 were arrested for disobeying orders to disperse. The news portal Delfi reported that on Tuesday morning Latvian police and “builders and equipment” arrived at Victory Park in Riga, where the famous Soviet monument is located. The memorial was surrounded by fences covered with opaque sheeting as the workers began dismantling it. In the evening, people began coming to the park, many carrying flowers. The police, however, did not let them approach the monument, so they tried laying the flowers in a field next to a nearby gas station, which was also eventually disallowed by the police, according to Delfi. Closer to midnight, even more people came to the site, states the outlet, many of whom began singing the popular Russian WW2-era song ‘Katyusha’. Meanwhile, some of the protesters began growing more agitated and were getting into verbal skirmishes with the police, after which they were ordered to disperse. Those who failed to comply were arrested. The monument, formally dedicated to the ‘Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders’ was built in 1985. However, after Latvia gained independence following the dissolution of the USSR, the country’s authorities increasingly began seeing the memorial as a symbol of Soviet oppression and the question of taking it down was repeatedly raised. With anti-Russian sentiment in the country rising in recent years, Russia’s operation in Ukraine that started in late February served as the catalyst for the final decision to demolish the monument. Earlier this month, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated that government-level decisions by countries such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to completely destroy the Soviet military memorial heritage, as well as anything related to Russia, was a manifestation of neo-Nazism in these states.",2.2705818442472805,2.847544453455999,-0.5769626092087186,4

The perpetrator, who was apprehended, is thought to be former Sunday school teacher, well known to the deceased. The death of Father Sergey Lopukhov, the archpriest of the St. Nicolas Church in Domodedovo, was confirmed by the Moscow Region Investigative Committee. According to the prosecutors’ report, the victim took the 22-year-old male suspect by surprise as he was trying to start a fire inside a room of the Sunday school hosted by the church. The perpetrator stabbed the priest, delivering a fatal injury, investigators said. Some media outlets said the cleric was discovered by firefighters responding to the fire. They reportedly found him bleeding out from multiple stab wounds at the stairs of the school building. The prosecutors released footage from the scene, showing what presumably was the blurred-out body of the victim lying by the front door and officers inspecting the charred interior of the site of the arson. Law enforcement said the suspect, a local resident, was apprehended shortly after the knife attack. The statement said the motive for the crime is yet to be established.

2022-08-24,https://www.rt.com/russia/561326-vladislav-ugolny-31st-independence-of-ukraine/,Vladislav Ugolny: The real root of the Ukraine conflict goes back 100 years and is misunderstood in the West,"Here's how the current narrative goes: Ukraine is at its peak on its 31st Independence Day. Thanks to euphoric national unity, the state was able to resist the Russian army. Kiev is still its capital, Odessa remains under its control and there’s are plenty of fortifications in Donbass for the Ukrainian army to hide behind. However, its eastern fortress is not Mariupol or Severodonetsk anymore, but Avdeevka. Although they prefer to omit this fact. This outcome of the first six months of Russia's military operation may seem like a convincing argument for those who believe Ukraine has a glorious future. Kiev managed to mobilize its defenses in the early days by hectically handing out arms to anybody interested, amassing experienced nationalist fighters in Donbass and bribing regional elites which may have been ready to take Russia’s side – or threatening them. In reality, this is the result of a policy of violence, coercion, deceit, manipulation and alienation, continuously conducted since 1991. It could’ve been called colonial policy if Ukraine were independent from the influence of the Atlantic agenda. But this is ultimately the victory of the pro-Western bloc over their pro-Russian fellow citizens. We have seen this before during the Anglo-French standoffs in America and India. And how did it end for Native Americans and Indians? Not good. And there’s nothing good in store for Ukraine either. Eight years ago, it lost Crimea and the natural resources of Donbass. Today, the former is many things at once: a rapidly developing showcase of the ‘Russian world’ and a constant military threat, as the Black Sea Fleet regularly strikes Ukrainian military targets with Kalibrs. The most successful offensive was also the one launched from the peninsula, giving Russia control over Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk and Mariupol. With just half of Donbass lost in 2014, Ukraine has found itself on the brink of an energy collapse, as its unified coal mining and thermal energy complex was ruined. The need for corrupt schemes to buy coal from Donbass republics arose, making fortunes for oligarch Rinat Akhmetov and ex-president Pyotr Poroshenko. The rebellious Donbass also posed a constant military risk to Ukraine, bringing forth the current war. The most daring and motivated infantry also comes from the region. Both republics have artillery and tanks, but their infantry will be remembered for achieving the impossible for six months already, breaking through the Ukrainian defense in depth. Now in 2022, Ukraine has lost Kherson, half of its Zaporozhye Region and a third of the Kharkov Region. These territories have now been cut out of the Ukrainian economy. No more Kherson watermelons – the delicious sweet fruit ripening under the southern sun. The largest nuclear power plant in Zaporozhye is now controlled by the Russian army, although it still provides electricity for Ukrainian towns. You can’t rush things when it comes to nuclear energy, but the day will come when Ukrainians will lose every watt of energy from the Zaporozhye facility. And that is a force majeure situation. Trying to overcome these circumstances, the Ukrainian nation has spent thirty years in preparation for a conflict with Russia. According to Alexey Arestovich, an ex-spy and now the most popular Ukrainian pundit, this is a ‘meta-historical’ conflict, the climax of a 400-year-long war, after which Ukraine will either be victorious or forgotten. Arestovich is a continentally-inclined philosopher, so he uses some abstruse wording to communicate the same things that Ukrainians are used to hearing in less sophisticated terms – from oligarchs with their criminal 1990s past and former Soviet officials with their Communist party rhetoric. The most concise message would be the typical ‘Glory to Ukraine’ salute which was originally popular in Galicia but was recently adopted more widely. Billionaire criminals, politicians and officials, residents of Galicia – that is the ‘Ukrainian nation’ that is celebrating the anniversary of usurping institutional power and getting privileges, not the country’s independence. Some received the privilege of getting unique access to the privatization of Ukraine’s economy with the right to lobby the interests of their multi-billion-dollar businesses: metallurgy, energy, the food industry, the chemical sector, amber mining, alcohol and tobacco manufacturing, banking, etc. Yes, there are foreign investors in Ukraine, but it’s the local oligarchs that control the most profitable industries. Not sharing the Ukrainian market with other competitors, especially from Russia, has always been their vital interest. They had help from politicians and officials, making the citizens of Ukraine their main source of building wealth. They stole government funds, smuggled contraband, manufactured counterfeit goods, and had their share of the drug and human trafficking market, as well as gambling. The unitarian structure created a situation where government offices could be bought, which helped them make money in the Odessa port or extort it from Kharkov businessmen promising them pain-free tax audits (you needed to have connections in Kiev, where these jobs were distributed). That’s why the authorities always ignored the demands for federalization – the idea of losing the monopoly on the decision-making process freaked them out, especially if it could potentially benefit Moscow. Finally, the residents of Galicia – formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire – joined Ukrainians and became citizens of one country only in 1939. These people were separated from the rest of the nation by religion, dialect, values and history. Galicia had very few industries. The only valuable things about the region were its Polish and Austrian architecture (or what was left of it), a couple of resorts, woods (which have thinned out significantly by now due to uncontrolled deforestation), and a proximity to the EU border that made smuggling and labor migration much easier. This is nothing compared to the riches in the south and east of Ukraine. Galicians soon realized that they possessed the ultimate resource that could secure their region's status as the cultural center of the country: their history, a history that could legitimize both Ukraine’s drive to distance itself from Russia and its attempts to stay independent by assimilating its Russian population – even if it’s exactly the kind of ‘colonial’ policy they often complained about. Galicians became the crusaders of Ukrainization, a restless minority clamoring for its rights. It seemed logical: “We live in Ukraine, so we must speak Ukrainian, mustn’t we?” But there’s only so much time in the school curriculum, so Ukrainian language, literature, and history came to be studied at the expense of other subjects, including Russian. Then the Ukrainian government introduced a unified entrance test for universities, and having a good command of Ukrainian became obligatory for any student-to-be. Children of Russian-speaking families became less competitive. If anyone said that the Russian and Ukrainian languages should have equal footing, Galicians answered that it would lead to the extinction of Ukrainian since it would not be able to compete with Russian. This is only one of the examples of institutional discrimination against the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine. Any political force that tried to protect the rights of Russians was destroyed. Yevgeny Kushnaryov, the former governor of the Kharkov Region, who nearly separated the area from Ukraine in 2005, died on a hunting trip under mysterious circumstances. The ‘Party of the Regions’, which had used his ideas, came to power after his death but didn’t keep its promises to protect the Russian-speaking regions. Neither did it make the Russian language a state language, as it pledged. Another story is the demise of the Rodina party in Odessa, which had been represented in the Odessa city council and whose leader had served in the national parliament. Even the party’s name bears witness to Ukraine’s chauvinistic policy: The names of parties were to be registered in Ukrainian, so the Odessa party had to find a Russian word that would sound exactly the same as a Ukrainian word. As a result, “Fatherland” in Russian had to pretend it was “Family” in Ukrainian. The party was wiped out by the end of 2013, with its leader, Igor Markov, sent to prison and other key figures forced to either emigrate or go into hiding. No one except the people of Odessa spoke up in protest: Rodina was deeply foreign to the Ukrainian state. By the way, repressions against the party came on the orders of the allegedly “pro-Russian” president Yanukovich. As a result, the Russians of Ukraine were left without political representation in a country that had set its sights on assimilating them. By the time Maidan happened, it was clear that Russians in Ukraine faced an uncertain future. Each of them had a choice: run, fight, or surrender. Many chose the first option: From 2015 to 2018, over 400,000 Ukrainian citizens received a Russian passport. For a period after that, the figure is even higher, but that is due to the mass granting of Russian citizenship to the people of Donbass who had stayed on their native soil. Many took up arms after Crimea and the Donbass republics exercised their right to self-determination and used violence to suppress protests in Kharkov, Odessa, and Zaporozhye, driving large numbers from these regions to volunteer. Some have remained and are now waiting for the Russian army to liberate their cities and towns. Video reports from Svetlodarsk and Severodonetsk have captured moments when militiamen’s families see their sons for the first time in eight years and cry tears of joy. Many have given up, however. Not everyone is born a hero and not everyone is prepared to leave everything behind or live a dissident’s life in a hostile environment. This is the tragedy of Russians in Ukraine. This tragedy is the triumph of the Ukrainian state, which took Russian Ukrainians hostage and turned them against Russia. How did it come to pass? Let’s say a long time ago, a small boy dreamed of serving in the military one day. He eventually became a Ukrainian officer and took the oath, making his mom and dad proud. Let’s assume that we’re talking about a Russian-speaking family from Kharkov. The Ukrainian government then started a war in Donbass and called on the boy, now a grown man, to do his duty. The Ukrainian government interpreted the oath to protect the Ukrainian people as a promise to crush the Russians who had risen up in Donbass. The officer faced a dilemma – what was good and what was evil? Some made the right choice and refused to go to war, others made a mistake. Sometimes they had the good intention of trying to prevent greater bloodshed and taking care of conscripts. There were Ukrainian officers in 2014 who avoided escalations and just wanted to save the lives of their subordinates, who had been thrown into the frontlines. Yet, as the war dragged on, people kept dying and the stakes got higher. While children were being killed in Donbass by the Ukrainian army, Russian-speaking Ukrainian servicemen’s friends and colleagues were losing their lives at the hands of the people’s republics’ militias. So the conflict acquired a personal dimension for them. The Russians who made different choices and found themselves on the opposite sides of the divide were killing each other, while the Ukrainian government was celebrating victory. A retailer from Odessa might have also had little admiration for an independent Ukraine, which, in his view, was synonymous with corrupt officials, thuggish law enforcement, and a never-ending economic crisis. Without proper maintenance, his dear city was slowly falling apart. Then the war broke out, making it likely that street fighting would destroy everything he had. What is he to do? Some have resigned to this risk, others hope that the Russians will take Odessa peacefully, while still others have decided (or been told to by Ukrainian radicals) to support the Ukrainian army between Nikolayev and Kherson in the hope that the frontline will stay far away and their livelihoods will be spared. The Russians who are fighting against Ukraine have many questions and harsh words for those Russians who give in to it and support it. This is a tragedy. The most capable units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are made up of Russian-speaking soldiers and officers. Their senior commanders often went to the same military schools as Russia’s senior officers. The only match for a Russian soldier is a Russian soldier. This is what happened a hundred years ago during the Civil War in Russia. It's this factor that runs through the present conflict. “After all, Ukrainians are an interesting and difficult opponent. Probably the most difficult of all possible for us. They are part of the Russian people, only with their brains washed. But at the same time, in other respects, they are carriers of all the same qualities and properties that we have. They know us intimately, as we know them. In terms of psychology and mentality, it’s like being at war with your own shadow,” a Russian soldier wrote in his Telegram blog. NATO has found the perfect way to introduce a hybrid war against Russia: they have set its twin against it and administered arms so it won’t collapse. For Russians, I repeat again, this is a tragedy and a fratricidal war. However, Russians have no alternative because they cannot abandon Donbass or allow the genocidal assimilation of the Russians of Ukraine to continue. Nothing good awaits Ukraine. In their confrontation with Russia, Ukrainians have been forced to resort to the help of the West and, consequently, lost their independence. In the short term, this promises benefits in the form of loans, arms supplies, and diplomatic assistance, but you have to pay for everything in the end. By drawing Western influence into the post-Soviet space, Ukraine has raised the stakes by an order of magnitude. Ukrainians have already lost a lot. Even if the frontline remains as it is now, Kiev will definitely lose the rest of Donbass this winter due to its inability to provide heating there. It will be a snowy field populated by Ukrainian soldiers shivering from the cold, harried by Russian artillery shelling. There will also be vulnerable grandmothers who simply have nowhere to go. Only the Russian army can save them. Everything has been decided with Donbass, but not with Kharkov. The mayor of the city glibly reports on the heroic struggle to prepare for the heating season, but there is a possibility that a large amount of the city’s population of one and a half million will not survive this winter. Kharkov is the second most important city in Ukraine. Zaporozhye may experience similar problems. In any case, the humanitarian crisis caused by the failure of the Ukrainian government to shore up the housing and utilities sector (for example, by not mobilizing its workers to the front) will turn the frontline territory into a no man’s land. Ukraine will lose its economic benefits, and receive only new displaced persons in return. The ‘grain agreement’ allowed the ports of Odessa to hope for the beginning of at least some work, but Ukraine is still under a naval blockade. Trade has risen, but the ports are not actually functioning. In fact, the Odessa metropolitan area has been deprived of its main sphere of activity, and the Ukrainian government is not able to harness its full potential. The city is suffering losses. Its prospects are unclear. The only thing that is actually moving forward in Odessa is a fight against monuments of ‘Russian imperialism’. Since Ukrainians cannot unblock the port, they want to compensate by demolishing a monument to the city’s founder, Catherine the Great. This Independence Day is the apogee for Ukrainian statehood. Ukrainian nationalists were able to use three decades to fool and intimidate others, as well as consolidate and bribe radicals. Thanks to this, Ukraine has withstood six months of confrontation with Russia and will endure for some time. But its defensive strategy will only lead to a slow retreat, a loss of territory, and the inability to ensure the proper administration of the frontline territories. Looking forward, difficulties will only increase and become more complicated, which will lead to a proportional increase in the cost of maintaining Ukraine for the West. Every penny saved means a worsened humanitarian crisis and a further reduction in territory. Where the fear of change initially sparked a national upsurge, now there will be increasing war fatigue, poverty, unemployment, hunger, and cold. In the end, the Russian army will move forward, step by step, with its superior number of artillery barrels, ready to provide humanitarian aid in every liberated Russian city.",2.4246524991588037,3.0580408082757744,-0.6333883091169707,6

The positive effects that the president mentioned included the rise of patriotism and nationalism in the country and growing awareness of the price that has to be paid for freedom. The Latvian government earlier decided to remove several Soviet-era monuments despite the objections of its ethnic Russian community. Some were moved to the Museum of Occupation – which is how the Latvian government perceives the time it was under Moscow’s control – while others were slated for scrapping. According to Levits, Latvians have become more sensitive about such monuments since Russia attacked Ukraine in late February. The Latvian president assessed that the situation in Ukraine proved that the Russian military was not as strong as some people had believed. He pledged that his country would continue providing assistance to Kiev.

He went on to accuse Kiev of remotely mining frontline communities with anti-personnel mines, claiming it is evidence that Ukraine intends “to inflict maximum damage to civilians and civilian infrastructure.” Shoigu was speaking at a meeting of defense ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional security group that includes several post-Soviet states, as well as China, India, and Pakistan. Earlier this month, Amnesty International released a report confirming that its inspectors witnessed Ukrainian troops using civilian sites such as schools and hospitals as military bases. Kiev condemned the document, claiming that the human rights organization was aiding Russia by corroborating these facts. Amid the backlash, Amnesty’s German branch said it wanted independent experts to review the process that led to the publication.",2.8004838524227935,2.755392799077107,0.045091053345686305,6

The news broke early Wednesday morning as police arrived at Roizman’s apartment in Ekaterinburg, the Urals city where he served as mayor from 2013 to 2018. The politician spoke to journalists from the window, confirming his status as a detainee and explaining the accusations against him. He said he has been accused of discrediting the Russian Armed Forces and indicated that the investigation against him was initiated “in Moscow” rather than by the local authorities. Journalists outside Roizman’s home reported that they witnessed the seizure of his personal items, such as computer equipment. The office of his foundation was targeted as well, its head confirmed to local media. According to a source cited by TASS, Roizman is being investigated over a video published on his YouTube channel. The politician claimed the case against him was “over one phrase about Ukraine.” Roizman is an outspoken critic of the Russian government, and his opposition activities have gotten him in trouble with the law in the past. He has been fined on numerous occasions for violating regulations regarding public gatherings in the country. This year, after publicly discrediting the military became a fineable offense in Russia, a court in Ekaterinburg found Roizman in violation on several occasions. He has accumulated around $2,500 in fines, according to media reports. A repeat violation of this kind may be considered a criminal offense under Russian law. Roizman came to prominence as a public figure in the early 2000s, thanks to his hardline campaign against drug crime in his city. Before serving as mayor of Ekaterinburg, he was a lawmaker in the Russian State Duma.",3.072077317756489,4.007621159951801,-0.9355438421953117,5

The relatively slow pace is the result of a conscious decision to protect civilian lives, he stated. Speaking at an international event on Wednesday, the minister stated that Russia “strictly follows the norms of humanitarian law” in Ukraine, countering claims to the contrary made by Kiev. “We do everything to avoid casualties among peaceful citizens. Certainly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we take this approach consciously,” he added. Shoigu contrasted Russia’s priorities in Ukraine with those of the US and its allies. The ongoing supplying of weapons to Kiev and other Western policies only prolong the conflict and inflate the human cost, he said. Western nations have accused Russia of launching an unprovoked war of aggression against the neighboring country, and have said their military assistance will continue for “as long as it takes.” Moscow, which believes the operation was necessary to stop NATO’s creeping expansion into Ukraine, says its opponents want to “fight to the last Ukrainian” in order to hurt Russia.

He also briefed the Security Council on the most recent attacks, some of which involved NATO-supplied weapons, and insisted that Russia does not use the site as a military base. ""Despite the false statements of the Kiev regime and its backers, Russia has not placed heavy weapons on the territory of the ZNPP and does not use the station for military purposes,” Nebenzia said during the council’s emergency session on Tuesday afternoon. “The Russian Ministry of Defense is ready to provide the IAEA with high-resolution images, which show that weapons, especially heavy ones, are not placed on the territory of the station,” he added. In addition to the photographic evidence of Ukrainian shelling of the plant, Nebenzia entered into the record a timeline of strikes, named the Ukrainian artillery unit involved, and specified which strikes featured M777 howitzers given to Ukraine by the Pentagon. “It seems that our colleagues exist in some kind of their own parallel reality, in which the Russian military shells the NPP it is protecting, using American systems at that,” Nebenzia said. Contrary to insinuations by Kiev and its Western backers, Nebenzia noted, Moscow had given assent to the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit the Zaporozhye NPP back in June, before the Ukrainian drone, artillery and rocket attacks began. Nebenzia blamed the US and its allies for tolerating “criminal” behavior by Ukraine – from the shelling of the Zaporozhye NPP to the car bomb that killed Russian journalist Darya Dugina in Moscow over the weekend, and was cheered by some NATO officials he mentioned by name. The Zaporozhye plant is located in Energodar, a city in southern Ukraine under the control of Russian troops since March. The plant’s civilian staff continued operations unhindered until the artillery attacks began in July. Kiev has denied responsibility for the attacks and accused Russia of shelling the nuclear site to discredit Ukraine, but also of placing troops and heavy weapons inside the NPP’s perimeter and thus making it a legitimate target. The US and its allies used the meeting to demand Russia withdraw from the plant, accuse Moscow of a plot to “steal Ukrainian electricity,” and demand the immediate end of all military operations in ukraine. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he will personally head the mission to the ZNPP in the coming days, and that the UN nuclear watchdog intends to establish a permanent presence on site.",4.211853728726348,3.8481076518496353,0.3637460768767129,9
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561410-zelensky-take-back-crimea/,Ukraine will seize Crimea ‘by any means necessary’ – Zelensky,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced on Tuesday that Ukraine will take the Russian territory of Crimea, by military force if necessary and without consulting any country, including Kiev’s Western backers. The Ukrainian military’s strikes on the peninsula have thus far been limited. Speaking at the so-called ‘Crimea Platform’, a Ukrainian-organized gathering of 60 nations and international organizations that back Kiev’s claim of sovereignty over Crimea, Zelensky said that “Ukraine is strong and powerful enough” to make the idea of a “Ukrainian Crimea” a reality. “We will return Crimea by any means that we consider correct, without consulting with other countries,” Zelensky said, according to Strana.ua, a Ukrainian news outlet. ""I know that Crimea is with Ukraine, [and] is waiting for us to return. We need to win the fight against Russian aggression. Therefore, we need to free Crimea from occupation.” Considered Russian land since imperial times, Crimea was an autonomous republic within the Soviet Union until it was appended to the Ukrainian SSR by Soviet Premier Nikita Kruschev in 1954 for logistical reasons. The peninsula remained in Ukrainian hands after the fall of the USSR, until its people voted overwhelmingly to join Russia in 2014, after the Kiev government rejected a number of plebiscites during the 1990s aiming at re-establishing Crimea as an independent republic. The US-led NATO alliance considers Crimea to be “illegally annexed” Ukrainian territory, and has demanded that Moscow return the region to Ukrainian control. A US official told Politico last week that Washington has given Ukraine its blessing to strike targets of its choosing in Crimea. Kiev’s military has carried out a number of these strikes in recent weeks, including a drone attack on the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol on Saturday. Explosions at military sites on the peninsula have been blamed by Russia on Ukrainian “sabotage,” but Kiev has neither officially confirmed nor denied responsibility. With its forces tied up fighting Russian and allied troops in Donbass, Ukraine has relied on drones to carry out its sporadic attacks on Crimea. The aim of these attacks is “not military, but psychological,” Crimean official Oleg Kryuchkov stated after Saturday’s strike, adding that owing to their small payload of explosives, drones are unable to inflict extensive damage. Zelensky ruled out the prospect of a ceasefire on Tuesday, telling the summit that Ukraine would not freeze the current front line to ""calm down Russia."" Moscow has repeatedly blamed Kiev for the breakdown of peace talks earlier this year, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accusing Western governments of “keeping Ukraine from any constructive steps” toward a peace settlement.",3.011228198542095,3.4027914383392983,-0.39156323979720353,2

The alleged sexual act was witnessed by two boys, aged 12 and 13, who notified their mother of the display. The woman alerted local police, who raided the apartment and detained one of the suspects. The other man willingly turned himself in to police the next day, according to Baza. The suspects were identified only as 21-year old Timur and 22-year-old Daniil. The two men were reportedly placed in pre-trial detention for two months and are facing charges of sexual assault. Given that the victims of the alleged “assault” are below 14 years of age, Timur and Daniil could face lengthy terms of 12-20 years behind bars. In order to convict the two men under that clause, however, prosecutors must prove that they had knowingly and deliberately engaged in sex in front of minors. One of the suspects, meanwhile, reportedly told the police that they were not having sexual intercourse at all and that the boys had misinterpreted what they had seen. According to his account, the two young men were fixing a burst water pipe at the apartment and got undressed to avoid getting wet. Moreover, the mother of one of the suspects denied the young men were even gay, insisting her son has a girlfriend, Baza noted.",3.6230597386708174,3.463240979181289,0.15981875948952862,5

Europe’s largest atomic power station, under Russian control since March, is at risk due to repeated Ukrainian artillery attacks. Grossi told the BBC on Tuesday that he expects to personally lead the IAEA mission “within days, not weeks.” He would not say whether they would travel through territory controlled by Russia or by Ukraine, saying only that such matters need to be “set aside” given the urgency of the situation. The IAEA wants to inspect the integrity of the Zaporozhye NPP, speak to both Russian and Ukrainian staff there, and establish a permanent presence on the ground, Grossi said. Moscow has repeatedly called for an IAEA inspection since the Zaporozhye NPP came under attack in mid-July. The Russian Defense Ministry says Ukrainian artillery is shelling the plant, using rocket launchers provided by NATO. Kiev has denied responsibility and accused Russia of shelling the nuclear site to discredit Ukraine. Kiev has insisted that the IAEA team can only travel to the site through Ukraine. Russia’s permanent envoy to the organization, Mikhail Ulyanov, said last week that he could see an inspection happening “in early September,” provided there was no interference from “external factors that have nothing to do with the goals of the IAEA visit.” Russia wanted an IAEA visit in June, Ulyanov said, but that proposal fell through and “in a sense, things have to be done from scratch now.” The Zaporozhye plant is located in Energodar, a city in southern Ukraine under the control of Russian troops since March. The plant’s civilian staff continued operations unhindered until the artillery attacks began in July. While the US and its allies have demanded that Russia hand the plant back to Ukraine, Kiev has floated the idea of a 30-kilometer demilitarized zone around it.

2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561383-ukraine-duda-courage-plaque/,Ukraine praises Polish leader,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky unveiled the ‘Alley of Courage’ in central Kiev on Tuesday to celebrate supporters of the fight against Russia. Located outside the national parliament, the venue is to be adorned with plaques embedded in the street reminiscent of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Polish President Andrzej Duda, who visited Kiev to meet Zelensky, took part in the unveiling ceremony, receiving the first plaque at the site. It’s the third time Duda has travelled to Ukraine since the hostilities broke out in late February. “The name of President of Poland Andrzej Duda will always be on this alley. It is a symbol of courage, a symbol of friendship, a symbol of support for Ukraine when it is really needed,” Zelensky said during the ceremony. The Alley will include the names of not only political leaders but other unspecified “partners” from the collective West and elsewhere, who have been assisting the Ukrainian government since the beginning of the conflict, Zelensky added. Poland has been among the top supporters of Kiev, having sent hundreds of tanks, long-range artillery systems and other military hardware to prop up Ukrainian forces in their fight against Russia. Moscow has repeatedly warned the collective West against “pumping” Ukraine with weaponry, insisting such aid would only prolong the conflict rather than change its ultimate outcome. Back in July, Kiev passed a bill that guaranteed Poles rights similar to those of Ukraine’s own citizens. Critics warned that such a move could result in the merger of the countries and possibly the dissolution of the Ukrainian state in the future. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",4.468569449305168,3.4506613473980106,1.0179081019071572,2
2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561396-russia-western-values-poll/,Russians increasingly disillusioned with Western values – poll,"The number of Russians who believe Western values to be beneficial to the country has fallen drastically in the last 20 years, according to a poll conducted earlier this month by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM) and published on Tuesday. “The West is not only a culture, but a whole system of socio-political and economic patterns and models,” wrote the pollsters, noting that while Russian society largely looked to the West in the 1990s, it has since changed its attitude towards Western values. Back in 2000, only 10% of respondents felt that Western democracy and civilization were “harmful for Russians,” according to the poll. Now, however, that number has risen to 26%. Another 33% said that Western civilization and culture were “unsuitable for Russia,” up from 25% in 2000, while over half of those polled, or some 59%, said they didn’t see any benefits to the Western model. It was also noted that in the past 22 years, the share of people in Russia who hold a positive view of Western values has declined from 55% to 30%. “The Western world has ceased to suit Russians as a source of reference points and development vectors. This opinion divides society into two groups,” stated VCIOM. The survey revealed that Western values are embraced the most by younger people aged 18 to 34, 55-50% of whom believe the West is necessary for Russia and has much good to offer. However, after the age of 35 people start to hold opposing views, which intensify among those over 60. Some 70% of respondents in this age group regard Western values as unsuitable or destructive. Over a third of those polled also believe that Western culture has a significant influence on the tastes of Russians, with some 44% saying this influence is “somewhat negative” or “very negative.” The number of Russians who see the influence as positive dropped from 17% in 2000 to just 9% in 2022. The poll revealed that Russians who watch TV are more likely to hold a negative view of the West (78%), while active internet users are almost evenly divided: 44% expressed a negative view, while 48% see the West in a more positive light.

There were no reports of casualties in either the office building, or in the hotel.

2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561376-ukraine-russia-conflict-us/,"A nuclear showdown? One of the greatest 'realist' fears about the Russia-Ukraine conflict is actually groundless, and here's why","Fears that the Ukraine conflict is now bogged down into some sort of stalemate which risks dangerous escalation from the parties involved in order to achieve victory are misplaced. There is only one victor in the Ukraine conflict, and that is Russia. Nothing can change this reality. Renowned American intellectual John Mearsheimer has written an important article about the conflict, entitled: ‘Playing with Fire in Ukraine: The Underappreciated Risks of Catastrophic Escalation’. The article paints a dark picture about both the nature of the war in Ukraine (prolonged stalemate) and probable outcome (decisive escalation by the parties involved to stave off defeat). Mearsheimer’s underpinning premises, however, are fundamentally flawed. Russia possesses the strategic initiative – militarily, politically, and economically – when it comes to the war in Ukraine and the larger proxy engagement with NATO. Moreover, neither the US nor NATO is in a position to escalate, decisively or otherwise, to thwart a Russian victory, and Russia has no need for any similar escalation on its part. In short, the Ukraine conflict is over, and Russia has won. All that remains is a long and bloody mopping up. The key to understanding how Mearsheimer got it so wrong is to dissect his understanding of the ambitions of both the US and Russia when it comes to the issue. According to Mearsheimer, “Since the war began, both Moscow and Washington have raised their ambitions significantly, and both are now deeply committed to winning the war and achieving formidable political aims.” This passage is especially difficult to parse out. First and foremost, it is extremely difficult to articulate a sound baseline when it comes to assessing US “ambitions” vis-à-vis Ukraine and Russia. President Joe Biden's administration inherited a policy which had been conceived in the George W. Bush-era and partially implemented under the team of Barack Obama (where Biden played a critical role). This was a very aggressive policy geared toward undermining Russia with the goal of weakening the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to such an extent that eventually he would be replaced by a figure more amenable to adhering to a US-dictated policy line. But one cannot pretend that there were not four years of Trump administration policy which threw the anti-Putin – and, by extension, anti-Russia – narrative promulgated by the Obama administration on its head. While Trump was never able to gain traction for his ‘why can’t we be friends’ approach to US-Russian diplomacy, he was able to seriously undermine two major policy pillars which propped the Obama-era policy up, namely NATO unity and Ukrainian solidarity. The Biden administration was never able to resuscitate the Obama-era policy direction regarding Russia, inclusive of its anti-Putin goals and objectives. Trump’s undermining of NATO's unity and purpose, when combined with the humiliating pull-out from Afghanistan, put the bloc on the back foot when it came to standing up to the challenge of a Russian state determined to be more assertive about what it viewed as its legitimate national security interests, inclusive of a new European security framework respectful of the notion of a Russian ‘sphere of influence’. Instead, the world was treated to the spectacle of Joe Biden insulting his Russian counterpart with cartoonish ‘he’s a killer’ comments, all the while making promises regarding diplomatic initiatives (pressuring Ukraine to accept Minsk II, starting ‘meaningful’ arms control talks) that his administration proved unable and/or unwilling to follow through on. When confronted with the reality of a Russian military build-up around Ukraine, the best the Biden administration could do was make empty military threats and even emptier promises about “meaningful and unprecedented” economic sanctions should Russia intervene militarily. The fact is, while US government officials may make bold statements about the need to inflict harm, via proxy, on the Russian military through the provision of billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Ukraine, it is the US which has had defeat inflicted on it in terms of the ongoing losses of its Ukrainian proxy military and the destruction of the equipment provided in support. The US, like its NATO allies, has proven to be very good at making bold pronouncements about goals and intent, but very bad at putting them into practice. This is the state of American ‘ambitions’ vis-à-vis Ukraine today – all rhetoric, no meaningful action. Any fear of a US and/or NATO military intervention in Ukraine must be weighed against the reality that hot air does not generate cold steel; US politicians might be adept at filling the pages of a compliant mainstream media with impressive-sounding words, but neither the US military nor its NATO allies are able to generate the kind of meaningful military capability needed to effectively challenge Russia on the ground in Ukraine. This reality severely limits the scope and scale of any possible US ambitions regarding Ukraine. At the end of the day, Washington has only one path forward – to continue to waste billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money sending military equipment to Ukraine, which has no chance of changing the outcome on the battlefield, to convince a domestic American audience that their government is ‘doing the right thing’ in a losing effort. There is no ‘military option’ in Ukraine for either the US or NATO because, simply put, there is no military capable of meaningfully executing such an option. This conclusion is critical to understanding Russia’s ‘ambitions’. Unlike the US, Russia has articulated clear and concise objectives regarding its decision to dispatch military forces into Ukraine. These can be described as follows: Permanent Ukrainian neutrality (i.e., no NATO membership), the de-Nazification of Ukraine (the permanent eradication of the odious nationalistic ideology of Stepan Bandera), and the de-militarization of the state – the destruction and elimination of all traces of NATO involvement in the security affairs of Ukraine. These three objectives only reflect the immediate goals of the Special Military Operation in Ukraine. The ultimate objective – a restructured European security framework that has all NATO infrastructure withdrawn to the 1997 boundaries of that alliance – remains as a non-negotiable requirement that will have to be addressed after Russia secures its final military and political victory in Ukraine. In short, Russia is winning on the ground in Ukraine, and there is nothing either the US or NATO can do to alter this outcome. And once Russia secures this victory, it will be in a far stronger position to insist that its concerns about a viable European security framework be respected and implemented. Mearsheimer believes that the situation on the ground in Ukraine provides both the US and Russia with “powerful incentives to find ways to prevail and, more important, to avoid losing.” At the end of the day, the Ukraine conflict is not an existential one for either the US or NATO; a loss in Ukraine will be another setback – Afghanistan on steroids. But a Ukrainian defeat does not, in and of itself, threaten NATO with collapse or spell the end of the American Republic. Simply put, Mearsheimer’s fear that a loss in Ukraine “means that the United States might join the fighting either if it is desperate to win or to prevent Ukraine from losing” is unfounded. So, too, is his contention that “Russia might use nuclear weapons if it is desperate to win or faces imminent defeat, which would be likely if US forces were drawn into the fighting.” Russia neither “faces defeat” nor has anything to worry about, existentially, from a US military intervention which, from all practical points of view, could not materialize even if the US wanted to be so bold. Mearsheimer concludes his article by noting that “This perilous situation creates a powerful incentive to find a diplomatic solution to the war.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Just as the US would be loath to seek a “diplomatic solution” to the conflicts waged against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Russia would be similarly disinclined to engage in any diplomacy which denied it the full implementation of its core objectives. Back in March, in response to a tweet from Joe Biden which declared “Let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia,” I responded by tweeting, “This war will go down in history as a strategic Russian victory. Russia will have halted NATO expansion, destroyed a dangerous den of Nazi ideology in Ukraine, redefined European security by undermining NATO, and demonstrated Russian military prowess, an important deterrent.” Those words were accurate then, and they remain accurate today.",2.550153048817719,3.201936105066153,-0.6517830562484339,8

Investigators have accused Kiev of masterminding a plot to kill the journalist and political commentator in a car bombing. “I consider it a barbaric crime for which no forgiveness can be granted,” Lavrov said on Wednesday, when asked about the murder, which took place on Saturday evening. The Russian investigation into the assassination will hopefully identify all the culprits soon, the minister added. “Certainly, the organizers, the middlemen and the executors can get no mercy,” he said. When asked whether the killing was “an act of terrorism or personalized retaliation,” Lavrov declined to offer a judgment. He made the comments during a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad, in the Russian capital. The FSB, Russia’s domestic security agency, identified a Ukrainian woman, Natalya Vovk, as the suspected assassin. She had entered Russia with her teenage daughter and rented an apartment in the same block where Dugina lived. She had allegedly been present at the same public event as the journalist, upon the conclusion of which the latter’s car was blown up, according to investigators. Vovk fled to Estonia before she could be apprehended, the FSB said. There is an image of an ID bearing the suspect’s name circulating online indicating that she is a member of a Ukrainian National Guard unit known as the Azov Battalion, which has been widely reported as enlisting radical Ukrainian nationalists in its ranks. Russia believes that Vovk acted on an order from the Ukrainian government. Kiev has denied any involvement in the bombing. Dugina was the daughter of philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, a controversial thinker known for his advocacy of Russian exceptionalism. He is often described in the Western media as having behind-the-scenes influence on the Kremlin’s foreign policy. Darya, a public figure of some prominence in her own right, shared some of her father’s ideas about Russia’s place in the world. The car targeted by the killer had belonged to Dugin, who was reportedly supposed to accompany his daughter but at the last moment ended up taking a different vehicle.",3.7610373486558406,3.0099125254330183,0.7511248232228223,1

According to the ministry’s spokesman, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, Russian and allied forces have destroyed Ukrainian military units defending the town of Aleksandrovka and managed to reach the administrative border of Nikolaev Region. The town is in Ukraine’s Kherson Region, which has mostly been under Russian control for months. It lies on the coast of the Dnieper-Bug estuary, through which the waters of both rivers flow into the Black Sea. The Bug River comes from the north, where the city of Nikolaev, the capital of the eponymous region, an important industrial and port city, and major stronghold of the Ukrainian military, is located. Konashenkov also said that elsewhere in southern Ukraine, Russian troops have advanced into Nikolaev Region and have taken control of 12 square kilometers (4.6 square miles). He identified the location of the advancement as near the village of Komsomolskoye. Russian forces were already in control of a small southeastern portion of Nikolaev Region, which borders Kherson Region. Earlier in August, Nikolaev’s regional authorities announced a major crackdown on suspected Russian sympathizers in the provincial capital.

Pyotr Vrublevsky, the Ukrainian ambassador to the Central Asian country, told a local blogger in an interview about the Ukraine conflict on Monday: “We are trying to kill as many [Russians] as possible. The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to.” “In our country, where peace and unity are the key principles of state policy and societal consolidation, such statements are unacceptable and inappropriate, no matter who makes them,” the APK, an advisory body to the president of Kazakhstan, said in a statement on its website on Tuesday. “Diplomacy must serve the ideals of peace and cooperation, not hatred and animosity.” “The language of animosity is foreign to us,” the APK said, adding that “the propaganda of ethnic hatred is unacceptable in any form.” The Ukrainian diplomat’s words sparked outrage in Russia and among the Russian community in Kazakhstan. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram that “only an ambassador of a terrorist regime can say such things.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",4.0896082980737285,3.4359301093874572,0.6536781886862713,2

Moscow has accused Kiev of masterminding the car bombing that resulted in her death. The reaction of the US Department of State to the high-profile murder and the evidence that Russia released in the investigation discredits Washington’s claim that it is concerned about human rights, Zakharova said on Tuesday in a social media post. “Washington has no moral right … to judge the state of human rights in faraway places if they don’t even comment on the murder of a journalist,” despite claiming to care about protecting the media, she said. “They simply did not take notice that she was a public figure.” Dugina was killed by a bomb planted under the car of her father, controversial Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin. She was a notable figure in her own right, working as a journalist and advocating for nationalist causes in Russia. Russian investigators said they identified the killer as a Ukrainian woman, who allegedly cased out her target beforehand, going as far as renting an apartment in the same block where Dugina lived. Open-source data indicate that the suspect, Natalya Vovk, serves in the Ukrainian military. Moscow accused Kiev of ordering the assassination, which the Ukrainian government has denied. Ned Price, the spokesman for the US Department of State, commented on the death of Dugina on Monday, stating that Washington “unequivocally [condemns] the targeting of civilians,” be they in Ukraine or Russia. “I don’t have anything to share beyond what you have all heard publicly, and that is that Ukraine has denied any involvement,” he said. Price added that he has “no doubt that the Russians will put forward certain conclusions” after investigating the bombing.",3.008080542370809,3.925775758598557,-0.9176952162277483,1

The proposals are being drawn up by an advisory group headed by former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. ""We believe security guarantees to be a very important issue, we constantly discuss this matter with all our partners. We talked about this today as well, and I’m glad that our partners are interested… By the end of this month, I think on the 29th or 30th, we can count on the first document emerging,” Yermak told reporters after a meeting with aides to the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Hungary. The Ukrainian official noted that he had already gone over the paper, touting it as “very powerful.” Earlier this month, in a Guardian op-ed, Yermak said Ukraine was preparing recommendations on security guarantees. He signaled that while Kiev’s long-term goal remains NATO membership, what he termed “Russia’s current belligerence” makes accession difficult. He believes Kiev needs legally binding guarantees from its partners for weapons deliveries, the exchange of intelligence, and the support of its defense and economy. On Tuesday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev commented on the talks, saying that any security guarantees for Ukraine could have only been provided by Russia, but Kiev has given up that chance. “No one will accept Ukraine into NATO now.

2022-08-23,https://www.rt.com/russia/561303-hungary-russia-eurocrat-elites/,"Kirill Teremetsky: Hungary is not Russia’s ally, but it’s a rare rational partner in an increasingly fanatical EU","We are witnessing a clash between Eastern European Realpolitik, the followers of which still remember Hans Morgenthau’s precepts about the primacy of the national interest, and the broader Western ideology and politics of high hopes and illusions. In this, mutually beneficial bilateral ties are sacrificed in favor of political agendas. On August 21, Hungarian oil and gas giant MOL and Slovakia’s Slovnaft paid for Russian oil transit through Ukraine. Kiev’s UkrTransNafta did not accept payment from Moscow’s Gazprombank allegedly because of sanctions. The stopping of transit through the Druzhba pipeline was another step to pressure Russia, which could not have taken place without the approval of their Western partners. But why is Hungary itself willing to look for ways to pay for Russian energy resources in an emergency and go against the EU’s sanctions policy? And why did Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto go to Moscow at the end of July for talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, about additional gas supplies? Despite the cooling of Hungarian-Ukrainian relations after 2014 and the lack of official support from Budapest for the Kiev authorities, Hungarian oil and gas company MOL has transferred €300,000 and sent special equipment worth €50,000 to keep the Ukrainian gas transmission system functioning during the Russian military operation. Hungary is concerned about the continuity of energy supplies from Ukraine, as it is 60% dependent on Russian oil (with another 16% coming from Kazakhstan, which also uses the Druzhba pipeline) and 85% on Russian gas. Thanks to stable and pragmatic bilateral relations between Russia and Budapest, long-term contracts have been concluded, allowing the country to buy energy resources at a price five times lower than the broader European market. The $10 billion project signed in 2014 between Rosatom and Hungary’s MVM to build two units of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant, which despite the political environment has been successfully implemented, allows Hungary to remain an attractive country for big business and foreign investment, thanks to its cheap electricity. All this helps Viktor Orban’s ruling Fidesz-CDPP coalition to make and keep promises to voters in the form of relatively low petrol and gas prices and lower electricity tariffs. They are also able to use pre-election populist measures such as thirteenth salaries and extra social payments, and influence public opinion through the media (MOL and energy company MVM Group are sponsors of Hungarian government publications) and student institutions. MOL will pay its shareholders a dividend of $652 million this year. One of the beneficiaries and shareholders (30.5%) are nominally non-governmental foundations that fund educational institutions such as Corvinus University and Mathias Corvinus Collegium. This helps the ruling party influence the formation of the ‘right’ view among students on political processes taking place in Hungary. At the same time, Budapest is diversifying its energy sector and trying to gradually reduce its dependence on Russian raw materials. Budapest buys LNG from Croatia, participates in gas projects in the UAE and Oman, and has a strategic partnership agreement with ExxonMobil (although a pipeline project from Romania proved unsuccessful). Hungarian operator FGSZ and Serbia’s Srbijagas completed an interconnector at the border between the countries for supplies through Turkish Stream on July 5, 2021, so the Hungarian government will buy natural gas from Azerbaijan from 2023. Hungary imports oil from Iraq and Iran, and cooperates in this sector with Kuwait and Bahrain, while developing its own fields (in the Baranja region). On May 18, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, unveiled a plan to move away from Russian energy, called REPowerEU. Up to €300 billion is planned to be allocated for the modernization of the bloc’s energy sector. The Hungarian side vetoed the sixth package of sanctions on Russia, which initially envisaged a complete rejection of Russian energy supplies. According to Foreign Minister Szijjarto, up to €18 billion would be needed to upgrade and refocus the country’s oil and gas industry. Szijjarto has repeatedly stated that Hungary has already lost more than €10 billion due to the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia in 2014. If the EU had adopted the sixth sanctions package in full, it would have been, as Orban put it, a real “nuclear blow” to the Hungarian economy. Gasoline prices in the country, according to him, would have at least doubled. Therefore, for Hungary and some individual CEE countries, reliefs were granted in the form of a postponement of the embargo on oil and gas supplies from Russia until 2024. In 2017, after the freezing at the time of Nord Stream 2, Orban blasted Western countries (especially Germany) given that they were already supplied with Russian gas thanks to the first branch of Nord Stream, while Budapest had no such guarantees of uninterrupted supplies (it was hardly controversial to say that Ukraine is not the most reliable transit country). In this context, the prime minister actively supported the Turkish Stream project. On May 21 of this year, during a press conference, Szijjarto asked why an embargo on offshore oil supplies from Russia should not be imposed. After all, Hungary, unlike most countries that more actively support the sanctions, does not have access to the sea; it gets its energy by land. In doing so, the minister once again rebuked the Western EU comrades for double standards. Budapest’s stance really irritates the European Commission, which has already accused the Hungarian authorities and Orban personally of undermining the bloc’s unity during the refugee crisis. Eurocrats have criticized the country for high levels of corruption and shutting down ‘free’ media, while repeatedly threatening to cut funding from the EU’s stabilization fund. In addition, Budapest does not support the bloc’s desire to arm Ukraine and does not allow the supply of military equipment through its territory to Transcarpathia. The EU either has to make an exception for Hungary and subsequently allow the purchase of Russian energy until the expiry of the contracts (and negotiate again with Budapest at the end of this period, at the same time gradually connecting Hungary to the newly developing energy infrastructure) or pay the amount of money that Budapest has estimated for modernizing the energy sector (adding to the money Hungary has not received to cushion the economic effects of the pandemic). Of course, due to the urgency of the circumstances, Brussels may decide in the future on a new package of sanctions without taking into account Hungary’s opinion, but then the EU can expect a new Brexit (analysts have been writing about Hungary’s possible exit from the association for a long time), which, in the current circumstances, is absolutely unacceptable to the ruling circles of the EU. This relationship between official Brussels and Orban suggests that the Hungarian government will continue to take a tough line on the Russian oil and gas embargo. It is clear that Hungary is not going to follow anyone’s orders to its detriment. For the Orban government, the Hungarian people (not the politicians in Brussels or Washington) and the Hungarian economy (not the pan-European ideology) come first. The Hungarian government follows pragmatism in its foreign policy and is ready to defend its position on the international scene. Hungary is only comfortable with win-win projects, such as the reconstruction of the Belgrade-Budapest railway to speed up the delivery of Chinese goods from the Greek port of Piraeus (China is paying all the costs for its ‘Silk Road’ and the Hungarian government is promoting the initiative in Europe). The European Commission’s plan to move away from Russian energy carriers, developments in Ukraine, Poland’s desire to influence the agenda in Europe, and Washington’s dream of increasing the EU’s dependence on its energy carriers could spur the development of the 2016 TSI project (or ‘Three Seas Initiative’, which includes 12 countries, including Hungary). This project involves transporting liquefied natural gas (and eventually oil) from the US through offshore terminals in Poland and Croatia, and in the future, also Norwegian gas – the first deliveries to Poland via the new Baltic Pipe pipeline from Norway are planned for October 2022. It is worth keeping an eye on developments in the Three Seas Initiative, as Poland already has experience in buying and selling US LNG, and Croatia has been re-selling it to Hungary and other countries since 2021. In May, the Polish authorities decided to terminate the Yamal intergovernmental agreement with Russia on gas supplies, concluded in 1993. In fact, the US-Polish project is already underway. With proper funding and political will on the part of the EU, the TSI infrastructure network could be successfully completed in the next few years. Hungary is not an ally of Russia, but it is a consistent and rational business partner. And there are few such states left in Europe. In the current circumstances, working contacts are needed with the Hungarian side regarding the possible prolongation of the energy supply agreements (so that any REPowerEU proposal looks completely unprofitable). The July meeting between Szijjarto and Lavrov proves that the channels of communication between the countries are established, and we understand and hear each other.",3.3897726335598923,3.188847456098422,0.2009251774614702,1

This is why he threatened to cut off all talks with Moscow if Russia’s ally in Donbass goes ahead with plans to launch a tribunal in Mariupol later this month. Writing on social media on Tuesday, Volodin said “everybody” is looking forward to the tribunal, except Zelensky, “who considers it unacceptable.” “He and the Kiev regime have reasons to be afraid,” he added. “He and his inner circle ordered to bomb, shoot and kill peaceful citizens: the elderly, women, children. That is why Zelensky is doing everything to prevent the tribunal.” The lawmaker was referring to a statement Zelensky made on Monday about the scheduled trial of Ukrainian troops captured by the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), an ally of Russia. The Ukrainian leader called the proceedings a “despicable show trial” and “the line beyond which any negotiations are impossible.” The DPR captured hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers during the battle for the city of Mariupol, including members of the notorious Azov Battalion, which has in its ranks fighters openly displaying neo-Nazi views and sympathies. Some of them have been accused of committing serious crimes during intensive fighting against DPR militias and Russian troops.

Russia’s Zvezda TV reported that the demolition of the WWII Victory Memorial had already begun, with an excavator removing the stairway leading to sculptures depicting three Soviet soldiers. The city authorities earlier refused to grant permission for a protest by the Latvian Russian Union political party, which the organizers had planned to hold on Monday to denounce the removal of the monument. According to Latvia’s LSM media outlet, officials cited the “opinion of security services,” as well as the fact that the rally would have taken place in an area “currently cordoned off due to the demolition process.” In an interview with Latvia’s LTV network last Wednesday, Riga Mayor Martins Stakis said the WWII memorial, once dismantled, will be “sent for recycling.” The official claimed that the “Museum of the Occupation of Latvia has not recognized any part of the monument as artistically valuable.” Stakis added that a park will be built in place of the memorial. The Riga City Council passed its decision in May, though calls for the removal of this and other Soviet war memorials have been made in the Baltic nation for years. Some see the monuments as symbols of “Soviet re-occupation,” and the launching of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine in February intensified public debate over the memorials.

Published on National Flag Day, the survey suggested that people tend to link the word ‘Russia’ with the official national symbols, the Russian people and their motherland. “Our fellow citizens have only positive associations with the word ‘Russia’,” the polling agency said in a statement, adding that these include “nature, history, architectural landmarks, cities, animals, culture and literature” among others. The biggest group of respondents (12%) linked Russia to its national symbols – the flag, emblem and national anthem. Almost as many people, a respective 11% and 10%, said they associate it with “the people"" and ""home."" Around 7% of Russians named Putin as the symbol of Russia and just as many mentioned the country's nature, such as the birch tree or Siberia’s Lake Baikal, the biggest freshwater lake in the world. The poll showed that young Russians tend to associate their nation with Putin more closely than their older compatriots. Among those aged between 18 and 24, 10% saw Putin as the symbol of Russia. The bear was named by just 5% of respondents. On Monday, Putin addressed the nation on National Flag Day and said that the flag “remained Russia’s symbol in difficult, challenging periods of its history,” including World War I and “the contradictory, arduous 1990s” that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. The flag has become “a symbol of the unity of our people and their devotion to the Fatherland and readiness to uphold national interests,” the president said, adding that it “symbolizes our faith in our traditional values that we will never give up – truth and justice, solidarity and mercy, and respect for Russia’s centuries-long uninterrupted history.” Russia is a “strong, independent world power” that is “committed” to defending its national interests and will not “permit any foreign hegemony or diktat,” he added.

At around 1pm local time, Kiev’s forces launched a series of attacks using US-made HIMARS artillery systems. The shelling was apparently meant to sabotage Russian efforts to repair the bridge after previous attacks, local emergency services said. At the moment of the attack, a crew of civilian employees from the local repair and restoration team were working on the bridge while a ferry carrying civilians was passing underneath it. The shelling left two people dead and 16 injured. Another three people are yet to be accounted for, according to local authorities. A representative for the local emergency services told TASS news agency that there were no losses among those who are tasked with ensuring the transfer of civilians across the Dnieper river. Meanwhile, Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Kherson region, said that the Antonovsky Bridge was not destroyed as a result of the attack, but had sustained significant damage. Earlier this month, Ukraine’s forces conducted a series of attacks on the bridge that connects the Russian-controlled city of Kherson with the rest of southern Ukraine. While the attack on August 8 did not lead to any casualties, it managed to destroy several pieces of equipment that had been brought to the site to repair damages from previous artillery strikes and caused local authorities to keep the bridge closed to all traffic. While the bridge has been closed for nearly a month now, Russian forces have launched a ferry to transport civilians from one side of the Dnieper river to the other. Local authorities also reportedly plan to build a pontoon bridge that will connect the two shores and be easier to repair in case of an attack by the Ukrainian side.",4.14346540279666,5.300331261998106,-1.1568658592014458,0

Speaking to a local blogger, Vrublevsky was asked to comment on the ongoing Ukraine conflict. “What can I say … We are trying to kill as many [Russians] as possible. The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to. That’s it,” he said. The Ukrainian envoy’s remarks sparked anger in Russia, with Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accusing Kiev of ‘terrorist’ policies. “Only an ambassador of a terrorist regime can say such things. The Kiev Nazis have been killing people for eight years silently and blaming Moscow for everything, but now they are openly talking about their ethnic cleansing plans,” she wrote on Telegram. Earlier this month, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev accused Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky of taking a page out of Adolf Hitler’s playbook by calling for the collective punishment of all Russians. Medvedev was referring to a previous statement by Zelensky in which he suggested deporting all Russians – regardless of their political leanings or circumstances – from Western countries. “Adolf Hitler tried to implement such ideas about an entire people,” the Russian official remarked. “Any more questions about the nature of the Ukrainian authorities?”",3.5379585759537426,2.8356199234488506,0.702338652504892,5

Vovk, 43, was named by the FSB on Monday as the prime suspect in the assassination of Dugina. The Ukrainian national arrived in Russia on July 23, using Donetsk People’s Republic license plates to avoid scrutiny. While in Moscow, she swapped the plates on her Mini Cooper to those of Kazakhstan, a friendly former Soviet republic. On Sunday, after the bombing, Vovk drove to Estonia with Ukrainian plates, the FSB said. Photos of the different license plates were included as part of the video presentation. The authorities also said Vovk may have used her teenage daughter as cover to move around Russia more easily. She rented an apartment in the same building where Dugina lived, and was captured on the doorway camera. A photo ID of Vovk in the uniform of Ukraine’s National Guard was published in April on the Russian internet, as part of a dox of neo-Nazi Azov regiment members. It lists her surname as Shaban – the surname her daughter used when entering Russia, according to the FSB. Ukraine previously claimed it was not involved in the assassination.

2022-08-22,https://www.rt.com/russia/561163-russian-flag-history/,"Jesus, Byzantium and the Slavic legacy: The true meaning behind the Russian flag explained","Every national flag distills the history and values of the people it represents. America's star-spangled banner is a great example of this. The Russian flag and its coat of arms, which predate it by a hundred years, are equally steeped in history. They have undergone changes in the last couple of centuries, but these symbols have retained the link between Moscow and the Byzantine Empire, the idea of Slavic brotherhood, and references to the country’s naval history. As Russia celebrates National Flag Day, RT sheds some light on its origins. The traditional symbol used by medieval Moscow princes, who brought together Russian principalities and created a unified state, was the figure of a horseman, which can be found on seals dating back to the 13th century. For a long time, it was just a knight on horseback holding a spear or a sword. Sometimes it was not even a warrior. Thus, Vasily the Blind used a seal depicting a horseman with a falcon on his arm. However, Yury of Moscow linked the image to his patron saint, St. George, and then it was made to represent one of the icon’s best-known deeds – the slaying of the dragon with a spear. Ultimately, St. George became the classic symbol of Moscow heraldry and can still be seen on Moscow’s coat of arms and on the shield in the middle of the national equivalent. The 15th century witnessed several important developments in Russia. For the first time in centuries, Ivan III, the grand prince of Moscow, managed to unify most of the old Rus lands under one ruler. He was widowed in 1467 after his wife, Maria, died at just 25 years of age. His second spouse was Sophia Palaiologina, the niece of the last emperor in Constantinople.The marriage to a relative of the last emperor of the Orthodox Christian superpower was important to Ivan in terms of both status and religion. Even though Byzantium had fallen to Turkish conquerors by then, the princess from the House of Palaiologos lost none of her pride. A strong and independent Greek woman, Sophia quickly adjusted to life in Ivan’s court and would not be overshadowed by her energetic and ambitious consort. One of Byzantium’s notable traits was a coat of arms in the form of a double-headed eagle. That was an incredibly ancient image literally going back to some of the first states in history, such as the Hittite Empire. It is likely that the double-headed eagle as a heraldic symbol traces its origins back to that era. In any case, these images first appeared in Anatolia. The Komnenos dynasty was the first to adopt it as a seal of the royal family, and later, the eagle with two heads served as an emblem of the Palaiologos, the last royal dynasty of the Byzantine Empire. Ivan III aspired to a status comparable to that of Byzantine emperors, so it was a natural choice for Moscow princes, and later tsars, to adopt the royal symbol as well. As time went by, the eagle was gradually transformed into the shape we see today. Under Ivan the Terrible, the shield with the horseman was moved to the bird's chest. In the 17th century, a scepter and an orb, the symbols of the Russian tsar’s power, appeared in its claws. It was then, under Tsar Alexis, the father of Peter the Great, that the function of the double-headed eagle was first put down in writing when it was officially adopted as the national coat of arms. It has remained in this role ever since, with the exception of the period between the revolution of 1917 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Tsar Alexis also contributed to the creation of Russia’s first flag. Initially, the shape, colors, and design of the Russian banner were not defined in any specific way, but religious images were almost invariably used – even the Russian word ‘znamya’ (banner) comes from ‘znamenie’ (sign, omen). Ivan the Terrible used a red banner with the image of Jesus Christ as his military flag. The volunteer army led by Prince Pozharsky, which liberated Moscow in 1612, also used a red flag, albeit depicting the biblical military leader Joshua, son of Nun, instead of Christ. The need to have a uniform flag which would be easily interpretable and recognized by everyone arose with the birth of the Russian Navy. For a long time, Russia was cut off from the seas, but when Russia’s first European-style navy ship, the Oryol, was being built on the Oka River, its commander asked Tsar Alexis what the Russian banner should look like. In 1667, the monarch approved white, blue, and red as the colors of the Russian national flag. Opinions vary on how exactly the colors were arranged. One theory is that it was a blue cross dividing two white and two red squares. What we do know for sure is that the tsar was shown the flags of England, Denmark, and Sweden as examples and these did have crosses on them. Peter I introduced a uniform navy flag of white, blue, and red. At first, it also included the heraldic double-headed eagle, which later disappeared. What’s important to remember is that the white, blue, and red flag was initially meant for the navy. Peter himself drew a sketch of this new flag and made the three colors standard for officers’ scarves. The country’s later flags were based on a combination of these colors, and the white, blue, and red banner was perceived as essentially Russian. At its introduction, the flag had no heraldic meaning, although some researchers linked it to the Moscow coat of arms. White was supposed to stand for St. George, while blue and red symbolized his cloak and the field he was riding in respectively. There are other interpretations of the choice of colors. One theory claims the tricolor comes from the official title of Russian tsars, ‘The Sovereign of all Rus: the Great, the Little, and the White’, in which white stands for the White Rus (modern Belarus), blue – for the Little Rus (the territories currently controlled by Ukraine), and red – for the Great Rus, or Russia itself. Until the 1917 revolution, there was another popular explanation in which white was thought to symbolize freedom and independence, blue stood for the Mother of God, and red was the expression of great power statehood. There are other, more prosaic versions as well, but, interestingly, there has never been any official explanation of the white, blue, and red symbolism either in Peter’s times or later. White, blue, and red have been typical flag colors in many Slavic countries since as early as the 13th century, when Serbia had a red and blue banner and Moravia used a blue flag with a red and white eagle. The 1848 Prague Slavic Congress officially defined the pan-Slavic colors based on the Russian tricolor, and this color combination was used for a number of state flags. The modern flags of Slovakia and Slovenia have the same colors arranged in the same order as the Russian banner, and are differentiated by their coats of arms placed above the color stripes. The colors are also used by Serbia and Croatia. Bulgaria was an exception. While it borrowed the concept of the Russian flag, it replaced the blue stripe with a green one, green being one of the colors on the coat of arms of the Battenbergs, the first princes of Bulgaria. As Slavic nations were uniting under banners of similar colors, Russia itself, remarkably, switched to a different color scheme. From 1858 to 1896, the Russian Empire officially used a black, yellow, and white flag associated with its coat of arms. Even though this combination was known in Russian heraldry since the reign of Peter the Great, the flag was only used sporadically, except the period in the second half of the 19th century when it became standard for government and administrative buildings on important occasions. The black, yellow, and white flag did not gain as much traction as the white, blue, and red, and was perceived more as the Romanovs’ banner than the national flag. It occupies a special niche in Russian society today, and is used by a range of right-wing groups who seek to highlight their admiration of the imperial period in Russian history, hence its informal moniker the ‘imperka’. Eventually, in 1896, Nicholas II made the white, blue, and red banner the only national flag of Russia. In some instances, it would also include the coat of arms. In Soviet times, the Russian tricolor was largely forgotten, with flags of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic invariably being versions of the red banner. The classic white, blue, and red flag was used either by emigres, or by collaborationist military units fighting on the side of Germany during World War II. The tricolor reemerged in Russia in the autumn of 1991 and was officially raised above the Kremlin to replace the red flag on December 25, 1991. It is still used today with minor modifications. The white, blue, and red flag remains primarily a symbol of the long and perhaps most illustrious era in Russian history – the imperial period. First adopted in an almost medieval country – which was 17th-century Russia – it saw the Russian Empire being consumed by the blaze of a world war, and was reborn in those troubled days when the USSR was falling apart. Whatever fate may yet befall Russia, it would be hard to imagine it with any other flag.",4.725554061972315,4.748783576356421,-0.0232295143841057,4

Only 25% of the German public is satisfied with his performance as chancellor, while 62% of those polled expressed disapproval.

Ukraine’s current position makes diplomatic contact with Russia impossible, Gennady Gatilov, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, told the Financial Times on Sunday. The US and its allies are using the hostilities in Ukraine “as a matter of pressure on Russia, as a tool of isolation of Russia … damaging our position, economically, politically,” he said. Consequently, Kiev broke off direct talks with Russia in March, which promised a potential resolution to the conflict, the diplomat said. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky claimed the talks with Russia were no longer possible after accusing Russia in April of committing war crimes in the town of Bucha near Kiev. Russia denied the allegations. Zelensky repeatedly said he was ready to talk to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to end the conflict, but would do so only after all Russian troops withdrew to the pre-2014 positions. Moscow believes this indicated that there was no “practical platform” for a Putin-Zelensky meeting, Gatilov said. “Now, I do not see any possibility for diplomatic contacts,” Gatilov told the British newspaper. “And the more the conflict goes on, the more difficult it will be to have a diplomatic solution.” Russian ties with Western nations have likewise become virtually non-existent, and the delegation he leads has no formal or personal contacts with any Western counterparts, he added.

One of them can be heard saying, “Glory to Ukraine!” and calling their act a “creative” performance. One of the men also appears to be wearing an insignia that resembles an emblem of the Right Sector neo-Nazi group – which is considered a terrorist group by Russia.

The stunt comes as Ukraine increasingly seeks to rid itself of any cultural references to Russia, ranging from street names to monuments. In June, the Kiev authorities renamed several metro stations in the city. Leo Tolstoy Square has been renamed in honor of Vasyl Stus, a local poet. There was also a petition to change all Pushkin Streets across Ukraine to the name of American writer Stephen King, but it failed to gather enough signatures. The Kiev Conservatory, which is officially named the Pyotr Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine (UNTAM) after the Russian composer, has so far resisted the trend that has engulfed Ukraine since the start of the Russian military campaign in February. In June, its board refused to rebrand and remove the composer’s name. The Ukrainian Education Ministry has revealed plans to wipe Russian literature out of the nation’s school curricula. Deputy Education and Science Minister Andrey Vitrenko said in June that “everything that somehow connects us with the Russian Empire should be thrown out.” The ministry has not yet officially announced any changes, but local media has reported that Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Bulgakov, and other iconic Russian authors are among those to be banned.

The move helped the Communists snatch almost 19% of the ballots and finish second, behind only the ruling United Russia party (49.82%). The CPRF currently has 57 seats out of 450 in Russia’s parliament, the State Duma. This process of unification of like-minded forces must continue, insisted Zyuganov, who had been the head of the CPRF since 1993. “If anybody has such a desire – join up, we’ll consider all applications,” the 78-year-old promised.

Zyuganov responded to the idea by stating that his party was ready to run in the next election together with Fair Russia if the latter was prepared to work to implement the CPRF’s program.",3.5550630677837938,3.190257060921344,0.3648060068624499,3
2022-08-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/561254-kiev-denies-dugina-assassination/,Kiev denies responsibility for Dugina killing,"Kiev has nothing to do with the assassination of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian political commentator and philosopher Alexandr Dugin, an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky pledged on Sunday. Speaking on national television, Mikhail Podoliak insisted his country is not “a terrorist state,” an apparent response to suspicion voiced by officials that Kiev might be behind the bombing. “I want to stress out that Ukraine, of course, has nothing to do with this, because we are not a criminal state, unlike Russia, and especially not a terrorist state,” he noted. Podoliak also indicated that the killing of Dugin’s daughter is “a testament to the ongoing struggle for power and influence among various groups in Russia.” Moreover, he did not rule out that Russia could use the blast as an excuse for announcing a large-scale mobilization amid the military offensive in Ukraine. Moscow has denied all claims it plans to do so, castigating such speculation as “bogus stories.” Podoliak’s comments came after Denis Pushilin, the leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic, accused the “terrorists of the Ukrainian regime” of carrying out the bombing. However, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova did not pin the blame on Kiev but noted that if investigators determine that Ukraine is indeed responsible, this “would be the case of state terrorism policies carried out by the Kiev regime.” Dugina was killed Saturday night outside Moscow when the SUV she was driving was ripped apart in an explosion. According to Russia’s Investigative Committee, the blast was caused by a bomb that had been attached to the underside of the vehicle. Investigators believe the attack to have been premeditated and to be a contract job. Earlier on Saturday evening, Aleksandr Dugin was giving a lecture at a family festival called ‘Tradition’ in Moscow Region. Dugina was in attendance at the event. Several reports say Dugin initially planned to leave the festival with his daughter but later decided to take a separate car, while Darya took his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. Dugin is known for his staunch anti-Western and ‘neo-Eurasian’ views. Western media has portrayed him as a driving force behind key aspects of President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy. However, despite his reputation in the West, in Russia he has never enjoyed official endorsement from the Kremlin and is largely considered a marginal figure.",3.827020288322958,2.025806550007141,1.801213738315817,1
2022-08-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/561092-nato-terrorist-states-russia/,NATO members pushing to brand Russia a 'terrorist state' tells us that the US and its allies lack self-awareness,"Efforts are underway in the US Senate to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Before going down that road, lawmakers may wish to consider some inconvenient facts. If Russia’s military operation in Ukraine is doing anything – aside from eradicating the resurgence of fascism on the European continent – it is revealing the shocking lack of self-awareness in Western capitals. Perennial American Russophobes from opposite sides of the political spectrum, Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Sen. Lindsey Graham, are now agitating members of Congress to include Russia in Washington’s list of ‘state sponsors of terrorism,’ which presently includes North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Syria. Meanwhile, the Baltic State of Lithuania signed off on its own legislation in May declaring Russia a ‘terrorist state.’ Yet Vilnius didn’t stop there, accusing Russia of carrying out ‘genocide’ on its neighbor’s territory. The resolution states that Russia is committing “genocide against the Ukrainian people,” while saying that the Russian military, like some kind of modern-day Huns, “deliberately and systematically target civilian targets..."" Consider how US-led coalition forces ‘liberated’ the Syrian city of Raqqa from Islafmic State militants, who scattered their forces throughout the civilian population thereby turning civilians into ‘human shields’ – a technique now being employed by Ukraine. The US-led Coalition's relentless four-month ‘precision’ bombardment against IS killed and injured thousands of civilians, while reducing homes, businesses and infrastructure to rubble. Surveying the damage on the ground, Amnesty International concluded that the US-led Coalition “launched strikes likely to cause excessive harm to civilians and failed to distinguish between military targets and civilians."" The tragic irony of the situation, from Russia’s perspective, is that while Moscow is attempting to spare infrastructure and human lives, it is branded the ‘terrorist state,’ whereas Ukraine is granted hero status as it employs those same tactics that put civilian life at grave risk. Naturally, tragedies will occur and Russia, like any country that finds itself at war, will eventually be accused of killing innocent civilians. Yet these casualties are vastly exacerbated by the fighting techniques of the Ukrainian military, which, it should be emphasized, has been receiving its training from NATO forces since 2014. Time and again, when Russian troops enter a city, they find the enemy fortified behind civilian infrastructure, like hospitals, kindergartens and schools. This automatically turns the facility into a military target for Russian forces, which Ukraine then uses as ‘proof’ that Moscow is deliberately targeting civilians. It’s the oldest trick in the book, used by terrorists, but thanks to the media’s political biases and the Western leaders’ geopolitical interests, that label is now being slapped on the other side in the fight. This month, Amnesty published a report that supports the claim that the Ukrainians are not fighting the fair fight. “Ukrainian forces have put civilians in harm’s way by establishing bases and operating weapons systems in populated residential areas, including in schools and hospitals…,” the human rights group said, much to Kiev’s ire. “We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. “Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law,” she added. Kiev was enraged, with the director of Amnesty Ukraine resigning in protest, and President Vladimir Zelensky calling the organization an “accomplice of Russia” and “a terrorist themselves” – another indication of the label being used as little more than a political smear. Now that we’ve compared and contrasted Russian and American fighting techniques, let’s take a look at Russia’s most vocal European accusers – the Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia. Do they have the necessary street cred to declare Russia – or any country for that matter – a state sponsor of terrorism? As it turns out, Vilnius existed as a vital link in the CIA’s top secret ‘extraordinary rendition’ program – which saw suspected Islamist militants from conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq captured and held in so-called ‘black sites’ outside the US. In windowless and soundproofed rooms on the desolate outskirts of the Lithuanian capital, “one could do whatever one wanted,” said Arvydas Anusauskas, who led a Lithuanian parliamentary investigation into the site in 2010. “What exactly was going on there, we did not determine.” Too bad they didn’t ask Abu Zubaydah, a former guest of the dungeon hideout. In January, the Lithuanian government was ordered to pay Zubaydah, who, like so many other detainees was eventually proven innocent of all charges, €100,000 ($113,319) in compensation for the brutal treatment he suffered at the site. In other words, Vilnius had secretly violated European laws banning torture, which includes beatings, waterboarding, sensory and sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, endless blaring noise and harsh light. Now does Lithuania really sound like the kind of place that should be inducting other countries into the terrorism hall of fame? Probably not. And then there’s Lithuania’s neighbor Latvia, which just can’t shake its Adolf Hitler obsession after nearly a century. Each year, on March 16th, thousands of Latvians parade through the capital Riga, resplendent in their Nazi regalia to pay homage to the homegrown SS divisions that fought in World War II alongside the Nazis – you know, the same characters who were responsible for the untimely death of millions of Jews, Christians and others. I could be wrong, but I’m pretty sure that would qualify Nazi Germany as being a full-blown terrorist state by modern standards, which suggests that Latvia has some explaining to do. But instead, it would rather tear down old Soviet statues while its parliament declares Russia a terrorist state for fighting the same menace. Sorry, it just doesn’t wash.",2.581073494159912,2.1349356190858706,0.44613787507404146,3

According to Russia’s Investigative Committee, the explosive device ripped through the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving in Moscow Region, near the village of Bolshie Vyazemy, on Saturday night. It has been reported that the vehicle belonged to her father. “It has already been established that the explosive was planted under the bottom of the car on the driver's side.

2022-08-21,https://www.rt.com/russia/561135-russia-nato-ukraine-propaganda/,Glenn Diesen: How 'Russophrenia' from supposedly smart people in the West has slowly led us towards a major European war,"The author and holocaust survivor, Victor Klemperer, identified two distinct styles of language that defined Hitler’s propaganda against the Jews: either “scornful derision” of the inferior race or “panic-stricken fear” of their threat to civilisation. Anti-Russian propaganda over the past centuries has similarly produced two contradictory positions – disdain for Russians as an uncivilised and backward people, and simultaneously an immeasurable threat looming over Europe. A state of affairs described by one writer as ""Russophrenia: the idea that Russia is simultaneously about to fall apart, and also take over the world."" Russia is hopelessly inept and weak, yet it is also capable of subverting the democracies of the world and restoring a global empire. Moscow is so impaired that the West does not need to acknowledge or accommodate its basic security interests, yet NATO’s 30 member states need ever-more weapons to defend against the dreaded Russians. Exaggerating the weakness or the strength of an adversary (or both) is a key component of propaganda, which carries with it the obvious risk of miscalculations, as the real capabilities of the opponent are not accurately assessed. The war in Ukraine is a good case study of this phenomenon. To encourage more NATO, more military spending and containment of Russia, it is commonly argued that we have underestimated the threat of the Russians. During the Cold War, it was falsely argued that the Soviets enjoyed a huge positive missile gap vis-à-vis the US, which incentivised further military spending in the US. After the Cold War, NATO expansion and raison d'etre have continued to rely on an exaggerated Russian threat. To encourage a more forceful approach to Russia, it is now argued that we have overestimated Moscow’s strength. Case in point, an article by The Atlantic argues that “Ukraine Has Exposed Russia as a Not-So-Great Power”. It suggests that because the Russian army “has seized only 20 percent of Ukraine,” it is time to shed the illusion of Russia being a great power. This conclusion supports an even more hard-line position towards Russia as opposed to Kissinger’s argument that great powers must be accommodated for peace. In other words, more of the same policies that fuelled tensions and brought us to this horrific conflict. There is no doubt that Russia failed to achieve a swift victory in Ukraine. Russia stormed up to the outskirts of Kiev in the early stages, seeking to impose a settlement. The Russian territorial advances seemed very impressive and coincided with the narrative of an all-mighty Russia. In reality, these positions relied on thin and vulnerable supply lines. With the failure of achieving a diplomatic settlement with Kiev, these positions had to be abandoned. The UK and the US persuaded Kiev to abandon the peace talks in Istanbul, and the nature of the fighting subsequently changed fundamentally. The collective West promised it would provide all the weapons required if Ukraine would end negotiations and fight Russia. Washington stipulated its objective of permanently weakening Russia and knocking it down from the table of great powers. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin explicitly announced that American aims included getting “Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things it has done in invading Ukraine”. This objective is consistent with the goals set by the renowned intelligence-linked think tank RAND Corporation in 2019, which is to overextend and take down Moscow: “The Ukrainian military already is bleeding Russia in the Donbass region (and vice versa). Providing more U.S. military equipment and advice could lead Russia to increase its direct involvement in the conflict and the price it pays for it”. The Russian hope of a swift victory was thus replaced with a war of attrition, in which Moscow aimed to grind down and destroy the Ukrainian army – before imposing a settlement. The breaking point has now been reached, as evident by the current collapse of Ukraine’s most heavily fortified positions in Maryinka, Pisky and Avviivka. This will likely end in August or September, and then shift towards more rapid territorial conquest. Is it strategically wise to deny this reality to sell the narrative of a weak Russia? The narrative of an inept, exhausted and demoralised Russian military that has almost run out of ammunition has persisted since March. Yet, there is an even wider problem with the narrative of Russia not being able to defeat its weak neighbour. In reality, NATO has also indirectly gone to war against Russia. US Brigadier General Joseph E. Hilbert argued that “the worst thing the Russians did was give us eight years to prepare.” Furthermore, the collective West has supplied increasingly advanced weapons since Russia invaded in February 2022. American political scientist John Mearsheimer defines a great power by its “reasonable prospect of defending itself against the leading state in the system by its own efforts.” It appears that Russia has passed that test as the collective West has now thrown everything but the kitchen sink in terms of supplying military hardware, military intelligence, and economic sanctions. The collective West has depleted a large part of its weapons storage in a futile effort to stop Russian advances on the battlefield. This is despite the fact that Russia is only fighting with its peacetime army of 200,000 troops against a Ukrainian army several times this size. The 3:1 rule of war stipulates that in order that for the attacker to win the battle, his forces should be at least three times the force of the defender. In Ukraine, this ratio is reversed with 1:3 in Ukraine’s favour. Russia’s 2 million reserve soldiers and much of its more advanced weapons are kept as backup in case NATO directly enters the war. The collective West has launched unprecedented economic sanctions with the explicit expectation that it would immediately collapse the Russian economy, financial system and currency. This never happened and the Russian ruble is the strongest performing currency this year. Instead, the sanctions have backfired so spectacularly, to the extent that the West has set fire to its own house in the hope it would spread to Moscow. The attempt to mobilise the international community against Russia has also failed, as 85% of the world population live in countries that have refused to participate in sanctions – despite pressure and threats from the US. Even the pope pointed to NATO expansionism as a source of the war. Denying that Russia is a great power may feel good, but as stated by Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu more than 2,500 years ago: “There is no greater danger than underestimating your opponent”. Wishful thinking about Russian weakness incentivises the collective West to escalate, while diplomacy and a peace agreement become increasingly difficult and unfavourable. Before February 2014, Russia’s main policy towards Ukraine was to preserve it as a neutral state, a bridge between East and West. After the Western-supported regime change and support for an “anti-terrorist operation” against Donbass, Russia demanded autonomy for Donbass. As the US sabotaged the Minsk peace agreement, which was aimed at delivering autonomy, for seven years, the Kremlin switched to pushing for Donbass independence. Once the US began sending advanced weapons to Ukraine with the explicit aim of permanently weakening Russia, Moscow expanded its territorial claims to counter this threat. The anti-Russia sanctions have been exhausted, and have backfired terribly. There is now a recognition that the measures have been a spectacular failure, as Western economies crumble while Moscow is shifting its economic connectivity to the East. Russia’s economic dependence on the West has been a source of great influence, but this leverage is dwindling and is not coming back. The desire to depict Russia as feeble is required as NATO insists it must negotiate from a position of strength. But isn’t this the source of the problems? For 30 years, NATO negotiated against a weaker Moscow, and the result was that the US-led bloc could act unilaterally and ignore Russian security interests. By abandoning pan-European security agreements, pan-European security collapsed. We have been moving slowly towards a major European war for 30 years and there are no good solutions anymore. But an end to wishful thinking must be the beginning.",3.282626689816355,3.2241823787718884,0.05844431104446679,8

Darya Dugina, 29, has been officially confirmed as the victim of the explosion outside the Russian capital, the agency said in a statement. According to investigators, a blast ripped through her Toyota Land Cruiser at around 9pm local time on Saturday as she was driving near the village of Bolshie Vyazemy in Moscow Region. It is thought an explosive device detonated inside the vehicle, which then caught fire. “The female driver, who was behind the wheel, has been killed on site,” the Investigative Committee said. A journalist and political commentator, Dugina was the daughter of philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, who is often painted in the West as the ideologist of President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy over the past decade. However, in Russia, Dugin is viewed as a relatively marginal figure due to his often extreme anti-Western and ‘neo-Eurasian’ views. The 60-year-old has never been officially endorsed by the Kremlin. On Saturday, he was giving a lecture at family festival called 'Tradition', with his daughter in attendance. Some reports suggest that Dugin initially planned to leave the event in the same car with his daughter, but later changed his plans. Russian writer and political activist Zakhar Prilepin, who also attended the festival, hinted that Ukraine could be behind the bombing. “They do things like this. They’ve crossed the line long ago,” he wrote on Telegram, noting the assassination of the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, in 2018, which was blamed on Kiev, and other high-profile bomb attacks in Donbass in recent years. “This comedy idol, this sleepy man in a T-shirt – he greenlights such actions,” Prilepin said in an apparent reference to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who was a comedian before turning to politics. Judging from his post, the writer believes that Dugin, not his daughter, was the real target of the attackers.

The incident took place on a highway 20km west of Moscow at around 9:35pm local time, with witnesses saying the blast occurred in the middle of the road, scattering debris all around. The car, which was engulfed in flames, then crashed into a fence, according to photos and videos from the scene. The emergency services said one person was inside the car and was instantly killed by the blast – a female whose body was reportedly burned beyond recognition. The authorities have yet to officially confirm the identity of the victim, but multiple Russian Telegram channels and media sources reported that the victim was Darya Dugina (Platonova), 29. Her father, Aleksandr Dugin, was spotted at the scene soon after the incident, visibly shocked, according to several videos circulating on social media. WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE Preliminary reports suggested that a home-made explosive device might have been involved, but investigators have yet to confirm the cause of the blast or any potential motive. Earlier on Saturday evening, Dugin was giving a lecture on ‘Tradition and History’ at a family festival in Moscow Region. His daughter was in attendance. Unconfirmed reports say Dugin initially planned to leave the festival with her but later decided to take a separate car, while Darya took his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. Dugina was a political commentator and daughter of the veteran Russian philosopher, known for his staunch anti-Western and ‘neo-Eurasian’ views. Western media has painted Dugin as a driving force behind President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy over the past decade. In recent months, CBS dubbed him “the far-right theorist behind Putin’s plan,” while the Washington Post called him a “far-right mystical writer who helped shape Putin’s view of Russia.” In Russia, the supposed shadowy puppet master is largely considered to be a marginal figure. While he has served as an adviser to several politicians, Dugin never enjoyed official endorsement from the Kremlin. In 2014, he was fired from his position at Moscow State University, after critics interpreted his call to “kill, kill, kill” those behind massacres in Ukraine, such as the Odessa tragedy, as a call for a genocide against Ukrainian people. The US think tank RAND Corporation wrote in 2017 that despite Western media reports of Dugin’s alleged “ties and connections” to the Russian leadership, he is “perhaps best thought of as an extremist provocateur with some limited and peripheral impact than as an influential analyst with a direct impact on policy.”",1.911012286261539,3.50927782530399,-1.598265539042451,0

Traces of Botulinum toxin Type B, which is an “organic poison of artificial origin,” have been discovered in samples taken from the servicemen, the ministry said, accusing Kiev of “chemical terrorism.” The Russian troops were “hospitalized with signs of severe poisoning” after being stationed near the village of Vasilyevka in Zaporozhye Region on July 31, the statement said. “The Zelensky regime has authorized terrorist attacks with the use of toxic substances against Russian personnel and civilians” following a string of military defeats in Donbass and other areas, the ministry insisted. Moscow plans to send laboratory tests from the soldiers to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Botulinum toxin, often called the “miracle poison,” is one of the most toxic biological substances known to science. Produced by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria, it blocks the release of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, causing muscle paralysis. Botulinum toxin Type A has been used in medicine in small doses in recent decades, especially to treat disorders characterized by overactive muscle movement. It’s also well known in cosmetology under its shortened name, Botox. However, Botulinum toxin poses a major threat as a bioweapon due its ease of production and distribution, and the high fatality rate resulting from poisoning.

Shoigu also expressed alarm that the results of the Nuremberg trials detailing crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis are being reassessed in a number of countries, especially in the Baltic region. “SS legionnaires’ marches have become a tradition in Estonia and Latvia; monuments and obelisks are being erected in honor of war criminals. Nazi slogans are openly proclaimed in the streets of Lithuanian cities,” he said. The defense minister recalled that fascist regimes came to power in many European countries in the 1930s, including Germany, where the Nazi ideology proved to be the most radical and expansionist form of fascism. He also underlined that international capital was instrumental in Nazis’ ascent to power. “It is abundantly clear that the financial and economic cooperation between the Anglo-American and Nazi business circles was one of the main factors that led to the Second World War,” Shoigu said, adding that the Soviet Union was the country that had borne the brunt of Nazi aggression. On this point, the minister noted that “history lessons had been poorly learned by those who rely on their own strength and commit violence.” “The bombing campaign on Yugoslavia, the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, cultivating terrorist structures in Syria – specific authors and actors always stand behind all these and similar crimes. The responsibility for such actions and their consequences rests entirely on the leadership of the United States and NATO,” he stated. Shoigu’s comments followed a decision by the Estonian government on Tuesday to remove several Soviet-era war memorials in Ida-Viru County, including a historic T-34 tank in the provincial capital of Narva. This monument has been a flash point for tensions between Estonia’s nationalistic government and the city’s Russian community. Many Tallinn officials view Soviet memorials as a reminder of a historical period that they consider to have been an occupation, while others see them as a symbol of the sacrifices made during World War II and the victory over Nazi Germany. Estonia recently barred most Russian citizens with Schengen visas issued by the Baltic nation from entering the country, while Finland announced this week that it would be cutting the number of entry visas available to Russians by half.",2.562876003015333,3.9178064513932727,-1.3549304483779396,3

The Kraken volunteer unit was formed in February by veterans of the Azov Regiment, which is known for welcoming fighters with openly nationalist and neo-Nazi views into its ranks.

Former Ukrainian president Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

The low-flying UAV was spotted approaching the city from the bay, but was only shot down once it was above the headquarters. The drone crashed into the roof of the building and caught fire, Razvozhayev said on Telegram, adding that the work of Russia’s air defenses allowed damage from the indecent to be minimized. The governor said there were no casualties or significant damage resulting from the attack, which he blamed on Ukraine. Footage uploaded on social media shows plumes of thick black smoke coming from the roof of the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. The HQ was struck by a drone in late July, leaving six people wounded and prompting the cancellation of Navy Day celebrations in Sevastopol.

The Crimean governor’s aide, Oleg Kryuckov, said on Telegram that the aim of the ongoing drone attacks was “not military, but psychological” as the UAVs only carry a small payload of explosives, unable to cause extensive damage. He advised the population to stay clam and report any suspicious activity to the authorities. There were also several reports of air defenses being activated in various part of Crimea over incoming UAVs on Friday.

Crimea is under reliable protection,” an adviser to the head of the region, Oleg Kryuchkov, wrote on his Telegram channel. An explosion in the sky, followed by a trace of smoke, can be seen in the footage circulating online. Some outlets speculated that a Ukrainian drone may have been shot down, following yesterday’s news that an unmanned aerial vehicle had been intercepted by air-defense systems in the vicinity of the Belbek airfield in Sevastopol, Crimea’s largest city. Air-defense systems were also activated in the city of Kerch, near the Crimean Bridge. The reports came after Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov said Kiev’s pledge not to attack Russian territory with Western-provided weapons would not apply to Crimea, which was later confirmed to Politico by an unnamed official in US President Joe Biden’s administration.

2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561179-macron-putin-call-ukraine-nuclear/,Macron calls Putin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have had their first phone call in almost three months to discuss the Ukraine conflict and nuclear security in the area of Zaporozhye, the Kremlin said on Friday. The call was initiated by the French side and saw the two leaders discuss “various aspects of the situation around Ukraine,” according to the Kremlin’s readout. Putin emphasized that “the systematic shelling of the territory of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant by the Ukrainian military poses a danger of a large-scale disaster that could lead to radiation spillover onto a large territory,” Moscow said. The two leaders agreed that a mission under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be dispatched to the NPP “as soon as possible” in order to assess the situation on site. “The Russian side confirmed it’s ready to provide the Agency’s inspectors with all the necessary assistance,” the Kremlin said. According to the Elysee Palace, Putin agreed that the IAEA mission to Zaporozhye NPP would be dispatched on the terms already arranged by Ukraine and the United Nations. This would mean that the IAEA delegation might travel via the territory currently controlled by Kiev’s forces. Previously, Moscow insisted that such a mission could arrive only via Russian-controlled territory. The two sides will address this issue again in the coming days, after technical teams discuss the matter in detail, the Elysee said. According to the Kremlin, Putin once again invited international experts to visit a detention facility in Yelenovka, in the Donetsk People’s Republic. An artillery attack on the prison, which Moscow says was carried out by Kiev’s forces, killed 50 Ukrainian POWs and injured dozens more last month. Putin also informed his French counterpart on the implementation of the deal for Ukrainian grain exports via the Black Sea. This agreement, which was brokered by the UN and Turkey, is also supposed to allow Russia to deliver fertilizers and food products to the global markets. However, the Kremlin noted, “obstacles for the Russian grain [export] persist,” which continues to have an adverse effect on global food security. The most recent call between the two leaders took place on May 28 and also involved German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. During that conversation, Putin blamed Ukraine for the stalled peace talks, assuring his counterparts that Moscow remained ready to negotiate an end to the ongoing conflict and condemning the West for supplying Kiev with weapons.",4.232283176040462,2.2345191041371337,1.9977640719033283,9
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/news/561162-us-ukraine-party-conflict/,US on verge of directly joining Ukrainian conflict – Moscow,"Washington’s continued support for Kiev during Moscow’s military operation has put the US on the verge of becoming party to the Ukrainian conflict, Russia’s deputy Foreign Minister, Sergey Ryabkov has said. “We don't want escalation. We’d like to avoid a situation, in which the US becomes a party to the conflict, but so far we don’t see any readiness of the other side to take these warnings seriously,” Ryabkov told Rossiya 1 TV channel on Friday. Moscow rejects Washington's explanation, that providing Ukraine with weapons and other aid is justified by Kiev’s right to self-defense, he pointed out. “Excuse me, what kind of self-defense is it if they are already openly talking about the possibility of attacking targets deep in the Russian territory, in Crimea?” the deputy FM wondered. According to Ryabkov, such statements are being made by the Ukrainian side “not just under the blind eye of the US and NATO, but with the encouragement of this kind of sentiment, approaches, plans and ideas directly from Washington,” Ryabkov insisted. “The ever more obvious and deeper involvement in Ukraine in terms of countering our military operation, in fact, puts this country, the US, on the verge of turning into a party to the conflict,” he reiterated. The US has been the strongest supporter of Kiev amid its conflict with Russia, providing Kiev with billions of dollars in military and financial aid, as well as intelligence data. Washington’s deliveries to the Ukrainian military have included such sophisticated hardware as HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, M777 howitzers and combat drones. Reuters reported on Friday that US President Joe Biden is about to announce another lethal aid package for Kiev of around $800 million. An unnamed official from the Biden administration told Politico on Thursday that the White House had no problem with Ukraine attacking Crimea, which became part of Russia after a 2014 referendum staged in response to a violent coup. The US believes that Kiev can strike any target on its territory, and “Crimea is Ukraine,” the American official insisted. There have recently been a number of explosions near a Russian ammunition depot and at a military airfield in Crimea, which the Defense Ministry said were acts of “sabotage.” However, Ukrainian authorities haven’t officially confirmed involvement in the attacks. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",3.9062046446663894,4.088317487860848,-0.1821128431944583,2

The decision, which Helsinki announced on Tuesday, “fits the pattern of the Russophobic campaign in certain EU nations, which was initiated by the Baltic states,” Ivan Nechaev said during a daily briefing on Thursday. He added that the Russian government was also aware that visa restrictions could be imposed on its citizens by the EU. The possible move was confirmed by European Commission spokesperson Anitta Hipper this week. Russia considers such actions to be evidence that Finland and rest of the EU “are reneging on their international obligations” for the sake of “politically motivated discrimination against Russians,” Nechaev said. “Such steps shall not be left without due reaction by the Russian side,” he added. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky called on Kiev’s allies to restrict the access of Russian citizens to their nations in retaliation for Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. He also suggested they should deport Russian nationals, including those who are critical of Moscow’s policies. All Russian citizens share collective responsibility for their government’s actions, he argued in an interview with the Washington Post earlier this month. After facing criticism over the remark, Zelensky said Russians concerned for their safety in their home country could apply for political asylum in foreign nations.",3.1632762862169566,2.9452338392387625,0.21804244697819408,8

After Russian forces carried out an assault on Ukraine’s 58th motorized infantry brigade on August 14 near the settlement of Udy in the Kharkov region, the remnants of the formation fled their positions and retreated, ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said. In order to “suppress panic and intimidate the personnel of the Armed forces of Ukraine,” fighters from the neo-Nazi “Kraken” regiment “demonstratively executed 100 servicemen of the 58th motorized infantry brigade who abandoned their positions” near Udy, the official said. The “Kraken” regiment describes itself as a special reconnaissance and sabotage unit under the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, operating separately from the Armed Forces. Moscow considers it to be an offshoot of the notorious neo-Nazi “Azov” regiment which suffered a crushing defeat in the city of Mariupol back in May. Russia’s Defense Ministry has accused the battalion of committing several war crimes since the beginning of the conflict, and believes it to be responsible for brutally mistreating Russian POWs. While there is no information on how many fighters the “Kraken” regiment has, some estimates suggest it is about 1,800 soldiers strong, most of whom are Azov veterans and volunteers. Over the course of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense has regularly reported the elimination of hundreds of fighters from the “Kraken” regiment as well as from other nationalist divisions. In its Friday update, Russia’s MoD reported destroying temporary deployment points of the “Azov” and “Aidar” formations near the city of Soledar in the Donetsk People’s Republic, and claimed to have eliminated over 50 neo-Nazi fighters as well as 12 units of military equipment.",3.3907176075406773,4.223068154831087,-0.8323505472904098,2
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561147-iaea-mission-ukraine-september/,Moscow comments on timeline for nuclear inspection of Zaporozhye NPP,"The UN nuclear watchdog could send an inspection team to the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in Ukraine in as soon as two weeks, a senior Russian diplomat said on Friday. “Forecasts don’t always come true, but my sense is that it can happen in early September,” Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s permanent envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said during a media briefing. The Russian diplomat stressed that the proposed timeline is conditional on non-interference by “external factors that have nothing to do with the goals of the IAEA visit.” The mission should have been launched in June, he explained, but the plan failed, and “in a sense, things have to be done from scratch now.” The Zaporozhye plant is located in the Ukrainian city of Energodar, and is controlled by Russian troops, although its civilian operators are Ukrainian. Over the past month, it has come under a series of attacks, which Russia has blamed on Ukrainian forces. Kiev has denied responsibility and accused Russia of shelling the nuclear site to discredit Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have also claimed that Russia is using the plant as a military base, keeping heavy weapons on site and carrying out artillery strikes against Ukrainian troops from the facility. The Russian Defense Ministry has said the only Russian forces present at the plant are lightly armed guards. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has said he wants to personally lead a fact-finding mission to the Zaporozhye plant. Both Moscow and Kiev have expressed their support for such a visit, despite near-daily reports of shelling in Energodar. “It appears that the Ukrainans are trying to prevent the mission from happening,” Ulyanov said during the briefing. The UN previously suggested that the entire area around the city should be demilitarized, but Russia insisted the proposal was not viable, claiming that Ukrainian forces cannot be trusted to abide by such an agreement. By withdrawing forces from Energodar, Russia would expose the nuclear power plant to increased risks, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.",4.167704521948856,2.9879554632630154,1.1797490586858408,9
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561146-us-doomed-eu-russia-cold-hunger/,US has doomed EU to hunger and cold – Russia,"The United States has doomed the EU to hunger, cold and isolation by pressuring the bloc to cut its ties with Moscow, Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said on Friday. He wrote on Telegram that Washington would “stop at nothing to cling to its power over the world as it throws under the bus the citizens’ welfare and the economies of European countries to achieve this end.” He noted that natural gas in the US costs $333 per 1,000 cubic meters. “At the same time, Washington sells it to Europe for a price which is 7.3 [times] higher, rendering the EU economy uncompetitive,” he wrote, adding that the eurozone’s annual inflation rate had hit a record 8.9%. Volodin said Europe had been hit by a heatwave that triggered huge problems in the agriculture sector, as well as an energy crisis which had seen prices soar six times in one year. The EU’s decision to phase out Russian energy supplies and cut economic ties with Moscow “have been made under Washington’s pressure,” the State Duma speaker claimed. “US policies in Europe are enforced by England that has left the EU high and dry, as well as by a number of countries that are sovereign in name only – Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Ukraine – with Poland, the Czech Republic and Finland joining this Russophobic coalition in the hopes of getting an American handout,” Volodin wrote. His comments come as the EU is plagued by an energy crisis due to rising global prices. Earlier this month, the bloc approved a plan that would see its member states reduce gas consumption by 15% in a bid to tackle the crisis. Another factor that has exacerbated the energy crunch was the EU’s decision to wean itself off natural gas from Russia, as the bloc considers these supplies to be unreliable. However, President Vladimir Putin has rejected accusations that Moscow could cut off gas supplies to the EU, stating that Russian energy giant Gazprom is “ready to pump as much as necessary” but that the bloc has “closed everything themselves.”",3.825071973024689,4.102707492130679,-0.2776355191059898,8
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561134-zelensky-deception-image-damaged/,Zelensky faces furious criticism from Ukrainians — WaPo,"Many Ukrainians have been infuriated by an admission, from President Vladimir Zelensky, that he concealed news of the imminent Russian special military operation last spring. That’s according to the Washington Post, where he made the revelation earlier this week. Zelensky’s disclosure that he sacrificed lives to avoid ruining the economy was his first serious communication blunder since the conflict began, the paper said. Before Zelensky seemed “beyond reproach, a national hero” to Ukrainians, the publication said, but the acknowledgment has “punctured the bubble, triggering a cascade of public criticism unprecedented since the war began.” In the interview, Zelensky admitted that prior to the outbreak of hostilities with Russia, he was downplaying US warnings about a looming attack out of fear Ukrainians would flee the country en masse. “If we had communicated that … then I would have been losing $7 billion a month since last October,” he said. Zelensky claimed that this deception of his own people prevented Russia from capturing the country in three days. In late January, Zelensky promised Ukrainians a peaceful year, stating that people would be cooking barbeque during the May holidays, like they always do. The statement came days after he met with CIA Director William Burns, who reportedly laid out in detail Russia’s military plans. Many ordinary Ukrainians and public figures were angered, seeing their president apparently not trusting them to handle the truth. Ukraine could have prepared for the fighting far better, stocking up on food and updating civil defense infrastructure and saving many lives that were lost, critics argued. Some questioned Zelensky’s motives in not informing the public. “He didn’t want to put the country on a military footing because he was afraid of losing power,” journalist Bogdan Butkevich wrote on social media, as cited by the Washington Post. Some of Zelensky’s supporters argued that people could have listened to American officials, who delivered public warnings about the Russian threat, instead of trusting their president, the article read. The newspaper ended the piece with remarks from a Ukrainian woman, who said people should not discuss Zelensky’s admission until after the conflict is over. “Ukraine is winning because of our belief in the president and our armed forces,” she was cited as saying. She believes that Zelensky would face accountability for his action afterwards, because “this is the society we are fighting for.”",3.6117699888357713,4.255696442344846,-0.6439264535090743,5

Rogov claimed at least seven shells hit the Russian-controlled city that hosts the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest such facility in Europe. In a Telegram post, Rogov claimed that heavy artillery fire targeted the city around 10:50pm local time. The Zaporozhye NPP suffered no damage in the strike, local authorities later told Russian media. There were also no immediate reports of any casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres voiced concern about the situation around the nuclear facility earlier on Thursday, during his meeting with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Lviv. While he stopped short of blaming either side, Guterres has once again called to demilitarize the area, insisting that an agreement was “urgently needed” to establish Zaporozhye as a “purely civilian infrastructure” to ensure the plant’s safety. “Common sense must prevail to avoid any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant,” the UN chief said, adding that the facility “must not be used as part of any military operation” and that any damage to the plant would be “suicide.” Moscow has repeatedly called for an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission to the plant, which Guterres said could only happen with Kiev’s approval. Zelensky reiterated on Thursday that any such mission can only take place via Kiev-controlled territory, while calling for an “immediate and unconditional withdrawal” of Russian forces from the area. However, removing Russian troops “would only make the nuclear power plant more vulnerable,” according to Russian Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman, Ivan Nechayev, who on Thursday cited repeated “provocations” from Kiev’s forces and dismissed the idea of a “demilitarized zone” as “unacceptable.” The Russian Defense Ministry also warned on Thursday morning that Ukraine might carry out artillery strikes on the Zaporozhye NPP amid the visit by Guterres and Erdogan – and then accuse Moscow of causing a disaster at the site. Ukraine’s military intelligence responded by saying that Russian forces might stage a nuclear “provocation” in the territory they control. Russian troops took control of the Zaporozhye NPP early on in the course of military operations in Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry denies deploying any heavy weapons at the nuclear site, insisting that only Russian troops at the facility are lightly armed guards providing physical security against “provocations.” Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev of conducting frequent drone and artillery strikes against the nuclear plant and the city of Energodar since mid-July. Kiev has denied responsibility and said Russian forces were attacking the plant to discredit Ukraine, while also claiming that Russia is using the facility as a military base.",2.9200658684046283,3.107958451670233,-0.18789258326560487,9
2022-08-19,https://www.rt.com/russia/561122-vnukovo-moscow-gold-heist/,$13 million gold heist busted at Moscow airport,"An international conspiracy to smuggle 225 kilograms of gold worth an estimated 760 billion rubles (roughly $12.7 million) through Moscow was thwarted by sharp-eyed customs agents, the Federal Customs Service (FTS) of Russia announced on Thursday. The scheme involved two groups of three travelers who swapped suitcases inside Vnukovo Airport. The group, bound for the United Arab Emirates, was caught with a number of gold bars in their bags. The attempted heist took place on August 11, the FTS said in a statement. According to the customs service, three Armenian nationals smuggled the gold into the airport in their carry-on luggage. Since Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, they were not subject to customs controls. Once inside, however, they traded suitcases with a trio of Russian citizens, who had come in with empty baggage. The Russians were en route to Dubai in the UAE. Customs officers monitoring the airport’s security cameras, however, noticed something strange – three passengers dragging their wheeled suitcases with considerable effort. They began following the trio and saw them swapping bags with the other men, proceeding to the gate for their Yerevan flight with much more spring in their step. The customs inspectors decided to do a spot check on the passengers headed to the UAE, who had already boarded their flight. “The smugglers with the valuable cargo were detained by Vnukovo customs operatives after boarding their plane,” the FTS said. After stepping on board and checking the suspects’ bags, customs officers found 45 gold bars, the FTS said in the initial report. None of them had been declared or cleared customs inspection. All had the legally mandated serial numbers and other identification marks. The newspaper Kommersant later reported that the haul amounted to a total of 71 gold bars – 14 ingots of 12kg each and 57 smaller, one-kilo bars. Prosecutors said they intend to charge the group with three felonies, including criminal conspiracy and smuggling of goods designated of strategic importance. A Moscow court ordered the three Armenian nationals jailed until September 11. They were identified as Artak Ayvazyan, Karen Darbinyan and Arman Harutyunyan, officially unemployed. Their attorneys made a motion to keep them under house arrest instead, but the court denied it. The Russian citizens were released pending trial after signing statements that they would not leave Moscow.",3.701802137085141,3.430060838681558,0.27174129840358274,7

Washington won’t stand in the way of attacks on the peninsula “if Kiev deems them necessary,” the outlet reported. Historically Russian, Crimea was part of independent Ukraine from 1991 to 2014 before locals voted to reunify with Moscow. “We don't select targets, of course, and everything we've provided is for self-defense purposes. Any target they choose to pursue on sovereign Ukrainian soil is by definition self defense,” the anonymous official said. Asked by Politico if the Biden administration considered the peninsula sovereign Ukrainian territory, the official said: “Crimea is Ukraine.” Crimea broke away from Ukraine following an armed coup in Kiev in 2014 and voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to join Russia, which was not recognized by the West. A Ukrainian official told the outlet that the ""message of support” from Biden’s administration “had made its way to Kiev."" Politico’s reporting echoes earlier comments by Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov. Reznikov told US government-funded broadcaster Voice of America on Thursday that Kiev’s promise not to attack Russian territory with Western-provided weapons does not cover Crimea – and that Washington had not objected to Ukrainian attacks there. Powerful explosions near a Russian ammunition depot rocked the village of Mayskoye in northeastern Crimea on Tuesday. It was the second such incident in a matter of weeks, with a series of explosions also happening at the Saki military airfield earlier in the month, injuring 14 people and killing one. Russia's Ministry of Defense said the recent strikes were acts of ""sabotage"" and caused damage to civilian objects, including power lines, a power station, a railroad and several residential buildings.

The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561109-ukraine-finland-reconnaissance-satellites/,Ukraine to gain more reconnaissance capabilities,"Finnish satellite maker ICEYE announced on Thursday that it had signed a contract with a Ukrainian charity to provide Kiev with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imaging capabilities. In a statement published on its website, ICEYE said the deal would grant the government in Kiev access to the full capabilities of one of its SAR satellites already in orbit, which is able to capture images on Earth’s surface regardless of the time of day or weather conditions. While the satellite will continue to be operated by ICEYE, the company will also provide Kiev with access to its constellation of SAR satellites for over a year, which will allow Kiev’s forces to receive high resolution radar satellite imagery on “critical locations with a high revisit frequency.” Sergey Prytula, the founder of the Sergey Prytula Charity Foundation that signed the contract with the Finnish satellite maker, said ICEYE’s products are the “most developed radar satellite imaging technology in the world as of today.” Although he did not provide details on how much the deal with ICEYE cost, in a YouTube video announcing the signing of the contract, he noted that it had been paid for using money his charity was gathering for the purchase of Bayraktar drones, which Turkey ended up gifting to Ukraine. According to Prytula, the charity raised over $16 million. “This agreement is a significant step in responding to the government of Ukraine’s urgent request for critical Earth observation data and it will greatly benefit our armed forces,” said Prytula. ICEYE CEO Rafal Modrzewski said he also believed the contract would provide Kiev with “objective data and technological support.” Operating the world’s largest SAR satellite constellation, ICEYE positions itself as the global leader in persistent monitoring via satellite imaging. Founded in 2014, the company has so far deployed some 21 satellites, including both commercial and dedicated customer missions, and claims to be the only organization in the world that offers its clients “rapid delivery of high-precision SAR satellites and data.”",4.111112541520557,2.5514841296850945,1.5596284118354622,3

On Thursday, the planes were relocated to Chkalovsk airfield in Kaliningrad Region as part of “additional strategic deterrence measures,” the ministry explained. During their flight, the Mig-31s worked out interactions with Russian forces stationed in the area, as well as the naval aviation of the Baltic Fleet, it added. The planes will be placed on 24/7 combat duty in Kaliningrad, according to the Defense Ministry. Russia’s neighbor Finland said later on Thursday that the Mig-31s may have violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland as they were heading to their destination. According to the Finnish Defense Ministry, an investigation has been launched into the incident. Kinzhal, which means ‘dagger’ in English, can travel at a speed of Mach 12 (around 14,800kph), while constantly performing evasive maneuvers, which is believed to allow it to penetrate any existing air defenses. Several Kinzhal missiles have been deployed by Russia during the conflict in Ukraine, according to the Defense Ministry. The missile is one of several hypersonic systems developed for the country’s military in recent years, along with the Avangard glider, which is fitted on silo-based ICBMs, and Zircon (Tsirkon) missiles, to be used by the navy. Kaliningrad, which borders Poland and Lithuania, and has access to the Baltic Sea, also hosts nuclear-capable Iskander missiles.",1.819423498731235,3.3961309648433806,-1.5767074661121456,0
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561096-russia-nuclear-arsenal-use/,Russia explains rules for using nuclear weapons,"Russia is a responsible nuclear power and will only use its nuclear arms if attacked with weapons of mass destruction or if its existence is under threat, a spokesman for the country’s foreign ministry has said. Meanwhile, some Western officials argue that nukes can play a role on the battlefield, Ivan Nechaev added. According to Russia’s official nuclear posture, “the use of the nuclear arsenal is possible only in response to an attack as a self-defense measure and in extreme circumstances,” the deputy press secretary of the ministry said during a daily briefing on Thursday. The diplomat was responding to a question about the risk of nuclear escalation in the conflict with Ukraine. Russia is not in the habit of “saber-rattling, especially with nuclear weapons,” he said. Moscow is determined to keep the situation in Ukraine conventional and has no need to use a nuclear option in Ukraine, Nechaev asserted. He lamented that the leaders of Western powers have become far less responsible than their Cold War-era predecessors when it comes to deterrence issues. “The liberal-globalist circles think it possible to discuss lowering the benchmark for the use of nuclear weapons,” he said, citing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as one example. The Russian Defense Ministry has repeatedly reassured that its goals in Ukraine can be achieved without the use of nuclear arms.

2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561091-ukraine-zaporozhye-nuclear-contamination/,Russia warns of another Chernobyl,"Ukraine’s ongoing attacks on the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant may cause a far worse disaster for Europe than the current energy crisis, a Russian Defense Ministry official has warned. Igor Kirillov, who heads Russia’s Nuclear Biological and Chemical Defense Troops, illustrated the likely worst-case scenario of a direct hit on Europe’s largest nuclear plant, during a briefing on Thursday. He showed journalists a map, with plumes of radioactive material from the site reaching Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, Belarus and even Germany. He blamed Ukraine's Western backers for trying to downplay the danger of targeting the atomic plant, and forgetting the lessons of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear incident. According to Kirillov, both disasters involved “the failure of support systems, the disruption of power supply and partial and complete shutdown of the cooling systems, which led to overheating of nuclear fuel and the destruction of the reactor”. The fallout of the Chernobyl disaster affected some 20 countries, while causing 4,000 deaths, a major spike in cancer cases, and the permanent relocation of around 100,000 people. The effects of the Fukushima nuclear incident might seem “insignificant” at first glance, but up to 500,000 people have abandoned their homes because of it, he noted. “Our experts believe that the actions of the Ukrainian armed forces may cause a similar situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant,” Kirillov said. Strikes by the Kiev forces could render the plant’s cooling systems and other support infrastructure inoperable, which would lead “to overheating of the core and, as a result, the destruction of reactor units at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, with the release of radioactive substances into the atmosphere and their spreading for hundreds of kilometers,” he warned. “Such an emergency will cause mass migration of the population and will have more catastrophic consequences than the looming energy crisis in Europe,” the military official added. Moscow has accused Kiev of carrying out 12 attacks on the nuclear facilitity, which provides energy to both Russian- and Ukrainian-controlled areas, since mid-July. Ukraine insists that Russian forces are shelling the site, while accusing them of stationing military hardware at the plant. The Russian side has denied both accusations, while also urging International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts to visit the Zaporozhye facility to see what is actually happening.",2.762420752226159,3.2051837921410313,-0.44276303991487254,9
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561016-russia-relations-north-korea/,No longer a pariah? Russia and China could be about to 'normalize' North Korea and leave the US with another Asian headache,"At beginning of this week the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin had exchanged letters with Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. The report stated both countries had agreed to “expand the(ir) comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”. Matching the anniversary of Korean independence on August 15th, Putin’s outreach comes as Russia seeks new partners away from the West. It also follows reports that North Korean expatriate workers would be assisting in the reconstruction of liberated territories in the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, to which it recently granted diplomatic recognition. But it’s also an indication that the world has changed, significantly. Only a few years ago Russia, as well as China, were at least somewhat willing to cooperate with the United States in imposing sanctions on the DPRK in the bid to curb its nuclear and missile development. That situation no longer exists. The outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, combined with America’s bid to try and contain the rise of China, now means we exist in a multipolar international environment where multiple great powers are competing for influence. This breaks down the space for cooperation over common issues, but also increases the need for strategic thinking among the competitors. In the eyes of Moscow, this makes their calculus concerning North Korea even more important than it was before, drawing parallels to the Cold War era. We should not forget that it was the Soviet Union that enabled the creation of the DPRK in the first place. It was following the closing days of World War II that a strategic contest for influence in East Asia began to emerge between the US and the USSR over the former territories of Imperial Japan. As the Red Army marched south, an agreement was made to divide the Korean Peninsula at the 38th parallel. Although the original agreement was designed only to make the division temporary, geopolitical frictions soon saw it become permanent, and rival Korean states emerged. The US-backed Republic of Korea in the South, and the Soviet- and China-supported Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the North, headed by former Red Army captain and guerrilla fighter Kim Il-sung. The two young nations went to war in 1950, again supported by their respective superpower backers. Active fighting in that conflict ended three years later, but a formal peace agreement has not been signed to this day. And while Koreans on both sides of the divide wish for reunification, the scale of foreign involvement in the 1950s war stands as a reminder the peninsula is seen as a strategically critical landmass linking the continent of mainland Eurasia to the eastern seas. Great powers have always seen it as a chess piece in the bid to dominate North East Asia. This had led to a tug of war which over the centuries has included the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the Russian Empire, the Empire of Japan and the United States, the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union. But for the last three decades, since the end of the original Cold War, North Korea found itself increasingly isolated as China and Russia, for a period of time, both sought ties with the West, as well as the much more lucrative and successful South Korea. US unipolarity meant there was little interest from Moscow or Beijing in opposing America’s wishes to curb Pyongyang’s nuclear trajectory, which it sees as its last hope for regime survival. But now a new paradigm is emerging, and just like in the times of old the DPRK, it’s seen yet again as a strategically indispensable bulwark against American power and military hegemony on Russia’s own border periphery, not least against its US-backed neighbors such as Japan. In such an environment, there is no longer any benefit for Russia in cooperating with the US on the North Korean issue. The horse of “North Korea denuclearization” has long bolted, and instead the presence of a nuclear armed DPRK with ICBM capability is another thorn in Washington’s side, which if removed, only expands US power. Thus, when America demanded another sanctions resolution against North Korea at the UN Security council earlier this year, both Russia and China vetoed it for the first time in over 15 years. It is a sign of the world we live in. Moving on from here, Russia is likely to deepen its military and economic ties with North Korea, primarily because of its strategic and political worth. In this view, history has completed a full circle and as the US shores up its allies to confront Moscow and Beijing, the theme of “bloc politics” re-emerges.",4.197639396620048,3.405427365283632,0.7922120313364154,6

He vented anger at DW on his Facebook page on Wednesday, saying that the German state-funded outlet was a “stooge for Russian propaganda, manipulates quotes and misrepresents the causes and consequences of the Russian aggression against Ukraine.” The post includes several screenshots, of what he sees as DW’s wrongdoing. One of the messages reported an initiative by a Russian political party last month to designate Ukraine “a terrorist state.” Another was from Vogue magazine, which disproved claims that in 1939 it published a glamorous photo of Adolf Hitler and his companion Eva Braun. The theme became popular in Russian social media after the magazine printed images of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenksy and his wife Elena last month, with users comparing the actual photoshoot with the fictional one. Nikolaenko was also apparently unhappy with DW’s coverage of a possible disaster at the Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, a poll on a ban of all Russians from the Schengen zone, and even Zelensky’s statement calling for such a restrictive measure. The Ukrainian diplomat recalled that the German government had banned Russian media outlets like RT from broadcasting in the country, adding: “We are calling on our German partners to react to the narratives of the Russian propaganda, which are being spread in the DW content.”",3.9529804814358522,3.513989138760065,0.43899134267578743,3

Ukraine received AGM-88 HARM missiles as part of the most recent weapons delivery from Washington. US Under Secretary of Defense Colin Kahl confirmed the shipment of anti-radiation air-launched missiles during an August 8 briefing. Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov mentioned receiving such weapons from the US in an interview last week. Neither official identified the weapon system by name, but debris reportedly found this month on the ground in Ukraine points to the specific model. The AGM-88 HARM, which has been in service since the mid-1980s, is designed to home in on strong radiation produced by ground radar systems. These weapons are usually launched to disable enemy air defenses ahead of a raid. In the Ukrainian conflict, it is likely to have only “a limited impact,” considering its nature, defense writer Michael Peck said in the BI article. Ukraine doesn’t have that many warplanes, he pointed out, so “shutting down Russian air-defense radars won’t necessarily translate into more success for Ukrainian aircraft.” The type of missile is, in many ways, “a psychological weapon,” but Ukraine could potentially use them against Russian radars used for counter-artillery warfare, Peck said. Artillery battles have been the deciding factor in the conflict so far, and Kiev has repeatedly complained about being completely outgunned as it asked for increased support from the US and its allies.",2.7315645227475627,2.8329960781388026,-0.10143155539123994,7

The predicted attack will be timed to coincide with the ongoing visit to Ukraine by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Moscow insisted. An official said they had detected the movements of Ukrainian troops, indicating a looming “provocation.” Kiev has deployed units trained in responding to the use of weapons of mass destruction, pre-positioning them to report a radiation leak and demonstrate a purported action to mitigate it, Russian military spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. The ministry said it expects a Ukrainian artillery unit to attack the plant on Friday from the city of Nikopol. “The blame for the consequences [of the strike] will be attributed to the Russian armed forces,” the statement said. In a separate statement on Thursday, Igor Kirillov, who heads Russia’s Nuclear Biological and Chemical Defense Troops, said his directorate has modeled possible scenarios for a disaster at the Zaporozhye plant. A plume of radioactive materials from the site may reach Poland, Slovakia and Germany, he warned. Russia has accused Ukraine of conducting frequent drone and artillery strikes against the nuclear power plant in the city of Energodar over the past few weeks. Kiev has denied responsibility and said Russian forces were attacking the plant to discredit Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have also claimed that Russia is using the Zaporozhye facility as a military base. During the briefing, Konashenkov denied Ukrainian claims that Russia has deployed heavy weapons at the Zaporozhye plant and is attacking Ukrainian troops from the site. The only Russian troops at the facility are lightly armed guards providing physical security, the official said.

In April, the Russian military estimated their numbers at nearly 7,000. However, last month it said that only 2,741 foreign fighters remained in Ukraine. Many of them were killed, while others fled to their home countries and later complained about chaos in the ranks of the Kiev forces, and a lack of arms and other equipment.

Russia will do its best to facilitate it,” Igor Vishnevetsky, the deputy foreign minister for arms control, said during a Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty conference on Wednesday. The inspection was supposed to happen sometime ago, he added, but was derailed “not due to a fault of ours.” The diplomat pointed the finger at Ukraine, saying that its regular attacks on the nuclear site was why it was not safe for IAEA monitors to visit it. “People should not attack nuclear sites, should not use artillery or other weapons against nuclear power plants,” Vishnevetsky stressed. “The Ukrainian side knows it very well, and nevertheless does it, effectively committing acts of nuclear terrorism.” The Ukrainian power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, comes under regular artillery shelling. One projectile this week reportedly struck ten meters from a container holding spent nuclear fuel. Kiev denies carrying out the strikes and claims that Russian troops are shelling the plant to discredit Ukraine. It also accused Russia of stationing its military forces at the Zaporozhye plant.

2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561062-nord-stream-antonov-victory/,Russia names main victim of US energy ‘victory’,"Western Europe’s current woes with natural gas supplies are due to US pressure to block the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from coming online, the Russian ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov claimed in a TV interview on Wednesday. With this move, he said, the US won a victory not so much over Russia, but over much of European industry, which now has to rely on far more expensive American “molecules of freedom.” “No matter how much Washington tries to present Russia as an unreliable supplier, this is not true,” Antonov told Russia-24 in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. “The problems of our buyers began solely as a result of sanctions and restrictions imposed or inspired by the US,” the ambassador added. “We are ready to sell to everyone who needs inexpensive and high-quality resources.” He cited the example of Nord Stream 2, the pipeline under the Baltic Sea that was supposed to deliver natural gas from Russia to Germany. It was completed last year but Berlin halted its certification in February – prior to the escalation of hostilities in Ukraine – and refused to make it operational despite appeals from German industry and local officials to do so. “The pipeline was ready to launch and could solve almost all the supply problems that arose with [Nord Stream 1] due to the sanctions confusion,” Antonov said. “The only thing missing is political will, the EU states just need to press the button and the pipeline will start working. But in the EU capitals they gave in to persistent pressure from the White House. As a result, a bet was made on expensive LNG.” Liquefied natural gas is exported by the US in quantities nowhere near sufficient for the European market. Antonov made a pointed reference to the US Department of Energy calling it “molecules of freedom” back in 2019. Nord Stream 2 was a victory for Washington, which “struck a massive blow not so much against Russia, but against European competitiveness,” Antonov said. Addressing reports that the US and its allies are trying to impose a price cap on Russian oil and gas exports, Antonov predicted that such attempts would backfire, as there would be a realignment of commodity markets “not in favor of Western countries.” “US attempts to divide the energy markets into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ leads to destabilization, rising fuel prices and inflation,” Antonov said.",3.504118573035428,1.4985974028868918,2.005521170148536,7
2022-08-18,https://www.rt.com/russia/561061-ambassador-us-relations-crumbs/,Moscow’s envoy picks over ‘crumbs’ of Russia-US relations,"Relations between Washington and Moscow are at an “unprecedented” low, making it practically impossible to resolve many issues that impact the entire world, the Russian ambassador to the US said on Wednesday in a TV interview. The Washington establishment and the media are overwhelmingly Russophobic, unlike the American public in general, ambassador Anatoly Antonov told the news channel Russia-24. “The situation is unfortunate. I would like to describe it otherwise, but I can't. Everything that has been built up in recent years has been destroyed,” Antonov said in the interview, aired on Wednesday evening. “It seemed like two years ago we were talking about a difficult relationship, when we had the Trump administration here kicking out Russian diplomats and seizing our property.” But ever since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, relations between Moscow and Washington have degraded to a point where Russian nationals, even those living in the US, are subjected to discrimination, intimidation and harassment, Antonov said. Antonov described Russian-American political dialogue as “paralyzed” to the detriment of even those areas where the two countries have mutual interests. The first contact Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken had in six months was a phone call at the end of July. Of our interactions, only crumbs remain. The few remaining areas of interaction amount to a deconfliction hotline in Syria, some work on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and to some extent peaceful space exploration. “Unfortunately, this is all I can name today,” Antonov said, adding that Russia is firmly convinced that without direct interaction, it’s impossible to solve not just bilateral problems but issues that affect the entire world. Russophobia currently dominates major American cities, but as one gets further from Washington, there is “less interest in European affairs and more questions about why the US is feuding with Russia in difficult economic times,” according to Antonov. “Unfortunately, cultural, scientific, and educational ties have been severed. Mentions of our country's role in World War II are also being erased,” he added. While Americans are slowly growing tired of anti-Russian rhetoric and are more interested in their everyday problems, according to the ambassador, there is a long way to go before the current hostility can be overcome. Antonov claimed that US “political circles do not like our desire to create a new international order.” The Kremlin demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc, after recognizing the Donbass republics as independent states over Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements. Ukraine insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked, even as its former president admitted that for Kiev the main goal of the Germany- and France-brokered protocols, first signed in 2014, was to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.”",2.924683985339248,1.796944113221411,1.1277398721178369,8

Tweeting about the lawsuit on Wednesday, Navalny called on the US, EU and UK to impose more sanctions on Deripaska and Lavrov. The opposition blogger is currently in prison for a series of transgressions, from defrauding a French company and donors to his political campaigns, to contempt of court. He claims to be a victim of political persecution by President Vladimir Putin’s government. “Putin crook is suing,” Navalny tweeted in Russian, posting a redacted photo of the court summons. He said Deripaska was demanding the removal of photos and videos depicting him with Lavrov in Japan, among other things. Deripaska’s lawyer Alexei Melnikov told the outlet RBK that his client has indeed filed a defamation lawsuit. “Based on the published photograph of the plaintiff with Foreign Minister Lavrov, completely unacceptable allegations were made about various crimes, in particular, with arguments about corruption, bribery and lobbying,” Melnikov said. In addition to Navalny, the lawsuit names his associates Georgy Alburov and Maria Pevchikh, as well as The Insider, the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, and Associated Newspapers Limited, the parent company of the Daily Mail. Pevchikh told RBK that Deripaska demanded not only the deletion of their “investigative report,” but also a video rebuttal, saying he would demand 50 million rubles (around $825,000) a day in damages until this is done. She added she did not intend to comply with his demands. Navalny seemed to suggest that the verdict before the Zelenograd court will be a foregone conclusion, tweeting, “I have no doubts about the ability of Putin's oligarch to convince Putin's court.” He also called on the US, EU and the UK to “introduce really effective sanctions against these thieves and accomplices of war” and make sure they can’t “bribe politicians and journalists” in the West to “launder their image.” Deripaska has sued Navalny for defamation before, winning a judgment in November 2021. Earlier this week, the aluminum magnate sued another Russian billionaire, banker Oleg Tinkov, demanding two billion rubles ($35 million) in compensation over an Instagram post in which Tinkov called him “an oligarch and a thief.”",3.4882001755537013,2.39604380066763,1.0921563748860712,5
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/561049-embassy-latvia-soviet-reparations/,Russia warns EU state over Soviet debt,"The Russian embassy in Riga has poked fun at Latvian media reports that a state commission is working on establishing “damages” from the Soviet “occupation” of the Baltic state, which is now a member of the EU and NATO. If Latvians really wanted reparations from occupiers, they shouldn’t give a pass to Poland, Sweden or the Teutonic Order, the embassy joked on Wednesday. It also warned that Riga could end up owing Russia money after they tally all the Soviet investments in its infrastructure and industry. According to statements in some local media, the “commission on accounting of damages from the Soviet occupation” is soon expected to present a report on alleged financial losses Latvia suffered between 1940 and 1991, the embassy said. “We never cease to be surprised at the selectivity of Latvian officials. After all, a fair accounting would also take into consideration the losses from the occupation of Latvian land by the German crusaders, the [Polish-Lithuanian] Commonwealth and Sweden,” the Russian diplomats said, noting that this accounts for more than 500 years of foreign rule. If the commission tallied up the entire housing, transport, communication, port and industrial infrastructure built from scratch in the Latvian Soviet Republic, the embassy added, “Latvia would end up with a bill to pay instead!” Imperial Russia ruled the territory of present-day Latvia from 1795 to 1920, developing Riga into the empire’s largest port. Some 40,000 men served in the Latvian Rifles, an elite imperial infantry corps, during the First World War. The majority joined the Bolshevik revolution, with one of their officers, Colonel Jukums Vacietis, becoming the first commanding general of the Red Army. Though they played a key role in winning the Russian civil war for the Reds, the Latvian Rifles lost the war in their own home province to a coalition of German, Polish and Estonian troops. In 1920, the Bolshevik government signed the Treaty of Riga, recognizing an independent Latvia. In August 1940, however, a pro-Soviet government made a bid for admission into the USSR. During the Second World War, Latvia was occupied by Nazi Germany. Two Waffen-SS units, the 15th and 19th grenadiers, were raised as the Latvian Legion. Around 10,000 of them continued to wage guerrilla war against the USSR until 1956, calling themselves “Forest Brothers.” Latvia declared independence in August 1991, and to this day denies citizenship to ethnic Russians living in its territory.",3.6375186463724023,1.7019731008537111,1.9355455455186912,4

Due to his athletic physique, some online commentators compared Andrey Fesik to ‘GigaChad,’ a popular internet meme, representing an ultra-masculine male. Fesik’s leap to fame came earlier this month when a poster prepared for his campaign was uploaded online. It featured a topless photo of the muscled candidate and a slogan promising that the city is going to be in firm hands if he’s elected on September 11. The 35-year-old bodybuilder, who’s employed as a trainer at a local gym, is running for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR). The party, which is often described as ultra-nationalist and populist, currently holds 21 seats in the Russian parliament. The LDPR has been around since the early 1990s, and was led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who passed away earlier this year due to complications from Covid-19.

While she did not provide any details of his death, she denied earlier reports that the 52-year-old businessman had committed suicide. On Tuesday, journalist Yuniya Pugacheva announced on her Telegram channel that Rapoport had killed himself, but not before apparently letting his dog out into a park along with some money and a suicide note attached. The journalist also claimed she had seen Rapoport in a London bar in May surrounded by young women and suggested that his wife had left him. “There were no letters, no suicide, no trip to London and no divorce,” Rapoport’s widow told the RBK news outlet, adding that she was supposed to meet her husband in the US. “We had plans, he had planned meetings, other plans... Dan evacuated us from Kiev and returned to Ukraine to help the country. We were supposed to meet later in the US,” she said. Rapaport was born in Riga, Latvia. In the 1980s his family emigrated to the US but after the fall of the USSR in 1991 he went to Moscow to become an investment banker. In 2007 he co-founded the Soho Rooms club which became one of the most popular nightclubs in the Russian capital, often frequented by the rich and famous. After publicly throwing his support behind Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Rapoport left Russia in 2012 and moved back to the US with his then-wife Irina and two children. He lived in Washington DC until 2016 before splitting up with his fiance and selling their mansion to Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka for $5.5 million. Since then he had been living in Kiev with his second wife Alena, with whom he had a daughter. Five years ago, Sergey Tkachenko - another co-founder of the Soho Rooms - was found dead after seemingly jumping out of the window of his apartment in central Moscow.",2.4589595830167497,2.77594003929538,-0.3169804562786305,5
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/561023-russia-alcoholism-putin-advice/,Putin gives advice on tackling alcoholism,"The government should promote healthy alternatives to excessive alcohol consumption rather than adopting restrictive policies, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. “You cannot prohibit it or impose excessively high excise duties to ramp up the prices,” the Russian leader said during video meeting with a Russian governor on Wednesday, adding that ignoring the problem and saying “people drink and they always will” is also the wrong approach. There are “simple things” that can be done to deal with the issue effectively, Putin suggested, including promoting better lifestyles and offering healthier alternative ways for people to spend their free time. “I am not saying anything novel here, but still. The promotion of a healthy lifestyle is very important. But it’s not enough. There needs to be a developed infrastructure for sports and physical training,” the president noted. “And culture in the wider sense needs attention. Make the conditions for people to go to places, foster their interest in culture,” he added. The issue was raised when the president mentioned to Aleksandr Avdeev, Governor of the central Russian Vladimir Region, that his constituency’s alcoholism rate is double the national average. Alcohol abuse has a long history in Russia, and for centuries taxing vodka and other spirits has been an easy way for the government to fill its coffers. However, national consumption has significantly dropped in the last decade, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). A 2021 report by the European office of the WHO’s SAFER initiative, aimed at combating alcohol abuse, said that between 2010 and 2016 Russia saw a 26.1% decline in estimated per-capita consumption, compared to the average 12.5% decrease in the region.",1.7430672265087206,1.7577611280863477,-0.014693901577627067,7

2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/561015-ukraine-crimes-strikes-permission/,No agreement with US forbidding attack on Crimea – Kiev,"Ukraine’s pledge not to attack Russian territory with Western-provided weapons does not cover Crimea, Ukrainian Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov said on Tuesday. Western nations have claimed that their supplies of advanced weapons to Ukraine were conditional on their non-use against targets in Russia, but officials in Kiev have long suggested that Crimea does not fall under that rule, as it considers the peninsula to be its own territory. In an interview with US government-funded broadcaster Voice of America, Reznikov said the US has not objected to strikes on the territory, which Russia views as its own. “We have an agreement with the US that we will not use weapons provided by the US and partners against the territory of the Russian Federation. But if we discuss de-occupying… Ukrainian land where the enemy is now, there are no such restrictions,” he said, after being asked about possible attacks against Crimea. The minister stated that the limiting factor in such strikes would be the range of the weapons it receives from foreign allies. In the same interview, he expressed hope that Ukraine would soon receive MGM-140 ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles. The Lockheed Martin-made projectiles can be fired by the M142 HIMARS and the M270 MLRS rocket systems, which Ukraine already has, and have a range of up to 300 km, significantly further than the types of ammunition provided by the US so far. Crimea broke away from Ukraine after the 2014 armed coup in Kiev, which ousted the democratically elected government. Crimeans overwhelmingly voted in a referendum to join Russia, which accepted the bid and enshrined the peninsula’s new status in its constitution. The move was not recognized by Kiev, which has said it will only seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis after defeating Russia militarily and ousting it from all captured territories, including Crimea. The administration of US President Joe Biden has said it imposed restrictions on Ukraine, to avoid being directly dragged into a conflict with Russia. Some officials in both the US and Russia have asserted that the conflict in Ukraine is a NATO war with Russia by a proxy. Washington has said its goal in Ukraine is to achieve a strategic defeat of Moscow.",2.5056110116180337,1.953960445968354,0.5516505656496797,8
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/560649-putin-west-officials-extremism/,"Putin first, populists next – who else will Western leaders blame for an energy crisis caused by NATO's geopolitical ambitions?","At the outset of the Ukraine conflict, Western officials proclaimed their unity against Moscow and vowed to accelerate their transition away from Russian fossil fuels and towards greener energy. The idea was to deprive the Kremlin of revenues which, in their minds, would result in defunding the military operation in Ukraine. So they went full scorched-earth on their own cheap energy supply – that is, gas from Europe's largest country – and sanctioned it. It wasn’t long before it became obvious that was something much easier said than done. Soon, officials started making public requests of their citizens to “do their part” by sacrificing their everyday comforts and quality of life, like taking shorter showers – as though that would remedy the fact that industrial representatives were already sounding the alarm about rationing and manufacturing shortages. Next, Western officials started backpedalling on their pledges to eradicate those forms of energy they had previously considered non-green. It was barely a few months earlier that Germany was chastising France for persisting with nuclear energy. Now, Berlin may potentially be joining Paris in turning back to it as a source, all while it also fires the old coal plants back up. Western Europeans had initially figured that they could at least maybe rely on hydroelectric energy from Norway, but the dry summer heat now threatens that, too, as Oslo considers cuts to its exports. And even liquified natural gas from Britain may not be exportable to the EU, since toxic and even radioactive contaminants have recently been found in the supply originally sourced from countries like the US and Qatar. The first flickers of real trouble are already evident – well ahead of the winter heating boom. The British consulting firm, Cornwall Insights, is warning of possible planned blackouts and empty shelves in Britain. Average household energy costs in the UK have reached £4,000 ($4,860) per year and are estimated to go even higher. The Bank of England is warning of a recession amid inflation which, in Germany, has just hit the highest level since reunification in 1990. Countries like Spain and Italy are imposing limits on heating and air conditioning in both public and commercial buildings. The EU’s imposition of a 15% energy cut across all member states has just come into effect, providing yet another pretext to reduce services to taxpayers. The mayor of the French town of Cabriès used it as an excuse to close the local swimming pool amid the record summer heat, citing a choice between the cost of feeding school kids increasingly pricy organic food in the cafeteria… or keeping the facility open. And whose fault is all this? It should seem obvious, no? Western officials cut themselves off from their own energy source in order to play geopolitics by pulling Ukraine into their orbit – but the blame is squarely on Russia. That’s what they said and that’s what they’re doubling down on. Britain’s Daily Mail refers in a graphic to Putin cutting the gas supply. “Putin's new gas squeeze condemns Europe to recession and a hard winter of rationing,” according to a CNBC headline. US President Joe Biden has framed it as “Putin’s tax on both food and gas.” Yet these officials did it to themselves – and to their citizens – “for Ukraine.” The problem, however, is that fewer and fewer constituents seem to be buying it. According to a recent Rasmussen poll in the US, just 11% attributed the economic crisis to Putin, while 52% blamed Biden’s own policies. And now, there are signs that a new scapegoat is being prepared. That scapegoat is populists. ""We can assume that populists and extremists will again try to influence protests to their liking,"" German Interior Ministry spokesperson, Britta Beylage-Haarmann, told Deutsche Welle. “Extremist actors and groups in Germany can lead to a growth in dangers if corresponding social crisis conditions allow for it.” It’s a troubling fact that Western officials attempt to conflate average people who oppose their radical policies – including their insistence on harming the energy supply as a matter of pro-Ukraine policy – with “extremists” when it’s their own positions that are growing increasingly radical. There had been a concerted effort in the past by Western officials to discredit any opposition to their plans by framing pushback by the average person as something brewed up in the halls of the Kremlin. And now, as they see chaos on the horizon as a result of their own insistence on pursuing social, economic, and industrial harm as a matter of policy, they’re gearing up to smear the blowback as illegitimate. French officials are not only dismissing but attacking the leader of France’s opposition party in parliament for speaking up about potential blackouts – all because she’s a populist. “Europe is going to face a blackout, notably on the question of Russian gas imports. These sanctions are simply useless. All they do is make Europeans suffer. And that, incidentally, includes French people,” said Marine Le Pen of France’s National Rally party. “You’d need a huge dose of bad faith not to realize that, contrary to the inflated claims of our government, the Russian economy is not on its knees. They are not on the brink of bankruptcy.” The French Energy Transition Minister, Agnes Pannier-Runacher, says that it’s Le Pen's remarks that are ""extraordinarily dangerous"" and ""irresponsible"", framing her legitimate concerns, which the average French can relate with, as something reckless. Populist leaders around the Western world, from Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, have been outspoken against anti-Russian sanctions, which are inherently harmful to the average Western citizen. Just because it’s populist leaders who have the courage to speak out on behalf of citizens doesn’t mean that the concerns can be dismissed or marginalized, because they are the concerns of a large swath of the silent majority. Western establishment officials are desperate to deflect accountability from a pending disaster that’s purely of their own making – either onto Putin or their own citizens.",1.4618134823942728,2.1371765393315445,-0.6753630569372717,8

Russia has been given 20 days to vacate the “premium site” in Yarralumla, not far from the Australian parliament, the NCA said in a statement. The Russian embassy in Australia is currently located in the Griffith suburb of the Australian capital, but there were plans to move it to Yarralumla, which hosts the diplomatic compounds of some other countries. “The NCA supports a policy of ‘Use it or lose it,’” Sally Barnes, the head of the agency that oversees planning and development of the capital, said, explaining the termination of the lease. She accused Moscow of showing no willingness to develop the site in Yarralumla, which it was granted back in 2008. According to the NCA, all approvals for the building were issued in 2011, with Russia promising to complete construction of the compound in the three years that followed. “While initial works have commenced, the block in question has been sitting as a building site with unfinished construction for many years now,” Barnes insisted. “Ongoing unfinished works detract from the overall aesthetic, importance and dignity of the area reserved for diplomatic missions and foreign representation in the national capital,” she added. Once the site is cleared, it will be returned to the pool of land available for diplomatic purposes in Canberra, and foreign countries will be able to file requests to use it. “The Russian Federation may submit a new application in the future which the NCA will review and assess accordingly,” the agency said. Tensions between Russia and Australia have spiked since the start of the Ukraine conflict, in which Canberra is supporting Kiev. The Australian authorities have joined international sanctions against Moscow, while providing Ukraine with armored vehicles and other military gear worth $390 million. During his visit Kiev last month, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese claimed his country was “the largest non-NATO contributor” to Kiev. On Thursday, Russia’s Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu slammed the AUKUS pact between the US, UK and Australia aimed at arming Canberra with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, saying it could “detonate” the whole Asia-Pacific region. “The implementation of this plan will have a profound negative effect on global and regional security and create an environment for the undermining of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,” Shoigu warned.",2.0823427235135736,1.535000178204429,0.5473425453091447,8
2022-08-17,https://www.rt.com/russia/560994-ukraine-destruction-crimean-bridge/,Zelensky aide threatens Europe's longest bridge,"Russia's Crimean Bridge, the largest structure of its kind in Europe, “should be destroyed,” an aide to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has warned. “It’s an illegal construction and the main gateway to supply the Russian army in Crimea,” Mikhail Podolyak told the Guardian on Tuesday, explaining why Kiev wants to attack it. The bridge was constructed after Crimea broke away from Ukraine following an armed coup in Kiev in 2014 and voted in a referendum to join Russia. It forms a direct road and rail connection with the region, which previously could only be reached from the rest of Russia by sea or air. The bridge is predominantly used by civilian traffic. Podolyak is the latest Ukrainian official to confirm Kiev’s intention to attack the structure. The remark came as he appeared to hint that Ukraine was in the process of delivering a series of acts of sabotage in Crimea. Since last week, two separate locations on the peninsula have been rocked by powerful explosions at military sites used to store ammunition. The Russian defense ministry acknowledged the latest, which happened on Tuesday near the village of Mayskoye in northern Crimea, as an act of sabotage. Kiev has not formally claimed credit for the incidents, but many Ukrainian officials hinted that this was the case, with Podolyak following the pattern in his interview with the British newspaper. “I certainly agree with the Russian ministry for defense, which is predicting more incidents of this kind in the next two, three months. I think we might see more of those happening,” he noted. The Ukrainian presidential aide called the purported clandestine attacks a “counteroffensive” different in nature from the type of military action usually described by this term. “A Ukrainian counteroffensive looks very different [from a Russian one]. We don’t use the tactics of the 60s and 70s, of the last century,” he claimed. The Guardian suggested that Podolyak may have tacitly admitted Ukraine’s failure to amass troops and weapons for an actual pushback against Russian troops on the battlefield. Top Ukrainian officials have for weeks promised a push to recapture the city of Kherson would begin soon, with some even claiming the operation was already underway. Podolyak told the BBC last week that “all public statements” by Ukrainian officials were “psychological warfare” aimed at demoralizing the Russian army.",3.10979827011814,3.262191464365017,-0.15239319424687725,0

Recent artillery attacks on the Zaporozhye NPP, which Moscow controls, are a “deliberate step in Russia’s wider goal: stealing [Zaporozhye’s] power by severing its connection to Ukraine’s remaining territory,” the WSJ claimed on Sunday, citing “Ukrainian leaders, international nuclear-power experts and the plant’s staff.” Those quoted on the record include Mikhail Podolyak, adviser to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, and former “energy chief at the US embassy” in Kiev, Suriya Jayanti. The Journal also claims to have spoken with “plant workers, family members and colleagues who fled to safety” – meaning, Ukrainian-held territory. Jayanti claimed that Russia wants to disconnect the ZNPP from Ukraine’s electrical grid in order to destabilize global energy markets but also leave Kiev dependent on the EU, where electricity prices are skyrocketing – while omitting to mention that this is largely due to anti-Russian sanctions. The report is “a complete demolition of the connection between cause and effect,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, dubbing the WSJ claims “the latest spin of the wheel of disinformation.” Ukraine has repeatedly targeted the nuclear power plant with artillery, rockets and even kamikaze drones, the ministry noted, adding that Russia has presented evidence of this to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN Security Council, among others. Ukrainian forces were also accused of bombing the Kakhovskaya hydroelectic power station – also under Russian control – which supplies the ZNPP with cooling water. On Tuesday, local administration member Vladimir Rogov told Russian TV that the latest Ukrainian attack came close to breaking a container storing spent nuclear fuel. A strike on the structure would amount to a “dirty bomb,” Rogov said. A release from 20-30 containers would create a radiation plume that could spread as far west as the Czech Republic and as far south as Turkey, affecting Poland and the Baltic States as well, former Soviet nuclear inspector Vladimir Kuznetsov told RT on Tuesday. “The conclusion suggests itself: by destroying the energy infrastructure, the Kiev regime is exposing the many millions of people on the European continent to the danger of a nuclear cataclysm, with the connivance of Washington,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said, noting that the WSJ, located across the ocean, clearly doesn’t seem to care.",2.1236655374876805,2.369340451805396,-0.2456749143177155,9

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric announced the meeting on Tuesday, saying that Guterres was invited to Lviv by Zelensky. Guterres will also visit Odessa, a port city where grain shipments across the Black Sea recently restarted after Russia and Ukraine struck a deal with Turkey and the UN to ensure their safe passage. The three-way meeting will focus on maintaining cooperation on these shipments, and “ending the Ukraine-Russia war through diplomatic avenues,” Erdogan’s office said in a statement. After leaving Ukraine, Guterrez will visit the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul, from where the shipments are being monitored by Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN officials. In addition to the trilateral meeting, Dujarric and Zelensky will hold a one-on-one meeting to discuss the situation at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. Moscow and Kiev have both accused each other of shelling the plant, although the facility has been under Russian control since the initial days of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. Erdogan will also meet alone with Zelensky, with his office saying that the two leaders will discuss “all aspects of Turkey-Ukraine relations.” Although Turkey is a member of the NATO alliance, it has not sanctioned Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.

2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560971-ukraine-bombs-waste-containers-zaporozhye/,Ukraine bombs nuclear waste storage site – official,"The Ukrainian military has fired multiple rockets directly at coolant systems and nuclear waste storage site inside the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in Energodar, local government administration member Vladimir Rogov told Russian media on Tuesday. He warned that a successful strike may result in a radiation release equivalent to a “dirty bomb.” “One of the guided missiles hit just ten meters” from the barrels with spent nuclear fuel,” Rogov told Soloviev Live. “Others hit a bit farther away, 50 to 200 meters.” Since the storage site is out in the open, any hit will result in the release of nuclear waste ranging from dozens to hundreds of kilograms and contamination of the area, the official explained. “In plain language, that would be like a dirty bomb,” said Rogov. While the reactor itself can only be destroyed with a tactical nuclear weapon, the coolant systems and waste storage are far more vulnerable and damage to them could easily cause a disaster, the official said. Ukrainian troops have already fired “several dozen” heavy projectiles at the cooling systems, Rogov added. If they succeed in disabling such a system, it could produce a meltdown bigger than the 1986 catastrophe at Chernobyl. Russian troops established control of the Zaporozhye NPP, Europe’s largest facility of the kind, early on in the course of military operations in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine have been accusing each other of shelling the facility, warning that combat in the area could trigger a nuclear disaster. Russia accused Ukraine of launching artillery and drone strikes on the facility, denouncing the operations as “nuclear terrorism.” Ukrainian troops claimed that the Russians were shelling themselves to discredit Kiev. Russian requests to the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect the site firsthand have been met with excuses that inspectors can only access the station via Kiev, and Ukraine can’t guarantee their safe passage. On Monday, Rogov accused the UN of blocking the IAEA visit because it was covering for Kiev. If the inspectors actually showed up, he said, they would be forced to conclude that Ukraine and not Russia was shelling the power plant. “It is obvious, it’s all been documented, and not only that, it’s also well known who is being supplied with American guided missiles.

While nearly all Russian and Belarusian books will be dropped from the school program, the ministry notes that it will allow some works by authors who wrote in Russian but whose “life and work were closely connected with Ukraine,” such as Nikolay Gogol and Mikhail Bulgakov. According to the updated curriculum, foreign literature courses in Ukrainian schools will now focus on works by writers such as Jean de La Fontaine, O. Henry, Anna Gavalda, and Joseph Roth. The ministry also announced that it will be updating history courses in Ukrainian schools “to take into account new historiographic developments.” Specifically, it will update courses on Ukrainian and world history for grades 6 to 11 to include the ongoing military conflict between Kiev and Moscow. Last month, Ukrainian officials introduced a new stage of the law on ‘Ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as a state language’, which introduces fines for speaking Russian. The law applies to workers in institutions such as government agencies, education, science, and media. “Citizens of the country must use the Ukrainian language in all aspects of social life,” the commissioner for the protection of the state language, Taras Kremen, explained, calling on people to report offenders to local law enforcement. Russian is a native language in much of Ukraine and predominant in many cities in both the east and south of the country. However, Kiev has been taking steps to outlaw its use in most fields. Moscow has expressed concern for years over the clampdown on Russian.

The deal was signed by Russian Deputy Defense Minister Aleksey Krivoruchko and the general manager of the country’s Makeev Missile Center, Vladimir Degtyar, RIA Novosti reported. Speaking on Russian TV in May, Degtyar claimed that “it is impossible to intercept” the Sarmat missile thanks to its “incredibly complex” design, which allows it to “overcome any multi-layered missile defense.” The commander of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, Sergey Karakaev, said at the time that the new rocket can travel along unusual trajectories, including via the South Pole. He added that the Sarmat is the “largest military rocket in human history,” boasting a diameter of three meters and a height equal to that of a 14-story apartment block.

2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560947-shoigu-aukus-detonates-region/,AUKUS deal could ‘detonate’ Asia-Pacific – Russia,"The AUKUS security pact between the US, Britain and Australia could “detonate” the Asia-Pacific region by introducing nuclear military drills, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has warned. “The AUKUS union has the potential of becoming a military-political alliance. It can’t be ruled out that NATO’s joint nuclear planning and joint nuclear exercises would be brought to the region,” Shoigu said on Tuesday. “The bringing of the practice of conducting nuclear exercises from Europe would detonate the region. Although, one can assume that this is the precise goal of the US.” The pact allows for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines with the help of the US and Britain. “The implementation of this plan will have a profound negative effect on global and regional security and create an environment for the undermining of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,” Shoigu said. Australia’s opposition leader and former defense minister, Peter Dutton, urged the government last week to acquire the submarines as soon as possible in the wake of renewed tensions between China and the US over Taiwan. Established last year, AUKUS was promoted as an agreement to deepen defense ties between three English-speaking nations and enhance interoperability. In April, AUKUS leaders released a statement, affirming “their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that Washington is not seeking to set up “an Asian NATO.”",1.5061246730371927,2.786002621143608,-1.2798779481064153,8
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560940-jewish-death-curse-putin/,Putin fears Jewish death curse – ex-Ukrainian official,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely afraid to attack the city of Dnepr due to a threat that he will be cursed to death through an ancient Jewish ritual, a former Ukrainian official claims. In an interview on Friday with the news website Novoye Vremya, Gennady Korban said he had threatened to place the curse on the Russian leader if he attacks the city. “Pulsa diNura is a complicated, difficult procedure,” he said, adding that his threat in July to curse Putin “may have contributed in some way in the sense that so far they have not struck Dnepr.” “I knock on wood not to jinx it, God forbid, but this is how it is,” he said. Pulsa diNura, roughly translated from Aramaic as ‘lashes of fire’, is a ritual that is attributed to an old Kabbalistic text, though scholars believe the term was not used in the sense of a curse invoked by man. It became a political tool among some religious Jews in the early 20th century. The ceremony is intended to compel ‘angels of destruction’ to not forgive the subject’s sins, ultimately killing him or her. Urban legend claims that Pulsa diNura was successfully used against Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by an Israeli right-wing extremist in 1995. Korban threatened to invoke the mystical threat against the Russian leader in July after a Russian missile strike hit Yuzhmash, a Soviet-built military plant in Dnepr. There was some debate in Ukrainian media whether a non-Jewish person would be a ‘valid’ target for the curse. In the interview, Korban suggested that Putin must be a superstitious man because “dictators” like Hitler and Stalin “very often believe” in such mystical things. He added that he has not actually had the ritual performed yet. “Pulsa diNura is not a procedure that you can start on a whim. Under the procedure, you have to inform the enemy or a person you want to subject to it,” he said. “I have warned Putin. Let him think and make conclusions now.” Korban entered the media spotlight this month after Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky revoked his citizenship while he was traveling to another country. Consequently, he was barred from returning to Ukraine. A number of public figures have urged Zelensky to reverse the decision. Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko claimed this week that somebody in the government threatened him for publicly supporting Korban. Despite his forced absence, Korban told Novoye Vremya that he continues to perform his duty as head of staff of Dnepr’s territorial defense. The mayor, Boris Filatov, is a long-time ally of Korban and leads the campaign to reinstate his citizenship.",3.383152789140405,3.719217699396526,-0.33606491025612106,5

Russian news agency RIA Novosti asked Kabulov on Tuesday to comment on the fate of the Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters that the US originally purchased for the Afghan Armed Forces in the 2010s but ended up delivering to Ukraine in the spring in order to fight Russia. Kabulov did not rule out similar incidents in the future. “There can’t be any guarantees with the US because it is not capable of negotiating,” he said. “It’s important for us that helicopters and planes that were flown to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan by the fleeing Afghan commanders and servicemen do not reach Ukraine,” the Russian diplomat said. He added that around 60 aircraft were moved from Afghanistan to Tajikistan and around 40-50 to Uzbekistan after the Taliban seized power. Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. RIA Novosti cited a diplomatic source in May as saying that Turkey was recruiting Afghan nationals in Iran in order to send them to fight against Russian forces in Ukraine. Kabulov said that the Taliban had provided assurances that they would not allow fighters from the country to travel to Ukraine. However, some former Afghan commandos have joined Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and are fighting in Iraq and Syria, he said. “Another part of these former commandos are joining Ukrainian Nazis as mercenaries. They were apparently offered money because they need to live off of something,” Kabulov said. The envoy's comments came after Reuters cited an unreleased report by the Republicans on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee that warned that former Afghan security personnel are susceptible to recruitment by Russia, China and Iran.",2.7286691223733186,2.0752271316663644,0.6534419907069542,7

The plant is located in Kursk Region, which borders eastern Ukraine. The blasts, which occurred on August 4, 9, and 12, “led to a disruption of the technological process of the nuclear power plant’s functioning,” the FSB said. Six transmission towers were targeted overall. These towers transmit power from the plant to crucial infrastructure, such as industrial sites and transportation systems. The FSB added that a terrorism investigation has been launched and that a search for the culprits is underway. Security at nuclear sites in Russia has been boosted. Earlier on Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukrainian agents blew up a military storage facility near the town of Dzhankoy in Crimea. It added that power lines, a railway, and several homes were also damaged. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi voiced concern last week over the “very alarming” situation around the Zaporozhye nuclear plant in southern Ukraine.

2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560934-ukrainian-men-travel-restrictions/,Zelensky reveals when men will be allowed to leave Ukraine,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has announced that men without military experience will be banned from leaving the country as long as martial law is in effect. The statement was posted on the president’s website on Monday in response to a petition urging that men between the ages 18 and 60 be allowed to travel abroad. The petition, which was signed by over 27,000 people, says many Ukrainian men are unfit for military service but could be useful in other fields. The author argued that if these people were allowed to work abroad, they could help refugees and send back money to aid the military, which, the text says, already has enough capable people. “Fighting should be fought by able-bodied people. We have many IT, social, creative, technical, and other specialists who can fight on the information front and be more useful working abroad, helping our refugees and supporting the army with earned funds,” the petition reads. The author claimed that Kiev’s travel restrictions aimed at certain categories of citizens resemble “Soviet practices, which [Ukraine] is gradually getting rid of,” and offered the example of Estonia, which only prohibits travel to those who are the subjects of criminal proceedings. “Therefore, we ask the president of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, to allow men aged 18-60 who do not have military experience and are of limited fitness to travel abroad,” the petition concludes. According to Ukrainian law, if an online petition receives more than 25,000 signatures, the president must issue a response. Zelensky replied by pointing to Article 64 of the constitution, which states that freedom of movement may be limited for Ukrainian citizens in the event of an emergency or the introduction of martial law. The president explained that according to the constitution, during a period of “martial law, the constitutional rights and freedoms of a person and a citizen… may be limited.” He went on to note that “the abolition of these restrictions is expected to be carried out after the end of the legal regime of martial law.” Ukraine’s Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, approved Zelensky’s decree introducing martial law in the country on February 24, 2022, after Moscow launched its military operation against Kiev. The Rada has since extended the period of martial law several times, most recently prolonging it for an additional 90 days, until November 21.",3.7386000111791864,4.298370056821253,-0.5597700456420664,3

2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560738-wild-east-inside-russian-chinese/,The Wild East: Inside the Russian-Chinese gold-rush 'California' where women were banned and fortunes were quickly made and lost,"Hardened criminals, valiant adventurers, thrill seekers, and thousands of gold prospectors from all over the world flocking to a new virgin territory, where a young republic of free people is being born amid the glow of gold mines. No, this is not a reference to the American Wild West – what we’re talking about happened on the other side of the Pacific, on Chinese land beyond the Amur River, where a Russian Klondike blossomed in the 19th century. Local residents mined minerals, snubbed governments, and had their own flag, leaders, and laws. They called their new homeland the 'Zheltuga Republic.' The Russians made it to the Amur as early as the 17th century. Eventually, their dramatic clashes with local tribes and politicians that paid tribute to China led to the drawing of a border between the Russian and the Manchu states. In the 19th century, this frontier followed the Amur River. But neither St. Petersburg nor Beijing could effectively control the vast and sparsely populated areas on the outskirts of their empires. In the spring of 1883, a member of the indigenous Evenk people, who lived on the southern, ‘Chinese’ bank of the Amur, was going about the sad but rather prosaic business of burying his mother. As he was digging her grave, he found several gold nuggets. He realized there was some money to be made, so he went to the border village of Ignashino on the Russian side of the Amur. This tiny village still exists today, although it has less than 200 residents. With Blagoveshchensk (216,000 people) roughly 500 kilometers to the southeast and Nerchinsk (population 15,000) about the same distance to the southwest, there is still nothing that could be called a big city close by. The locals knew that Evenk man, who would sometimes come to the village to sell hides. He found a merchant called Seredkin and, in exchange for a payment, told him where the gold could be found. Seredkin sent a mining engineer to the south bank of the Amur and he found a rich goldfield close to the Mohe river, which the Russians called the ‘Zheltuga’. The first teams of prospectors were soon to follow. In the winter of 1884, a rumor swept through Siberian towns about untold riches to be found on the Zheltuga. As it usually happens, imagination was conjuring up images of a new Eldorado. A good reflection of everyone’s sentiment was a phrase coined back then: “You peel off moss and pick up gold.” People from as far as Nerchinsk, Chita, Irkutsk, Blagoveshchensk, and even Sakhalin volunteered to travel to the Zheltuga, not to mention residents of villages along the Argun and the Amur. Naturally, prospectors were followed by merchants and then by all sorts of robbers and con men. In early 1883, a mere 120 people lived on the Zheltuga; a year later, that number went up to 7,000 and it peaked between 10,000 and 15,000. Admittedly, all of these figures are approximate and different estimates have been made. The fact remains, however, that the Zheltuga valley rapidly became very populous, with the Russians far outnumbering the Chinese, who were also drawn to the area by rumors of gold. Although the gold rush was felt even by some government officials and intellectuals, it stands to reason that most of those flocking to the Zheltuga were no church choir boys. At best, they were ordinary workers and peasants who gave up their primary occupations, at worst – escaped convicts and deserters. A correspondent from the Peterburgskie Vedomosti described them as “desperate villains.” There were some remarkable characters among them, like a guy who managed to escape from prison on Sakhalin, cross the sea, and walk 1,500 kilometers to get to the goldfields. Apart from Russians and Chinese, the Zheltuga valley saw the arrival of Americans, Jews, Germans, Frenchmen, Poles, and members of all kinds of Siberian peoples. You could run into anyone here, from a branded highwayman to an impoverished aristocrat. That ragtag community mainly relied on the Russian language and sometimes used Chinese or the Kyakhta Russian-Chinese pidgin. Most of those people were actually prospectors, or ‘predators’, as they were called then. Around 100-150 newcomers would arrive in Zheltuga every day. Community life centered around California, which is what they called the rapidly growing mining village, whose main street was known as Million Street. Its name was, however, more impressive than its architecture. People lived in simple and practical log cabins chinked with moss under flat timber roofs covered with dirt. Local carpenters built a whole lot of huts like that, which ordinarily had an area of 72 square meters and a ceiling height of just 2 meters. There was a wood stove in the middle without a chimney and bunk beds lined up against the walls. The gold-seekers’ diet consisted mostly of rice and other grains, game, fish, and berries. The dwellings were very primitive but they were only used as sleeping quarters. Chinese prospectors’ houses stood apart from the rest, and they conducted their mining activities on their own. There was a large square in the middle of California, called Orlovo Pole (Eagle Field), used for town meetings. It was the location of the mining administration and had a rostrum, a bell, and even a black and yellow flag. The black color symbolized earth, while yellow stood for gold. Beyond California, mining pits stretched along the Zheltuga for about 15 kilometers. Some belonged to teams, others to individual prospectors. In Zheltuga’s heyday, there were over 700 teams and countless individual gold-seekers. Some of them made money and went back home spreading the word about the gold country, but others rushed in to take their place. After the topsoil was removed, miners worked through the gold-bearing layer and continued prospecting in underground galleries. Exploration was usually abandoned when you reached your neighbors’ galleries. Gold mining was mainly carried out in winter when the pits were not flooded. Gold digging was equally lucrative for those who served the miners. Stores, mostly selling food and tools, bathhouses, gambling houses, and taverns were booming as they charged locals for a pickaxe or a piece of dry bread several times as much as in Blagoveshchensk. California could boast 18 hotels and inns, 22 taverns, a photo lab, a zoo with a female tiger, a musical theater, two orchestras, two jewelry shops, a choir, seven bathhouses, a hospital, and a pharmacy. Pure gold was used as a means of exchange due to a shortage of banknotes and coins. Chita, the local casino, which some wisecrackers called Monte Carlo, was California’s epitome of grandeur. It had several halls dedicated to specific games, from roulette to dice and faro. The casino had its own orchestra and a café. In reality, the owners of such establishments were the ones who were breaking the bank, while many prospectors simply gambled and drank away their fortunes. Gold dealers were another group of local big shots. One of them was executed for fraud. After he circulated a fake wire about the imminent arrival of a Cossack squad, he was able to buy a lot of gold on the cheap and ruined many prospectors. The perpetrator was flogged to death. One thing they didn’t have, by the way, was brothels. The Zheltuga Republic had a rule against inviting women. The miners, mostly no gentlefolk themselves, were afraid that the presence of the fair sex would result in a spike of incidents, brawls, and murders. Out of similar concerns, the selling of liquor was prohibited in the places where actual mining took place. So-called 'alcohol carriers' tried to circumvent this ban though, much to the joy of workers, who were suffering from freezing cold. Zheltuga had important implications for the economy of the whole region. It’s hard to grow wheat in the Far East under normal circumstances, and field workers started leaving in droves to go looking for gold. As a result, the prices of food and other consumer goods in Chita, Nerchinsk, and Irkutsk skyrocketed. The local authorities’ attempts to stem migration were ineffective. It was all completely illegal. Moreover, Russian prospectors were technically on Chinese territory, so they worked without a break trying to get as much done as possible before the two governments took notice. The Chinese, however, were happy to turn a blind eye for a while because locally-mined gold was mostly sold to Chinese dealers. Zheltuga started out as a pure anarchy. Soon enough, however, the 'Californians' thought they needed an administration of some kind. At one point, the cook of one of the teams was killed with a hammer because the murderers wanted to get their hands on his gold stash. The Zheltuga community swiftly responded by electing a leader who would be responsible for law and order. The residents took an oath where they pledged to follow Christian principles and civil laws. Here’s the text of this oath: “We, the teams and owners of free enterprises in Amur, California, remembering the words bestowed upon us by our great teacher the Son of God and Our Lord, ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself’ and following this Christian teaching contained in the Holy Gospel, which leads us to peace and welfare in this worldly life and salvation and eternity in the kingdom of heaven, do undertake, with the help of the Almighty, to labor relentlessly for the benefit of our neighbors in order to show the departed the true path and, by doing so, to banish ungodly deeds which are committed by many from our midst who are wandering in the darkness of sin and have forgotten the commandments ‘Thou shalt not kill’ and ‘Thou shalt not steal’. Sending our heartfelt prayers to Our Lord so that He may not abandon us, weak as we are, on the hard path that is set for us, we place our unmitigated trust and deliver ourselves into the hands of our elected officials not as power-coveting superiors but as the worthiest people among us who remember the word of God teaching us truth and justice, which we have confirmed with our signatures and, in our thoughts, with this oath.” All the mines were divided into five districts, each of which elected two foremen resulting in a ‘parliament’ of sorts, which consisted of two Chinese men and eight Russians. Curiously, there are still questions about the identity of the first elected ‘president’ (yes, this is the word they used) of the Zheltuga Republic. Historians generally agree that he was a foreigner, but his exact origin remains a mystery. It is traditionally said that the first president of the Zheltuga Republic was Karl Ivanovich Fasse, who most researchers believe to be an Italian. Other sources claim he was an Austro-Hungarian subject born in Slovakia. According to one version, Fasse, whoever he was, came to the Amur not straight from his home country but from the ‘original’ California in the US. Another version maintains that he graduated from a law school in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and worked as a government official in Vladivostok before showing up in Zheltuga. In any case, he appears to have been an educated man, and speculations about his legal and bureaucratic background are not unfounded. A popular story about how the Zheltuga Republic was run by the so-called Cornet Savin, a famous con man, seems to be a hoax that goes against the facts. The president and foremen were paid for their work. In addition, everyone chipped in to pay for a free 'republican' hospital, a treasurer, and the fire and police services. The foremen were also the court of first instance, while more serious cases could be appealed before the president. The republic’s legislation was quite unsophisticated and mostly dealt with four areas: taxes and payments for the common good, the procedure for staking and using claims, the organization of trade and other activities, and criminal law. The latter was simple and easy to grasp. Minor crimes, such as stealing, sodomy, bringing women to the mines, disturbing the peace while being drunk, cheating at card games, etc., were punished by a certain, but always considerable, number of blows with a rod or a cane. Those guilty of murder or other serious crimes were hanged. Smaller offenses like breaking work rules that didn’t lead to grave consequences were punishable by a fine. The measures proved to be effective in maintaining order. The tax on retailers was 10% of the price of goods, and this figure went up to 25% for sellers of liquor. Establishment owners paid 20% of their monthly revenue in taxes. That idyllic situation was short-lived. In 1884, China demanded that Baron Korf, the governor general of Amur, take steps to bring Russians back to the north bank of the Amur. Russian officials shrugged and said they were powerless because they were not authorized to operate on Chinese soil. The debate around what to do with Zheltuga and whose responsibility it was lasted for years. The checkpoints put up by Russian authorities along the border didn’t really do much. One has to assume that the officials in charge liked gold no less than everyone else. The Chinese governor was essentially told by his Russian counterpart to do whatever he pleased – on his own. His predicament was that California was separated from the closest Chinese settlements by 500 kilometers of taiga. Even getting through that forest to the colony of thousands of people was a huge problem, let alone dispersing the prospectors. In August 1885, a Chinese official came to Zheltuga to tell gold-seekers to leave within a week. That sounded serious, so many decided not to play with fire and go back to Russia. Many others, however, relocated to the nearest Russian villages of Ignashino and Amazar to see if they could wait this out. Some even remained in California. On September 6, 1885, 700 Chinese soldiers showed up to the Russian colony. They burned houses and killed several people, but when they left thinking their mission was accomplished, Zheltuga prospectors came back, rebuilt California, and went on with their work as if nothing had happened. A new squad was dispatched to punish intruders two months later, in November 1885. This time, the Qing sent 1,600 troops. Californians were divided about what to do, with some arguing for a final stand and some deciding to go back home. Russian prospectors were leaving in parties of up to 100 people. The Chinese squad severely punished Chinese miners while mostly refraining from violence against Russians. Those few who dared return were intercepted by the Chinese and got a beating with bamboo rods. Prospectors tried digging along the whole of the Amur’s Russian side as well, but they couldn’t compete with big Russian gold mining companies supported by soldiers and Cossacks. Still, 'predatory' gold mining continued until the 1930s, when Soviet authorities finally suppressed illegal exploration. The Zheltuga Republic only existed for two years, but it left an interesting legacy in Russian memory. It was a moment when a group of rough but enterprising people, acting very quickly, managed to turn a gang of outcasts into a functioning, self-governing civil society united by a sense of common purpose, which made officials in St. Petersburg and Beijing take notice. This commune became not just a symbol of enrichment but a symbol of freedom as well.",3.6275131482542666,5.0958277902394045,-1.4683146419851378,4
2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560924-russia-us-conflict-nuclear/,Russia warns of ‘direct military clash’ with US,"Washington’s behavior on the world stage risks direct conflict between the nuclear states, the Russian embassy in the US has warned. “Today, the United States continues to act with no regard to other countries’ security and interests, which contributes to an increase in nuclear risks,” the embassy said in a statement on its Telegram channel. “The [US’] steps to further engage in a hybrid confrontation with Russia in the context of the Ukrainian crisis are fraught with unpredictable escalation and a direct military clash of nuclear powers.” The embassy noted that Washington has recently withdrawn from two key arms control agreements, the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which banned certain classes of land-based missiles, and the 1992 Treaty on Open Skies, which allowed for surveillance flights over each other’s territories. The embassy urged the US to “take a closer look at its own nuclear policy instead of making unfounded accusations against the countries whose worldviews do not coincide with the American ones.” “Our country faithfully fulfills its obligations as a nuclear-weapon state and makes every effort to reduce nuclear risks,” the diplomats said. The statement comes after the US accused Moscow of using the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine as cover for its soldiers. The plant, the largest in Europe, was seized by Russian troops during the early stages of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, which was launched in late February. It continues to operate with Ukrainian personnel under Russian control. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Russia’s action at the facility “the height of irresponsibility.” Russia and Ukraine, meanwhile, have been accusing each other of shelling the plant. According to Moscow, artillery fire by Ukrainians forces caused several fires and partial power outages this month. Russia initiated a UN Security Council meeting last week regarding the situation around the Zaporozhye power plant. Russian envoy Vassily Nebenzia said that Moscow supports the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect the facility as quickly as possible.",3.0672972026809,2.532802924820463,0.5344942778604369,9

Speaking at the forum, part of the ongoing Army 2022 expo near Moscow, Shoigu claimed that the weapons provided to Kiev have not had a significant effect on the battlefield, as has been claimed by the West. “Initially, it was about the supply of Javelin anti-tank systems and some unique drones. More recently, HIMARS multiple launch rocket systems and long-range howitzers were being promoted to the role of superweapons by Westerners. However, all of these weapons are being ground up in battle,” the minister said. Shoigu added that Russian forces are “carefully examining” the Western weapon systems seized on the battlefield in Ukraine, and are “taking into account the features and specific qualities” of these weapons when planning combat operations.The minister’s statement comes after US Defense Secretary LLoyd Austin announced last week that the weapons sent to Kiev by Washington have proven themselves effective on the battlefield and pledged to send more arms to Ukraine for “as long as it takes.” The US has approved more than $54 billion of economic and military aid to Ukraine since February, while the UK has committed nearly $3 billion in military aid alone, and the EU has spent another $2.5 billion on arms for Kiev. A large range of equipment, from rifles and grenades to anti-tank missiles and multiple launch rocket systems, has left Western armories for Ukraine, with most entering the country through Poland.

2022-08-16,https://www.rt.com/russia/560920-russia-ukraine-nuclear-weapons/,No need for nuclear weapons in Ukraine – Moscow,"There are no targets in Ukraine that warrant a Russian nuclear strike, so claims that Russia could use nuclear weapons in its ongoing military operation are absurd, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has insisted. He was speaking during a security conference in Moscow on Tuesday. “The use [of nuclear weapons] is restricted to emergencies only, as outlined in Russian guidelines that are publicly available,” he added, noting that the weapons are meant as a deterrence against foreign aggression. Shoigu said that “claims of possible use of chemical weapons in Ukraine are absurd too,” since Russia destroyed its stockpile in an effort that was completed in 2017. False accusations of such attacks have been used by Western-backed groups in Syria in the past, he added. The Russian minister, who was speaking during the opening of the Moscow Conference for International Security, said the situation with strategic weapons reduction and control was at a difficult spot due to the ongoing confrontation between the US and Russia. “American statements that claim that Russia has to earn the right to continue dialogue with the US are beyond the pale. Weapons control is a two-way street,” he stressed. The Russian official said Washington was an unreliable partner when it came to the balance of strategic power. The US scrapped several key treaties with Russia over the years, which Moscow says seriously hurt transparency in military affairs. “I suppose the Russian experience engaging the West in the area of disarmament demonstrates that the so-called ‘rules-based order’ they promote does not provide for fulfilling treaty obligations,” Shoigu said. The lessons learned from it will direct Russia’s future international agreements on security and arms control, he said. In particular, there is a “difficult situation with” the NEW START treaty, which limits the number of nuclear weapons, the minister noted. The document needs to be renewed before 2026 to remain in force. Shoigu assessed that the security situation in Europe was worse at the moment than during the Cold War, blaming NATO for it. “The military activities of the alliance have become fully aggressive and anti-Russian in nature,” he said, citing deployments of American troops and weapons in Eastern Europe. He added that the strengthening of NATO forces began long before Russia attacked Ukraine in February. Commenting on the operation in Ukraine, Shoigu said it has disproven the notion that ‘game-changing’ Western weapon systems can turn the tide on the battlefield. “First, they spoke that way about the Javelin anti-tank missiles and ‘unique’ drones. Later, the pro-West people promoted the HIMARS multiple launch rockets system and long-range howitzers as ‘superweapons,’” he said. These weapons are destroyed just like any others and don’t affect the situation in a significant way, the minister stressed. Meanwhile, the Russian forces study the equipment that is captured on the battlefield to identify ways to counter it, he added.",2.3335009049493087,3.4489468457637824,-1.1154459408144737,8

Putin reiterated that Moscow launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February in order to “ensure the security of Russia and its citizens, and defend the people of Donbass from genocide.” The president said the US has “set the role of cannon fodder for Ukrainians, implemented the ‘anti-Russia’ project [in Ukraine], turned a blind eye to the spread of neo-Nazi ideology, to the mass murder of the people of Donbass,” adding that the US has been “pumping the Kiev regime with weapons, including heavy weapons, and continues to do so.” The US and its allies under NATO have been increasingly supplying Ukraine with weapons, including M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, M777 howitzers, and combat drones. US President Joe Biden said in June that NATO will support for Ukraine “as long as it takes to, in fact, make sure that they are not defeated.” Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014.

The blasts took place at a temporary ammunition depot operated by the Russian military, the Defense Ministry confirmed. The settlement is located in the Dzhankoy region, near Ukraine, and is believed to have around 2,000 residents. This is the second incident of this nature on the Crimean Peninsula since the beginning of the month. Last week, a series of explosions occurred at the Saki military airfield, located in the resort town of Novofedorovka. As a result, 14 people were injured and one died Images on social media purportedly taken at the moment of the incident show a massive ball of fire rising into the air. According to the Defense Ministry, the ammunition exploded due to a fire at the site. It reported no serious injuries in the incident and said its causes were being investigated. The head of the Republic of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said he was going to Mayskoye to investigate the situation on the ground. The official said that according to preliminary reports, two civilians were injured in the village, adding that their lives are not in danger. Residents are being taken at least 5km away from Mayskoye due to the risks posed by continuing explosions at the military site, Aksyonov said. Later in the day, the region’s head said rail connection between mainland Russia and western Crimea was disrupted by damage done by the incident in Mayskoye.

On Monday, Russian media reported that the judge informed the three men of the punishment they could face during a hearing in Donetsk. “The court is obliged to clarify that charges against [Matias] Gustavsson, [Vjekoslav] Prebeg, and [John] Harding call for capital punishment,” the judge said. The charges include “undergoing training to seize violently power,” “violent seizure of power,” as well as “the participation of a mercenary in an armed conflict or military action.” The other two foreign fighters, Britons Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy, could reportedly face up to eight years behind bars. According to Russia's TASS news agency, all five pleaded not guilty, with Harding refusing to testify. Gustavsson insisted that he had not participated in fighting. At least some of the men were captured in the city of Mariupol, including at the Azovstal steel plant. The next hearing in their case is expected in early October. In June, a court in Donetsk sentenced to death three foreign men who served in the Ukrainian armed forces and fought for Kiev in the DPR. British citizens Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, as well as Moroccan Saadun Ibrahim, were found guilty of acting as mercenaries and attempting to seize power by force in the DPR.

A MiG-31 interceptor was dispatched to escort the RC-135 surveillance jet from the vicinity of Cape Svyatoy Nos, near the major bases of the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet. The MiG-31BM interceptor on duty with the border air patrol identified the aircraft and compelled it to stop its violation of Russian airspace, the military said in a statement. Moscow identified the location of the incident as Svyatoy Nos, a cape on the Kola Peninsula, east of Murmansk in western Russia. While the Russian Defense Ministry offered no further details about the incident as of Monday evening local time, FlightRadar showed a Royal Air Force RC-135 flying off the coast of Murmansk earlier. The RAF spy plane with the designation RRR7255 made several loops before heading for the entrance to the White Sea, violating Russian airspace in the process. The plane is seen currently flying back to the RAF base in Waddington, Lincolnshire, the hub of the RAF Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) command. Monday’s incident was the first incursion of NATO aircraft into Russian territory since the conflict in Ukraine escalated in February. Earlier that month, Moscow said that a US submarine was spotted and chased off from Russian waters near the Kuril Islands in the northern Pacific. The Pentagon denied all allegations. This is the second British trespass into Russian territory since June 2021, when Royal Navy destroyer HMS Defender sailed off the coast of Crimea. The most recent known incident in the Barents Sea was in July 2021, when three nuclear-capable US B-52 bombers approached Russian airspace, but were escorted away before they could trespass. According to Russian officials, the number of reconnaissance NATO flights near the state border grew by more than 30% in 2021.",4.674443784785535,3.782654367070051,0.8917894177154841,0
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560893-former-pentagon-adviser-russian-offensive/,Ukraine failed to mount counteroffensive – ex-Pentagon adviser,"The Ukrainian military has not been able to pull off its promised counteroffensive, and Russian forces are now likely to take over the whole of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, Colonel Douglas Macgregor, a former adviser to the secretary of defense in the Trump administration, has said. Appearing on a livestream hosted by former US judge and columnist Andrew Napolitano last Tuesday, Macgregor dismissed as “utterly nonsensical” reports in some US media outlets that the Russian military has lost some 80,000 personnel in Ukraine so far. According to the decorated Gulf War veteran, “more accurate numbers are probably thirteen to fifteen thousand dead on the Russian side,” with Ukrainian forces having lost “sixty to eighty thousand.” Commenting on these reports in late July, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the alleged Russian casualty figures as “fake.” He also lamented that even established media outlets are publishing misleading reports these days. The last time Russia’s Defense Ministry provided an update on the number of casualties was in late March, at which time the official death toll had reached 1,351, with 3,825 service members injured. When asked to comment on the current state of affairs on the frontline, the former Pentagon official said that the majority of Russian personnel had been given rest, “refitted, reorganized,” to renew the offensive in August. Macgregor claimed that the first signs of that happening were already evident, “particularly down in the south.” He went on to predict that the Russian military would seize the key port city of Odessa, making Ukraine a “landlocked country.” “Ukrainians have been unable to put together any sort of counteroffensive. So, I don’t see much evidence that the Ukrainians can stop this,” the former Pentagon adviser claimed. Moreover, Macgregor said that the activities of Russian forces south of Kharkov in the east of Ukraine seemed to him like preliminary “shaping operations” meant to pave the way for a major offensive later on. He concluded that “first comes the operation in the south and then subsequently up in Kharkov,” pointing out once more that the Ukrainian army does not appear to be able to stop either one. Macgregor added that he expected these offensives to be over by the “end of August-beginning of September.” Last month, a number of top Ukrainian officials suggested that the country’s military would launch a counteroffensive in the south of the country in August to retake the city of Kherson. However, according to Moscow, it is the Russian military along with the forces of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics that have recently made advances and taken territory. On Saturday, Igor Konashenkov, the spokesperson for Russia’s Defense Ministry announced that the “allied forces completely liberated” the strategic village of Peski in the Donetsk People’s Republic.",3.686747638977347,2.496142552087931,1.1906050868894162,2
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/news/560888-robot-dog-army-2022-expo/,Robot dog wields grenade launcher at Russian army expo (VIDEO),"The Russian company Intellect Machine unveiled the first prototype of the M-81 robotic system during Russia’s Army 2022 expo, which opened on Monday outside of Moscow. The dog-like robot is capable of conducting both military and civilian tasks, according to its creators. A spokesperson for the company told the RIA news agency that the robot can be used for a number of civilian applications, such as working in emergency zones and helping rescuers conduct reconnaissance, finding paths through rubble, or delivering medicine to trapped victims. However, the company representative added that the M-81 can also be adapted for combat situations, as it can conduct precision fire, identify targets, carry out patrols, and transport weapons and ammunition. During a demonstration held during the expo, the M-81 could be seen following a number of commands given by its owner all while carrying and occasionally aiming an unloaded rocket launcher on its back. As for its dog-like appearance and movement, Intellect Machine explained that the M-81 was heavily inspired by the principles of bionics in the animal world, particularly with regards to structures and mechanics. Intellect Machine says that the prototype presented at the Army 2022 expo, which was primarily built using Chinese components and technology, cost nearly 1 million rubles (~$16,000). However, the company says it hopes to launch production of these robots in Russia in the near future. Meanwhile, it’s hard not to notice the similarities between the M-81, the Boston Dynamics Spot, and the Chinese-made Go1. All such robots tend toward a dog-like appearance and are seemingly able to carry out similar tasks. The US Army has already reportedly agreed to provide one Spot robotic dog to help a charity clean up battlefields in Ukraine. HALO Trust, a US-based demining organization, said back in June that it intends to use Spot to remove mines, mortar shells and unexploded munitions from areas near the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, according to executive director Chris Whatley.",3.139690754663235,2.8230143457754546,0.31667640888778026,0
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560884-poland-crossings-border-revealed/,Poland reveals number of crossings from Ukraine,"Over 5 million people have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since Russia launched its operation in the neighboring country, the Polish Border Guard reported on Monday. The agency said on Twitter that “since February 24, the border guards have checked 5.519 million people who crossed the border from Ukraine to Poland.” Just last Sunday alone, 24,300 crossings were recorded, the agency added. The number of crossings in the other direction – from Poland into Ukraine – since the start of the conflict is approaching 3.7 million, according to the data. Most of those represent people coming back to areas considered safe, or those who didn't managed to settle abroad, media reports indicate. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) provides slightly smaller but comparable figures of just over 5.2 million crossings from Ukraine into Poland and a little more than 3.2 million crossings from Poland into Ukraine. In March, Warsaw provided Ukrainian nationals with the right to stay legally in the country for 18 months. Nearly 1.3 million Ukrainians have been granted temporary residency status in Poland – more than in any other Western country, the UNHCR statistics show. However, given the large influx of refugees, Poland stopped providing financial aid to most Ukrainians last month. Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker explained the move by saying that “many people in Poland are able to become independent and adapt.” Meanwhile, according to a think tank called the Polish Economic Institute, the volume of aid provided by individual Poles to Ukrainian refugees has been decreasing since the first weeks of the military conflict, though it has “remained relatively high.” “The largest decrease concerned the two most popular categories of aid. Right after the start of the war, 51% of Poles bought items for refugees; after two months, this has decreased to 39%. At the beginning, 46% of Poles made cash donations; this then dropped to 33%,” the think tank said in a July report. Nevertheless, in the period between the end of February and the end of June, Poles donated almost 10 billion zlotys ($2 billion) to help Ukrainians. This amount surpasses their charitable contributions for the whole of 2021, according to the report. Earlier in August, the European Commission agreed to provide more than €31 ($31.6) million “to support people fleeing Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and for the economic recovery of four Polish regions” through its REACT-EU program.",3.379900282995228,2.7408257553867235,0.6390745276085044,7
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560842-afghanistan-us-year-after/,"The price of defeat: The US fled Afghanistan exactly a year ago, but the real consequences are yet to come","The Americans were preparing to pull their troops out of Afghanistan for months, but the operation still turned out to be a disaster. Footage of young Afghans clinging to Lockheed C-5 Galaxy cargo planes at Kabul Airport went viral all over the world. And although it seems these images have vanished from mainstream discourse, the consequences of those events are yet to come. RT asked experts what President Joe Biden’s first and most important foreign policy decision cost his administration. The Cold War was full of symbols. One of the most striking of these was footage of US military personnel pushing helicopters off the landing deck of the destroyer USS Kirk in the Mekong Gulf in 1975. The helicopters had been operated by pilots taking part in the US military mission in South Vietnam who were removing diplomatic staff from a besieged Saigon, along with their families. They no longer planned to return to the burning capital, so the expensive aircraft were sunk in the South China Sea. While the helicopters on the deck of the Kirk were a striking, albeit isolated, case of such an incident being caught on camera, the multi-day flight of thousands of people fearing the Islamist dictatorship of the Taliban, who were rapidly taking control of Kabul, was shown on all social networks. The situation was exacerbated by a terrorist attack in the now almost forgotten style of the aughts. On August 26, an explosion was heard in an airport terminal building packed with refugees. Approximately 170 civilians and 13 American servicemen were killed. At the same time, the world was innundated by videos of groups of grim men in turbans sitting at tables in the government offices of the presidential palace. Kalashnikov assault rifles from all over the world, as well as American M4s and Swiss SGs, could also be seen in the frame. George W. Bush, who started the Afghan War, promised to quickly end the scarcely comprehensible conflict launched as a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But this did not work out for him, nor for his successors Barack Obama or Donald Trump. It was clear to both the military and politicians that it was probably impossible to do so without suffering critical losses. Trump came closest to withdrawing troops by concluding an agreement with the Taliban that was criticized in the United States, but his defeat in the presidential election prevented him from finishing the job. As a result, responsibility for the exodus of Americans from Afghanistan fell on Joseph Biden, who had already studied the problem as vice president under Obama and firmly linked his fate with this operation during the election race. Referring to a report by the Watson Institute, a Washington Post article on the troop withdrawal noted that 71,000 civilian Afghans and Pakistanis had died in the war over 20 years. The drone strike that followed the terrorist attack at the airport claimed the lives of ten civilians but was one of the last, if the recent (August 1, 2022) elimination of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was recognized as a terrorist, isn’t counted. The agreements with the Taliban and the chaotic evacuation from Kabul were the first significant foreign policy steps of the new Democrat administration after Trump left the White House. And, most likely, they have become a time bomb for the electoral prospects of the current cabinet and the top-tier of the Democratic Party in general. At least, experts interviewed by RT hold this view. “This was an important turning point in American history, the consequences of which will take several decades to see. In a narrower sense, the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan turned out to be the defining point of the entire policy of the Biden administration. It was a watershed moment,” Vladimir Vasiliev, chief researcher at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, said in a conversation with RT. “First of all, it caused a split in American society and the American political elite. There was polarization in the assessment of this event on the part of both parties and their leaders. In words, and maybe in deeds, the Democrats supported this initiative. Biden took full responsibility, believing that he had ended this 20-year war, which had cost the Americans a trillion dollars,” the expert added. According to Vasiliev, representatives of the Republican Party still consider the evacuation from Afghanistan comparable to the exit from South Vietnam and Southeast Asia in the mid-70s. In their pre-election narrative, this can still be used as justification to demand either the voluntary early resignation of the incumbent president, or even his impeachment, if a favorable political situation develops. According to Reuters, Biden’s current approval rating barely reaches 40%, whereas 55% of Americans are dissatisfied with his actions. The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan could be the starting point for the downfall of the Democrats. The ongoing pandemic, tensions in Asia, and an imminent economic recession are also contributing to the president’s declining popularity. Nancy Pelosi’s recent Asian tour may just have been an attempt to rectify the situation for the party. “While before the troop withdrawal, most Americans supported Biden, maybe blindly, maybe due to inertia – Afghanistan changed everything,” Vasiliev said. “Since then, his degree of public support has fallen sharply and is now at a critically low level. And today, we could even say this trend is irreversible.” According to available data, including an analysis by auditors from the public organization Open the Books, the US military left up to 650,000 weapons to the rapidly advancing Taliban forces. This includes 350,000 modern M4 assault rifles and obsolete M16s, 65,000 machine guns, 25,000 submachine guns, and 2,500 mortar launchers. According to the organization’s estimates, the Americans left up to 22,000 Humvees and 110 UH-60 Black Hawk combat helicopters. Even if these figures are an exaggeration (as seems to be the case), it is logical to assume that withdrawing all of America’s remaining troops within just a week after pumping the entire region with weapons for 20 years would result in precisely this outcome. Army General Austin Miller, a special forces soldier who was in charge of the troops in Afghanistan, demonstratively handed over his command before the start of the troop withdrawal and now works as an adviser in a private company. “We can only call what happened a ‘withdrawal operation’ with a grain of salt. In fact, it was a genuine escape, with allies thrown under the bus. Afghans who worked for the Americans, mountains of weapons worth billions of dollars, helicopters, and vehicles were all abandoned – it’s hard to call this a ‘withdrawal operation,’” Yuri Rogulev, director of the Foundation for the Study of the United States of the Moscow State University, said. “This flight marked a turning point for the Biden administration, after which its approval rating plummeted and never rebounded. After that, no matter what the White House took on, it ended up the same way – in failure. And in this sense, it is a symbolic act that lays bare all the contradictions in America’s relations with many countries and reveals its attitude towards former allies.” According to Vasiliev, the failure in Afghanistan put an end to the administration’s domestic political ambitions. One year on, the cabinet has been unable to implement any of the major policy initiatives in its domestic agenda. Given the circumstances, the Biden administration justified the withdrawal by saying, “We are leaving Afghanistan to focus our actions on countering Russia and China.” Despite all its “adventurism and absurdity,” this line began to be implemented and provoked the Russian side to take forceful measures. “This goes to show that the United States can do this to any of the protégés, allies, or clients that they supported,” Rogulev said, pointing to a century-old tradition of US foreign policy. “They have abandoned Afghanistan completely. They don’t provide it with any financial support or even humanitarian aid. This is also an example for Pakistan to keep in mind.” According to Vasiliev, the increased tensions surrounding Taiwan and US-Chinese relations are a direct consequence of the military detente in Afghanistan. In light of the unsuccessful end of the war in Afghanistan, he questions the Democratic Party’s prospects for retaining control in both chambers of Congress in the upcoming election. “The 2020 mandate has been exhausted,” Vasiliev said. “Approval ratings are ephemeral. They can climb. But since then, we have not seen an upswing. No fluctuations. So, to say that no one noticed the setback in Afghanistan would be a mistake. I think the images of the departing plane and people falling from it are still engraved in everyone’s memory,” Rogulev noted. Comparing this with the Vietnam flight of 1975, Rogulev makes one distinction. At that time, the US troops had been truly defeated. There was no defeat here – what happened was a demonstration of a lack of any common strategy or clear position. The fact that the troops were withdrawn was not the problem. “But how it was carried out and the consequences it has led to, both for Afghanistan and the rest of the world – that’s what we need to talk about.” Rogulev believes that the troop withdrawal has weakened America’s position in the Middle East. “The general image of the United States as a country that can bring something positive has disappeared in the region.” According to Vasiliev, an investigation into the matter still lies ahead, after which there will be a big shakeup in the US State Department. “This is a problem that has been kind of put off,” he said. “So far, no one has been held accountable.” “The Republicans tried to initiate this through Congress, but only a special bipartisan commission can identify the people responsible and give a real assessment. And as of today, there’s been none. It’s like the collapse of the Soviet Union – there is the fact that it happened, but everyone has to figure out why for themselves.”",2.8144368163719196,2.933627665960444,-0.11919084958852455,6
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560873-ukraine-boosts-military-spending/,Ukraine to boost military spending,"The Ukrainian parliament approved on Monday a boost to defense spending amid the ongoing military conflict with Russia. According to the bill passed by the Rada, the country’s parliament, the government will be authorized to raise an additional 270 billion hryvnias ($7.3 billion) through domestic borrowing. This will allow an extra 241 billion hryvnias ($6.5 billion) to be allocated to the Defense Ministry and for more funds to be provided to the police, security and intelligence services. The move comes after the Wall Street Journal reported that a shortage of funds risks becoming “Ukraine’s Achilles’s heel” in the conflict. “We have to worry about winning the war. It is better to risk high inflation than not to pay soldiers’ salaries,” Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko told the WSJ last week about the National Bank of Ukraine’s strategy of printing more money. Marchenko told news agency RBC Ukraine on Monday that Kiev hopes to receive $12-16 billion from foreign lenders by the end of 2022. The exact sum will depend on negotiations with foreign partners, he said.

It said the Russian Air Force had hit a mercenary deployment point in Kharkov Region. “More than 100 militants from Poland as well as Germany were killed, with more than 50 injured,” the statement read. According to the Defense Ministry, Russian airstrikes on the combat positions of the 63rd Ukrainian Mechanized Brigade in Kherson Region resulted in the 105th and 107th battalions of the unit losing more than 160 fighters. Meanwhile, an artillery attack on the positions of the 66th Ukrainian Mechanized Brigade in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) wiped out “more than 70% of personnel in the unit’s third battalion.” Another high-precision strike near the settlements of Ugledar, Vodyanoye and Dobrovolye, in the DPR, that was conducted against the 53rd Mechanized and 68th Chaser Infantry brigades killed more than 260 fighters. In early August, the ministry claimed that it had eliminated “more than 80 foreign mercenaries and 11 units of special equipment,” that were a part of Ukraine’s ‘International Legion’ in southeastern Ukraine. Earlier, the ministry revealed that since February 24 – the day Russia began its military offensive – more than 7,100 mercenaries from more than 60 countries had arrived in Ukraine. The military says that it is actively monitoring the foreign fighters and specialists, noting that their number had been reduced to 2,190 as of early August. In April, however, Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov stated that the best thing the foreign mercenaries could expect in Ukraine was a “long term in prison.” In June, he also noted that while hundreds had been killed by Russian long-range precision weapons “shortly after their arrival,” most of the foreign fighters were eliminated “due to a low level of training and a lack of real combat experience.” Regarding its own casualties, Moscow has not updated the numbers since March, when it reported 1,351 military personnel killed and 3,825 wounded.

2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560861-ukraine-ace-pilot-dies/,Ukraine’s ‘best fighter pilot’ killed,"A Ukrainian Air Force captain described by the military as an ace fighter pilot died while defending his homeland, his childhood school has reported in an obituary. It did not reveal the circumstances of his death. The institution in the city of Ivano-Frankovsk said on social media that Anton Listopad was “recognized in 2019 as the best pilot of the Ukrainian Air Force and took part in military action in the east of Ukraine.” A captain of that name was listed among those awarded with various merits by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky last month. The man has his own Wikipedia page in the Ukrainian version of the online encyclopedia, though it was only created two days before Zelensky’s order was published. The school that announced Listopad’s death published a biography of the man last year, according to which he joined the Ukrainian armed forces in 2010. He underwent two surgeries to qualify to be a combat pilot, and studied at a military aviation school in Kharkov, which he graduated from in 2018, realizing his childhood dream, the article said. Listopad was 31 at the time of his death, judging by the bio. The article included several photos of him as a student, piloting a fighter jet, and receiving the Order for Courage from Zelensky. The obituary stated that Listopad led the air parade over Kiev during last year’s celebration of the country’s independence, with “millions of Ukrainians watching with joy and pride.” The Russian military says it has virtually undisputed control of the airspace of a large part of Ukraine, making most combat missions by Ukrainian military pilots extremely dangerous. According to the latest update by the Russian Defense Ministry, more than 260 Ukrainian fighter jets have been destroyed during the conflict, both in the air and on the ground, by Russian warplanes and air defenses.",3.0606582938850764,2.6658939239126376,0.3947643699724388,0
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560858-un-blocking-iaea-zaporozhye-inspection/,Zaporozhye official explains why inspectors can’t reach nuclear plant,"Members of the UN are blocking a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant (ZNPP) so they can avoid confirming Kiev shelled the Russian-controlled facility, local official Vladimir Rogov told RT in an interview on Monday. Rogov, a member of the Zaporozhye military-civil administration, insisted that the ZNPP is always prepared to welcome the atomic energy watchdog, which has repeatedly expressed a desire to visit the facility, but noted that the UN has “directly started to block the possibility of an IAEA inspection.” The official suggested that if the agency does visit the plant, it would be forced to conclude that it had been shelled by Kiev’s forces. “It is obvious, it’s all been documented, and not only that, it’s also well known who is being supplied with American guided missiles. Obviously, not Russia, but the Zelensky regime.” The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant - the largest in Europe - has repeatedly come under attack over the past few weeks. While none of the reactors have so far been struck, the shelling has partially damaged a nearby thermal power plant as well as equipment used to cool the nuclear reactors. Moscow has accused Ukraine of using rockets, artillery and drones to attack the ZNPP and has described Kiev’s actions as “nuclear terrorism” and holding the whole of Europe hostage. Rogov stated that Western countries have “completely lost their instinct of self-preservation” in an economic, geopolitical and ecological sense, as a disaster at the ZNPP would spell trouble for European countries first and foremost. ""Nevertheless, we do not hear a single adequate statement, not a single voice of reason, either from Germany or from France,"" he noted. Kiev, meanwhile, has denied responsibility for shelling the plant and insists that it is Russia that has been targeting it in a plot to discredit Ukraine. The US State Department has taken Zelensky’s side and has called for a withdrawal of Russian forces from the area and the creation of a demilitarized zone around the plant. While that solution has been supported by the UN and the EU, Rogov insists that the West should instead be working to establish a ceasefire there. Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, has pointed out that if Russian forces were to leave the power plant it would be vulnerable to action by Kiev. “Those who propose the withdrawal of Russian troops should be aware of the consequences that this object will be left without protection and can be used by Kiev and nationalist groups for the most monstrous provocations,” said the Russian ambassador, stressing that Moscow does not use nuclear facilities for military purposes.",4.541710004489369,4.680831496214419,-0.13912149172505028,9
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560860-zelensky-fires-sbu-chiefs/,Zelensky fires security chiefs amid crackdown,"President Vladimir Zelensky on Monday fired the heads of three regional offices of the nation’s Security Service (SBU), Ukraine’s successor to the KGB. Earlier, he dismissed the top official in the agency, citing widespread treason among agents. The top security officials in the Kiev, Lviv, and Ternopol regions were fired by presidential decree. A new leader was immediately appointed to the SBU’s Kiev office but replacements for the other two have yet to be revealed. Zelensky’s move appears to be a continuation of the crackdown on the SBU that he launched in mid-July. At the time, he dismissed the head of the security agency, Ivan Bakanov, his deputy, and four regional SBU heads. He also sacked Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova. Zelensky claimed the shakeup was due to rampant “treason” under the leadership of the officials. The move was reportedly not perceived positively by the US government, which publicly maintains unwavering support for the Ukrainian president. But according to US media, White House officials have said privately that there is growing mistrust in Washington over Zelensky’s increasingly authoritarian rule. It has not been uncommon for Ukrainian officials to question the loyalty of citizens amid the armed conflict with Russia. Nikolaev Governor Vitaly Kim suggested he may place his region’s capital on lockdown to conduct a Bolshevik-style purge of Russian sympathizers, saying he trusts no one. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked.",3.022714333424214,3.5698712765647906,-0.5471569431405765,2
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560848-space-station-russia-model-iss/,Russia unveils look of its new space station,"The Russian space agency unveiled a mockup of its new orbital station for the first time on Monday, after Moscow revealed earlier this year that it plans to leave the International Space Station (ISS) after 2024. Roscosmos showcased the model of the Russian Orbital Station (ROS) during the Army 2022 International Military-Technical Forum. According to the agency, Energia Space Corporation, which is a part of Roscosmos, is now developing a sketch of the future space station, with its deployment set to unfold in two stages. The first stage will involve four modules – a science power module, a node, a core module, and a gateway, Roscosmos said. At this stage, the crew will consist of two people. The second stage will add two more modules to the station – target and production modules – as well as a servicing platform, the agency added. After this, the crew will be increased to four. “Among the new features and capabilities of the national station, the developers single out huge energy potential for purpose-oriented tasks, unification of modules, the possibility of interaction with next-generation satellite groupings and various modes of operation,” Roscosmos said. In late July, Roscosmos chief Yury Borisov said Russia will withdraw from the ISS after 2024, adding that Moscow intends to fulfill its obligations to its foreign partners. He noted at the time that the decision has nothing to do with geopolitics, including the Ukraine conflict. Later, Sergey Krikalev, the executive director for manned space programs at Roscosmos, clarified that the timing for pulling out depends on the technical state of the ISS, and could come at any time after 2024. Last year, Vladimir Solovyov, a former Soviet cosmonaut and chief designer for spacecraft manufacturer RSC Energia, said Russia would start construction on its own space station as early as in 2028. The project will be built on the Science Power Module 1, which was originally designed for the ISS, but is now being repurposed, Solovyov said at the time. The former head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, predicted that the ISS, which NASA plans to operate until 2030, would “fall apart” by that time unless “huge amounts of money” are invested in repairs.",2.8675946572896343,2.3985491214846135,0.46904553580502073,6
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560850-ukraine-budget-bankrupt-moscow/,‘Ukraine is bankrupt’ – Moscow,"Ukraine has lost its financial independence as it cannot meet its obligations to its citizens without Western help, Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin wrote on Monday. Taking to Telegram, Volodin claimed that “collected taxes form only 40% of the country's budget,” more than 60% of which covers military spending. Ukraine’s monthly deficit amounts to $5 billion, Volodin reminded. “Ukraine is bankrupt,” he said. The same numbers were reported on Friday by the Wall Street Journal. In the speaker’s opinion, “without the help of Washington and Brussels, Kiev can no longer fulfill its obligations to citizens.” “Ukraine has lost its financial independence,” Volodin concluded. On Monday, the Ukrainian government introduced draft legislation to abolish preferential taxation on fuel. An explanatory note on the Rada’s website says that “there is a significant shortage of funds for financing the road industry.” The legislation is poised to create “during the period of martial law” conditions “for the proper functioning of the economy” and increased budget revenue through excise duties. In a recent interview with RBK Ukraine, Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko said that next year's budget will be “extremely tight” due to “war conditions.” “There will be no expenses that will not be reviewed,” he said. According to Oleg Ustenko, a presidential adviser on economic issues, Ukraine’s state budget deficit is expected to reach $50 billion by the end of the year. That is about 30-35% of the country’s GDP, he said in a TV interview last month, adding that “this is a problem of war.” Kiev says it needs $5 billion a month in assistance from Western backers. However, Ustenko, quoted by the Financial Times, said in July they would need an extra $4 billion a month over the next three months to cover the cost of emergency accommodation and housing repairs for millions of people, and to fund a basic minimum income for those who had lost their jobs. The grants and loans pledged to Ukraine by the West have been arriving much slower than expected. So far, only €1 billion out of a €9 billion ($9.3 billion) long-term loan package proposed by the European Commission in May has arrived. Since February, the EU has provided €2.2 billion. The United States Agency for International Development announced in mid-July that it would send an additional $1.7 billion, bringing the agency’s total spending on Ukraine to $4 billion. Last week, Ukraine’s finance minister said that his country expects $3 billion of US financial aid to arrive in August and a further $1.5 billion in September. According to Marchenko, the payments are part of an agreed $7.5 billion financial aid package, and would be used to finance “critical spending” such as healthcare and pension costs.",2.6251632830748663,2.4868770183929234,0.13828626468194294,7
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560847-klitschko-zelensky-citizenship-threat/,Kiev mayor claims Zelensky’s government threatened his citizenship,"The government of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky made a veiled threat to strip the citizenship of Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko, the head of the Ukrainian capital claimed in an interview published on Monday. “I had a conversation with an innuendo: ‘Since you are so proactive, we could look into your German citizenship’. I said: ‘I’d be very surprised if somebody showed me a German passport in my name and took it away,’” he said, as cited by the website Babel. The exchange allegedly happened after Klitschko signed a public call for Zelensky to reverse his decision to revoke the Ukrainian citizenship of Ukrainian official Gennady Korban, which he ordered last month. Korban, a longtime close ally of Dnepr Mayor Boris Filatov, was among several Ukrainians whose citizenship was taken away by Zelensky. He was on a foreign trip when the move was made. Upon attempting to return to Ukraine he found himself at an impasse when the border guards would not let him cross back into his home country. Over a hundred Ukrainian public figures supported the open letter to Zelensky, which Filatov published on Facebook in late July. Klitschko declined to reveal who exactly put pressure on him, but said he supported reinstating Korban’s citizenship on principle rather than as a political favor to Filatov. “Everything must happen under universal principles, not selectively,” he explained. “In this case this is how it looks: we’ll take this one’s [citizenship] and let others keep theirs, so that they are more pliable, realizing that we can take theirs too.” Ukraine disallows dual citizenship. Under the law, Ukrainians who also hold foreign passports are treated as regular citizens but are banned from holding public office. The president may revoke the citizenship of a Ukrainian who takes another passport. In practice, however, this principle is often ignored. For instance, billionaire Igor Kolomoysky, one of the people targeted by Zelensky’s July order, had served as a governor in Ukraine despite holding the citizenship of Cyprus and Israel at the time. The fact was widely known in Ukraine, and Kolomoysky even joked that it was OK, since the law bans dual citizenship, not triple citizenship. In the interview, Klitschko provided assurance that Ukrainian citizenship is the only one he has. The official was a world-renowned boxer before going into politics and spent much of his athletic career in Germany. Korban, whose parents are Israelis, has long denied rumors that he holds a passport of the Jewish state. “I always take pleasure in vacationing in Israel. But I have no intention to ask for asylum or citizenship there since I plan to continue my career in my homeland, Ukraine,” he told the media in 2015, responding to reports that he may leave the country. The issue was brought back into the media spotlight after Zelensky’s order and remains murky. Israel’s ambassador to Ukraine, Michael Brodsky, said his nation does not normally disclose if a person has its citizenship to protect privacy. “As far as I know, no requests of that nature came from Ukraine,” he added.",3.019438281296335,3.5899280559627615,-0.5704897746664264,5
2022-08-15,https://www.rt.com/russia/560839-ben-wallace-crimea-bridge/,British leaders discussed 'destruction' of Crimean bridge – Ukrainian MP,"A Ukrainian lawmaker says he discussed the “destruction” of Europe's longest bridge with UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace in June. Aleksey Goncharenko was responding to a claim on Russian television that Wallace was personally in charge of developing a plan to strike the strategically important crossing, linking Crimea to the Krasnodar region. The remark, which Goncharenko made on Telegram, last week, included a photo of himself with Wallace and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson during a NATO gathering. It was captioned ""Tell [host Olga] Skabeeva that Ben Wallace and I discussed a plan to destroy the Crimean Bridge back in June."" The allegation arose during a TV appearance by Russian military expert and journalist Igor Konashenko, who said that “according to some information”, the British defence minister was in charge of developing plans to attack the bridge, which connects Crimea with mainland Russia across the Kerch Strait. The bridge was built by Russia after Crimea broke away from Ukraine and voted to rejoin Russia in 2014 to ensure that there were railway and road links with the region. The Ukrainian government earlier dismissed calls for it to be destroyed, but Kiev now considers the bridge to be a primary military target that should be attacked as soon as it receives Western weapons capable of striking it. Konashenko was on air to share his thoughts on this revised position, which Ukrainian Major General Dmitry Marchenko announced last month. The UK is a major supplier of advanced heavy weapons to Kiev, most notably the M270 multiple rocket launchers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the general’s statement, saying that it was hardly novel. “We are certainly aware of such threats and take them into consideration,” he said at the time. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed confidence that any plans to attack the bridge would fail. Goncharenko is a controversial political figure in Ukraine who has a record of anti-Russian publicity stunts and posts. One of his latest is a picture of the Crimea Bridge with the dog from the “It’s fine” meme sitting on it. “A good remark from comments: add some fire,” he wrote under the picture. In the original work the anthropomorphic dog sits in a house engulfed by flames, ignoring the obvious threat.

Data provided by the company indicates that it is capable of firing 800 rounds per minute. According to Russian media, bullets fired from the gun have a velocity of nearly 470 meters per second and are capable of penetrating IIIA level body armor – one of the highest armor classes for concealable, lightweight soft protection. The machine pistol weighs just under 3kg, has a sound moderator, and a standardized mounting rail interface similar to the Picatinny rail used in Western weapons. The PPK-20 was first presented by Kalashnikov at the ARMY 2021 exhibition last year. The SVCh, or Chukavin Sniper Rifle, is a new generation of designated marksman rifles designed to replace the Soviet-made Dragunov Sniper Rifles (SVD). It is lighter than its predecessor, has higher precision, and is capable of hitting targets at a distance of around 1,200 meters. The small size of this semi-automatic rifle also makes it effective at middle-range distances and even in close combat.

A local 49-year-old resident was killed in the strike, he added. Energodar hosts the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest such facility in Europe. The man was walking his dog when the shelling began, according to Rogov. A 24-year-old woman was also injured in the attack, he said, adding that she had been sent to a hospital. The Ukrainian strike also targeted an area near the city’s thermal power plant, where the shelling caused a fire close to the facility, the official said. Moscow has repeatedly blamed Ukraine for shelling the Russia-held Zaporozhye nuclear plant over the past week. On Thursday, Russia’s Ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, told the Security Council that a nuclear disaster could happen “at any moment” amid the “reckless” shelling of the plant by Kiev’s forces. “Kiev’s criminal attacks on the nuclear infrastructure facilities are pushing the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster that would rival the Chernobyl one,” Nebenzya said at that time. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also expressed concern over the developments at the plant and suggested sending an IAEA mission to the facility to assess the situation. The initiative was welcomed by Moscow. Kiev, in turn, has blamed Russia for targeting the plant in an alleged plot to discredit Ukraine – an accusation Moscow dismissed by saying it had no reason to target its own troops. Washington, meanwhile, has sided with Kiev in its demand for a demilitarized zone around the nuclear plant and the withdrawal of the Russian troops controlling the area.",4.413699171890635,6.157324786069724,-1.7436256141790887,9
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560820-ukraine-ambassador-crowdfunding-begging/,Russia ridicules Ukrainian ambassador for ‘begging',"Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has shamed Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Vasily Miroshnichenko, for “begging and vagrancy,” after he launched a crowdfunding appeal to send his daughter to a top-tier London university. “It’s not a joke,” Zakharova wrote in a Telegram post on Sunday, explaining that the ambassador had posted a link to the crowdfunding page on his official Facebook and Twitter accounts. “First, he wrote how he showed his daughter American universities, and then he reported that she chose a British education after his fascinating stories,” Zakharova continued. “Begging and vagrancy are the basis of the Kiev regime’s ‘diplomacy,’” she added, remarking that Ukraine “was squandered” through such grift. In a Facebook post last month, Miroshnichenko said that he had taken his daughter, Yaroslava (Yasia), on a road trip to California to look at universities four years ago. With Yasia recently turning 19, he said that she had chosen not to attend any of the US schools, and would instead study chemistry and management at University College London, an institution rated 18th in the world on the Times Higher Education rankings. Miroshnichenko posted a link to a crowdfunding appeal by Yasia, who is seeking £30,000 ($36,400) to cover tuition and living costs for her first year in London. Yasia wrote on the crowdfunding website that she had been granted a British visa under a scheme for Ukrainian refugees and qualified for domestic tuition. At UCL, this means that she will pay the same £9,250 per year rate as British students, instead of the £31,200 charged to international students. “It’s still a huge amount of money for my family to pull off,” she wrote. “Therefore, I need your support.” Miroshnichenko has served as Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia and New Zealand since March. Although his net worth is not publicly available, it is highly unlikely that his family cannot afford Yasia’s university fees.

2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560822-poland-russia-eu-visa-ban-plan/,Poland reveals plan for EU-wide Russian visa ban,"Warsaw is currently developing a draft proposal that would allow the EU refuse visas to Russian travelers, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Piotr Wawrzyk told the nation’s PAP news agency on Sunday. A decision on the matter can be expected within the coming weeks, he added. The deputy minister did not elaborate on the exact details of the proposal, which is still in the works, but said that its purpose is to head off the potential resistance of some key EU members that are likely to oppose a blanket visa ban on all Russians. Poland is in favor of suspending the 2007 agreement between Brussels and Moscow on “the facilitation of the issuance of visas” altogether. This treaty regulates the issuance of visas “for an intended stay of no more than 90 days per period of 180 days” for the citizens of Russia and the EU. Yet, according to Wawrzyk, not all EU members are on board with such an initiative. “This is opposed by large member states, including Germany, France and the Netherlands,” he said. Since it is “impossible to overcome the resistance of these countries to suspend the agreement … Poland is working on a new solution,” he added. Warsaw has already been holding talks with some EU member states “for several weeks,” the deputy minister said, adding that Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia as well as the Czech Republic and Slovakia are aligned with Poland’s approach to the issue. “We can expect a decision on this matter in the coming weeks,” Wawrzyk said. The deputy minister welcomed the decisions of Tallinn and Riga to suspend or limit the issuance of visas to Russians. “Better late than never,” he said, adding that Poland has not been issuing tourist visas to Russians for several months already. Warsaw only admits diplomats, truck drivers traveling to Poland for work, and family members of Polish and EU citizens. Earlier this week, the Czech Republic, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, said it would push for a blanket EU ban on Russians. The bloc’s members will discuss the issue at a ministerial summit in Prague in late August. Latvia stopped issuing visas to nearly all Russian citizens earlier this month, citing security concerns. Estonia said on Thursday it would do the same. Tallinn also plans to ban current Russian holders of Estonian visas from entering starting on August 18. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas called travelling to the EU “a privilege, not a human right” last week as she called on other member states to follow suit. Finland’s government, which advocates the same measure, is expected to discuss potential limits on issuing visas to Russians on Tuesday, Finnish YLE broadcaster reported. Germany has so far been one of the few EU nations opposing such a move. Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed skepticism over a potential blanket ban, arguing it would diminish the effectiveness of other sanctions by targeting “innocent people.” Moscow has blasted the proposed measures as “flagrant nationalism” and xenophobia. The Kremlin also expressed its hope that “common sense” would prevail over time.",2.2618059974210767,1.5444782896040627,0.7173277078170139,8
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560301-nikolai-family-regicide-urals/,The last Tsar: How Russia commemorates the brutal communist murder of Emperor Nikolai II's family,"On the night of July 16-17, 1918, the Bolsheviks shot the family of the last Russian tsar, Nikolai II. Eleven people were killed in total: The emperor, the empress, five of their children, and four royal servants. The remains were secretly buried in an abandoned mine, the location of which was hidden until the collapse of the Soviet Union. The family of Nikolai II was subsequently canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church, and for the last 30 years, in mid-July, Christians from all over the world participate in a church procession from the murder site in Ekaterinburg to a monastery in Ganina Yama. An RT correspondent learned the story of this extrajudicial massacre and talked to pilgrims about their attitude to the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers. In March of 1917, before the October Revolution, Russia’s provisional government decided to arrest the royal family. At first, the Romanov's lived at Tsarskoye Selo, but in August, they were forced to go to Tobolsk. In the spring of 1918, the group was moved to Ekaterinburg, where they stayed in the house of an engineer named Nikolay Ipatiev, which had been requisitioned by the Bolsheviks, and sometimes received food from the nuns of the Novo-Tikhvin convent. On the night of July 16-17, 1918, Nikolai II, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, Grand Duchesses Anastasia, Tatiana, Olga, and Maria, Tsarevich Alexei, imperial doctor Evgeny Botkin, imperial cook Ivan Kharitonov, the empress’ housemaid Anna Demidova, and the tsar’s valet Aloysius Troup, were all shot by Bolsheviks under the command of Yakov Yurovsky. Shortly afterwards, the murder of the royal family was investigated by Nikolay Alekseevich Sokolov, a judicial investigator for particularly important cases with the Omsk District Court. The civil war between the Communists and their opponents was still raging in Russia in 1918. On July 25, anti-Bolshevik forces from the Siberian army occupied Ekaterinburg. At the beginning of February 1919, Sokolov was summoned by the Supreme Governor, Admiral Alexander Kolchak, and instructed to launch an investigation. After the execution of Kolchak by the Communists in the winter of 1920, the investigator left the country and continued to take testimony from witnesses in Western Europe. In Paris, he interviewed Prince Lvov, the former chairman of the provisional government’s Council of Ministers, as well as its former minister of justice, Kerensky, and minister of foreign affairs, Milyukov. Kerensky cited two main reasons for the arrest of the tsar and his family. The first was the “agitated mood” of workers and soldiers who wanted to deal with the sovereign. The second was “high-ranking officers” who thought the emperor and empress intended to conclude a “separate peace” with Germany. Sokolov’s book entitled ‘The Murder of the Royal Family’, which contains materials from the investigation, was published in Berlin in 1925. He had been one step away from solving the mystery of whereabouts of the tsar’s remains but did not have time to discover them before the Bolsheviks took the area. The key document containing details about the regicide is a note from 1920 written by Yurovsky, who had overseen the killing. According to his memoirs, on a night in July 1918, the royal family and their servants were told: “‘Due to unrest in the city, it is necessary to transfer the Romanov family from the upper floor to the lower one’… When the team entered, the commandant told the Romanovs that, since their relatives in Europe [probably meaning German troops under the leadership of the empress’ cousin, Emperor Wilhelm II – ed. note] were continuing their offensive against Soviet Russia… the [Ural] District’s executive committee had decided to shoot them. Nikolai turned his back to the team and faced his family. Then, as if coming to his senses, he turned to the commandant and asked: ‘What? What?’ The commandant hastily repeated his words and ordered the team to prepare. The team was told in advance who was to shoot at whom and ordered to aim directly at the heart in order to avoid a large amount of blood and end the affair as quickly as possible. Nikolai said nothing more and turned back to his family. The others uttered several incoherent exclamations for several seconds. Then the shooting began and lasted two to three minutes. Nikolai was killed on the spot by the commandant himself. Then, Alexandra Feodorovna and the Romanovs’ servants died immediately... Alexey, three of his sisters, the lady-in-waiting [Anna Demidova], and Botkin were still alive. This surprised the commandant, because they were aiming directly at the heart. They had to be shot again. It was also surprising that the bullets ricocheted off something, like hail, and bounced around the room. When they tried to stab one of the girls with a bayonet, the bayonet could not pierce the bodice. Thanks to all this, the whole procedure, counting the ‘check’, took 20 minutes.” According to the note, the bodies were supposed to be buried in an abandoned mine nearby. However, shortly after the murder, it turned out that no one knew where it was, and nothing had been prepared to carry out the burial. In addition, the Bolsheviks were prevented from ending the affair as soon they wished, as the perpetrators of the murder made sporadic attempts to steal valuables from their victims. A car left Ekaterinburg with the bodies and stopped near the village of Koptyaki, where another abandoned mine was found in a nearby forest. The bodies were stripped and lowered down. The Bolsheviks tried to avoid inconvenient witnesses. They even announced in the village of Koptyaki that Czechs, who were armed opponents of the Soviet government, were hiding in the forest and that it would be searched. No one was allowed to leave the village. “The idea arose to bury some of the corpses right there in the mine,” Yurovsky writes. “They began to dig a hole and had almost dug it out when a peasant friend of Ermakov [who aided in hiding the bodies] drove up and it turned out that he could see the pit.” In 2000, the monastery of the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers was established in the Ganina Yama tract. Some Orthodox consider this to be the final burial place of the royal remains. Later, at a meeting of old Bolsheviks in 1934, Yurovsky described the vicissitudes of the burial in more detail. On the morning of July 17, water covered the bodies that had been put in the mine. They wanted to blow up the mine with bombs, but nothing came of it. They decided to “transport the corpses to another place.” Yurovsky instructed his subordinates to remove the bodies. “I had a plan, in case any problems arose, to bury them in groups, in different places along the roadway.” Then they began to dig a new hole, but at some point, the already mentioned acquaintance of Ermakov saw it and the plan failed. “After waiting for evening, we loaded the cart… It was already approaching midnight when I decided it was necessary to bury them somewhere nearby, since no one could see this place… I sent them to get railroad ties to cover the place where the corpses would be buried... About two months ago, I was leafing through a book by Sokolov, the investigator on extremely important cases, and I saw a picture of these railway ties. It says that they had been laid there to help trucks pass. So, after digging up the whole area, they didn’t think to look under the railway ties.” While Sokolov was able to find traces of members of the imperial family near the Ganina Yama, he never found the bodies themselves. “A bonfire was immediately lit, and while the grave was being prepared, we burned two corpses: those of Alexei and Demidova [in fact, Grand Duchess Maria – ed. note], who we burned instead of Alexandra Feodorovna by mistake. A pit was dug near the fire. We put the bones in and covered it. Another large fire was lit on top, and all traces were hidden by ashes. Meanwhile, a mass grave was dug for the others… Before putting the rest of the corpses into the pit, we poured sulfuric acid over them. Then we lowered them into the pit, poured more sulfuric acid on them, filled in the pit, and covered it with railroad ties. The empty truck drove over them a few times to tamp them down and that was it. At 5-6am, we gathered everyone and explained the significance of what we’d done, warning that everyone should forget about what they’d seen and never talk about it with anyone. Then we went to the city.” In 2015, an investigator in the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation named Vladimir Solovyov said that Pyotr Voykov had written out a purchase order for sulfuric acid. A metro station in the north of Moscow still bears the name ‘Voykovskaya’. The imperial family’s final burial place under a platform of railway ties was not a secret for all Soviet citizens – apparently, high-ranking party functionaries knew about it. Literary critics believe that this place was even shown to the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky in 1928. The result of the visit was his poem ‘The Emperor’. The first to discover the royal remains in Soviet times was geologist Alexander Avdonin, a graduate of the Ural Mining Institute. In the 1960s, Avdonin met Gennady Lisin from the Ural Worker publishing house. Lisin claimed that he’d been a member of the Boy Scouts and had helped White investigators search for the burial site in his youth. It was he who showed Avdonin Ganina Yama. In 1976, Geli Ryabov, a screenwriter from Moscow and an honored employee of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, went to Avdonin. A few years later, Avdonin thoroughly examined the Old Koptyakov Road, along which the Bolsheviks had once transported the bodies of the Romanovs. In the town of Porosenkov Log near Ekaterinburg, he found the same railway ties. Under them, the geologist managed to find skulls and bones. Ryabov took two skulls to Moscow in the hope of conducting an examination. However, no one agreed to help him before the collapse of the USSR. Later, Avdonin and Ryabov decided to rebury the wooden box containing the remains near the place it was discovered – until better times. In 1989, Ryabov told the Moscow News that he had found the imperial remains, and interest in the tsarist mystery grew rapidly among amateur geologists. Avdonin began to worry about the fate of the remains and wrote a letter to the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, Boris Yeltsin, who instructed the governor of Sverdlovsk Region, Eduard Rossel, to deal with the issue. In 1993, Rossel was briefly the head of the Ural Republic, a de facto entity in the Russian Federation that was not provided for by the Constitution. The governor believed that the Urals should become more independent in economic and legislative terms. In November, the initiative was finally curtailed, and Rossel was dismissed. Ural historians and journalists suspect that the governor may have been using the royal remains as a bargaining chip with the federal authorities up until that moment. In 1998, after numerous examinations, the remains were buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg in the presence of Yeltsin. At that time, the Russian Orthodox Church did not recognize the authenticity of the remains, and Patriarch Alexy II did not attend the funeral. Among the discovered remains, two of the dead were missing. In 2007, a search team found the remains of Grand Duchess Maria and Tsarevich Alexei 75 meters from the main burial site. In March 2022, ex-Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, chairman of the Moscow Patriarchate’s Department for External Church Relations, stated that “We now have clear and sufficient evidence that the ‘Ekaterinburg remains’ are the genuine remains of members of the royal family… It seems to me that the arguments supporting the authenticity of the ‘Ekaterinburg remains’ significantly outwfeigh any arguments that could refute it.” The church could have officially recognized the authenticity of the remains at the Bishops’ Council in May, but this had to be postponed. Sixty years after the October Revolution, Ipatiev’s house was demolished. Yeltsin was then the first secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU. In 2003, a Church-on-Blood was erected on this site, and in 1992, the tradition of holding a penitential procession was born. Its current route was established in 1994. The Romanov Memorial is now located in the Porosenkov Log tract. Ilya Korovin, the director of the memorial, who is a supporter of Avdonin’s theory concerning the preserved remains, told RT that the procession route does not include this cultural heritage site. In 2018, Patriarch Kirill participated in the procession. After four years, believers again walk around 20 kilometers from the Church-on-Blood to the monastery of the Holy Royal Passion-Bearers in the Ganina Yama tract. This year, there were 50,000 pilgrims, according to the St. Catherine’s Foundation. In conversations with RT during the procession, believers shared their views on whether the Church should officially recognize the royal remains. Some believe this would be the right thing to do, putting an end to the ‘biggest crime’ in Russian history. Others, on the contrary, do not believe the remains found by Avdonin are authentic, holding that they were probably destroyed in Ganina Yama. The procession begins at 2:30am Ural time. It is headed by church leaders, followed by a long column of Orthodox Christians, who hail not only from Russia, but also from Western Europe, Latin America, and Asia. In less than four hours, the first pilgrims appear at the final point of the route – the monastery at Ganina Yama. Orthodox Christians in comfortable sneakers carrying bottles of water cheerfully sing “Lord, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us!” The former mine is now enclosed by a gallery filled with portraits of the royal passion-bearers and their faithful servants. RT spoke with people born in the Urals who say that they participated in the procession as children, and now help their elderly parents walk along this long route.",4.805091716346015,4.3162256360048445,0.48886608034117085,4
2022-08-14,https://www.rt.com/russia/560817-lithuania-minister-visa-ban/,Lithuania wants EU visa ban for Russian opposition,"A blanket Schengen visa ban for Russian citizens would allow more people who disapprove of the government to be kept in the country, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on Saturday. These people would thus become a driving force of political change, he believes. In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the minister talked about what he sees as an unfair situation when Ukrainians are fleeing their country or fighting for their homes, while Russians can still enjoy traveling to the bloc. When asked if he would like to see a Schengen visa ban applied to those Russians who are against the military action in Ukraine and who might be facing persecution in their own country, Landsbergis said that he believes that “change comes from within.” Therefore, he argued, the scenario of ‘two Russias,’ one of which would be in emigration, is not vital. He stressed that even if only 5-10% people in Russia oppose the country's actions in Ukraine, that would still mean millions of people. The real change – the establishment of “democratic Russia” – will be prompted by those people, and thus it is better if they stay in their home country, the minister said. Landsbergis argued that the EU could impose a total ban on visas for Russian citizens, except for those who apply on humanitarian grounds. He said that his country, by working with various non-government organizations, has already found a good way to establish when humanitarian grounds are valid. The three Baltic countries – Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia – have been known for their harsh policies towards Russia and were among the first nations to impose visa restrictions on Russian citizens in response to Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine. They are now at the forefront of the call for an EU-wide visa ban. Germany and many EU officials, however, have been skeptical of the idea. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz cited the “very far-reaching sanctions” imposed on Russia and said that a visa ban would weaken their effectiveness “if it was directed against everyone, including innocent people.” A spokeswoman for the European Commission said that a total ban would simply be unlawful and that each application must be considered individually. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, commenting in July on the Schengen visa ban proposals, said that Moscow hopes that the EU would show common sense. However, he didn’t rule out “actions of an emotional nature.”",2.5068063358973656,2.616628715535829,-0.10982237963846364,8

According to the outlet, the Russian military operation in Ukraine has caused Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to fear that “they will be next to come under attack.” “HIMARS, Reapers, counter-battery radars: these are what we will need most in terms of military lethal power that is imminently needed to deter Russia,” Kusti Salm, the secretary general of the Estonian Defense Ministry, was quoted as saying. He was referring to the US’ High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, combat drones, and technology used to detect incoming fire. Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks recently told reporters, the Washington Post said, that Riga needs additional financial support in order to buy new weapons and to strengthen its air and coastal defenses. Polish officials have also urged the US to speed up the delivery of weapons promised to Warsaw, according to the Post. Poland is awaiting Patriot missile batteries, HIMARS, F-16 fighter jets, and Abrams tanks, “all along multiyear schedules set before” the Russian offensive in Ukraine began, the outlet said. The Polish Embassy in the US revealed on August 4 that “efforts to strengthen the defensive capabilities of countries helping Ukraine in the ongoing war” were a key topic of a meeting between the head of Poland’s national security bureau, Pawel Soloch, and US President Joe Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan. A senior US defense official who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity said the countries which are now providing Ukraine with weapons will need to backfill these capabilities in the future, though he did not indicate how long that would take. According to the outlet, while the Eastern European countries realize that not everyone in Congress supports the idea of moving more US personnel to Europe, many of them insist that having a greater presence of troops in Europe “is necessary to keeping Moscow at bay.” The US has said it is committed to its defense cooperation with the Eastern European NATO allies. The 2022 federal spending package included the first-ever authorization of $180 million for the Baltic Security Initiative. Earlier this week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US will conduct more military exercises with the Baltic nations and will look to provide additional training for their troops. In June, Biden announced that the US will significantly increase its military presence in Europe for the long haul and will establish its first permanent base in Poland. Meanwhile, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, accused Washington of trying to turn Eurasia into “a conflagration space of warring nations.” He said in June that the rapid military buildup in Eastern Europe might have disturbing consequences for the region’s security.",2.1255146225913806,2.387371430252346,-0.26185680766096553,8

According to Monastirsky, the Ukrainian parliament may allow citizens to buy handguns and other weapons to protect their homes. While stating that he believes people should be able to do so, he said the Internal Affairs Ministry is against granting people the right to carry guns in public. “We are opposed to carrying weapons freely in public places, because we believe that the risks to public safety outweigh the benefits,” he stated, adding that the ministry has been working with Ukrainian MPs on the issue, and that a law could be adopted soon. “[It] has been approved in the first reading and is now being prepared for the second one. I think that it would be submitted to the Parliament for consideration in the near future.” A bill on gun control that was approved by the Ukrainian parliament in late February, shortly before Moscow launched its military operation, allows citizens to buy and store at home short-barreled firearms, as well as using them at shooting ranges. In March, Monastirsky revealed that the Ukrainian authorities had distributed “tens of thousands” of assault rifles, usually reserved for the trained personnel, among civilians, in a move to turn the public into a resistance force against Russian troops. At the time, Kiev also announced it would set free combat-experienced felons who agree to take up arms and fight against the Russian Army. According to media reports, on February 24 alone – the day Russia began the attack – the Kiev authorities handed out at least 10,000 automatic rifles among residents. In July, Viktor Andrusov, a former adviser to Monastirsky, announced that Ukrainians could gain the right to carry pistols for self-defense as early as next year. He also claimed, citing an unspecified poll, that 70% of Ukrainians support the move. Even before full-scale hostilities between Russia and Ukraine broke out, the number of unregistered firearms in Ukraine was estimated at between 3 and 5 million.",2.5344282358292767,2.4158407423512416,0.1185874934780351,7

According to the ministry the explosion in the mall was followed by a fire, with videos posted on social media depicting large plumes of smoke. Eyewitnesses also reported several minor explosions, which could have come from fireworks. A building on the grounds of the plaza that housed a pyrotechnics store has reportedly collapsed. The exact cause of the blast is unclear.

In its annual Association Implementation Report, Brussels acknowledged that Tbilisi continues “its reform path” in tough circumstances – amid the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russian military operation in Ukraine. “However, we have seen setbacks in the key areas of rule of law, governance and human rights,” Josep Borrell, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said. He urged Tbilisi, whose “European perspective” was formally recognized by the bloc in June, to take “a responsible and conscientious approach that matches its stated objectives and its citizens’ aspirations.” The EU commissioner for neighborhood and enlargement, Oliver Varhelyi, said “the ball is now in Georgia’s court.” “A serious commitment to democratic consolidation, judicial reforms, strengthening the rule of law as well as fight against corruption and organised crime will be key,” he added. The EU pledged to continue supporting Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the reform process and economic development. The Association Implementation report was published ahead of the Annual EU-Georgia Association Council, which will take place on September 6, Brussels said. Last month, the European Commission announced that it had decided to “not rush the Georgian political elite” and to give Tbilisi “sufficient time” to work on the reforms required for granting candidate status. Michael Rupp, the European Commission’s representative at the European Parliament, said that an assessment of Georgia’s implementation of the priorities set by the EU in June will not take place before 2023. The Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia entered into force on July 1, 2016. On March 3 this year, a week after Moscow launched its attack on Ukraine, Tbilisi submitted an application for EU membership. While Georgia did not receive candidate status, on June 23, the bloc recognized “the European perspective” of the country and confirmed its willingness “to grant candidate status once the outstanding priorities are addressed.” On the same day, the EU granted candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova, which had also applied for EU membership following the launch of Russia’s military operation. The European Council stated in June that the progress of each country towards membership will depend not only on meeting the criteria, but also on the “EU’s capacity to absorb new members.” Russia blasted the EU’s expansion strategy, saying that granting EU candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova proves that the bloc’s goal is to “contain” Russia.",1.4964654612035109,2.3739070624691267,-0.8774416012656159,7

In a statement released by its German section on Friday, the human rights watchdog said that the study of the document was “initiated at the international level,” and will examine the process by which the material was prepared and how the report was analyzed from the legal and political standpoints. “We want to understand what exactly went wrong and why, in order to learn a lesson and improve our work in the field of human rights,” the organization said. Amnesty International noted that “its findings were not conveyed with the delicacy and accuracy” that are expected from the organization. It also stated that its International Secretariat did not react to criticism from the international community in the correct manner. The report, the watchdog said, also “did not pay due attention to Russian aggression in violation of international law,” adding that Amnesty condemns Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. On August 4, Amnesty released a report that accused Kiev of “a clear violation of international humanitarian law,” saying it was putting civilian lives at risk by placing its military assets close to civilian infrastructure. In 22 of the 29 schools visited by Amnesty between April and July, the human rights group said it found evidence of current or prior military activity. In five locations, they witnessed Ukrainian troops using hospitals as bases. The group also said it was “not aware” whether Ukraine tried to evacuate civilians from the areas in question. Nonetheless, the watchdog noted that no Ukrainian troops were present in some areas where it found that Russian forces had allegedly delivered strikes on residential areas, concluding that Ukraine’s unlawful military use of civilian sites does not “in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks.” Following backlash from Kiev, with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky slamming Amnesty for siding with “terrorists,” the organization issued an apology for its report, saying it “deeply regrets the distress and anger that our press release on the Ukrainian military’s fighting tactics has caused,” while stating that “we fully stand by our findings.”",3.2124584466861923,2.311188203817288,0.9012702428689043,9

According to Zelensky, as quoted by TASS, Kakhovka is now operating in a “very dangerous” emergency mode. The Kakhovka plant is located in Kherson Region in southern Ukraine, which was seized by Russian forces in the early stages of Moscow’s military operation. Together with Russia-controlled Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, it has been attacked by Kiev’s troops – with use of Western-supplied weapons – according to the regional authorities. “In case of problems with the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, there will be big troubles at the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant. [This] could lead to a nuclear catastrophe,” the deputy director of the Kakhovka plant said. He explained to journalists that if the dam is destroyed, the nuclear facility would be deprived of the water needed to cool its reactors. He revealed that the station has been working in emergency mode “since the first days of hostilities.” “The station's own needs, backup 6 kV, are lost, we are working in a very dangerous mode,"" he said, adding that one of the turbines had to be turned off following Ukrainian rocket attacks. If the military action ceases, Zelensky said, the plant can be “restored within a week.” “Fortunately, the station has not yet received major damage, except for hydroelectric unit number three, which burned down in March, it takes 1.5 years to complete the work,” he said. Zelensky’s remarks came the day after Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the military-civilian administration of Kherson Region, revealed that the city of Novaya Kakhovka had again been attacked by “Ukrainian nationalists” but “no tangible damage” was caused. “The hydroelectric power station was not damaged,” he said. On Thursday, Russia’s Ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, told the Security Council that a nuclear disaster can happen “at any moment” amid the “reckless” shelling of the Zaporozhye plant by Kiev’s forces. “Kiev’s criminal attacks on the nuclear infrastructure facilities are pushing the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster that would rival the Chernobyl one,” Nebenzia said. Responding to Kiev’s claims that Russia was the one targeting the plant in an alleged plot to discredit Ukraine, the diplomat said that Russia has no reason to target the facility or its own troops, and that multiple attacks on the facility have been documented from Ukrainian-held territory in Dnepropetrovsk Region. The US Department of State, however, took Kiev’s side by endorsing the demand for a demilitarized zone around the Zaporozhye nuclear plant and calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops that control the area.",5.490490598992568,4.095418249494644,1.3950723494979238,9

Talks with Russia today will mean only one thing: Russia has won… Are you ready for that? The presidential aide warned that Ukraine’s defeat would also mark the “collapse of the global security system and the system of democratic values.” Reaching a ceasefire now would not stop further conflicts, he said, adding that Russia might launch another attack on Ukraine at some point in the future. Podoliak also compared the idea of starting peace talks with Moscow to conducting talks with Nazi Germany in 1942, when the Nazis occupied large swathes of Soviet territory, including all of Ukraine. “One cannot even imagine it. Any talks at that moment and with that [balance of power] would mean a civilizational catastrophe,” he said. In early August, the Kremlin signaled its readiness to strike a peace deal with Kiev, while warning that it would achieve the goals of its military operation in Ukraine regardless of Kiev’s willingness to concede. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the time that the two nations were close to settling their differences in a way that was acceptable to Russia, but the draft agreement prepared during a meeting in Istanbul was torpedoed by Ukraine. Kiev broke off the talks with Moscow after accusing Russia of committing war crimes, an allegation that Russia said was based on fabricated evidence. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who visited Moscow in early August, also said that a negotiated solution is possible and argued that the recent “initial success” of the grain export deal should be used to reach a ceasefire. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

Peski, located some 2km away from the Donetsk Airport, has been one of the main pillars of Ukraine’s elaborate defense line in the DPR. The settlement had been heavily fortified since 2015. A DPR militia commander told Russia’s Channel One last week that the area had been turned into “literally one big garrison,” from which all civilians were evacuated long ago. All buildings in Peski are surrounded by trenches, while Ukrainian defenses had been set up in “according to NATO standards,” he pointed out. The joint operation to seize the settlement began in late July and saw intense fighting and artillery shelling. In early August, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky described the situation in Peski and nearby Avdeevka by saying that “it’s just hell there. It can’t even be described in words.” Meanwhile, strikes against Kiev’s forces and military infrastructure continued in other parts of Ukraine over the past 24 hours, Konashenkov said. Among other things, a HIMARS multiple rocket launcher and a warehouse that stored munitions for it were destroyed near the town of Kramatorsk in the DPR, according to the spokesman. More than a hundred Ukrainian troops and members of the nationalist Right Sector group were also killed in a strike near the village of Starye Terny in the DPR, Konashenkov added.

The US and its allies in NATO imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow after Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. However, the attempt to tank the Russian economy has failed, Darchiev argued, as have “the attempts to muster an international anti-Russian coalition that would be broader than the traditional bond between the US and its vassals.” “We are reacting calmly, and not going out of our way to seek talks,” the diplomat said, adding that it was Washington’s decision to suspend wider contacts with Moscow since February. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his US counterpart Antony Blinken spoke over the phone in late July, their first conversation since Russia’s military campaign began.

2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/news/560772-ukraine-eu-west-aid/,Ukraine struggles to find money to pay troops – WSJ,"With Western financial help apparently slow to arrive, Ukraine has been forced to print money to pay its troops in the fight against Russia, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko told the US outlet that it’s “a constant headache” for him to keep balancing the cost of the conflict and the lower tax revenues in an economy battered by almost half a year of fighting. With around 60% of the budget being spent on the fighting, the minister said he has had to cut all unnecessary expenditures. But it’s still not enough, as tax revenues only cover 40% of government spending, the WSJ reports. The Kiev authorities earlier said they needed $5 billion per month to run the country, and would not be able to cope without Western help. However, the grants and loans pledged to Ukraine by its foreign backers have been arriving slower than expected, according to the journal. For example, the EU has so far provided only €1 billion out of €9 billion it promised to Kiev, with Germany resisting the idea of offering low-interest loans backed by guarantees from the bloc’s member states. According to Marchenko, a lot of his time at work is spent trying to persuade Western governments to act faster. “Without this money, the war will last longer and it will damage economies more,” he explained. Rostislav Shurma, an economic adviser to President Vladimir Zelensky, described the situation in harsher terms. If Kiev acted as sluggishly at the West, “the Russians would be at the Polish border by now,” he told the WSJ. “They don’t feel the war. That’s the problem. The only thing they feel in the EU is high prices,” Shurma said. Due to the lack of funds, the Ukrainian Central Bank has no choice but to print more money to allow the government to pay the troops and purchase arms and ammunition in order to keep fighting. This approach has been weakening Ukraine’s national currency, the hryvnia, which has already lost 30% since the launch of the Russian military operation in Ukraine, prompting a major spike in inflation. But this is a sacrifice that Marchenko is willing to make: “we have to worry about winning the war. It is better to risk high inflation than not to pay soldiers’ salaries.” He also said the conflict will likely be prolonged, and this must be factored in as well. “This is a war of attrition. You have to think in these terms, to think about 2022 and 2023. It’s a marathon.” Earlier this week, Sergey Kiriyenko, the deputy head of the administration of the Russian president, accused the authorities in Kiev of selling out their own people to fight on behalf of NATO. “NATO will gladly fight against Russia ‘to the last Ukrainian’ as they say themselves without hesitance. Why not? They don’t feel sorry about it,” Kiriyenko said.",2.5428678850884836,2.819533599986437,-0.2766657148979532,7
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560690-five-days-war-georgia-russia-2008/,How the ambitions of a small country's US-backed leader launched the current confrontation between Russia and the West,"Combat units of the Russian army, using old Soviet tanks that kept breaking down, made their way across mountain ranges. Their mission was to rescue a small group of peacekeepers encircled by the enemy and put an end to the shelling of a small town nestled deep in the Caucasus Mountains. The Russian troops didn’t carry any advanced weapons; they even lacked adequate military communications – and yet, thanks to high morale, they made the enemy surrender in just five days. This, in broad strokes, is the 2008 war in South Ossetia – one of the many territorial conflicts sparked by the collapse of the Soviet Union. To Moscow, this conflict was of special significance: not only did it mark the beginning of Russia's current confrontation with the West, but it also prompted a sweeping modernization of the Russian army. The Soviet Union collapsed over 30 years ago, exposing multiple simmering conflicts that had previously been kept dormant by the repressive apparatus of the state. With the dissolution of the USSR, many of these deep-rooted conflicts resurfaced, followed by numerous fresh disputes. Only a handful of them have been successfully resolved in the past 30 years. The vast majority remain ‘in stasis,’ liable to erupt at any moment, with unpredictable consequences. At the center of one of these conflicts were the Ossetians, a people living on both sides of the Greater Caucasus mountain range. They make up the majority of the population in Russia’s Republic of North Ossetia. There is, however, another sizeable community in South Ossetia, a densely populated territory separated from its northern counterpart. In the 19th century, the territories of the North Caucasus, including those of the future Georgian state, were incorporated into the Russian Empire. At that time, collective Georgian statehood was in its infancy, and the Russian empire, like any other empire, would not tolerate even bringing up the idea of separatism. It all changed after the Russian Civil War. As part of the newly formed Soviet Union, Georgia existed as a patchwork of the core plus three autonomous regions (Abkhazia, Adjara and South Ossetia) and multiple other areas (not given their own separate status) populated by Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The South Ossetian autonomous region was a backwater province, quiet and undisturbed, with Georgians and the Ossetians living alongside each other. This region was and still is a small one with an area of 50x50 km and a population of less than 50,000, most of whom live in the region's only city, Tskhinval. Unfortunately for Georgia, when the Soviet Union collapsed, a man named Zviad Gamsakhurdia became its first president. He was utterly obsessed with nationalist ideas. At the same time, a movement for national autonomy gained momentum in Ossetia. Gamsakhurdia branded the Ossetians “trash” and attempted to launch a punitive expedition into the region. His plans failed, however, as neither the Georgian nationalists nor the local militia had any experience of real combat. In the early 90's, a short-lived and pointless but bloody war ended in negotiations. South Ossetia declared itself a republic; Georgia refused to recognize it, but the conflict was put on ice, and a Russian peacekeeping battalion was deployed in the region at the consent of both sides. The following 15 years were uneventful – South Ossetia is, after all, a small region hidden deep in the mountains. It maintained contact with its sister republic of North Ossetia through the only road that led north via the Roki tunnel. The republic had no natural resources of major significance, and the great powers of the world had no interest in it whatsoever. But then, in the early 2000s, a young and ambitious Mikhail Saakashvili became Georgia’s third president, launching massive reforms and changing the country’s outlook to pro-Western and, most of all, pro-American. While Saakashvili managed to jump-start the economy to a degree, to the point that Georgia briefly became the poster child for a successful westernization, he had other interests, too, and they included restoring Georgia’s territorial integrity. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, followed by a number of local civil conflicts, had left the former Georgian SSR lacking a few territories. South Ossetia and Abkhazia had proclaimed their independence, and on top of that Tbilisi lost control of Adjara, an area of importance in the country’s southwestern corner, as well as the Pankisi Gorge and the Kodori Valley. Saakashvili began building a reformed army to achieve the goal of bringing back the provinces that had gone rogue. Georgian troops were trained by the US and its NATO partners. The president stuck to his westernization policy with regards to the army too. Georgia increased its military spending to 9.5% of GDP, which is extremely high – more typical for a nation in a state of war. What’s interesting is that the US didn’t see any of that as important or necessary, although it was happy to take Georgia under its wing. It was rather Saakashvili’s personal project. He obviously wanted to enter history as the man who restored Georgia in every possible sense of the word. In his speeches, he liked to mention conquests and heroes of the past, going back to the Middle Ages. Besides, the problem of Georgian refugees was a real one: the violent armed conflicts that broke out in the 1990s had driven many from their homes, and they never got the chance to return. Adjara didn’t put up any resistance and was reunited with Georgia peacefully. The Pankisi Gorge and the Kodori Valley followed suit. South Ossetia and Abkhazia, however, presented a challenge. Both were self-proclaimed republics that had announced their independence from Georgia and had armed forces of their own. Russia had been supportive of both republics ever since, providing military, political, and financial aid. The attempted negotiations between Georgia and the republics failed, since the violence committed by both sides in the 1990s was a major stumbling block. That’s when Mikhail Saakashvili decided it was time for a military operation. Believe it or not, neither of the patron states of the involved parties wanted a war – neither Russia nor the United States. Thanks to documents leaked by the WikiLeaks project, we know that American diplomats considered Moscow’s concerns about a possible military move on the part of Saakashvili nothing but a case of paranoia. Some experts even believe that the United States simply never consolidated its official position in regard to Saakashvili’s ambitious plans, while the president might have misinterpreted the somewhat ambivalent signals coming from Washington as a sign of support and a green light for his project of a lifetime. One big problem was that a Russian peacekeeping force was permanently deployed in South Ossetia and that Moscow had made it clear it wasn’t going to tolerate an attack. It seemed impossible for Saakashvili to simply go ahead and challenge Moscow, but he had a sort of plan. Knowing that the only road connecting South Ossetia and Russia goes over the Main Caucasian Range, making it impossible to deliver any significant reinforcements fast, Saakashvili placed his bet on taking control of the Roki Tunnel, a key passage point on that road, thus cutting off the peacekeeper force and forcing it to capitulate. He was going to rely on this advantage. South Ossetia couldn’t boast any significant military force. Whatever troops it had were commanded by an experienced Russian colonel, Anatoly Barankevich. Most of the fighters, however, didn’t have any military training or experience and lacked proper munitions, let alone artillery or armored vehicles. The republic relied heavily on Russia’s support. Since earlier in the summer of 2008, the sides had occasionally exchanged fire on the border between South Ossetia and Georgia. Tskhinval (the Ossetian name for the country’s capital, Georgians used to call it Tskhinvali) is very close to the border – only a few hundred meters separate it from the nearest Georgian village. The republic began to evacuate women and children. On the night of August 7, Tskhinval came under shell fire. Apparently, the Georgian reconnaissance units didn’t do a very good job, because the Ossetian militia fighters were hardly affected. Refugees began to flee Tskhinval. The Russians were blocked at their base and kept firing. They were able to destroy a Georgian tank, but that was the only tactical victory at that point. Over ten peacekeepers were killed, and the rest had to retreat to the basement. The Georgian plan began to malfunction on August 8. Two brigades tried to enter Tskhinval from different sides but came under fire and suffered significant losses. Colonel Brankevich, the militia commander, personally stopped one tank with a grenade launcher. Its crew is still considered missing in action – the ammunition exploded and practically turned the personnel into ash. Brankevich’s soldiers burned down a few more vehicles. At that time, the Russian military were quickly entering the republic from the north. It had become clear a few months before the events that Saakashvili was going to launch an attack, and South Ossetia had formed combat groups to prepare for it. The Georgians failed to take over Tskhinval on the first day, and now chaotic and violent street battles were raging. Nervous breakdowns and incompetence kill people faster than a premeditated crime. The Georgian soldiers mostly just shot everywhere. A scene like something out of a comedy sketch occurred in one building. The Georgians destroyed the gate with their gunfire, stormed the house and stumbled on a stunned elderly couple. “What are you doing here?” the officer asked. “We live here,” was the obvious answer. The gob-smacked warriors had no other choice but to leave. At the same time Russian jets began to bomb Georgian troops deployed to Tskhinval. The Georgians failed to get to the Roki Tunnel or destroy the Gufta bridge, which they tried to do in order to cut off enemy reinforcements. The road leading north was flooded with refugees, while Russian soldiers were moving in the opposite direction. The Russian army was in bad shape in 2008. A significant number of vehicles were lost along the way – some of them were simply pushed off the cliffs, so that they wouldn’t block the road. Communication systems were awful, with officers often switching to their regular mobile phones. But morale was surprisingly high – the troops engaged in battles right away and were very effective. There was still a significant degree of chaos, however. On the whole, the Russians were able to gain momentum during the first two days. Several battalions entered South Ossetia – they unblocked the peacekeepers, while the Georgian troops suffered significant losses. The Russian army didn’t show much in the beginning, but proved effective against Georgian artillery, and new battalions kept arriving through the tunnel. The Russians lost a few jets, but overpowered the Georgian Air Force and air defense, and destroyed several missile boats in the Black Sea. The jets bombed Georgian targets near and behind the frontline, but sometimes they made mistakes and hit civilians along with the combatants. The Georgian army collapsed after August 10. In the 4th Brigade, for example, 2,000 staff were punished for desertion – several times more than the number of its killed and wounded. The Russians simply disarmed and let go a large Georgian force blocked in the west of the country. All of that while the Russian forces were still outnumbered. On August 11, Saakashvili visited the frontline near the town of Gori. There he suddenly tried to run away, fearing an air raid, when he heard a sound of a jet. His bodyguards were there to bring him to the ground, but the media managed to take a photo of the Georgian leader with a face distorted by fear. Soon he added to that image by chewing his tie during a live broadcast. Meanwhile, the West protested the “excessive use of force” by Russia, resulting in France’s Nicholas Sarkozy meeting then-president Dmitry Medvedev to negotiate a ceasefire. The hostilities stopped as rapidly as they had erupted. The Russian army pillaged Georgian military bases, taking home or destroying 65 tanks, 3,700 small arms and a plethora of other military equipment. The war was over. The fighting took the lives of over 60 Russian and 180 Georgian soldiers, 37 Ossetian militia fighters, and more than 300 Ossetian and 200 Georgian civilians. For Ossetia, with a population of just 50,000, the blow was especially hard. Russia soon recognized the independence of the Republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Today, they are tiny and rather poor nations effectively under Russia’s protection. The war in South Ossetia was a milestone for Moscow. It exposed the Russian army’s many problems and was enough to lay out a plan for improving the military. The victory over Georgia wasn’t thanks to the army’s combat effectiveness but rather thanks to the personal quality of its staff. The next few years saw Moscow conduct major reforms. The politicians, however, had a slightly different perspective. For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia had flexed its muscles in the global arena. Within the country, the common take on the events was as follows: the West had used its vassal state to test how Russia would react to a great infringement upon its interests. It was the first time Moscow had actively fought back against Western pressure, or what felt like pressure. The tensions only heightened over the ensuing years. The key takeaway from the Five-Day War is that opportunism and recklessness can do more harm than scheming. The clueless pursuit of a single man’s ambition cost hundreds of lives. Those deaths could have been avoided had the politicians shown just a little more restraint and wisdom at the right time.",2.2346860441638468,2.8198541656778606,-0.5851681215140139,6
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560768-ukrainian-pows-exchange-russia/,Ukrainian POWs reluctant to be exchanged – Moscow,"Ukrainian soldiers that were captured as prisoners of war by Russia have decided to remain in the territory controlled by Moscow and allied forces, expressing reluctance to continue fighting, Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed on Saturday. “Ukrainian prisoners of war belonging to the units of the Naval infantry, National Guard, air assault and ground forces chose to stay in the territory controlled by Russia because of their reluctance to fight and fear of being sent to the frontlines again,” the ministry wrote on its Telegram channel. The Defense Ministry said the Ukrainian POWs do not want to be used as “cannon fodder” and die on the battlefield while “carrying out criminal orders” issued by Kiev. The Russian military also posted a video of what appears to be an interview with a Ukrainian POW who said he laid down his arms voluntarily and turned himself in to the allied forces. According to the prisoner, he has been treated well and does not want to return to Ukraine as part of any future swaps. Few soldiers manage to surrender voluntarily due to a crackdown by Ukraine’s nationalist battalions, the ministry claimed, noting that the nationalists threaten to shoot any soldiers that seek to abandon their combat positions. According to the ministry, the POWs have told of rampant corruption among the Ukrainian ranks, the use of intimidation tactics by Kiev, and “barbaric treatment of civilians who are used by [the] nationalists as human shields on a regular basis.” Earlier this month, Moscow claimed that it scrupulously observes the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war, while Kiev’s forces have tortured, starved, and deprived of medical care Russian POWs. At the time, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Fomin also condemned the West’s unwillingness to hold Kiev accountable for these violations and crimes. In July, Moscow blamed Kiev, and Ukranian President Vladimir Zelensky personally, for the fatal shelling of a detention facility in the Donetsk People’s Republic. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, a missile strike using the US-made HIMARS multiple rocket launcher killed 50 Ukrainian POWs, injuring another 73.",2.5101219803211134,3.6078997388930527,-1.0977777585719393,5
2022-08-13,https://www.rt.com/russia/560766-west-ukraine-biolab-shift-blame/,West will brush Ukraine biolab allegations under the carpet just like those of Kosovo organ trafficking,"In crisis after crisis, Western narrative control kicks into overdrive to shift blame, whitewash culprits, or make sure inconvenient lines of questioning are never pursued Soon after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent descent on Taiwan, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, called out Nicholas Burns, America’s ambassador to China, for “keeping an embarrassed silence” regarding the “insolent stunt.” The silence was quite a change from how vocal Burns had been a mere month prior at the World Peace Forum in Beijing, where he demanded that China stop relaying “Russian propaganda” by “accusing NATO of starting” the conflict in Ukraine. He used the opportunity to accuse the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson of “telling lies about American bioweapons labs, which do not exist in Ukraine.” But that was then and this is now in the West’s ‘rules-based order’, where each occasion requires a new set of rules. Thus, it goes without saying that, for the time being, Burns will also keep an ‘embarrassed silence’ about another potentially tectonic event – the latest, even more damning statement regarding alleged US-run biolabs in Ukraine made by the Russian Defense Ministry on August 4. Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops of the Russian Armed Forces, said Moscow was assessing the possibility of US involvement in the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as investigating US-funded research of various other pathogens. The reason for Burns’ silence is not difficult to guess – the serious allegations made in Kirillov’s presentation, if properly investigated and proven true, could serve as an indictment of what could be America’s use of Ukraine as a vast pathogen testing ground. And since the Western media mostly chose to ignore it, the ambassador was certainly not going to make a statement they would have to quote, drawing attention to the issue. And now that Twitter has suspended the Russian Foreign Ministry’s account for daring to quote key parts of Kirillov’s media presentation about the possible origins of Covid-19, Burns and company don’t have to say anything at all. If it’s memory-holed by the social media, then it’s as if it never happened. That’s the modus operandi of the Western elites – it’s not the truth that matters, but successfully managing the narrative so that it doesn’t leave room for doubt in people’s minds. In other words, they think they can do whatever they want. Perhaps we should remind ourselves of the post-Cold War Western formula announced during the heady days of the early 2000s, an era marked by another famous American political quote, Karl Rove’s “we’re an empire now and, when we act, we create our own reality.” As Tony Blair’s policy adviser, Robert Cooper, nonchalantly put it on the pages of The Guardian in April 2002: “The challenge to the postmodern world is to get used to the idea of double standards. Among ourselves, we operate on the basis of laws and open cooperative security. But when dealing with more old-fashioned kinds of states outside the postmodern continent of Europe, we need to revert to the rougher methods of an earlier era – force, pre-emptive attack, deception, whatever is necessary to deal with those who still live in the 19th century world of every state for itself. Among ourselves, we keep the law but when we are operating in the jungle, we must also use the laws of the jungle.” Two decades later, despite the rise of both China and Russia and the world’s inexorable evolution to multipolarity, imperial habits die hard – usually until they hit a wall of reality, as is currently happening in Ukraine and is bound to happen in Taiwan. But back to Burns for a moment. He’s far from new in enforcing double standards in the ‘jungle’. Before his present work on poking the Dragon regarding Taiwan, and the Bear regarding just about everything, he distinguished himself as a partisan and apologist of NATO’s illegal aggression against Serbia back in the 1990s, which resulted in Kosovo’s unilateral secession. Meanwhile, in 2009, when he was the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, Burns explained to the media that the recognition of Pristina’s independence was in fact an expression of the US’ “interest in good relations with Serbia.” Will he, in due time, express himself similarly vis-à-vis China and Taiwan? Outside the West, it’s all still a jungle to Burns and his ilk, and the ‘natives’ are to be dealt with accordingly. So, in Burns-talk, Pelosi’s Taiwan sojourn and pledge of continuing US support for the island is actually a sign of America’s interest in good relations with China. Another notable Anglo-American figure visible across the Kosovo-China-Ukraine crisis landscape is the Englishman Geoffrey Nice, who gained international notoriety as a prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), whose sole purpose was to shift the blame for the Western-inspired bloody breakup of that multinational country solely onto the Serbs. In addition to his selective prosecution of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for ‘crimes against humanity’, Nice’s ICTY legacy also includes accusations of destroying evidence related to human organ trafficking in Kosovo. Nice subsequently offered his legal services to former Kosovo President Hashim Thaci, one of the main figures in not just the trafficking but the alleged “forcible extraction” of human organs of still-living, mostly Serb prisoners, as outlined in a stunning Council of Europe 2011 report, ‘Inhuman treatment of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo’. The report also cites anti-drug agencies of “at least five countries” as saying Thaci “exerted violent control over the trade in heroin and other narcotics.” Nice’s subsequent attempt to discredit the report was, however, brilliantly dissected and exposed by American journalist Diana Johnstone as the latest attempt by a representative of “self-righteous Western democracies” to reserve the privileges of a “culture of impunity” exclusively for themselves and their clients. Of course, the clients in the ‘jungle’ still have to pay for the imperial ‘double standards’ umbrella, so in the end, Nice reportedly accused Thaci of owing him “almost a half a million euros” for his work for the Kosovo government. Zakharova just recently more fully described the house of horrors over which Thaci allegedly presided: “Kosovo is the territory of ‘black’ transplantation. People were dissected alive, taking out internal organs for sale to those people in the West… In the West they stood in line for organ transplant operations. And they began to receive these organs when Kosovo turned into a terrible black hole in which people disappeared, who were not just killed, but killed to sell their internal organs.” To paraphrase Franklin D. Roosevelt’s immortal words justifying US support for Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, they may be sons of b****es, but they’re the West’s sons of b****es.",0.0,0.0,0.0,6
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560737-ukraine-promotion-english-language/,Ukraine eyes promotion of English language,"Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture and Information Policy is working on a draft law to grant a higher status to the English language, the ministry’s vice head Rostislav Karandeev said during a press briefing on Friday. “Ukraine is still largely separated from the EU and the rest of the world by a language barrier. A change in the status of the English language is a step that could solve that problem,” Karandeev told reporters. In order to grant the language “a higher status” and help Ukrainians master it, the ministry “has started working on a draft law that would ensure English is spoken [in the country] as a language of international communication,” the official added. That means, he explained, that in future all civil servants or law enforcement officers will have to be able to speak English. Even though Article 10 of Ukraine’s constitution states that the country’s government must promote “learning of languages of international communication,” that article – as well as the legal concept of such languages – is only referenced in a single law, Karandeev explained. The new bill will grant English the status of “language of international communication,” encouraging its promotion in the country, the official said. According to Karandeev, expanding the use of English will not only speed up Ukraine’s integration into the European community, but also help the country attract more investment and tourists “once we achieve our victory.” Language issues have long been a source of tension between Russia in Ukraine, far predating the current military conflict. Even though a significant portion of Ukraine’s population speaks Russian as a first language and uses it far more than Ukrainian, some voices – especially among the country’s nationalist movements – have been calling for its use to be restricted lest it eventually supplant Ukrainian. In July 2012, Ukraine’s parliament adopted a law titled “On the principles of the state language policy,” which granted Russian and other minority languages regional status, meaning they could be used in courts, schools and other government institutions in areas where ethnic minorities exceeded 10% of the total population. However, after the 2014 Maidan revolution, Ukrainian lawmakers demanded that the law be reviewed by the country’s Constitutional Court, arguing it went against the same Article 10 which also stipulates that the government must ensure the development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine. In 2018, the court finally ruled the law unconstitutional. Instead, in April 2019, the Ukrainian parliament voted for a new, wide-ranging piece of legislation called “On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language.” The law made Ukrainian compulsory in many fields, including public administration, media, and education. While it provided some exemptions for the Crimean Tatar language, other languages of indigenous peoples of Ukraine, as well as English and the other official languages of the EU, Russian, Belarusian and Yiddish were not granted such exemptions. Since the start of Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine on February 24, restrictions on the Russian language and culture have been picking up pace. In June, the country’s parliament banned Russian music.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560725-estonia-finland-baltic-nato/,NATO states mull closing Baltic for Russian Navy,"Tallinn and Helsinki have discussed the integration of coastal missile batteries that would enable the two Western states to blockade the Russian Navy in the Gulf of Finland, Estonia’s defense minister announced on Friday. This would turn the Baltic Sea into a “NATO internal sea,” the official said, echoing comments made earlier by Polish and Lithuanian leaders. Finland has applied to join the US-led military bloc. “We need to integrate our coastal defenses. The flight range of Estonian and Finnish missiles is greater than the width of the Gulf of Finland,” Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur told the Finnish newspaper Iltalehti. Finland’s MTO85M coastal missiles have a range of over 100 kilometers. The Gulf is about 82 kilometers across from Helsinki to Tallinn. Estonia plans to buy Israeli Blue Spear missiles later this year, which have a range of almost 300 kilometers. “The Baltic Sea will be NATO’s internal sea when Finland and Sweden have joined NATO. Compared with what it is today, the situation is changing,” Pevkur said, adding that the two countries will then be able to close the sea to the Russian Navy if need be. The applications of Finland and Sweden to join NATO were met with the greatest enthusiasm by Poland and the former Soviet republics on the Baltic Sea. Following the alliance’s summit in Spain at the end of June, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics both said they hoped for the Baltic to become a “NATO lake.” Pevkur said he discussed airspace with his Finnish colleague as well, though he dodged Iltalehti’s question whether the US will deploy its F-35 fighter jets to Estonia. “For me, this is one airspace,” Pevkur added. “Finnish airspace cannot be protected if Estonian airspace is not protected at the same time, and vice versa. Fighter jets cross the 80-kilometer-wide Gulf of Finland in minutes.” Estonia has been one of the most outspoken NATO members in urging a confrontation with Russia. On Thursday, Tallinn announced that it would ban entry to Russians with EU Schengen visas starting next week, and demolish all Soviet-era monuments “as soon as possible.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,8

Medvedev, who is now the deputy head of Russia’s National Security Council, previously called Zelensky “an unshaved fellow wearing a green shirt” and compared him to Adolf Hitler after the Ukrainian president urged Western countries to close their borders to all Russian nationals. Before becoming president of Ukraine, Zelensky was a comedian and actor.

Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, citing Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements, designed to give the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk special status within the Ukrainian state. The protocols, brokered by Germany and France, were first signed in 2014. Former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko has since admitted that Kiev’s main goal was to use the ceasefire to buy time and “create powerful armed forces.” In February 2022, the Kremlin recognized the Donbass republics as independent states and demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join any Western military bloc.

2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560728-ukraine-german-howitzers-broken/,Most German howitzers in Ukraine out of order – MP,"Most German PzH 2000 howitzers that have been supplied to Ukraine by the West have already broken down and are in need of repair, according to German Bundestag member Marcus Faber, who recently visited Ukraine. In a Wednesday interview with the German news outlet NTV, the politician claimed he was surprised to learn from Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense that only five of the 15 German-made PzH 2000 howitzers supplied to Ukraine by Berlin and Amsterdam were still operational. He added that the cause of the failures was not Russian fire, but the fact that the guns were “massively used” by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. While Kiev has yet to officially confirm Faber’s statements, it was reported last month by Der Spiegel that Ukraine had informed Germany that a number of PzH 2000 howitzers were malfunctioning after extensive use. According to the outlet, the German Ministry of Defense believed the issues may have resulted from high intensity firing, which may have impacted the artillery round loading mechanism. Der Spiegel said 100 shots a day was considered a “high level of shooting intensity” for the howitzer. Faber also stated that Kiev had requested more spare parts for the weapons and was “optimistic” that it could bring the howitzers back into working order. He noted that while Germany had already supplied Ukraine with spare parts packages, not all of them were “the right ones.” He pointed out that spare parts were not always enough and that larger repairs required special workshops, meaning the Ukrainians could only carry out minor repairs themselves. According to Faber, Kiev has already requested help in building their own repair facilities in order to avoid having to send the howitzers out of the country for maintenance. Germany has so far supplied Kiev with ten PzH 2000 howitzers while another five were provided by the Netherlands, who have promised another three. Meanwhile, German arms manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann struck a deal with the Ukrainian government in late July that would see the firm produce and supply Kiev with some 100 PzH 2000 howitzers, according to a Der Spiegel report. A company spokesperson was quoted as stating that the arms deal was worth $1.72 billion – almost triple the cost of all military aid Berlin has sent to Kiev’s forces since Russia launched its military operation in late February. However, Faber has pointed out that these 100 howitzers will not be delivered to Ukraine before the end of next year and has called on Berlin to send Kiev weapons out of its own reserves, which could then be replenished by Ukrainian order. Germany has previously supplied Ukrainian forces with thousands of portable anti-tank and anti-air missiles, tens of thousands of anti-tank mines, as well as millions of rounds of ammunition. However, Kiev and even the former Ukrainian ambassador to Germany have still criticized Berlin for what they called reluctance to send military aid to Ukraine and the slow pace of deliveries. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against sending weapons to Kiev, saying it only prolongs the conflict and increases the number of casualties.",0.0,0.0,0.0,7
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/news/560720-czech-russian-visa-ban/,EU presidency advocates ‘straightforward signal’ to Russians,"The Czech government will push for an EU-wide ban on Russian travelers during a ministerial summit in late August, the country’s foreign minister, Jan Lipavsky, has said. The proposal is aimed at adding to the list of sanctions imposed on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine. Prague currently holds the bloc's rotating presidency. “We are convinced as a government that halting visas for ordinary Russian citizens gives a very clear and straightforward signal to Russian society,” Lipavsky told Politico magazine on Thursday. He said Russians “should realize that such a militant policy has consequences.” The politician said he would propose the measure at a meeting of EU foreign ministers on August 31 in Prague. “We are trying to explain to our partners that the approach is justified and effective,” Lipavsky said. He also argued that a visa ban could help “decrease the influence of the Russian secret service in the EU.” The European bloc has been imposing sanctions and cutting ties with Moscow since Russia launched its military operation in Ukraine in late February. Prague stopped accepting visa applications from Russian citizens shortly after the hostilities began. Latvia stopped issuing visas to nearly all Russians earlier this month, citing security concerns. Estonia said on Thursday it would do the same, as well as banning Russian citizens who hold Estonian visas from entering the country from August 18. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas urged EU member states last week to stop issuing tourist visas to Russians. “Visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right,” she stated. Berlin, however, opposes a full ban on issuing visas to Russians. “Contacts with civil society, especially its part that it is open to the EU and critical of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, remains important,” the German Foreign Ministry said in a statement to newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Thursday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also voiced skepticism about a blanket ban, citing “very far-reaching sanctions” imposed on Russia and saying that a visa ban would weaken their effectiveness “if it was directed against everyone, including innocent people.” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba, meanwhile, backed the banning of all Russians from entering the EU. “Let Russian tourists enjoy Russia,” he wrote on Twitter. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the calls to ban all Russians from traveling to the EU were signs of “flagrant nationalism” and xenophobia. “I think common sense will take action over time, and those making such statements will come to their senses,” Dmity Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said on the matter this week.",0.0,0.0,0.0,8
2022-08-12,https://www.rt.com/russia/560714-ukraine-mineral-reserves-deindustrialization/,Ukraine may have to close down industries – WaPo,"Ukraine has lost “the building blocks of its economy” and may find it difficult to exist as an industrialized nation in the aftermath of the conflict with Russia, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. The warning came in a feature article based on an analysis of the value of Ukraine’s hydrocarbons and valuable minerals which have come under Russian control amid the protracted conflict. Russia controls over $12 trillion-worth of the resources that used to be under Kiev’s jurisdiction before 2014, according to SecDev, an Ottawa-based analytical firm. WaPo said coal accounts for the lions’ share of the sum. Some 30 billion tons of hard coal deposits with an estimated commercial value of $11.9 trillion were identified by the Canadian researchers, the newspaper reported. “The worst scenario is that Ukraine … becomes more like one of the Baltic states, a nation unable to sustain its industrial economy,” Stanislav Zinchenko, chief executive of the Kiev-based economic think tank GMK, told the newspaper. A senior Ukrainian official with the nation’s Geological Survey told WaPo that the lost reserve may be worth even more than the estimate. SecDev, which counts various Western governments and organizations like US AID among its partners, warned that Russia’s seizure of Ukrainian natural wealth would have a profound impact on the European economic future, too. “Unless they can rapidly diversify oil and gas sources and shift to renewables and nuclear, European countries will remain dangerously dependent on Russian hydrocarbons,” it said. “Similarly, Europe will also remain highly dependent on China for rare earths, a country that already supplies the region with 98% of its current supply,” it added, referring to plans in the EU to have Ukraine develop rare-earth mineral extraction on its soil. Heavy metals like neodymium, crucial for many modern technologies, are relatively abundant in earth crust but their extraction and refining are associated with serious environmental impact. For historic reasons, China became the world-leading producer of rare earths. WaPo journalists toured a mine operated by a Ukrainian company, which, the newspaper said, conditioned the visit on an agreement not to reveal the site’s location or the surnames of workers. Extracting the fuel “has become an act of patriotism” for the workers, the report said, adding that “should the towns between the mine and the front lines fall, there is little to separate the Russian troops from [them].” The story includes multiple photos of people working at the mine, with their faces clearly visible in some. It’s not uncommon for Western officials and media to highlight potential wealth hidden in foreign nations that the US and its allies risk losing access to. During NATO’s withdrawal from Afghanistan a year ago, Pentagon officials and many news outlets cited the estimated $1 trillion to $3 trillion worth of minerals in the possession of the south-central Asian country. Those include copper, lithium, rare-earth elements, gemstones and other valuables.",0.0,0.0,0.0,7
